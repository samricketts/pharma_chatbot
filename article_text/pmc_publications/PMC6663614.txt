Objective

PhytoSERM is a formulation of genistein, daidzein, and S-equol that has an 83-fold selective affinity for estrogen receptor-β (ERβ); and may enhance neuron function and estrogenic mechanisms in the brain without having peripheral estrogenic activity.

Methods

We conducted an overarching, two-stage, dose-ranging, double-blinded,randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 12 weeks duration comparing 50 mg and 100 mg per day of phytoSERM with placebo for non-cognitively impaired, perimenopausal women ages 45 to 60, with intact uteri and ovaries, at least one cognitive complaint, and one vasomotor-related symptom. Primary objectives were to assess safety and tolerability of a 50 mg and 100 mg daily dose; and, secondly, to evaluate potential indicators of efficacy on cognition and vasomotor symptoms over 4 and 12 weeks, and using an imbedded, 4-week, 2-period, placebo-controlled crossover trial for a subset of participants.

Results

Seventy-one women were randomized to treatment; 70 were evaluated at 4 weeks; 12 were entered into the crossover study; 5 did not complete 12 weeks. Reasons for discontinuation were: withdrawal of consent (n=1) and lost to follow-up (n=4). Adverse events occurred in 16.7% (n=4) placebo, 39.1% (n=9) 50 mg per day, and 29.2% (n=7) 100 mg per day treated participants; 85% were mild and none was severe. Vaginal bleeding occurred in 0, placebo, 1, 50 mg, and 3, 100 mg per day participants.

Conclusion

The phytoSERM formulation was well-tolerated at 50 and 100 mg daily doses. Based on safety outcomes, vaginal bleeding at the 100 mg dose, and vasomotor symptoms and cognitive outcomes at 12 weeks a daily dose of 50mg was considered preferable for a phase 2 efficacy trial.

Introduction

The role of estrogen and postmenopausal hormone therapy in cognitive function and Alzheimer disease is of considerable interest but evidence is mixed 1. The use of estrogen-containing hormone therapy, however, has been unsuccessful in Alzheimer disease, mild cognitive impairment, and for preventing cognitive impairment. Rather, estrogens have shown no cognitive difference compared to placebo over four years,2 or has been cognitive impairing in older women 3,4. The most common symptoms during menopause are hot flashes that occur in up to 80 percent of women in some cultures. Women often describe problems with memory and difficulty concentrating during menopausal transition and menopause. Moreover, substantial biologic evidence supports the importance of estrogen for cognitive function 1,5.

Alternative approaches to estrogen might prove to be symptomatically effective and cognitively enhancing. A group of plant-derived structural analogs of mammalian estrogens, known as phytoestrogens can bind, at weak to moderate affinities, to estrogen receptors and exert estrogenic or antiestrogenic activities 6. Selective estrogen receptor-β (ERβ) may be a novel therapeutic target for the development of therapies for a range of conditions including cognitive impairment and age-related ovarian failure (menopause). There are plausible mechanisms by which ERβ receptor stimulation could lead to improved cognition, feelings of wellbeing, reduced risks for cognitive impairment, and improved vasomotor symptoms7–16.

The development of a formulation composed of rationally-selected ERβ-selective phytoestrogens (PhytoSERMs) provides a greater effect on ERβ than plant based formulations that contain weak ERα and ERβ agonists and antagonists 16. The rationally-defined content of this new formulation induces synergistic rather than antagonistic effects on estrogen receptors and could potentially generate salutary therapeutic effects 7,8,15,16. The PhytoSERMs formulation promotes ERβ responses by combining equol, genistein and daidzein in equal parts.

Three potential advantages of the phytoSERM formulation are: (1) reduction of antagonistic interactions that occur in complex soy-derived isoflavone preparations; (2) minimization of adverse events associated with ERα activation in reproductive tissues; (3) potential benefits in conditions mediated by ERβ. Based on translational analyses, the formulation of ERβ-selective phytoSERMs may provide greater safety than soy isoflavones that contain both ERα and ERβ 12. Further, the formulation may moderate the potential influences of inter-individual differences in the production of equol by gut bacteria.12

A single-dose pharmacokinetics study indicated that plasma concentrations of genistein, daidzein, and S-equol peaked at 9, 6, and 4 hours, respectively, for the 50 mg phytoSERM dose, and at 6, 6, and 5 hours, respectively, for the 100 mg dose 17. The maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) for the three parent compounds were greater in the 100 mg dose group, indicating a dose-dependent change in concentration following phytoSERM treatment. A single-dose oral administration of the phytoSERM was rapidly absorbed, reached high plasma concentrations, showed a linear dose-concentration response in its pharmacokinetics, 16 and was well-tolerated with no adverse events. These findings were consistent with previously reported parameters for each parent compound.

We report here outcomes of a randomized, nested, placebo-controlled clinical trial of this ERβ-specific phytoSERM combination for peri- and post-menopausal women. The trial served several purposes in the development of the phytoSERM formulation, including a dose-ranging, placebo-controlled trial to assess tolerability and safety, the potential for efficacy over 4 weeks, and over 12 weeks; and also used an embedded 4-week period, 2 period crossover study to assess efficacy in a within-subject comparative design.

Methods

Design

This phase 1b/2a study was designed as an overarching two stage, dose-range, double-blinded, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 12-week duration trial. The intent was to demonstrate sufficient safety, tolerability, and the potential for efficacy to enable the further development of the phytoSERM combination. In order to maximize the gain in information and to be economical with time, and study participants’ effort, we embedded three studies within the basic parallel group trial. First, 18 participants among the first 36 contributed to a single-dose, 24-hour pharmacokinetic study to begin with the first dose of study medication. Second, we did a parallel group analysis at 4 weeks comparing two doses and placebo, focusing on safety. Third, we conducted a crossover study with a subset of the participants wherein after 4 weeks individuals had their medications randomly switched from placebo to active therapy, or vice versa, for the remaining 8 weeks of the trial. In this way, we created a 2-period, 4-week treatment crossover trial where each participant served as her own control (Supplemental Digital Content 1 for trial outline).

The treatment allocation was 1:1:1, randomly assigned 100 mg, 50 mg, and placebo daily doses. Cognitive performance and clinical ratings were assessed every 4 weeks with a 6-test neuropsychological battery assessing functions shown to have improved measurably in previous isoflavone and estrogen trials 18–25. An interim analysis was planned after 36 participants had completed 12 weeks in order to estimate final sample size and to adjust the allocation ratio but was not carried out due to rapid recruitment.

Inclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria required generally healthy, peri- to postmenopausal women, from ages 45 to 60, with intact uteri and ovaries, whose last natural menstrual cycle completed from ≥ 60 days to less than 4 years prior to screening. Participants must have had at least one cognitive complaint and one vasomotor-related symptom as rated on the Memory Function Questionnaire26 and Greene Climacteric Scale27, respectively, and willingness to delay specific treatment for menopause symptoms for the duration of the study. Symptoms must not have been so severe that treatment would be indicated immediately. Participants must have been fluent in English or Spanish, have had at least a high school education, capacity to understand risks and benefits from participating, and provided informed consent.

PhytoSERM combination

Study products were oval film-coated tablets (8.5 × 15.5mm) of the phytoSERM combination in doses of 50 mg and 100 mg, or placebo. The 50 mg tablet contained 16.7 mg of each of genistein, daidzein, and S-equol; and the 100mg tablet contained 33.3 mg of each isoflavone. Ingredients were weighed and blended according to a detailed formulation sheet. The placebo tablets were identical in appearance and taste to the phytoSERM combination tablets. Study products were manufactured to cGMP standards and supplied by MeriCal, Inc. (Vista, California) and packaged in blister packs of 14 tablets to facilitate double-blinded treatment, dispensing, and tablet counts. Dosage selection was based on preclinical experiments,8,16 past studies of isoflavones, and dosages used in various soy extract products that are marketed as food supplements.12,28,29

Randomization

Eligible participants were randomly assigned to drug or placebo by treatment assignment in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio to 100 mg per day, 50 mg per day, or placebo (block size, 3). Blinded product packets were prepared by a staff member not involved in the trial according to the randomization sequence. Participants were given the next blinded study product packet in the randomization sequence; and the participant’s ID number and packet ID were recorded in the randomization log. Participants were instructed to take 1 tablet each morning.

Outcomes

Safety and tolerability assessments, neuropsychological assessments, assessment of vasomotor symptoms, and self-assessments of memory and affective symptoms were the study-specific clinical outcomes; and were administered by raters blind to treatment allocation and compliance.

Six neuropsychological scales were used to assess cognitive change domains, including immediate and delayed memory, verbal fluency, executive function, visuospatial orientation and sustained attention. They were the WMS-R Logical Memory I and II30, Verbal Fluency (FAS)31, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)32, Trail Making Test Parts A and B33,34, Card Rotation test35,36, and the Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT)37. The card rotation test requires participants to view a random polygram and judge which of eight alternative test figures are planar rotations of the target figure, and to do this as quickly and as accurately as possible. The CPT assesses sustained and selective attention. Participants are asked to click a space bar when they are presented with any letter except the letter “X.” (The same story and word lists were used throughout).

A neuropsychological composite score was created by summing the standardized scores for: verbal fluency (total correct), RAVLT total words from 5 trials; RAVLT total words after delay; Continuous Performance Test: number of omission errors + number of commission errors; CPT: Hit Reaction time; Trail Making Test Part A; Trail Making Test Part B; LM-I immediate recall; and LM-II delayed recall. Trails A and B times were reverse scored (maximum time allowed minus recorded time) prior to standardization so that higher scores represented better performance on all tests. Similarly, standardized scores for CPT error and reaction times were first computed, then negated so that higher scores represented fewer errors and lower reaction times.

The 21-item Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS)27 provides a measure of menopausal symptoms. Participants also completed a daily diary, separately recording the number of mild, moderate and severe vasomotor flushes. A vasomotor composite score was created that summed the number of weekly hot flushes and items 19 and 20 on the GCS. Higher scores represent greater vasomotor symptoms.

Four questionnaires for self-assessment of memory and affective symptoms were utilized (Table 1). The Memory Function Questionnaire (MFQ),26 consists of 64 items that reflect the individual’s perception of memory function. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)38 has been used previously in soy-extract isoflavones and estrogen trials, and measures positive and negative affect. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)39 is a self-administered screening and diagnostic tool for depression. Blood was taken for phytoSERMs levels at baseline and every 4 weeks, and for the development of biomarkers.

Statistical Analysis

General plan

Analyses used general or mixed effects linear modeling to assess between-group differences in the treatments on change of the z-transformed composite neuropsychological and vasomotor composite scores, MFQ, GCS, PANAS, and PHQ-9. A modified intent-to-treat (mITT) sample was defined as all participants who were randomized, dispensed study treatment, and had baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. Individual participants were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized. An exception is that, for the overall 12-week analysis, the 6 participants who were randomized to placebo for the first 4-week period of the nested crossover study (and then received 100mg per day) were assigned to the 100 mg treatment group as they would have been treated from week 4 to 12 with 100 mg; and similarly, the 6 participants who were randomized to 100 mg treatment group for the first 4 weeks (and then to placebo for the remaining 8 weeks) were assigned to the placebo group.

Repeated dependent measures were the change from baseline in the specified trial outcomes obtained at trial weeks 4, 8, and 12. The primary independent variable was randomized treatment; additional covariates were indicator variables for trial week, whether the participant was randomized in the crossover condition, and a covariate for the baseline level of the outcome measure. In addition, we analyzed a completers/compliers sample, defined as participants who were greater than 80% compliant by tablet count. The order of the outcomes analyses was as follows.

Safety outcomes

A primary objective was to assess the tolerability and safety of the phytoSERM compared to placebo by the assessment of treatment emergent adverse events, clinical symptoms, and neuropsychological performance. Adverse events as well as any adverse cognitive or behavioral changes were collected, rated in terms of severity, tabled and analyzed descriptively. Safety outcomes are primary considerations for the future development of the phytoSERM combination.

4-week outcomes

Using a general linear model for the 4-week change in outcome, including the baseline outcome level as a covariate, two comparisons were assessed: 100 mg per day vs. placebo or 50 mg per day versus placebo. Tolerability and adverse events were assessed by enumerating and comparing numbers and severity of adverse events and adverse events by category (organ system) between the groups. The outcomes tested were the z-transformed composite neuropsychological and vasomotor scores, the MFQ, GCS, and PANAS.

This 4-week analysis was mainly intended to inform on adverse events and the potential for a dose effect. If either contrast was significant at the P &lt;0.05 level, two-tailed, then phytoSERM combination was to be provisionally considered superior to placebo. No adjustment to the alpha error was made for the multiple comparisons, as any significant outcomes would have been considered as requiring confirmation.

12-week parallel group outcomes

Tolerability and adverse events were assessed by enumerating and comparing numbers and severity of AEs between the groups. Using the mixed effect linear models, comparisons between 100 mg per day vs. placebo and 50 mg per day vs placebo on the clinical measures was assessed. The outcomes tested were the repeatedly measured (4, 8, and 12-week) changes from baseline in the z-transformed composite neuropsychological and vasomotor scores, MFQ, GCS, and affect scale. In addition to randomized treatment group, independent variables included indicator variables for study week, randomization to the crossover condition, and the baseline value of the outcome measure. A random-subject intercept was specified. An additional treatment-by-week interaction term tested if any treatment effect differed by trial week.

If any comparison was significant at P &lt;0.05, two-tailed, then phytoSERM combination would be considered superior to placebo, potentially supporting proof of concept. No adjustment to the alpha error was made for the multiple comparisons.

4-week, 2-period crossover

The sample consisted of 12 participants from the first 36 randomized who were randomly assigned to either the 100 mg phytoSERM combination or placebo for the first four weeks followed by the reciprocal treatment condition for the next 8 weeks. Participants served as their own controls. We used repeated measures (each of two, 4-week periods from their respective baselines) mixed effects models that included a random intercept effect for participants with baseline as a covariate that took into account order effects. Outcomes included the composite neuropsychological and vasomotor scores, MFQ, GCS, and affect scales.

Sample size

This phase 1b/2a trial was designed as a safety and feasibility study and there was no prior efficacy data. Therefore, we considered trials of various soy isoflavones that showed efficacy on neuropsychological and clinical ratings and with sample sizes ranging from 34 to 389 participants over 6 weeks to 12 months treatment 18–25,40–44. We planned an interim analysis after 36 participants completed 12 weeks of randomized, blinded, parallel-group treatment. The upper 95% confidence limits of the 8- and 12-week outcomes was to be used to re-estimate the remaining sample sizes. The total number of participants was planned from 60 to 72.

Institutional Review Board statement, informed consent

The study was conducted at the USC Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the Keck School of Medicine, approved by the USC institutional review board and registered at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01723917. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Results

Between July 2012 and February 2015, 319 volunteers were assessed for eligibility; 81 were screened; and 71 were randomly allocated to one of three treatments and received at least one dose of their allocated treatment (Figure 1). One participant in the (50 mg per day group) discontinued within the first 4 weeks; 3 discontinued during weeks 5 to 8 (1 in 50mg, 2 in 100mg groups), and 1 discontinued during weeks 9 to 12 (50 mg group). Overall, 93% of participants who were randomized completed the 12-week trial.

Overall, 87% of participants were greater than 90% compliant with their medication. There were no differences between groups: two, placebo-treated, three, 100 mg treated participants took less than 80% of their expected dosage; four, 50 mg treated participants took 80 to 90% of their prescribed doses. Compliance was calculated for each participant as the percentage of capsules that should have been taken over the 12-week treatment period.

Mean age was 54 years, 77% were white and 25% Latino. Participants were not cognitively impaired and all had mild memory complaints. There was little depressive symptomatology with participants scoring about 5 on the PHQ9. Overall vasomotor and climacteric symptoms were low. Demographics and baseline clinical ratings are in Tables 1 and 2.

Safety

The phytoSERM preparation was overall well-tolerated, and all but 5 participants completed the 12 weeks of the study. Reasons for dropout were lost to follow-up (n=4) and withdrawal of consent out of concern about becoming dependent on the treatment and not being able to obtain it after the trial (n=1). No participant withdrew because of an adverse event. Nine, 50 mg treated, 7, 100 mg treated, and 4 placebo-treated participants reported at least one adverse event (Table 3). There was a total of 12 adverse events in each phytoSERM group, and 9 in the placebo group. Adverse events were broadly distributed, did not appear related to dose, and all but 5 were mild in severity (Table 3). Vaginal bleeding, however, was reported in 3 (12.5%) participants on 100 mg, 1 (4.3%) on 50 mg, and none on placebo. One participant on 50 mg and one on 100 mg reported menstrual bleeding; two participants on 100 mg reported spotting.

4-week outcomes

Treatment with the phytoSERM combination up to maximum doses was as well-tolerated as placebo over 4 weeks. There were no statistically significant differences between either dose of the phytoSERM preparation and placebo on either vasomotor composite score or the neuropsychological composite at four weeks (Table 4, Figure 2A).

12-week parallel group outcomes

Treatment with the phytoSERM combination was as well tolerated as with placebo (Table 3). There were no statistically significant effects on either vasomotor composite or the neuropsychological composite over 12 weeks (Table 4, Figure 2B). The numerical increase in the vasomotor composite in the 100 mg group compared to placebo and 50 mg phytoSERMs was not statistically significant.

As a post hoc sensitivity analysis, we analyzed the 12-week parallel group vasomotor and neuropsychological composite outcomes after removing the participants who were crossed over from placebo to 100 mg, and from 100 mg to placebo after the first 4 weeks (see Supplemental Digital Content 3). Between-group effects and P values for change over 12 weeks were very similar to the specified analyses (Table 4).

4-week, 2-period crossover

In the four-week crossover study there was also no statistically significant effect on outcomes. The 12 participants showed a nonsignificantly higher vasomotor composite score with 4 weeks placebo treatment period compared to 4 weeks 100 mg per day phytoSERM treatment, 2.31 (1.06 SE) vs 0.33 (1.01 SE), P=0.20 (for linear mixed model week*treatment P=0.50); and on the neuropsychological composite, placebo vs. 100 mg per day, 1.17 (0.93) vs. 0.29 (0.93), P=0.52 (linear mixed model week*treatment, P=0.31).

Discussion

Soy extract products have proliferated with most of the products advertised as dietary supplements targeting menopausal symptoms. Supplements are not as strictly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration as drugs are, and their compositions and efficacies greatly vary. An area of particular concern is the lack of standardization regarding the preparation and processing of soy extracts. An analysis of multiple commercial soy extract supplements revealed abundant impurities of unknown origins at uncertain concentrations, which may antagonize the effect of active ingredients and induce unexpected side effects 45. For this reason, we developed phytoSERM, a combination of three phytoestrogenic ERβ specific modulators S-equol, genistein, and daidzein in equal parts. By specifically enhancing estrogen receptor beta mediated neuronal responses, this formulation induces a synergistic, rather than antagonistic effect, and can serve as an effective and safe alternative to estrogen therapy 16.

This study was designed as a two-stage, dose-range, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled adaptive design trial of 12-week duration. Because this trial was designed for safety and tolerability, tests of clinical outcomes were not the primary focus. Moreover, there were no prior data in humans on the PhytoSERM combination with which to estimate potential effects. In this phase 1b/2a trial we successfully completed the first to human study of the phytoSERM preparation that allowed us to determine a clinically relevant dose range, evaluate early evidence of adversity, pharmacokinetics, and the feasibility of clinical outcomes and potential biomarkers in women with memory complaints and menopausal symptoms. The phase 2a portion of the trial was planned as a proof of concept, feasibility study employing both doses of the phytoSERM combination (Supplemental Digital Content 2, CONSORT diagram).

The single dose pharmacokinetic analysis based on a subset of 18 participants from this study indicated that phytoSERM exhibited a rapid absorption rate, high bioavailability, and a linear dose-concentration response17. These results were consistent with previously reported parameters for each parent compound 17,28,46–48. The inclusion of S-equol confers a particular advantage to this formulation. While genistein and daidzein naturally occur in soy products, S-equol is an active metabolite of daidzein, and exclusively produced by the gut microbiome 28. Because the ability to produce equol varies across different populations, addition of S-equol to the formulation minimizes individual variations and ensures effect in both equol producers and non-producers 49,50.

The full extent of risk for soy isoflavones and metabolites administered individually or in combination is not well known and is particularily the case for the phytoSERM combination. However, isoflavones have been considered “generally recognized as safe” under Federal regulations (GRAS, 21 CFR 170.3 and 21 CFR 170.30 ) and have been extensively marketed.

Overall, we found the phytoSERM combination to be relatively safe and well-tolerated over 4 and 12 weeks, with no serious adverse events and good participant compliance. Most adverse events were mild in severity, and only 5 were moderate. Vaginal bleeding occurred more often in the 100 mg per day treatment group (n=3) compared to the 50 mg group (n=1), and the placebo group (n=0) and was considered possibly related to treatment (Table 3). Two participants reported menstrual bleeding (one each in the 100 mg and 50 mg groups), and two spotting (both in the 100 mg dose group) and possibly cycling irregularly in perimenopause transition. Our preclinical studies using a rodent model of human menopause found no physiological alternation of uterus in phytoSERM treated animals6. However, vaginal bleeding occurs with isoflavones; and in this trial could suggest the possibility of ERα activation. Future studies will need to assess the potential for vaginal bleeding as an adverse event of concern. Nausea and headaches occurred more frequently with the phytoSERM combination than with placebo, respectively; Table 3), and have been reported as occurring more frequently with genistein23,24,51.

Participants treated with the phytoSERM combination did not show statistically significant improvement on vasomotor symptoms and cognitive function compared to placebo group overall. The latter findings were expected considering that this was a safety and feasibility study, and that the sample size did not allow for the detection of expected moderately small cognitive effects.

Although the vasomotor symptom scales and the neuropsychological tests employed in this study were appropriate and reflected changes in similar populations18–20,22–25,42,52–57 the mild clinical symptoms coupled with the short duration of treatment may have limited our ability to detect the effects of phytoSERM. Going forward, stricter hot flash entry criteria for recruitment will require moderate to severe symptomatic women. In addition, assessment of vasomotor symptoms by physiological monitoring compared to subjective reporting is warranted 58.

Further, most studies that observed favorable effects of soy extract products on vasomotor symptoms and cognitive function enrolled more participants per treatment group, and those with fewer participants had longer treatment periods 18–25,40–44. Moreover, in a level 1 clinical trial of 350 healthy, postmenopausal women, long-term dietary soy isoflavones in a dose comparable to that of traditional Asian diets had no effect on global cognition but may have improved visual memory.59 Thus, while our trial was planned to determine the initial tolerability and safety of phytoSERM exposure at 2 doses, it was underpowered to determine efficacy on vasomotor and cognition at either doses.

However, it is worth noting that this clinical trial included a novel, embedded crossover design, where each participant became her own control. While this design has limitations including the possibility of learning/practice effects, order effects and carry-over between treatments, it could also reduce the influence of confounding covariates, and yield important information that might not be elicited in the larger parallel group comparisons.

Conclusion

This first, human study of the phytoSERM formulation for management of menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms and cognitive decline demonstrated safety, tolerability and a good pharmacokinetic profile, although peripheral ERα activation will require further surveillance. Further, an optimal dose of 50 mg of phytoSERMs was established which is consistent with preclinical analyses5,7. Based on previous efficacious preclinical studies and the outcomes from this study in humans, a rationally designed phase 2b efficacy trial to further assess phytoSERMs for menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms and cognitive decline can be pursued.
