The Gs-coupled A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) has been explored extensively as a pharmaceutical target, which has led to numerous clinical trials. However, only one selective A2AAR agonist (regadenoson, Lexiscan) and one selective A2AAR antagonist (istradefylline, Nouriast) have been approved by the FDA, as a pharmacological agent for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and as a cotherapy for Parkinson’s disease (PD), respectively. Adenosine is widely used in MPI, as Adenoscan. Despite numerous unsuccessful clinical trials, medicinal chemical activity around A2AAR ligands has accelerated recently, particularly through structure-based drug design. New drug-like A2AAR antagonists for PD and cancer immunotherapy have been identified, and many clinical trials have ensued. For example, imaradenant (AZD4635), a compound that was designed computationally, based on A2AAR X-ray structures and biophysical mapping. Mixed A2AAR/A2BAR antagonists are also hopeful for cancer treatment. A2AAR antagonists may also have potential as neuroprotective agents for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.


pmc1. Introduction

Adenosine receptors (ARs) have been explored extensively as pharmaceutical targets since the late 1960s (IJzerman, Jacobson, Müller, Cronstein, &amp; Cunha, 2022; Jacobson &amp; Gao, 2006). Endogenous extracellular adenosine, the native agonist, is produced as a hydrolysis product of ATP by cells, tissues or organs under stress (Borea, Gessi, Merighi, Vincenzi, &amp; Varani, 2018; Cekic &amp; Linden, 2016; Haskó, Antonioli, &amp; Cronstein, 2018; Linden, 2005). ARs have a role in allostasis, the body’s stress response to correct imbalances, rather than in homeostasis. Their biological roles have been explored extensively using genetic receptor knockout mouse lines (Lopes, Lourenço, Tomé, Cunha, &amp; Canas, 2021), including one line in which all four of the ARs were deleted, which does not display a strong phenotype compared to WT mice (Xiao, Liu, Jacobson, Gavrilova, &amp; Reitman, 2019). The A2AAR subtype is coupled to Gs guanine nucleotide-regulatory proteins to stimulate intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) production. The A2AAR is found, among other locations, in immune cells and platelets, where adenosine suppresses their activation, in vascular smooth muscle, where adenosine induces relaxation and vasodilation to increase circulation and oxygen supply, and in the brain. The combination of A2AAR agonists and other antithrombotic agents, such as P2Y12R antagonists, might be useful clinically (Wolska et al., 2020). In the basal ganglia, adenosine has a role opposite that of dopamine in movement control. Specifically, the A2AAR suppresses postsynaptic dopamine D2R effects (Ferré, Díaz-Ríos, Salamone, &amp; Prediger, 2018). Locations of high A2AAR gene expression in the human analyzed by RNA-seq are available in online databases. For example, high expression (&gt;0.8 transcript per million, TPM, GeneID: ENSG00000128271) was determined in: EBV-transformed lymphocyte, blood, caudate nucleus, cerebellar hemisphere, cerebellum, liver, nucleus accumbens and testis (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home, accessed Dec. 26, 2022). Medium expression (0.5–0.7 TMP) was noted in: lung, ovary, putamen and spleen.

The alkylxanthines caffeine and theophylline are the prototypical antagonists of action of endogenous adenosine through these receptors (Fredholm, 1985; Huang &amp; Daly, 1974; Sattin &amp; Rall, 1970). One of the first medical applications of an adenosine antagonist was the use of the non-subtype-selective theophylline (now as aminophylline, i.e. the salt with ethylenediamine) for treating asthma (Schultze-Werninghaus &amp; Meier-Sydow, 1982), but its AR-subtype related mechanism is still under discussion (Fozard, 2003). Both synthetic, selective agonists (Fig. 1) and antagonists (Fig. 2) of the A2AAR subtype have been sought for over three decades (Baraldi et al., 2018). However, until the mid-1990s, even after the cloning of the canine and human A2AARs (Le, Townsend-Nicholson, Baker, Sutherland, &amp; Schofield, 1996; Maenhaut et al., 1990), little attention was given to the distinction between A2A and A2BARs in the medicinal chemistry literature. The earliest pharmaceutical focus on this subtype led to the discovery of A2AAR-selective agonists for hypertension control, cardiac stress testing, anti-inflammatory effects and the potential use in treating schizophrenia (Jacobson, Tosh, Jain, &amp; Gao, 2019; Singer and Yee, 2023). Adenosine itself, when infused in the coronary artery causes A2AAR-mediated dilatation (Belardinelli, Linden, &amp; Berne, 1989), and adenosine was eventually approved as a pharmacological agent for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) as the widely used Adenoscan. Later, a synthetic and moderately A2AAR-selective agonist, also an adenine nucleoside derivative, regadenoson, known as Lexiscan, was introduced for the same diagnostic application (Gao et al., 2001; Iskandrian et al., 2007).

Potent and selective A2AAR-selective antagonists were initially developed for CNS applications, particularly in aging and neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), and later for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Jazayeri, Andrews, &amp; Marshall, 2017; Kanda, Shiozaki, Shimada, Suzuki, &amp; Nakamura, 1994; Merighi et al., 2021; Pinna, 2009; Preti et al., 2015; Schiffmann, Fisone, Moresco, Cunha, &amp; Ferré, 2007). The first synthetic selective A2AAR antagonist was istradefylline, an alkylxanthine, like caffeine, and which was earlier approved in Japan and Korea and since 2019 is now FDA-approved (as Nouriast) as a cotherapy for PD together with dopaminergic therapy (Chen &amp; Cunha, 2020; Ferré et al., 2018). Within recent years, the A2AAR appeared as a drug target for use in cancer immunotherapy (Ohta &amp; Sitkovsky, 2001). There is a pathologically elevated level of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment, and thus blocking A2AAR activation with a selective antagonist, or inhibiting adenosine production locally, removes the adenosine-induced suppression of the immune response in a variety of cell types (Vigano, Alatzoglou, &amp; Irving, 2019). This has led to both the discovery of novel A2AAR antagonists not of the same class (de Lera Ruiz, Lim, &amp; Zheng, 2014; Müller &amp; Jacobson, 2011), as well as repurposing toward cancer of some antagonists that were initially introduced for CNS indications.

Although the earliest medicinal chemistry studies of A2AAR agonists and antagonists were purely based on empirical probing of the structure–activity relationships (SAR), for roughly two decades their discovery has taken into account, been guided by, or even was purely based on structural information about the receptor (Gutiérrez-de-Terán, Sallander, &amp; Sotelo, 2017; Jazayeri et al., 2017). Early A2AAR site-directed mutagenesis identified amino acid residues important for agonist recognition, including those conserved within the AR family, both in the transmembrane region and on the extracellular loops (Jiang et al., 1996; Kim et al., 1996; Kim, Wess, van Rhee, Shöneberg, &amp; Jacobson, 1995). The first antagonist bound A2AAR receptor structure, with ZM241,385, was reported in 2008 by Stevens and colleagues (Jaakola et al., 2008), and the first agonist-bound A2AAR receptor structures in 2011 (Lebon et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011). A very high-resolution antagonist (ZM241,385)-bound A2AAR structure (1.7 Å) was reported that defines specific water molecules and negative allosteric sodium ion surrounding the binding site (Liu et al., 2012). Notable in this structure-based design of A2AAR antagonists is the work of Heptares (now Sosei-Heptares) that was able to obtain X-ray structures of the receptor in complex with a wide range of antagonists, with affinities ranging from nM to μM (Doré et al., 2011). The key to this ability was the introduction of strategic single amino acid replacements within the transmembrane helical domains of the receptor (TMs) that stabilized either an inactive or active state of the receptor, while maintaining the essential small molecular ligand interactions (Jazayeri et al., 2017). This proprietary approach, termed StaRs (stabilized receptors), was first applied to the A2AAR receptor, and its success was soon extended to many other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The StaRs approach led to biophysical mapping of the drug binding site, which calculated the energetic contribution of specific molecular interactions and led to a new class of A2AAR antagonists suitable for translation to the clinic. Numerous structures of the A2AAR in complex with antagonists that are in clinical trials are now available (Salmaso, Jain, &amp; Jacobson, 2021). Recently, the electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the A2AAR in complex with an engineered G protein was solved (García-Nafría, Lee, Bai, Carpenter, &amp; Tate, 2018), and this technique continues to be increasingly popular for AR structures. The A2AAR cryo-EM structures in complex with two agonists are now available (Chen, Zhang, &amp; Weng, 2022). NMR has also been utilized effectively to study the conformational changes associated with A2AAR activation (Eddy et al., 2018). The family of membrane-bound proteins having seven TM helices (7TM receptors), mainly GPCRs, is the largest single class of gene products in the human genome, representing ~4% of the proteins coded. Even before structural approaches to GPCR ligand design were feasible, GPCR modulators were among the most important drug categories introduced, and therefore the feasibility of using a structure-based design approach greatly facilitated the identification of novel drug lead molecules.

2. A2AAR agonists

Most known AR agonists are nucleoside derivatives, particularly derivatives of adenosine. When radioligand binding assays for the A1AR and A2AAR became available (Bruns, Daly, &amp; Snyder, 1980; Jarvis et al., 1989), the pace of medicinal chemical studies of AR agonists accelerated, although most binding was performed at the rat receptors until the mid-1990s. However, there have been several classes of non-nucleosides reported, including 2-thio-3,5-dicyanopyridines and 3-cyano-pyrimidines (Beukers et al., 2004; Catarzi, Varano, &amp; Vigiani, 2022; Rosentreter et, al). Also, a non-nucleoside heterocyclic derivative was reported to activate the A2AAR (Bharate et al., 2016). Some of the major A2AAR agonists, introduced either as receptor probes for pharmacological studies or for translational development are described below.

Table 1 contains affinity determined for A2AAR agonists and antagonists at four AR subtypes. The clinical trial information for agonists that have been tested in humans is referenced in (Jacobson et al., 2019). The agonist CGS21680 was reported as the first highly selective agonist for the A2AAR, due to combining substitutions of adenosine at the C2 (aminoalkyl/aryl) and 5′ (uronamide) positions (Hutchison et al., 1989). The terminal carboxylate of CGS21680 served as the basis for functionalized congeners that could be radiolabeled or derivatized for irreversible receptor labeling of fluorescent detection (Jacobson, 2009). Also of note, an early monosubstituted adenosine derivative CV1808 (2-phenylamino-adenosine, structure not shown) had a small degree of A2A selectivity compared to A1AR (A3AR had not yet been discovered). SAR studies by Olsson and coworkers identified other (oxy-alkyl/aryl) A2AAR-affinity enhancing modifications the C2 positions (Ueeda, Thompson, Arroyo, &amp; Olsson, 1991). CGS21680 was demonstrated to be selective for the A2AAR and totally inactive at the A2BAR (Hide, Padgett, Jacobson, &amp; Daly, 1992), although its rat A3AR affinity (Ki) was 144 nM (Zhou et al., 1992). Later, CGS21680 was found to be relatively potent at the human A3AR (only 2.7-fold lower affinity than at the human A2AAR, Gao, Blaustein, Gross, Melman, &amp; Jacobson, 2003), but it retained its rat A2AAR selectivity. The compound was being evaluated preclinically as an antihypertensive agent, but never progressed to clinical trials. Its binding site in the receptor was later elucidated by Lebon, Edwards, Leslie &amp; Tate (2015). Its use as a chemical precursor functionalized congener for fluorescent probes, radioiodinated probes, irreversibly binding agonists, nanoparticle conjugates, bivalent drugs, and peptide conjugates was explored by Jacobson and coworkers (Jacobson, 2009). The carboxylate group was found empirically to be in a region of the binding site that was exposed to the extracellular medium and therefore could be coupled to large chemical moieties in these receptor probes without losing A2AAR affinity.

Various mono-substituted adenosine derivatives have been studied as A2AAR agonists, although many are not selective. NECA (5′-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine) was the first highly potent A2AAR agonist reported in the 1970s (Prasad, Bariana, Fung, Savic, &amp; Tietje, 1980). Its original patent claimed it as a rodent poison (Stein, Prasad, &amp; Tietje, 1980). Metrifudil (N6-(2-methylbenzyl)-adenosine), a pan-AR full agonist (Ki 24–60 nM at four AR subtypes, Gao et al., 2003), was in early human trials for glomerulonephritis, but failed to progress (Jacobson et al., 2019).

Sonedenoson ((2R,3R,4S,5R)-2-(6-amino-2-(4-chlorophenethoxy)-9H-purin-9-yl)-5-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran-3,4-diol) is an A2AAR agonist that was tested in MPI (Jacobson et al., 2019). YT-146 (2-(oct-1-yn-1-yl)-adenosine). Following the early A2AAR agonist SAR studies of Olsson and colleagues and the introduction of CGS21680 having an extended 2-aminoalkyl/aryl group at the C2 position, several other groups reported 2-alkynyl-adenosine derivatives as A2AAR-selective agonists, including YT-146, as potent A2AAR agonists (Ono, Matsuoka, Ohkubo, Kimura, &amp; Nakanishi, 1998).

Binodenoson ((2R,3R,4S,5R)-2-[6-amino-2-[(2E)-2-(cyclohexylme thylidene)hydrazinyl]purin-9-yl]-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolane-3,4-diol). Other 2-substituted adenosine derivatives were introduced in the early 1990s for A2AAR activation, among them binodenoson. This A2AAR agonist was administered in patients for MPI, and it did not induce bronchoconstriction (Murray et al., 2009). However, its development was discontinued (Jacobson et al., 2019).

DPMA (N6-(2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(2-methylphenyl)ethyl)adenosine). One adenosine derivative of adenosine modified only at the N6 position was found to be a moderately rat (but not human) A2AAR-selective agonist (Bridges et al., 1988; Gao et al., 2003), i.e. the first reported such compound. At the time, one of the envisioned applications of A2AAR agonists was in the treatment of schizophrenia, based on the inverse relationship of CNS dopaminergic and adenosinergic signaling (Boison, Singer, Shen, Feldon, &amp; Yee, 2012). However, this concept was not tested clinically.

Regadenoson (1-[6-amino-9-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydro xymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]purin-2-yl]-N-methylpyrazole-4-carboxamide), an adenosine derivative substituted at the C2 and 5′ positions became a translational success story, with its FDA approval for MPI in 2008. It is short acting, and as such does not display long lasting cardiovascular side effects, and its effectiveness as a diagnostic agent was comparable to adenosine itself (Iskandrian et al., 2007). No other synthetic A2AAR agonists have been approved for this indication.

ATL-146e (apadenoson, 4-{3-[6-amino-9-(5-ethylcarbamoyl-3, 4-dihydroxy-tetrahydro-furan-2-yl)-9H-purin-2-yl]-prop-2-ynyl}-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid methyl ester) and ATL-313 (evodenoson, methyl 4-[3-[6-amino-9-[(2R,3R,4S,5S)-5-(cyclopropylcarbamoyl)-3,4-dihydroxyoxolan-2-yl]purin-2-yl]prop-2-ynyl]piperidine-1-carboxylate) from the Linden lab (Lappas, Sullivan, &amp; Joel Linden, 2005) are both adenosine derivatives substituted at the C2 and 5′ positions that have considerable A2AAR agonist selectivity (Jacobson et al., 2019). However, a Phase 2 clinical trial associated with ATL-146e for treatment of sickle cell disease, an ischemic condition, failed to show statistical efficacy (Field et al., 2017). Both ATL146e and ATL313 were shown to inhibit inflammatory damage in transplanted islets, and therefore enhancing islet survival and functional engraftment (Chhabra, Wang, &amp; Zeng, 2010). These results were suggestive of coadministered A2AAR agonists as a novel anti-inflammatory treatment during pancreatic islet transplantation.

UK-432,097 (6-(2,2-diphenylethylamino)-9-((2R,3R,4S,5S)-5-(ethylcarbamoyl)-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl)-N-(2-(3-(1-(pyridin-2-yl) piperidin-4-yl)ureido)ethyl)-9H-purine-2-carboxamide). This adenosine analog substituted at the N6, C2 and 5′ positions was tested clinically for the indication of COPD, but was found to be non-effective, mainly due to limited bioavailability when administered by inhalation as a dry powder (Jacobson et al., 2019; Mantell, Jones, &amp; Trevethick, 2010).

LUF5834 (2-amino-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-6-[(1H-imidazol-2-ylmethyl)thio]-3,5-pyridinecarbonitrile) is a non-nucleoside mixed A1AR and A2AAR agonist (Beukers et al., 2004; Lane et al., 2012). In tritiated form, it was a suitable radioligand for the A1AR, but not the A2AAR or A3AR (Lane et al., 2010). The X-ray structure of a close analog (LUF5833) in complex with the A2AAR was recently reported (Amelia et al., 2021). The possible trajectory of the ligand approach and mechanism of receptor activation were compared for non-nucleoside agonist LUF5833 and two nucleoside agonists by modeling (Bolcato, Pavan, Bassani, Sturlese, &amp; Moro, 2022).

3. Positive allosteric enhancers (PAMs)

The concept of a positive allosteric enhancer (PAM) of the A2AAR is appealing, because it would amplify the effects of endogenous adenosine, in a temporally and spatially selective manner, to avoid the known agonist side effects. There have been several reports of PAMs of the A2AAR (Korkutata, Agrawal, &amp; Lazarus, 2022), including A2AR PAM1 (Fig. 1), but additional pharmacological and structural characterization of their receptor interaction is needed. However, other AR subtypes have more established and chemically explored PAM chemotypes (Vincenzi et al., 2021). Although not acting at the A2AAR, the structure activity relationship of prototypical human A3AR PAM LUF6000 has recently been expanded (Fallot et al., 2022).

4. A2AAR antagonists and inverse agonists

Numerous A2AAR antagonists have been reported (Baraldi et al., 2018). Until recently, adenosine derivatives that bound to the A2AAR acted as agonists. However, Shiriaeva et al. (2022) found a 4′-truncated nucleoside derivative LJ4517 that also contained a heteroaryl group (thien-2-yl) at the 8-position and that acted as an A2AAR antagonist. An X-ray structure accompanied the characterization of this atypical antagonist, showing that the truncated ribose moiety was forced into an alternative position by steric crowding in the receptor binding site, thus precluding its accessing the hydrophilic residues needed for receptor activation.

The difference between antagonists and inverse agonists has been studied for various antagonists, but there are contradictions in the literature. Caffeine was revealed to be an inverse agonist (Fernández-Dueñas et al., 2014). However, Bennett et al. (2013) classified theophylline, caffeine, and istradefylline as neutral antagonists because they bind equipotently at active and inactive states. They reported that xanthine amine congener (structure not shown), ZM241385, SCH58261, and preladenant are inverse agonists and bind preferentially to the inactive state.

Caffeine. Caffeine is a prototypical AR antagonist and the most widely consumed drug (Jacobson, Gao, Matricon, Eddy, &amp; Carlsson, 2020). It has significant activity in vivo to block the A2AAR but not selectively. Nevertheless, its A2AAR antagonist effects are being tested clinically for treatment of AD.

DPMX (3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine). This caffeine derivative from the Daly laboratory at NIH was the first example of a xanthine A2AAR antagonist that showed slight selectivity for that subtype (Daly, 2007). It is predicted to readily enter the CNS and has been used in numerous in vivo studies. However, its only 3-fold A2AAR selectivity has to be emphasized in interpreting experimental results, and its use as a pharmacological tool has been supplanted by more potent and selective antagonists.

CGS15943 (N-9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-amine). This compound was the first example in 1988 of a non-xanthine A2AAR antagonist that showed slight selectivity for that subtype (Francis et al., 1988). The affinity in radioligand binding at the rat A1AR was 6.4-fold weaker than at the rat A2AAR (Ki 3.3 nM), which was ~500-fold more potent that theophylline in blocking adenosine-stimulated cAMP in guinea pig synaptoneurosomes. It was identified in a broad screen of different heterocyclic derivatives for this inhibitory activity and was considered for potential anxiomodulator activity. The heterocyclic scaffold was distantly related to the xanthine series, except that a N atom of the pyrimidine moiety was moved, and the remaining 6-membered ring was fused to a chloro-substituted phenyl ring. It was the first example of substitution of the heterocyclic antagonist with a fur-2-yl group, which was essential for high A2AAR affinity and later appeared in other A2AAR antagonists (e.g. ZM241385, vipadenant, SCH58261, SCH44226, TPP455, preladenant, inupadenant and ciforadenant).

ZM241385 (4-[2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazin- 5-yl-amino]ethyl]phenol) was introduced as a A2AAR antagonist with an alternative heterocyclic core in 1995 (de Lera Ruiz et al., 2014; Poucher et al., 1995). It has become a widely used A2AAR antagonist for both pharmacological and structural studies. However, it should be noted that it has considerable affinity at the A2AAR. When receptor bound (Liu et al., 2012), its furyl group points downward toward the hydrophilic region of the A2AAR that is the binding site of the ribose moiety of A2AAR agonists. Its phenol side chain points toward the extracellular region of the receptor (Salmaso et al., 2021). In fact, in different X-ray structure in complex with A2AAR, this phenolic chain attains different conformations. The phenolic side chain can be radioiodinated to generate a high-affinity A2AAR radioligand (Palmer, Poucher, Jacobson, &amp; Stiles, 1996).

Istradefylline (8-[(E)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethenyl]-1,3-diethyl-7-methylpurine-2,6-dione, KW-6002). The class of 8-styrylxanthines was first reported by Suzuki and colleagues as A2AAR antagonists (Kanda et al., 1994). Over 52 weeks of once-daily oral administration in levodopa-treated PD patients it was well tolerated and remained effective in reducing off time in PD (Kondo &amp; Mizuno, 2015). Its recent approval by the FDA followed clinical studies in &gt; 4000 PD patients (Chen &amp; Cunha, 2020). It will be interesting to see future data indicating if there is a slower depression of disease progression in PD patients or improvement of mood and memory in aging patients with istradefylline or other A2AAR antagonists (Merighi et al. 2022; Merighi et al., 2021). Istradefylline will begin a clinical trial in combination with low oxygen therapy, aiming to improve functional mobility after spinal cord injury. Another A2AAR-selective antagonist from the same source (Kyowa Hakko Kirin), KW-6356 (Ohno et al., 2023a,b; Chen &amp; Cunha, 2020), was in a Phase 2 trial for PD, and was well tolerated. However, it is no longer in development for PD but might yet prove useful for cancer.

CSC (8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine). CSC is an early reported 8-styrylxanthine that displays relatively high affinity and selectivity as an A2AAR antagonist (Jacobson et al., 1993). However, it was later shown to inhibit MAO-B (Ki 80.6 nM) as well (Vlok, Malan, Castagnoli Jr, Bergh, &amp; Petzer, 2006). It acts in the CNS following peripheral administration (Aguiar et al., 2008) to ameliorate symptoms in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, leading to the conclusion that CSC acts in the brain as both A2AAR antagonist and MAO-B inhibitor, both being beneficial activities in this neurodegenerative model.

MSX-3 (disodium 3-[8-[(E)-2-(3-methoxyphenyl)ethenyl]-7-methyl-2,6-dioxo-1-prop-2-ynylpurin-3-yl]propyl phosphate) was introduced by the Müller lab as water-soluble prodrugs in the 8-styrylxanthine series. The enzymatic hydrolysis of a phosphoester group in vivo generates the active drug MSX-2 (Mott et al., 2009).

ATL-444 ((1S,3R)-1-((6-amino-9-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)-4,5-dihydro-9H-purin-2-yl)ethynyl)-3-methylcyclohexan-1-ol), a mixed A1AR and A2AAR antagonist, was studied in relation to dopaminergic and glutamatergic psychostimulant action in rats and increased cocaine self-administration (Doyle, Breslin, Rieger, Beauglehole, &amp; Lynch, 2012).

A series of SCH antagonists of the 7H-pyrazolo[4,3-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c] pyrimidine-5-amine family have been reported as pharmacological, imaging and therapeutic agents. SCH-58261 was an early A2AAR antagonist that proved useful in numerous in vitro and in vivo studies, including as a tritiated radioligand (Pinna, Fenu, &amp; Morelli, 2001). SCH-412,348 showed anti-PD activity in rodent and primate models (Hodgson et al., 2009; Smith, Browne, &amp; Jayaraman, 2014), but did not progress to clinical trials. SCH-442,416 (2-(2-furyl)-7-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-7H-pyrazolo[4,3-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c] pyrimidin-5-amine) is a selective antagonist that has been labeled with 11C for PET imaging (Todde et al., 2000). Preladenant (SCH-420,814, 2-(2-furanyl)-7-[2-[4-[4-(2-methoxyethoxy)phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]7H-pyrazolo[4,3-e] [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine-5-amine) (Hodgson et al., 2009) was in multiple clinical trials for PD, but its clinical efficacy was variable and development discontinued. However, it is now being repurposed for cancer treatment as (MK-3814A) alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. MNI-444, is a derivative of SCH-420,814 that when labeled with 18F, is a useful as in vivo imaging agent showing high labeling of the A2AAR in the monkey putamen (Vala et al., 2016).

ST1535 (2-butyl-9-methyl-8-(2H-1,2,3-triazol 2-yl)-9Hpurin-6-xylamine) is a selective A2AAR antagonist that binds with higher affinity in the striatum than in the hippocampus, suggestive of the formation of AR-heterodimers in the latter brain region (Riccioni, Leonardi, &amp; Borsini, 2010).

Vipadenant (3-(4-amino-3-methylbenzyl)-7-(furan-2-yl)-3H-[1,2,3] triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-5-amine, BIIB-014) is a moderately A2AAR-selective antagonist (52-fold) that was shown to be active in vivo in a PD model without inducing dyskinesias in either naive or l-DOPA pre-sensitized rats, but did not block dyskinesias resulting from l-DOPA (Jones, Bleickardt, Mullins, Parker, &amp; Hodgson, 2013).

Tozadenant (4-hydroxy-N-(4-methoxy-7-morpholinobenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-4-methylpiperidine-1-carboxamide, SYN115) was in a Phase 2 clinical trial that was abruptly ceased due to patient deaths. Out of ~890 patients receiving tozadenant, there were seven sepsis cases (including five fatalities due to agranulocytosis) (LeWitt, Aradi, Hauser, &amp; Rascol, 2020).

ANR94 (Spinaci et al., 2022) is an A2AAR-selective 8-ethoxy-adenine derivative that crosses the blood-brain barrier and reduces the motor deficits and tremors in a PD model without inducing long-term plastic changes in the striatum.

TPP455 (2-(2-furanyl)-N5-(2-methoxybenzyl)[1,3]thiazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidine-5,7-diamine) demonstrated an unusually high A2AAR affinity in the pM range (Gessi et al., 2017). It reduced acute pain in the mouse and inhibited proliferation of cancer cells.

Lu AA47070 (phosphoric acid mono-{2-[(E/Z)-4-(3,3-dimethyl-butyrylamino)-3,5-difluoro-benzoylimino]-thiazol-3-ylmethyl} ester) is a water-soluble (8.6 mg/mL) prodrug of a potent and selective A2AAR antagonist (compound 28) (Sams et al., 2011). It was dosed orally in solution to show efficacy in reversing haloperidol-induced hypolocomotion in the mouse. [3H]SCH-58261 ex-vivo binding in the brain was used to demonstrate target A2AAR engagement at the efficacious dose.

Imaradenant (6-(2-chloro-6-methylpyridin-4-yl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazin-3-amine, AZD4635) was designed through a combination of X-ray crystallography and biophysical mapping (Jazayeri et al., 2017). It was in a Phase 2 clinical trial for progressive metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (in combination with durvalumab and in combination with cabazitaxel and durvaluma) and Phase 1 trial in Japan for advanced solid malignancies. Its target is to inhibit the immunosuppressive A2AAR on T-lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment.

Inupadenant (7-amino-10-[2-[4-[2,4-difluoro-5-[2-[(S)-methylsulfinyl] ethoxy]phenyl]piperazin-1-yl]ethyl]-4-(furan-2-yl)-12-thia-3,5,6,8,10-pentazatricyclo[7.3.0.02,6]dodeca-1(9),2,4,7-tetraen-11-one, EOS-850) is a highly selective, non-brain-penetrant A2AAR antagonist that is being developed for the treatment of advanced lung cancer, head and neck cancer and melanoma (Buisseret et al., 2021).

Ciforadenant ((R)-7-(5-methylfuran-2-yl)-3-((6-(((tetrahydrofuran-3-yl)oxy)methyl)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)-3H-[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-5-amine, CPI-444) (Zhang, Yan, Duan, Wüthrich, &amp; Cheng, 2020) completed Phase 1B clinical trials for renal cell cancer, as a monotherapy or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 treatment.

Taminadenant (5-bromo-2,6-di(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyrimidin-4-amine, PBF-509) was well tolerated in a Phase 1 clinical trial for advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer, either as a monotherapy or in combination with spartalizumab, with only with 20% and 12% discontinuation, respectively, due to side events (Chiappori et al., 2022).

Several AR antagonists of the 2-amino-9-(4-methyl-2-phenylthiazol-5-yl)-4-phenyl-5H-indeno[1,2-d]pyrimidin-5-one family have been developed. JNJ-40255293, a mixed A1AR and A2AAR antagonist that shows efficacy in PD animal models (Atack et al., 2014). In 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat, there was agreement of receptor occupancy (60–90% required) and potentiation of l-DOPA effects. JNJ-41501798 (695-fold selective for binding to the A2AAR compared to A1AR), as well as JNJ-40255293, reduced meningeal arterial dilation induced by an A2AAR agonist (CGS21680) or by electrical stimulation, indicative of use in treating migraine, without affecting neurogenic vasodilation (Haanes et al., 2018).

Among the newest AR antagonists to enter human testing, ILB2109 (Innolake Biopharma), an A2AAR antagonist, is in a Phase 1 clinical trial in China in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies. Etrumadenant (AB928, Arcus Biosciences) is a mixed A2AAR/A2BAR antagonist in Phase 2 clinical trials for colorectal cancer that increased tumor cell cytolysis through CAR T cell secretion and proliferation (Seifert, Benmebarek, &amp; Briukhovetska, 2022). The structure of its A2AAR-bound complex was reported (Claff et al., 2023). However, its further clinical development was recently terminated. A Phase 2B PD clinical trial of a highly potent and selective A2AAR inverse agonist KW-6356 (sipagladenant) was also halted. Nevertheless, a recent X-ray structure of its receptor complex highlighted the stabilizing interactions that contribute to its long receptor residence time (Ohno et al., 2023b). Its anti-parkinsonian activity in combination with L-DOPA has been reported (Ohno et al., 2023a). A2AAR/A2BAR antagonist M1069 (Domain Therapeutics licensed to Merck-EMD Serono, administered as the fumarate salt) is in a Phase 1 clinical trial as an oral drug for metastatic or locally advanced unresectable solid tumors. Other adenosinergic signaling blockers, including CD73 inhibitors, that are in clinical trials for various cancers were recently reviewed (Wang, Du, &amp; Chen, 2022).

5. Negative allosteric enhancers (NAMs)

Sodium ion act as a negative allosteric enhancer (NAM) of the A2AAR (Liu et al., 2012). A mass spectroscopy approach was used to identify an apparent NAM that bound to the A2AAR sodium site (Lu, Liu, &amp; Yang, 2021). Cholesterol has weak negative effect on A2AAR activation, but this is now ascribed to indirect membrane effects (Huang et al., 2022). Other potential A2AAR NAMs, such as amiloride analogs, are described in Korkutata et al. (2022).

6. A2AAR partial agonists

8-Aminoalkyl-substituted adenosine derivatives that act as A2AAR partial agonists were reported (van Tilburg, J.von Frijtag Drabbe Kunzel, de Groote, &amp; IJzerman, 2002). More recently, a series of 7-(prolinol-N-yl)-2-phenylaminothiazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidines, including compound 10l as were reported to act as non-nucleoside A2AAR partial agonists (Bharate et al., 2016).

7. Conclusions

Despite the setbacks of many unsuccessful clinical trials, A2AAR antagonists, agonists and partial agonists have promise as future therapeutic agents. Some A2AAR agonists have a liability of cardiovascular side effects, but there are encouraging results for their use and use of PAMs in treating inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. A2AAR antagonists have been avidly pursued by the pharmaceutical industry for treatment of neurodegenerative conditions and for cancer immunotherapy. The use of receptor structures in the rational design of new ligands is increasingly popular and productive.

Fig. 1 Structures of adenosine receptor agonists, partial agonists and allosteric modulators described in the text. Most of the agonists and partial agonists are adenosine derivatives, while all of the allosteric modulators are small heterocyclic molecules. Refer to Table 1 for their binding affinity and selectivity.
