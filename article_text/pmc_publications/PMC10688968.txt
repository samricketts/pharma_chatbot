Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and has far reaching consequences for patients and their caregivers. Early detection and treatment are key factors in limiting the impact of the disease. However, a definitive diagnosis of AD requires an examination of brain tissue during an autopsy. Although a plethora of biomarkers such as neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are available, their utility is limited to research due to their poor reach and prohibitive cost. In order for biomarkers to be widely used, they need to be accessible, affordable, and conducive for the patient population or disease stage. Blood-based biomarkers may not only be less expensive and more accessible compared to neuroimaging or CSF tests, but they are also preferred by patients with AD as they are much less invasive. In this mini-review article, we expand on the rationale for the use of blood-based biomarkers, review currently available biomarkers and discuss the need for the standardization of these biomarkers. We contrast the blood-based biomarkers with other available biomarkers and discuss the advantages of using a panel of blood-based biomarkers to strengthen their accuracy.

pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, followed by frontotemporal lobar dementias (FTLDs), Lewy body dementias (LBDs), and vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). A definitive diagnosis of these diseases requires an examination of brain tissue during an autopsy; however, biomarkers are quickly improving in their ability to detect brain pathology. Clinicians and researchers have realized that to accurately diagnose these diseases in living people, especially during the early stages, validated biomarkers are needed. Imaging, electrophysiological, and biofluid-based AD biomarkers are available for clinical and/or research use. Imaging biomarkers mostly use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), but they can also be derived from computed tomography (CT), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and infrared optical imaging (Olson et al., 2008). Electrophysiological biomarkers use electroencephalography (EEG) and EEG-based event-related potentials (ERPs), as well as magnetoencephalography to obtain measurements. Biofluid biomarkers are measured in biological samples, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), saliva, or urine (Koenig, Nobuhara, Williams, &amp; Arnold, 2018).

In order for biomarkers to be widely used, they need to be accessible, affordable, and conducive for the patient population or disease stage. Blood-based biomarkers may not only be less expensive and more accessible compared to neuroimaging or CSF tests, but they are also preferred by patients with AD as they are much less invasive. On average, MRI and PET scans can cost up to $8,400 and $3,000, respectively. Blood tests typically cost up to $1,250. Logistically, PET scans are less available for would-be patients living in rural areas while blood testing is likely to be more widely available (RTI International). Additionally, blood-based biomarkers may be valuable in patients with dementia to help rule out specific etiologies to make the proper diagnosis. Specific biomarkers for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia are currently being investigated (Tumati, Herrmann, Marotta, Li, &amp; Lanctot, 2022). In this paper, an overview of current and developing blood-based biomarkers will be provided in comparison to the current neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and CSF biomarkers.

General description of biomarkers

Biomarkers are bodily characteristics that are “objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention” (NIH) (Biomarkers Definitions Working, 2001). Currently, a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease can only be made through an examination of brain tissue and the clinical presentation of symptoms. However, research into various biomarkers shows their ability to indicate the presence of brain pathology of AD. Biomarkers are important to glean the risk for a disease, its current state, its progression, its prognostication and to measure its response to a therapeutic agent. Biomarkers can be classified either as trait or state markers. Trait markers such as genetic variants do not change during someone’s lifetime and are not influenced by the natural history of a disease. On the other hand, state markers such as amyloid beta (Aβ) or proteomics—the sum of all proteins of a cell or organism—reflect the actual condition of the disease at a given time. Biomarkers can reflect either the disease process or a compensatory response to the disease. Additionally, AD biomarkers can be classified based on the study design: cross-sectional vs. longitudinal. While cross-sectional studies can help identify a potential biomarker candidate, longitudinal studies with clinical correlations are needed to test the utility of the biomarker.

Need for biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease

AD is a progressive neurodegenerative condition affecting over six million Americans with no definitive treatment. It is characterized clinically by progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions. The pathological changes seen in the cerebral cortex in AD, the presence of abundant Aβ neuritic plaques and paired helical filaments (PHF)-tau neurofibrillary tangles, have been utilized for biomarker development (McKhann et al., 2011). The National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) conceptualizes AD pathology in the ATN framework: Aβ deposits (A), hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates (T) and neurodegeneration or neuronal injury (N) (Jack et al., 2018). There is growing evidence that early detection of the disease or a prodromal state of AD might be amenable to treatment, but currently there is no such treatment available. Studies like the AHEAD 3–45 (NCT04468659) and Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s (A4) (NCT02008357) studies are good examples of research being done to test the viability of early detection. The AHEAD study is a clinical trial of lecanemab, a monoclonal antibody which targets Aβ, on participants with intermediate to high amyloid levels without a diagnosis of AD to track amyloid levels and cognition (Swanson et al., 2021). Similarly, participants in the A4 study with elevated amyloid concentrations receive solanezumab, another monoclonal antibody which targets Aβ, in an effort to observe its effect on memory loss (Honig et al., 2018).

As of now, the FDA-approved anti-amyloid treatment, aducanumab, is available on the market (Cummings et al., 2021). Aducanumab can be used in patients who are in the mild dementia stage of AD. While it has shown a significant reduction of Aβ burden, there remains controversy about its ability to show clinical benefits (Cummings et al., 2021). The potential pipeline of disease-modifying drugs underlines the urgency of developing biomarkers that can detect the disease process perhaps even decades before the clinical presentation.

Traits that make a biomarker ideal for use

Biomarkers need to meet certain qualifications in order to be viable for use. While they cannot act as substitutes for clinical outcomes as clinical presentation symptoms are necessary for diagnosis, they can help to identify the underlying disease and expedite the process (Biomarkers Definitions Working, 2001). Biomarkers should be able to accurately predict AD and its prognosis in each patient. Accessibility is another key factor when evaluating biomarkers. Accessibility includes cost, time burden, and the extent of invasiveness. Biomarkers must have good sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity of the biomarker will help with differentiation of AD pathology from cognitively normal patients. However, as sensitivity increases, the precision of results may increase, leading to more false positives. Specificity of the biomarkers should help distinguish AD from the other types of dementia so as to have a more accurate diagnosis (Mayeux, 2004). Sensitivity and specificity of a test vary in opposite directions when changing the threshold; for instance, sensitivity of a test can be increased by lowering the threshold, but the specificity reduces in turn. As such, it is important to find an optimal balance between the two. Most biomarker assays undergo Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analyses to determine the optimal cut-off for a test. One way out of the dilemma is to use several tests that complement each other, first using a test with high sensitivity (i.e. blood NfL in AD diagnosis) followed by a test with high specificity (i.e. plasma P-tau 217). Another important consideration is the positive predictive value of a biomarker test, the probability that someone with a positive screening test truly has AD. The predictive value of each of the biomarkers is influenced by the prevalence of the disease, and as such, the positive predictive value of the test increases as prevalence of a given disease increases. Since AD prevalence increases with age, most AD blood-based biomarkers will have better predictive value when performed in older adults than in younger adults.

Neuroimaging biomarkers summary

Magnetic resonance imaging uses magnetic fields and radio waves in order to examine organs of the body. Cerebral atrophy primarily affecting the hippocampus and adjacent regions of the medial temporal lobes is the most common MRI neuroimaging finding for AD, and as the disease progresses, it extends to the parietal and frontal association regions (Risacher &amp; Saykin, 2013). There have been studies that illustrate that the rate and degree of gray matter atrophy on MRI is associated with clinical indicators of AD severity and progression; these indicators can be used in concordance with other biomarkers and clinical symptoms to show the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD (Jack et al., 1999). Another neuroimaging approach uses positron emission tomography—an imaging technique that uses radiotracers to observe and measure the metabolic processes in the body—to measure the uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as an indicator of glucose metabolism and neuronal activity as AD patients show significantly reduced cerebral glucose utilization in the parietal and temporal lobes (Mosconi, 2005). A more recent approach uses PET radiotracers to identify amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which are two pathological characteristics of AD (Landau et al., 2011). In a similar vein, neuropathological studies have shown that Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and other clinically available fluorinated ligands bind to cerebral tissue that contain high levels of amyloid deposition (Kemppainen et al., 2007). However, several barriers such as cost, limited availability, experimental use, radiation exposure, the need for longitudinal studies, and the subjectivity of interpreting the results limit the role of neuroimaging biomarkers for AD. In addition to the traditional barriers, the current pandemic has shown an additional drawback of these high-touch procedures, namely increased risk of exposure to infection.

Electrophysiological biomarkers summary

An emerging area of biomarkers are electrophysiology-based biomarkers. These biomarkers record normal and aberrant physiological processes through sensors placed on the scalp. When compared to imaging-based biomarkers, such as functional MRI and FDG-PET, EEG produces exceptional temporal resolution through the detection of scalp electrical potential measuring the activity of ensembles of neuronal cells that reflects brain activity. With improving technology, EEG has become a promising biomarker for dementia, representing a cost-effective and easily accessible technique. Two major categories of EEG analysis are of potential use as biomarkers of dementia: Quantitative EEG (QEEG) and ERPs (Gouw et al., 2017). Abnormal QEEG recordings are most frequently seen in AD and atypical EEG activity is observed in frontotemporal dementia, though less consistent evidence is found (Calzetti, Bortone, Negrotti, Zinno, &amp; Mancia, 2002). However, EEGs have poor spatial resolution and are limited in their ability to capture electrical activity arising from deep subcortical and medial temporal lobe structures, areas that are vulnerable to AD (de Waal et al., 2011). In addition, EEGs are time-consuming and require specialization and training which means that specific personnel must be present for utilization.

CSF biomarkers summary

Biofluid-based biomarkers commonly use CSF to detect AD, as it is clinically accessible and can reliably measure amyloid and tau, the two most common pathological brain changes seen in AD. Low levels of amyloid—particularly a 42 amino acid proteolytic product from the amyloid precursor protein, Aβ42—and high levels of total and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) proteins are seen in patients with AD, and postmortem studies present evidence for an inverse relationship between ventricular Aβ42 CSF levels and cortical plaque load (Blennow &amp; Zetterberg, 2015). Because of this relationship, it is assumed that lower levels of Aβ42 in the CSF reflect AD pathology (Blennow &amp; Zetterberg, 2015). Low Aβ42 is also found to be related to a high level of amyloid radiotracer for in vivo brain imaging of Aβ42 pathology, as plaques draw in soluble Aβ42 from interstitial fluid. However, low CSF Aβ42 levels do not automatically indicate that a person has AD. P-tau can also be measured in the CSF, with increased levels of both total and P-tau in patients with AD. However, P-tau levels are also found to be increased in stroke, neuroinflammatory conditions and other disorders such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, making it harder to predict a specific disorder. A combination of both low CSF Aβ42 and high CSF P-tau can predict the presence of AD with potentially the greatest accuracy of any of the biomarkers that are currently available (Tapiola et al., 2009). Although the clinical use of CSF Aβ42 and P-tau testing is available, lumbar punctures are not commonly performed during dementia evaluations. General patient unease, post lumbar puncture headache (reported in up to a quarter of the patients), bleeding risk, back pain, the risk of dry tap which usually results from misplacement of the spinal needle, and the limited availability of personnel make CSF biomarkers less than ideal for many patients with AD (Duits et al., 2016).

Blood-based biomarkers

Similar to neuroimaging and CSF-based biomarkers, blood-based biomarkers are not stand-alone tests, but their ease of access in patients with all stages of dementia (with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms) make them preferrable and explains the necessity of further research. The limited permeability of the BBB to brain-derived proteins and low assay sensitivity are barriers in finding a reliable blood-based biomarker (Zetterberg &amp; Burnham, 2019). Furthermore, the greater diversity of blood proteins compared to CSF, the tendency of Aβ42 to aggregate into clumps in the blood, and the presence of proteases in the blood that destabilize Aβ42 necessitate a highly sensitive assay to reliably detect Aβ42 in the blood (Zetterberg &amp; Burnham, 2019). However, blood-based biomarkers have gained attention due to their accessibility. Blood-based biomarkers range from non-specific markers such as neurofilament-light (NfL) biomarkers, a marker for axonal injury, to a very-specific “panel” (several biomarkers in combination) approach (Narayanan, Shanker, Khera, &amp; Subramaniam, 2021). The aforementioned concerns about assay sensitivity have mostly been resolved. Currently, harmonization across assay platforms and standardization are the primary obstacles to full clinical rollout.

The new CLIA-approved PrecivityAD™ test by C2N Diagnostics uses a two-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based assay that simultaneously quantifies Aβ isoforms in human blood and determines the common apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype (Kirmess et al., 2021). The presence of two alleles of APOE4 are known to increase the risk of AD by 10–12-fold compared to those individuals that have two alleles of APOE2 genes. This combination of state and trait markers of AD provides tests that have a wide linear range, a low limit of detection, and independence from common interference in older adults such as medication use (Kirmess et al., 2021). In a sample of 686 AD patients that underwent PET imaging with an amyloid tracer, the PrecivityAD™ test had a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 77% in predicting the presence of amyloid plaques. This test has several advantages over other biomarkers including ease of access and higher sensitivity and specificity. It is currently being investigated for its reliability and accessibility against other Aβ-quantifying tests such as PET imaging.

Currently used blood-based biomarkers of AD

Although there were some valid concerns about the utility of blood-based biomarkers in comparison to CSF and neuroimaging markers, a wide variety of blood-based biomarkers are currently available. Blood-based biomarkers cover the ATN framework (amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration). Several recent studies have demonstrated that the blood Aβ42/40 ratio is a reliable tool for the assessment of amyloid pathology in the brain (Nabers et al., 2018; Ovod et al., 2017; Perez-Grijalba et al., 2019; West et al., 2021). The most common methods for Aβ measurement include liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) and immunoassays. These have shown that a decrease in blood Aβ42 or Aβ42/40 ratio is associated with clinical AD with diagnostic accuracy similar to CSF Aβ42 and can detect an earlier indication of changes in Aβ42 production and clearance rates. Blood Aβ42/40 ratio usually declines before brain amyloid accumulates to a level that can be detected by PET tracers (Zetterberg &amp; Burnham, 2019). While immunoassays are easier to perform, LC-MS assays may yield higher accuracy (Keshavan et al., 2021). Plasma P-tau is another viable biomarker of AD, although it is a better predictor when used in a panel with other biomarkers such as Aβ. A panel consisting of P-tau217, APOE genotype and neurofilament has shown to be better at predicting AD than solely clinical symptoms themselves (Seto, Weiner, Dumitrescu, &amp; Hohman, 2021).

The following section includes details about each of the commonly used blood-based biomarkers of AD, briefly outlining evidence to support their use, strengths, and weaknesses.

Amyloid based biomarkers

Amyloid based biomarkers are the most commonly used blood-based biomarkers for AD. Accumulation of Aβ42 into brain parenchymal plaques by overproduction coupled by poor clearance is the fundamental etiology in the onset of AD. Decreased CSF Aβ42 levels in conjunction with increased CSF tau are established biomarkers of cerebral amyloidosis. Several studies have successfully and reliably correlated the blood Aβ profile to the CSF profile; the faster metabolism in blood compared to CSF (3hrs vs. 9hrs) leads to similar kinetics but lower magnitude in the blood (Ovod et al., 2017). Some studies noted elevated levels of Aβ42 in patients with MCI compared to cognitively normal controls and individuals with AD, and others have found an association of higher blood Aβ42 levels with increased risk of sporadic AD (Mayeux &amp; Schupf, 2011; Sobow, Flirski, Kloszewska, &amp; Liberski, 2005). Chen et al. found that blood levels of Aβ42 were capable of distinguishing AD from the controls, with a sensitivity of 88%, and a specificity of 81% (Chen et al., 2021). Measuring Aβ42 alone might lead to unreliable results in low Aβ producers, but this problem is overcome by measuring the Aβ42/40 ratio, which is a more robust plaque pathology marker than Aβ42 alone. The blood Aβ42/40 ratio is used to distinguish amnestic MCI (aMCI) from the controls and to predict risk of conversion to AD dementia. Perez-Grijalba et al. found lower Aβ42/40 ratio in aMCI compared to those with normal cognition. Furthermore, the lower Aβ42/40 ratio was associated with an increased conversion rate from aMCI to AD by 70% (Perez-Grijalba et al., 2019). Higher blood levels of Aβ40 are seen in those with the APOE-ε4 allele. The diagnostic accuracy of blood amyloid biomarkers is substantially increased when done in conjunction with plasma tau biomarkers.

Plasma tau biomarkers

Plasma tau biomarkers have attracted attention due to phosphorylated tau, a major constituent of neurofibrillary tangles, being a brain-specific protein unlike Aβ. P-tau181 and P-tau217 are the most commonly assayed molecules, and increased CSF P-tau181 is commonly associated with AD pathology. Plasma P-tau181 levels reach diagnostic accuracies for the separation of AD from non-AD dementia disorders similar to those achieved using CSF P-tau181 or tau PET (AUC 0.81–0.94) (Palmqvist et al., 2019). Palmqvist et al. found that the blood biomarkers for Aβ, tau and neurodegeneration started to change approximately at the same point of the disease process as the corresponding CSF biomarkers, especially P-tau (Palmqvist et al.,2019). Mattsson et al. used the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and BioFINDER cohorts (N = 1284) and found higher plasma P-tau associated with AD diagnosis (Mattsson et al., 2016). They also found significant associations between plasma P-tau and worse cognition, observed by more atrophy on neuroimaging. Furthermore, they found correlations of plasma P-tau levels with levels of hypometabolism during follow-up in longitudinal studies (Mattsson et al., 2016). Plasma P-tau levels correlate well with PET amyloid and tau measures (Mielke et al., 2021). In 200 participants from the Mayo Clinic Study on Aging, P-tau181 and P-tau217 predicted entorhinal cortex tau PET measures and were associated with MRI measures of cerebrovascular pathology (Mielke et al., 2021). There is accumulating evidence that serial levels of P-tau may be helpful in predicting which of the patients with aMCI convert to AD. In a recent study of 343 patients in the BioFINDER 1 and 2 studies, plasma P-tau217 was seen as the best predictor of future P-tau accumulation in cognitively unimpaired patients and tau PET for those with mild AD. Combining these two biomarkers in longitudinal studies would significantly reduce the sample sizes needed for studies that use P-tau accumulation as an outcome measure (Leuzy et al., 2022).

Neurofilament light

Neurofilament light, a marker of subcortical large-caliber axonal degeneration, is one of the most promising blood-based biomarker of neurodegeneration (Narayanan et al., 2021). Validation studies have established a satisfactory correlation between the CSF and blood levels of NfL (Osborn et al., 2019). Although a non-specific marker of neurodegeneration, higher levels of NfL are associated with faster disease progression and higher rates of brain atrophy in most neurodegenerative disorders. In a longitudinal study of AD, the absolute blood NfL levels were indicative of the symptomatic phase and progression of AD (Preische et al., 2019). In patients with neurodegenerative disorders, higher baseline NfL levels correlated with poor scores on global cognitive measures and worse performance on the same tests at follow-up (Dhiman et al., 2020). NfL was highly specific and sensitive in separating patients with AD from healthy controls (AUC for NfL 0.84) on par with that of tau (AUC 0.87) and Aβ (AUC 0.84) (Dhiman et al., 2020). Blood NfL levels may pre-date symptom onset as early as around 6.8 years in individuals carrying AD familial disease mutations. In ADNI, the rates of change in NfL levels were predictive of neuroimaging structural and functional decline and of change in cognitive scores (Preische et al., 2019). However, due to the lack of specificity of NfL, it has its best utility in a panel of biomarkers including amyloid and tau markers.

Inflammation-based biomarkers

Inflammation-based biomarkers found in blood plasma have been studied for AD dementia. Inflammation of neurons is often prominent in early stages of AD and has compounding effects with time. Chronic neurodegeneration is accompanied by selective activation of the microglial cells and astrocytes of the central nervous system. Dysfunctions of microglia and astrocytic metabolism can result in the accumulation of Aβ and phosphorylation of tau (Kwon &amp; Koh, 2020). Interleukins 1 and 6 (IL-1, IL-6) have been implicated in the transition of diffuse plaques to neuritic plaques in the brain of AD patients (Hull, Berger, Volk, &amp; Bauer, 1996). Morgan et al. looked at several analytes to observe their viability as biomarkers. Analytes Factor B and H were found to be the best predictors of MCI in patients with AD (Morgan et al., 2019). Pillai et al. found that CCL2 in blood is another good predictor of AD. Concentrations of CCL2 in blood plasma increase with increasing severity of AD and lead to cognitive decline in MCI (Pillai et al., 2020). Higher CSF pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α) and lower anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-β) are found in MCI patients that convert to AD dementia compared to those that do not (Tarkowski et al., 2003). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of reactive astrogliosis, is a possible biomarker specific for Aβ pathology (Benedet et al., 2021). Blood GFAP levels are not elevated in cognitively normal controls and increase with worsening AD dementia. Interestingly, upon head-to-head comparison between CSF and blood GFAP levels, the blood GFAP more accurately discriminated Aβ-positive from Aβ-negative individuals than CSF GFAP (Benedet et al., 2021).

PrecivityAD™ test studies

AD clinical trials may increasingly use tests like PrecivityAD™ to reduce the cost of screening potential participants by reducing amyloid and/or tau PET scans. The AHEAD 3–45 study, a multisite NIH-funded primary AD prevention study, will examine the concordance in detection of Aβ via PET scans and the PrecivityAD™ test in two clinical trials. Investigators at Vanderbilt University plan to use the PrecivityAD™ test to measure Aβ levels in a phase 2 trial of treatment for inflammation-induced oxidative stress in AD.

Combining blood biomarkers with other variables to improve prediction of conversion to AD

The ultimate reason for using biomarkers is to predict which dementia and its subcategories that patients with subjective memory complaints fit into. Palmquist et al. used two independent cohorts (ADNI and BioFINDER; combined N = 883) to examine the utility of plasma P-tau levels with and without other variables to predict conversion of MCI to AD dementia at a 4-year follow-up (Palmqvist et al., 2021). They found that plasma P-tau alone (4-year AUC 0.71–0.83) and in combination with ApoE genotyping and brief cognitive testing (4-year AUC 0.90–0.91) had significantly higher accuracy in predicting conversion to AD dementia than clinical estimation by memory clinic experts (AUC 0.71). These estimates were true even when two different plasma P-tau were used (P-tau217 in BioFINDER and P-tau181 in ADNI). Furthermore, they found that replacing the blood biomarker data with CSF biomarker data did not improve the accuracy of prediction significantly.

Next Steps

Blood-based biomarkers could be useful as early diagnostic tests to select patients that are likely to benefit from disease modifying treatments and to monitor treatments. Biomarkers in advanced dementia may also help with decisions on therapeutic modalities and their follow-up. Although the recent progress with high precision blood Aβ measures has resulted in commercially available blood tests for the detection of amyloid pathology, fully automated, high-throughput, and highly reliable analysis methods would facilitate implementation more broadly in clinical practice. Appropriate-use criteria need to be developed for the use of blood-based biomarkers and implemented in clinical practice. Standardization of different biomarkers using the ATN framework is needed. Appropriate cut-offs for various biomarkers must be defined. These cut-offs might vary based on the mode of collection of the same biomarker. For instance, using currently available cut-offs, patients with 10% higher levels of Aβ were classified as ‘amyloid abnormal’ using CSF cut-offs over PET-based cut-offs (Jansen et al., 2022). Since there is no set gold standard, or when “sensitivity and specificity equal 100%,” optimal specificity and sensitivity levels need to be agreed on to act as a reference standard, and this standard must be able to confidently indicate AD pathology in the brain (Umemneku Chikere, Wilson, Graziadio, Vale, &amp; Allen, 2019).

There is also an urgent need of data from diverse populations which may also alter the threshold of each marker based on the ethnicity of the patient. For instance, the Mayo Clinic Study on Aging had 1% non-white participation (Mielke et al., 2021). Apart from the technical enhancements to standardize the tests, attention should be paid to educate providers and patients. The Alzheimer’s Association, the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry, and the American Association of Neurology could help by writing position papers about the use of biomarkers in clinical use. Dementia experts could then help with the education of primary care providers and trainees in subspecialties that work with AD patients. The Alzheimer’s Association could also help by educating the general public about biomarkers. Policymakers could work with third party payers to include biomarkers in their reimbursement plans.

Conclusions

Biomarkers for AD have been refined over decades targeting the Alzheimer’s pathology and its effects on brain structure and function. While MRI protocols have been optimized to detect subtle structural changes, functional and amyloid/tau tracer imaging have clearly set imaging biomarkers as indispensable tools in research and some clinical practice. Similarly, electrophysiological biomarkers have gained increasing popularity due to their non-invasiveness. CSF biomarkers have established a signature of AD with a combination of both low CSF Aβ42 and high CSF P-tau. However, cost, limited availability, and potential side effects leave plenty of room for blood-based biomarkers.

Blood-based biomarkers have developed substantially in the last few decades with wide availability spanning from amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration and immunological markers. The new CLIA-approved PrecivityAD™ test can be used to quantify Aβ isoforms in human blood and determine the common APOE genotype with excellent sensitivity and specificity in predicting amyloidosis. Refining of the biomarkers has overcome the assay sensitivity issues. Currently, harmonization across assay platforms and standardization are the primary obstacles to full clinical rollout. Several groups are studying the use of blood-based biomarkers in observational studies with longitudinal follow-up and are targeting earlier stages of AD. Standardizing blood-based biomarkers will help clinicians with prognostication, tailoring treatments, and help researchers screen for eligible participants for future clinical trials at a substantially lower cost compared to CSF analysis or PET imaging. It is important to understand that although biomarkers can aid diagnosis in clinical setting, correlation with clinical signs and symptoms is essential to reach an accurate diagnosis.
