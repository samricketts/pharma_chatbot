Objective

The proteinaceous inclusions in TDP-43 proteinopathies such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-TDP are made of high–molecular-weight aggregates of TDP-43. These aggregates have not been classified as amyloids, as prior amyloid staining results were not conclusive. Here we used a specific TDP-43 amyloid oligomer antibody called TDP-O to determine the presence and abundance of TDP-43 oligomers among different subtypes of FTLD-TDP as well as in hippocampal sclerosis (HS), which represents a non-FTLD pathology with TDP-43 inclusions.

Methods

Postmortem tissue from the hippocampus and anterior orbital gyrus from 54 prospectively assessed and diagnosed subjects was used for immunostaining with TDP-O. Electron microscopy was used to assess the subcellular locations of TDP-O–decorated structures.

Results

TDP-43 inclusions staining with TDP-O were present in FTLD-TDP and were most conspicuous for FTLD-TDP type C, the subtype seen in most patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia. TDP-O immunoreactivity was absent in the hippocampus of HS patients despite abundant TDP-43 inclusions. Ultrastructurally, TDP-43 oligomers resided in granular or tubular structures, frequently in close proximity to, but not within, neuronal lysosomes.

Interpretation

TDP-43 forms amyloid oligomers in the human brain, which may cause neurotoxicity in a manner similar to other amyloid oligomers. Oligomer formation may contribute to the conformational heterogeneity of TDP-43 aggregates and mark the different properties of TDP-43 inclusions between FTLD-TDP and HS.


The neuropathological diagnosis of major neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is heavily based on the presence of proteinaceous inclusions.1–3 FTLD is a heterogeneous group of disorders that manifest clinically as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), one of the most common forms of dementia in persons younger than 65 years. FTLD can be subdivided according to whether the protein inclusions found in neurons and glia contain tau (FTLD-tau), TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein-43kDa; FTLD-TDP), or fused in sarcoma. TDP-43 inclusions are also found in nearly all patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).4

TDP-43 is a DNA- and RNA-binding protein that serves multiple functions in gene transcription and translation.5,6 In normal neurons, the majority of TDP-43 resides within the nucleus.7,8 However, pathological TDP-43 inclusions commonly present as neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs) and dystrophic neurites (DNs). Less commonly seen are neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs). How abnormal TDP-43 causes neuronal dysfunction and forms NCI/DN pathologies is currently under investigation. There is evidence linking loss of TDP-43 function to neurotoxicity, and several studies using models overexpressing full-length or truncated TDP-43 have demonstrated neurotoxicity as well as formation of FTLD-like cytoplasmic inclusions, indicating a gain of toxic function from TDP-43 aggregation.9–12 The 2 RNA recognition motifs RRM113,14 and RRM215 and the glycine-rich domain16,17 in human TDP-43 have been implicated in aggregation of TDP-43 into pathological inclusions.

One prevailing hypothesis with regard to pathogenic proteins implicated in neurodegenerative disorders (for example, amyloid-β, tau, prion, α-synuclein, and huntingtin) is that they form amyloids, losing their normal function and causing neurotoxicity. In this regard, the high–molecular-weight aggregates of TDP-43 present in FTLD NCIs and DNs resemble amyloid inclusions found in other neurodegenerative disorders. The first line of supporting evidence came from our recent demonstration that human TDP-43 forms structurally stable, spherical oligomers that possess properties of amyloid.12 Such TDP-43 oligomers exhibit reduced DNA-binding capability, are conformational and functionally distinct from native TDP-43, and are neurotoxic. Interestingly, TDP-43 oligomers were recognized by an amyloid oligomer-specific antibody A11,18 indicating that they share structural and functional homology with many amyloid oligomers. Because a common neurotoxic mechanism associated with amyloid oligomers has been suggested for various neurodegenerative disorders,19 we hypothesize that such a mechanism could play a role in FTLD-TDP. To obtain an initial confirmation of the pathological significance of TDP-43 oligomers in the human brain, we used a polyclonal TDP-43 oligomer antibody, TDP-O, the specificity of which was validated in our prior study,12 to determine the presence and abundance of TDP-43 oligomers among different sub-types of FTLD-TDP. We found that TDP-O highlighted a subpopulation of conventional TDP-43 lesions such as NCIs and DNs in FTLD-TDP cases, with a particular abundance of FTLD-TDP type C.20 Remarkably, no TDP-O immunoreactivity was found in cases of isolated hippocampal sclerosis (HS), despite an abundant presence of TDP-43 NCIs in the hippocampus. Our data support the notion that TDP-43 aggregates into amyloid oligomers in FTLD-TDP, particularly FTLD-TDP type C, and suggest that TDP-O immunoreactivity profiles could aid in further refinement of the subclassification of TDP-43 proteinopathies.

Methods and Materials

Tissue Samples

Fixed human brain tissue and paraffin-embedded tissue used in this study were obtained from the Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank at the University of California, San Francisco, Memory and Aging Center, San Francisco, California and the Alzheimer's Disease Center at University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California. All human specimens were obtained through consented autopsies with institutional review board approval. The diagnosis of HS was based on clinicopathological correlation, following the National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer's Association guidelines,21 and our previous criteria for HS.22 FTLD-TDP subtypes were designated using consensus nomenclature20 and diagnosed following the original descriptions.23,24 Patients with FTLD-TDP spanned types A to D, and sporadic and genetic forms, including patients with GRN, C9ORF72, and VCP mutations (Table 1). Although such gene mutations were not routinely determined for HS and control cases, we stained the cerebellum of all HS and control cases with ubiquitin and p62 antibodies and did not find any inclusions, making it highly unlikely for these cases to have C9ORF72 mutations.25,26 The clinical diagnosis of ALS was made following the criteria described by de Carvalho et al.27 All listed cases of ALS had pathological confirmation of motor neuron disease (MND) with essential manifestations of loss of anterior horn motor neurons and TDP-43–immunoreactive inclusions in neurons and/or glia in the spinal cord.

TDP-43 Oligomer Immunohistochemistry

Five-micrometer-thick sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus) and anterior orbital gyrus were immunostained with anti–TDP-43 oligomer polyclonal antibody (TDP-O, 1:500) overnight at 4°C. The specificity of this antibody was validated in a prior study.12 Slides were washed with ×1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) 5 times, then incubated in goat antirabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:500) for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were washed with ×1 PBS 5 times, then incubated with Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After washing with ×1 PBS, slides were placed in DAB substrate (Vector Laboratories) for 10 minutes and rinsed with water. Slides were counterstained in hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for 5 minutes, dipped in 0.05% lithium carbonate, rinsed, and coverslipped following dehydration in increasing concentrations of ethanol and clearing with xylene. A similar protocol was followed to stain TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO)1 at a dilution of 1:3,000 for 30 minutes at room temperature. Slides were scanned and images were taken using an Aperio camera (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) and analyzed using ImageJ.

Electron Microscopy

Immunostained sections for electron microscopy (EM) were prepared as previously described.28,29 Briefly, formalin-fixed brain tissue from the medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus) was cut on a vibratome. Fifty-micron-thick sections were collected in cold 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB) and used for immunocytochemistry (TDP-O antibody 1:50). Immunolabeled sections were osmicated and rinsed with PB, dehydrated, embedded in epoxy resin, and polymerized for 24 hours at 70°C in an oven. Ultrathin sections (70–80nm) were cut on a Leica Ultramicrotome (EM UC7) and were collected on Formvar-coated single-slot copper grids (EMS, Hatfield, PA). Sections were lightly stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in with a Philips (Best, the Netherlands) CM120 electron microscope at 80kV. Electron microscopic images were acquired by a 2k × 2k high-resolution charge-coupled device camera attached to the microscope (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA). Images were processed using an EM software program (DigitalMicrograph; Gatan). Neuronal profiles were considered immunopositive when electron-dense immunoperoxidase reaction product could be detected in at least 3 serial thin sections.

Image Processing

Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) was used for image processing in the current study. Image processing included adjustments in brightness and cropping of images to create layered images showing high magnification of stained cells.

Statistics

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed in multiple group comparisons followed by Tukey post hoc analysis (Prism 5; GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Data from the FTLD-TDP type D case was included in Figure 1, but was excluded from statistical analysis because there was only 1 patient in this group.

Results

Oligomeric TDP-43 Is Present in FTLD-TDP Brains

We examined TDP-O immunoreactivity in sections from 25 FTLD-TDP cases and 15 age-matched cognitively normal controls. Sections of medial temporal region and anterior orbital frontal cortex were chosen for this purpose, as TDP-43–immunoreactive NCIs and DNs are readily identifiable in these regions.30 Figure 2 shows side-by-side comparisons of TDP-O and TDP-43 immunoreactivity. As expected, TDP-O did not stain the native monomeric TDP-43 normally present in the nucleus, but readily highlighted NCIs and DNs (Figs 2–4, arrows). No TDP-O–immunoreactive NIIs were identified. Morphologically, TDP-O–immunoreactive NCIs (TDP-O-NCIs) and DNs (TDP-O-DNs) were indistinguishable from those detected by anti–TDP-43, but they were much fewer in quantity in any given section, indicating that TDP-O epitopes are present only among sub-populations of NCIs and DNs. Our prior validation also ruled out the possibility that TDP-O cross-reacted with other types of amyloid oligomers such as amyloid-β.12

TDP-O Is Most Conspicuous in FTLD-TDP Type C

The widely adopted “harmonized” classification system for FTLD-TDP pathological subtypes is based on the profiles of TDP-43–immunoreactive NCIs and DNs.20 Briefly, type A is characterized by abundant compact round or crescentic NCIs and short, thin neuropil threads, predominantly in superficial cortical layers. Type B has frequent diffuse, granular, or stippled NCIs throughout all cortical layers and few DNs. Type C has many long, swollen DNs and few NCIs in cortex. Type D has many short DNs, lentiform NIIs, and few NCIs found throughout all cortical layers.20 This classification enables a moderate degree of clinicopathological correlation, suggesting relatively distinct pathological mechanisms underlying the 4 subtypes. Interestingly, in our initial 6 cases studied, we noticed that TDP-O–immunoreactive inclusions were more numerous in FTLD-TDP type C cases. Pursuing this initial impression, we expanded our study to include an additional 6 cases. Whereas all 12 cases (100%) of FTLD-TDP type C contained numerous TDP-O–immunoreactive NCIs and DNs in the dentate gyrus, these findings were less frequent in FTLD-TDP type A (50%) and FTLD-TDP type B (67%; Table 2). TDP-O-NCIs were quantified in 15 random microscopic fields, each covering a 0.01mm2 area of the dentate gyrus, amounting to a total area of 0.15mm2 examined for each case. Quantification by the experimenter was blind to the pathological diagnosis for each case. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc analysis showed a significant increase in the number of TDP-O-NCIs found in type C cases as compared to control and types A and B (see Fig 1A). Figure 1B shows the number of TDP-O-NCIs in cases of type A, B, and C where inclusions were found. Figure 1C shows the number of TDP-O-NCIs in relationship to the frequency of TDP-43-NCIs in the dentate granules. The number of TDP-43-NCIs did not correlate with the number of TDP-O-NCIs. The finding of numerous TDP-O-NCIs in type C suggests that abnormal TDP-43 in type C pathology is prone to oligomerization. In the single case of type D,31 a rare genetic subtype associated with VCP mutations, we did not identify TDP-O-NCIs or DNs (see Fig 2D).

Interestingly, 2 of the 15 control cases had minimal TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions, consistent with previous reports on the frequency of abnormal TDP-43 in normal controls. One study showed that 1 case out of 33 controls had TDP-43 inclusions limited to hippocampus and entorhinal cortex,32 and a more recent study showed a 36.4% prevalence of pathologic TDP-43, mostly in the form of neurites, with inclusions being rare in cognitively normal elderly cases.33 Between our 2 cases with TDP-43 inclusions, 1 showed a minimal number of TDP-ONCIs, and the other had none.

We similarly quantified TDP-O-NCIs and TDP-O-DNs in the anterior orbital gyrus, focusing on layer 2, where all FTLD-TDP subtypes show TDP-43 NCIs and DNs (see Fig 3). A total area of 0.45mm2 was examined for each FTLD-TDP case. The number of TDP-O-NCIs found in cortical layer 2 was relatively low and showed no significant difference between the type A, B, and C groups. However, considering that type A is defined by the presence of many TDP-43-NCIs and type C by few TDP-43-NCIs in layer 2 of the anterior orbital gyrus, the increased TDP-O staining in FTLD-TDP type C is clearly apparent. TDP-O stained significantly more DNs in FTLD-TDP type C and were significantly longer than type A and B DNs. We observed that TDP-O-DNs were shorter than TDP-43-DNs, suggesting that oligomers may constitute segments of TDP-43-DNs. These findings suggest that TDP-43 oligomerization is present across the FTLD-TDP spectrum, although it may vary in degree and distribution by subtype.

Variable TDP-O Pathology in Other TDP-43 Proteinopathies

TDP-43 pathology is also found in other common neurodegenerative conditions,1,34–36 especially in the mesial temporal region. Most patients with HS, for example, show abundant TDP-43-NCIs.34,37 To determine whether TDP-43 oligomerization also occurs in non-FTLD pathologies, we examined the hippocampus of 9 cases of HS without FTLD pathology. Interestingly, whereas a large majority (8 of 9) of HS cases had abundant TDP-43-NCIs, none had TDP-O-NCIs (see Table 2 and Fig 4A, B). This observation, together with our findings among FTLD-TDP subtypes, indicates that the abundance of TDP-43-NCIs does not necessarily correspond to a similar abundance of TDP-O-NCIs (see Fig 1C).

ALS is a disease lying on a clinicopathologic spectrum with FTLD. In addition to the 5 cases of FTLD-TDP type B with ALS listed in Table 1, we also examined 5e cases of ALS with no clinical history of dementia. We found that 2 of these 5 cases had TDP-43 inclusions, and both cases had TDP-O-NCIs (see Fig 4C, D). In summary, among our series of 11 cases with ALS (see Table 1), 8 had TDP-43 proteinopathy (ALS-FTLD-TDP), and 5 of these 8 cases (62.5%) had TDP-O inclusions.

TDP-O Show Lysosome-Associated Granular and Tubular Ultrastructural Profiles in NCIs

We next examined TDP-43 oligomers in formalin-fixed, immunoperoxidase-labeled, Araldite-embedded tissue from FTLD-TDP type C cases using immunoelectron microscopy. TDP-43 oligomer immunoperoxidase labeling was first identified in the light microscope prior to electron microscopic study. At the EM level, light to moderate electron dense immunoperoxidase reaction products were found to be associated with neuronal lysosomes, consistent with the detection of NCIs at the light microscopic level (Fig 5). Serial EM section analysis from the same labeled neuron confirmed a cytoplasmic immunolabeling pattern. In some cases, nuclei of immunolabeled neurons appeared to be pushed in and oblong in shape as opposed to the normal rounded shape found in unlabeled (without NCIs) neurons. At higher magnification, electron dense immunoperoxidase reaction products were attached to granular or tubular structures of different sizes, which were approximately 250 to 500nm away from lysosomes, and no immunoperoxidase products were found in the lysosomes. One group of TDP-O–labeled structures appeared to be granular and measured approximately 200nm. Other TDP-O–immunolabeled elements appeared to also be tubular in different sizes with fiber tracts of tubules likely connecting to lysosomes. More diffusely labeled elements were also found in the cytoplasm.

Discussion

Using TDP-O, a well-characterized TDP-43 oligomer-specific antibody,12 we provided the first line of evidence that TDP-43 forms oligomers in the human brain, constituting a part of abnormal TDP-43 inclusions identified in the brains of patients with FTLD-TDP and ALD/MND. This observation, together with our previous finding that TDP-O–immunoprecipitated spherical oligomers from human FTLD-TDP brains could be cross-recognized by anti–TDP-43,12 provides clear evidence supporting formation of amyloid oligomers by TDP-43 in the human brain. TDP-43 oligomers were preferentially present in FTLD-TDP, minimally present in brains of neurologically normal subjects, and absent in HS hippocampi despite concurrent abundance of TDP-43 inclusions. TDP-43 oligomers were particularly abundant in type C, suggesting a predilection toward oligomer formation in this FTLD-TDP subtype.

Currently the histomorphology-based neuropathological subtyping of FTLD-TDP affords relatively specific but not entirely consistent clinicopathological correlations. Type A is associated with progressive nonfluent aphasia and corticobasal syndrome, type B with MND, and type C with semantic dementia; behavioral variant FTD, however, can be associated with any pathological subtype.20 Recently it was proposed that conformational changes of TDP-43 lead to the formation of multiple “strains” that could determine the clinicopathological phenotypes of FTLD-TDP and therefore conformational classification could be useful for more specific subtyping.38 Our consistent findings of abundant TDP-O inclusions in FTLD-TDP type C suggest that a relatively uniform TDP-43 conformational strain determines the pathological manifestations of this subtype. In our series, all type C cases were sporadic, whereas 8 of 13 cases of other FTLD subtypes had a mutation (see Table 1). Therefore, it appears that TDP-O is a shared feature across sporadic and genetic forms of FTLD-TDP.

A sharp contrast can be made with HS, cases of which consistently showed no TDP-O despite having numerous concurrent TDP-43 inclusions. These results suggest a distinct, nonamyloid conformation of TDP-43 aggregates in HS, and perhaps a different pathophysiology. Therefore, our results could aid in further refinement of the classification scheme, which is instrumental for effective design of targeted therapy. Furthermore, it would be interesting to explore whether TDP-O in cerebrospinal fluid or blood samples might serve as a biomarker for FTLD-TDP, especially type C, in prospective studies.

Our results could also help address a long-standing concern about the rather frequent presence of TDP-43 inclusions, sometimes large in quantity, in many non–FTLD-TDP neurodegenerative disorders, such as HS, Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and even diseases in the FTLD-tau group such as Pick disease, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy.38 Because of the frequent “nonspecific” co-occurrence, one may question whether TDP-43 inclusions simply represent a nonspecific marker of neurode-generation. Although a comprehensive survey of all these disorders was not the goal of this study, our finding of the absence of TDP-O inclusions in HS samples supports the conformational heterogeneity of TDP-43 inclusions in different disorders, despite their morphological similarity. Moreover, our results suggest that different “strains” of TDP-43 aggregates may contribute to different neurodegenerative entities. For example, the NCIs seen in HS cases were found to be enriched in phosphorylated TDP-43,37 and it could be speculated that the specific phosphorylation “strain” of TDP-43 in HS brains could prevent oligomerization and assume other conformations. Future studies should address whether the TDP-43 aggregates seen in other non–FTLD-TDP histopathological entities also lack oligomeric TDP-43.

Ultrastructurally, the TDP-O-NCIs appear to be composed of granular and tubular structures. A prior ultrastructural study using postembedding staining by anti-TDP-43 showed morphologically heterogeneous structures, mainly composed of packed straight filaments of slightly different diameters, variably associated with electron-dense granular material.39 In contrast, our study did not find any TDP-O–decorated straight filaments, suggesting that the straight filaments in NCIs are not composed of TDP-43 oligomers or that they may mask the TDP-O epitopes. The ultrastructural localization of TDP-O–immunoreactive structures in the close vicinity of but not within lysosomal structures is somewhat similar to that reported for phosphorylated TDP-43–immunoreactive inclusions found in motor neurons.40 This proximate association with neuronal lysosomes was consistent between individual neurons and rather frequent (see Fig 5); however, its significance awaits further studies. One intriguing possibility is that the TDP-43 oligomers may reside in lysosome-associated autophagosomal elements that are abnormal, showing ill-defined boundaries and seemingly failing to fuse with lysosomes.

The mechanism through which TDP-43 is involved in neuronal degeneration in the frontal, insular, and temporal lobes in FTLD-TDP remains unclear. Perhaps the most significant implication of our results is that FTLD-TDP may be characterized by TDP-43 oligomer formation-dependent neurotoxicity, a mechanism that has been well studied and conceived as a high-priority therapeutic target in several other neurodegenerative disorders.19 Amyloid oligomers made of various amyloidogenic proteins were shown to be highly toxic, much more so than amyloid fibrils. Because TDP-43 oligomers are immunoreactive to A11,12 an antibody recognizing common amyloid oligomer structures,18 current experimental therapies targeting such structures could prove to be useful. Such therapies include active and passive immunotherapies and several small molecules.41 Our results support pursuit of such therapies for types of TDP-43 proteinopathy that are enriched in TDP-43 oligomers, such as FTLD-TDP type C.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-TDP type C cases had significantly more TDP-O-NCIs as compared to controls, FTLD-TDP type A, and FTLD-TDP type B (A). Of the 15 control cases analyzed, only 1 case had a rare finding of an NCI in the dentate layer. The single FTLD-TDP type D case had no TDP-O-NCIs and was excluded from the statistical analysis because n = 1.

Few TDP-O neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs) were found in FTLD-TDP type A (A) and B (B) cases, and frequent inclusions were found in the dentate granule cells of FTLD-TDP type C (C) cases. The FTLDTDP type D case had no TDP-O-NCIs (D). The TDP-43 antibody stained native monomeric TDP-43 normally present in the nucleus and highlighted NCIs in FTLD-TDP types A, B, C, and D (E–H, respectively; see insets).
