Although often unmeasured in studies of cognition, many older adults possess Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologies such as beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, despite being asymptomatic. We were interested in examining whether the behavior-structure relationship observed in later life was altered by the presence of preclinical AD pathology. 511 cognitively unimpaired adults completed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and three attentional control tasks; a subset (n = 396) also underwent Aβ-positron emissions tomography (PET). A vertex-wise model was conducted to spatially represent the relationship between cortical thickness and average attentional control accuracy, while moderation analysis examined whether Aβ deposition impacted this relationship. First, we found that reduced cortical thickness in temporal, medial- and lateral-parietal, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, predicted worse performance on the attention task composite. Subsequent moderation analyses observed that levels of Aβ significantly influence the relationship between cortical thickness and attentional control. Our results support the hypothesis that preclinical AD, as measured by Aβ deposition, is partially driving what would otherwise be considered general aging in a cognitively normal adult population.

pmc1. Introduction

Older adults make up an increasingly large percentage of the population (Alzheimer’s Association, 2019). Advancing age is accompanied by progressive worsening of cognition (Craik &amp; Salthouse, 2011; Harada, Natelson Love, &amp; Triebel, 2013; Johnson, Storandt, Morris, &amp; Galvin, 2009; Park &amp; Gutchess, 2002; Rabbitt, Donlan, Watson, McInnes, &amp; Bent, 1995; Salthouse, 2009, 2010; Singh-Manoux et al., 2012). These age-related differences are most prominent in fluid aspects of intelligence such as episodic memory (Rönnlund, Nyberg, Bäckman, &amp; Nilsson, 2005), attention (Ball, Beard, Roenker, Miller, &amp; Griggs, 1988), working memory (Salthouse, 2010), and inhibition (Darowski, Helder, Zacks, Hasher, &amp; Hambrick, 2008; Wecker, Kramer, Wisniewski, Delis, &amp; Kaplan, 2000). In contrast, crystalized facets of intelligence such as semantic memory and language processing are relatively preserved (Park &amp; Gutchess, 2002; Park &amp; Reuter-Lorenz, 2009; Rabbitt et al., 1995). While overall group trajectories suggest decline, rather than being a ubiquitous effect, the relative preservation and decline of cognition with age is highly heterogeneous (Barter &amp; Foster, 2018). In general, the variability between individuals is greater in older adults than younger adults, suggesting an increasing influence of secondary factors on cognition (Hertzog, Kramer, Wilson, &amp; Lindenberger, 2008). The cause of this variability has been associated with a number of factors including education (Ardila, Ostrosky-Solis, Rosselli, &amp; Gómez, 2000; Sattler, Toro, Schönknecht, &amp; Schröder, 2012), socioeconomic status (Rabbitt et al., 1995), cognitive engagement (Sattler et al., 2012), physical fitness (A. F. Kramer, Colcombe, McAuley, Scalf, &amp; Erickson, 2005), and comorbid diseases such as diabetes (Messier, 2005), vascular disease (Debette et al., 2011), and preclinical Alzheimer Disease (Hassenstab et al., 2016).

In concert to overt declines in cognition, aging is associated with changes in the underlying biological structures of the brain. Analyses of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has provided evidence of grey- and white-matter atrophy (Fjell et al., 2013, 2009; Gordon et al., 2008; Raz, Ghisletta, Rodrigue, Kennedy, &amp; Lindenberger, 2010; Raz et al., 2005), as well as age-related decline in white matter integrity observed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI; (Bennett, Madden, Vaidya, Howard, &amp; Howard, 2010; Madden, Bennett, &amp; Song, 2009; Madden, Spaniol, et al., 2009). In addition, older adults have altered evoked responses measured with event-related potentials (ERPs; (Fabiani &amp; Friedman, 1995; Fabiani et al., 2014), task-based functional MRI (fMRI; (Fabiani et al., 2014; Gordon, Tse, Gratton, &amp; Fabiani, 2014; Milham et al., 2002; Nielson, Langenecker, &amp; Garavan, 2002; Schneider-Garces et al., 2010), as well as resting-state MRI (rsMRI; (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2007; Damoiseaux et al., 2007; Ferreira &amp; Busatto, 2013). As with cognition, although there is an overall negative trend at the population level, there is a high degree in variability with some older adults having well preserved brains (Stewart, Tran, &amp; Cramer, 2014).

Studies examining functional measures find robust associations between altered behavior and disruption in task-evoked fMRI (Cabeza, Anderson, Locantore, &amp; McIntosh, 2002; Gazzaley, Cooney, Rissman, &amp; D’Esposito, 2005; Kennedy et al., 2015; Milham et al., 2002; Persson et al., 2005; Schneider-Garces et al., 2010), as well as ERPs (Daffner et al., 2006; Duarte, Henson, &amp; Graham, 2008; Fabiani, Friedman, &amp; Cheng, 1998). These studies suggest a complicated relationship, as older adults have been reported to have both increased (Langenecker, Nielson, &amp; Rao, 2004) and decreased (Iidaka et al., 2001) activation relative to younger adults. These differences in activation are often tied to task characteristics such as difficulty (Kennedy et al., 2015; Schneider-Garces et al., 2010), and it is unclear whether this activity represents dedifferentiation, compensation, or both (Park &amp; Reuter-Lorenz, 2009). The associations between cognition and brain structure are more straight-forward, with prior work in aging cohorts demonstrating that worse cognitive performance is related to greater atrophy measured with structural MRI (Buckner, 2004; Cardenas et al., 2011; J. H. Kramer et al., 2007; Persson et al., 2005; Rusinek et al., 2003; Vyhnalek et al., 2014) and lower average values of white matter integrity assessed using DTI (Charlton et al., 2006; Jackson, Balota, Duchek, &amp; Head, 2012; Madden, Spaniol, et al., 2009; Voineskos et al., 2012; Walhovd &amp; Fjell, 2007).

The links between behavior and the brain are often interpreted as representing typical, or healthy aging, as participants are cognitively normal. However, upwards of one third of cognitively normal older adults have biomarker evidence of abnormal levels of AD pathology, and this frequency increases with age (Jack et al., 2013; Mishra et al., 2018). The high frequency of preclinical AD suggests that what is interpreted as normal aging may be partially driven by undiagnosed disease processes. Unrecognized preclinical AD leads to an overestimation of age-related differences in grey-matter (Fjell et al., 2010), rsMRI (Brier et al., 2014), and cognition (Harrington et al., 2021; Hassenstab et al., 2016). It may be that much of the shared variance between brain structure and overt behavior in older adult samples are significantly influenced by preclinical AD. While many domains of cognition are impacted by aging and undiagnosed AD pathology (Duchek et al., 2013; Hedden, Oh, Younger, &amp; Patel, 2013), previous work has highlighted that attentional control is a particularly sensitive cognitive measure to such changes (Aschenbrenner, Balota, Fagan, et al., 2015; Balota et al., 2010; Duchek et al., 2013; Gordon et al., 2015). Attentional control encompasses the ability to direct attention toward relevant stimuli while filtering out irrelevant stimuli and has a clear link to memory processing (Balota &amp; Duchek, 2015). A recent meta-analysis suggested that despite strong evidence that attentional control is able to differentiate healthy aging from those with preclinical AD, very few studies of this cohort include these measures (Hedden et al., 2013).

In the current work we examined behavioral performance on three different cognitive tasks that require attentional control in both middle- and older-aged participants. Our motivation for using this measure was driven by previous work that has highlighted attentional control as a sensitive measure of preclinical AD pathology (Aschenbrenner, Balota, Fagan, et al., 2015; Aschenbrenner, Balota, Tse, et al., 2015; Hassenstab et al., 2016; Mishra et al., 2017; Monsell et al., 2014). Given its sensitivity to subtle cognitive change related to preclinical AD, we propose that attentional control is an important measure for understanding the contribution of unrecognized disease processes in otherwise healthy adults. Primarily, we were interested in assessing whether variability in behavioral performance on these tasks was related to measures of cortical thickness. Given the previous work outlined above, we hypothesized that individuals with worse attentional control ability would have associated lower cortical thickness values. Finally, we were also interested in exploring how much of the relationship between behavior and structure could be accounted for by the presence of preclinical AD pathology; namely Aβ deposition. To this end we employed a moderation approach to model the impact of Aβ on the relationship between cognition and cortical thickness.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants

Data was acquired from 511 healthy middle- and older-aged adults (50-96 years old) who were enrolled in longitudinal Memory and Aging studies at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) at Washington University in St. Louis. In order to be considered for these analyses, individuals were required to have a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR ©) of 0 indicating that they were cognitively unimpaired (Morris, 1993), an T1-weighted MRI scan, and have completed a cognitive battery. Importantly, in the context of CDR, cognitively unimpaired refers to a participant being non-demented, and it is still possible for them to have some non-specific cognitive impairment. These clinical and MRI assessments were required to have been completed within one year of each other. A total of 396 participants also had either PiB-PET or florbetapir-PET scans within a year of their MRIs that was used in additional analyses aiming to investigate the impact of Aβ deposition. Demographics for the full sample, and the Aβ-PET sub-sample, are provided in Table 1.

2.2. Cognitive Tasks of Interest

Individuals completed a series of cognitive tasks that were designed to measure attentional control as part of the Knight ADRC Memory and Aging studies. The three tasks completed were: the Stroop (Spieler, Balota, &amp; Faust, 1996), Simon (Castel, Balota, Hutchison, Logan, &amp; Yap, 2007), and Consonant-Vowel Odd-Even (CVOE; (Huff, Balota, Minear, Aschenbrenner, &amp; Duchek, 2015) tasks. For participants to be eligible to be included, they must have completed at least two of the three tasks of interest. There are 15 individuals included in our analyses who did not complete all three tasks (9 failed to complete the CVOE task and 6 failed to complete the Simon task).

2.2.1. The Stroop Task.

A color-naming version of the Stroop task was conducted, where participants were asked to verbally name the color of the text for each word presented to them. In total, participants were shown 36 congruent, 36 incongruent, and 32 neutral words. Congruent stimuli were color words (“blue”, “green”, “red”, “yellow”) presented in their corresponding colors, while incongruent stimuli were the same color words present in non-matching colored text. Finally, the neutral stimuli were four non-color words (“deep”, “bad”, “poor”, “legal”) presented in one of the four colors.

2.2.2. The Simon Task.

The Simon task consists of participants being presented arrow stimuli and responding with whether the arrow is pointing left or right, via a button press. 120 arrow stimuli were presented, 40 were congruent with the arrow on the same side of the screen as it was pointing, 40 were incongruent with the arrow on the opposite side of the screen as it was pointing, and 40 were neutral stimuli where arrows were centered on the screen.

2.2.3. The CVOE Task.

The CVOE task consists of participants being presented with letter-number pairs, and being instructed to either classify the letter as a vowel or consonant, or the number as odd-even. The CVOE task was presented in three blocks, the first was a letter judgment block, where individuals were asked to only consider the letter stimuli, while the second was a number judgment block, where they would only consider the number stimuli. However, the third block consisted of both letter and number judgment trials. In this third block, participants were cued for each of these judgment types prior to the presentation of the letter-number pair stimuli. These cues alternated runs of 2 trials for each classification type, resulting in a total of 30 trials where participants switched between classifications, and 30 non-switch trials where they did not switch classifications between trials.

2.2.4. Attentional Control Composite Score.

An attentional control composite was derived following the method outlined in Aschenbrenner et al. (2015). Only accuracy on the incongruent trials for the Stroop and Simon tasks, and the switch block of the CVOE task, were considered, given these trials place the highest demands on attentional processing. After standardizing each participant’s raw score on each task to the mean and standard deviation of the entire cohort, z-scores for each individual were then averaged together to form their composite score (see supplemental material). This score was the input cognition value for subsequent analyses. For those who had only completed two of the three tasks, composite scores were computed as an average of the z-scores for the two tasks they had completed. In all cases, higher attentional control composite score indicates a more accurate performance, and thus greater attentional control.

2.3. MRI Acquisition and Processing

MRI images were acquired on either a Siemens Biograph mMR (n = 92), or Siemens Magnetom Trio (n = 419) 3T scanner. Anatomical scans were collected with a T1-weighted magnetized prepared rapidly acquired gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence. Images were collected in a sagittal orientation with the following parameters: TE = 16 ms, TR = 2400 ms, matrix = 256 x 256 mm, Flip angle = 8, slices = 176, thickness = 1 mm, resolution = 1 x 1 x 1 mm. Data were processed using FreeSurfer v.5.3 (Woolrich et al., 2009).

Briefly, images were corrected for any common artifacts (Reuter, Rosas, &amp; Fischl, 2010), then watershed and surface deformation procedures were used to remove the brain from the skull within the image (Ségonne et al., 2004). Images were then registered to MNI space in order for subcortical white and grey matter structures to be segmented (Fischl et al., 2002, 2004). A tessellation step was then employed to estimate the grey and white matter structural boundary, and apply any necessary topological correction (Fischl, Liu, &amp; Dale, 2001; Ségonne, Pacheco, &amp; Fischl, 2007). All intersurface boundaries (white matter-grey matter, grey matter-cerebral spinal fluid) were placed in their optimal locations using surface normalization and intensity gradients (Dale, Fischl, &amp; Sereno, 1999; Dale &amp; Sereno, 1993; Fischl &amp; Dale, 2000). Finally, images underwent surface inflation and registration to a spherical atlas (Fischl, Sereno, &amp; Dale, 1999). All images were manually inspected by a group of annually trained raters within our center. Any FreeSurfer output images requiring manual edits were corrected and the processing was rerun to ensure consistency across all scans. Up to three attempts are made to fix FreeSurfer errors that persist after editing. If errors continue to persist after the third attempt the FreeSurfer will be considered to have failed quality control. The resulting cortical thickness measures, defined as the distance from the grey-white matter boundary to the pial boundary, were collected from these processed images and used in subsequent analyses. The resulting data included regions of interest defined using the Desikan atlas used for processing of the PET data as well as vertex-wise cortical thickness measures.

2.4. PET Acquisition and Processing

Aβ PET images were acquired on a Siemens Biograph 40 PET-CT scanner. PET scans were completed using one of two different tracers: 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB; n = 301) or 18F-florbetapir (florbetapir; n = 95). Each participant received a single intravenous bolus of between 3.6 and 19.9 mCi of PiB or between 7.8 and 11.3 mCi of florbetapir (see supplemental material). PET data was analyzed using the PET Unified Pipeline (PUP; https://github.com/ysu001/PUP; (Su et al., 2013). The pipeline calculates a standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) for each FreeSurfer ROI, with a partial volume correction (PVC) procedure adjusting for regional spill by using calculated regional spread functions implemented geometric transfer matrix approach (Rousset, Collins, Rahmim, &amp; Wong, 2008; Su et al., 2015). Data collected for 30 minutes after a 30-minute post-injection delay for PiB and for 20 minutes after a 50-minute post-injection delay for florbetapir were converted to SUVrs using the cerebellar grey as a reference. Aβ PET positivity from the PiB tracer was defined as a summary composite SUVr of 1.42 for PiB (Brier et al., 2016; Su et al., 2013)while, an equivalent florbetapir threshold of 1.22 was defined by a linear regression of 100 individuals who had both florbetapir and PiB imaging (Mishra et al., 2017). To standardize the PiB and florbetapir tracers, the values were converted into centiloid units (Klunk et al., 2015) using a linear transformation from previously defined equations (Su et al., 2018, 2019). The value of zero on the centiloid scale represents the mean amyloid burden for healthy participants and the value of 100 on the centiloid scale represents the mean amyloid burden for AD participants.

2.5. Statistical Analyses

To examine the association between attentional control and cortical thickness, we performed a vertex-wise group analysis using the general linear model function (mri_glmfit) of the FreeSurfer suite. The attentional control composite z-score was set as the primary predictor of interest, and sex and age were included as covariates. Significance was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation with a p &lt; 0.005 vertex-wise threshold and a p &lt; 0.05 cluster-wise threshold. Analyses were performed separately for the left and right hemispheres. Significant clusters identified from the vertex-wise analyses were binarized and combined into one cortical mask per hemisphere. Cortical thickness was extracted from these two masks, and then a weighted average based on the number of vertices was calculated to provide one summary cortical thickness value per individual. This summary measure was used for visual illustration as well as subsequent analyses.

To explore the moderating influence of amyloid on the relationship between cortical thickness and attentional control, a series of linear regression models were run. First, using the full cohort, a linear regression model was used to assess attentional control score using cortical thickness as a predictor and age and gender as covariates. To assess whether there was a moderating influence of amyloid on this relationship, a second model was implemented in the Aβ Subset. For this model centiloid was included as a main predictor and an interaction term consisting of centiloid and cortical thickness was also added. Estimated marginal means and simple slope analyses were conducted to quantify the moderating influence of centiloid. All analyses were performed in R (version 4.6.3; (R Core Team, 2019).

3. Results

Demographic information for the full- and Aβ- cohorts are represented in Table 1, while Table 2 depicts the average raw- and z-scored accuracy rates for the cognitive variables of interest.

3.1. Cortical Thickness Regions of Interest

Vertex-wise analyses identified 19 significant clusters (p &lt; 0.05), 8 in the right- and 11 in the left-hemisphere. These clusters represent regions where there was a significant association between the attentional control composite score and cortical thickness (Figure 1). The relationship was such that higher cognitive performance related to greater cortical thickness. In the left hemisphere, regions highlighted by this analysis included the middle and inferior temporal regions, supramarginal gyrus, middle frontal region, orbitofrontal region, cingulate gyrus, and precuneus. In the right hemisphere these regions included the superior, middle, and inferior temporal regions, inferior parietal region, pars opercularis, lingual gyrus, and precuneus (see supplemental material for a full table of FreeSurfer regions underlying these significant clusters). These regions were used to create a binarized mask using a threshold of p &lt; 0.05. The resulting binarized masks were used to extract mean cortical thickness values that were used as the thickness measure input for subsequent analyses and plots.

3.2. Cortical Thickness and Attention

First, a simple linear regression with attentional control composite score as the dependent variable and cortical thickness as the independent variable was performed to quantify the relationship between these variables of interest. After accounting for age, sex, and education, we found cortical thickness significantly predicted attentional composite scores in middle- and older-adults (B = 1.95, CI = [1.5:2.4], p &lt; 0.001; R2 = 0.19, F(4,495) = 29.73, p &lt; 0.001; Figure 2A).

Given the similarity between the spatial patterns observed in our analysis, and those observed in other AD studies (Mintun et al., 2006; Mishra et al., 2018), as well as the strong relationship between cortical thickness and attention composite score, we were motivated to explore whether amyloid accumulation influenced the relationship between these variables. Therefore, we repeated our initial analyses in a subset of individuals with Aβ PET data. Here, we similarly found a strong relationship between cortical thickness and attentional composite score (B = 1.70, CI = [1.2:2.2], p &lt; 0.001; R2 = 0.18, F(4,386) = 21.77, p &lt; 0.001). We subsequently added centiloid into our model as an additional predictor and again found that cortical thickness significantly predicted attentional composite score (B = 1.55, CI = [1.1:2.0], p &lt; 0.001), as well as a strong relationship between centiloid and attentional composite score (B = −0.003, CI = [−0.006:−0.002], p &lt; 0.001; R2 = 0.21, F(5,385) = 20.27, p &lt; 0.001; Figure 2B). Finally, the addition of an interaction term concerning centiloid and cortical thickness revealed that these two variables significantly interact to predict overall attentional composite scores (B = 0.018, CI = [0.0019:0.0343], p &lt; 0.05; R2 = 0.22, F(6,384) = 17.86, p &lt; 0.05).

Given this significant interaction, we were interested in quantifying the moderating impact of Aβ deposition on the relationship between cortical thickness and attentional control. Using our established interaction model, we predicted the estimated marginal means for attentional control composite scores associated with different cortical thicknesses, across different levels of Aβ burden (see Table 3). We found that greatest reductions in estimated attentional control composite score were present for individuals with lowest cortical thickness measures, particularly in those with high Aβ burden (estimate = −0.326, CI: −0.434: −0.218), while those with the largest cortical thickness measures and lowest Aβ burden had the highest estimates of attentional composite (estimate = 0.277, CI: 0.165: 0.390).

In order to formally test the association between attentional control composite and cortical thickness at different levels of Aβ burden, we conducted simple slope analyses. We used 1 standard deviation below and above the mean for our low and high (respectively) input values of cortical thickness and centiloid. Using this approach, we found that the slopes describing the relationship between attentional control and cortical thickness do significantly differ as a function of Aβ burden (t (385) = −2.46, p &lt; 0.05; Figure 3). All models discussed above are summarized in Table 4.

4. Discussion

As the world population ages, it is critical that we better understand overt behavioral declines occurring in older adult populations as well as the biological properties in the brain driving these age-related changes. We found robust associations in our vertex-wise analysis where lower cortical thickness in temporal, parietal, and frontal regions predicted worse scores using our attentional composite derived from the most difficult trials from the CVOE, Stroop, and Simon tasks. Importantly, in a subset of the cohort with Aβ-PET imaging, moderation analyses found that this brain-behavior relationship was influenced by the extent of Aβ deposition, although the relationship between cortical thickness and attention was still robust beyond the effects of Aβ.

In the current work thinner cortices throughout the temporal lobe, precuneus, lateral parietal regions, as well as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex predicted worse performance on the attentional composite. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as dorsal parietal regions, are regions where attentional control is tied to greater activation seen using task-based functional MRI (fMRI; (Banich et al., 2000; Gordon et al., 2015; Langenecker et al., 2004; Milham et al., 2002), and these regions are often grouped together into the same functional network using rsMRI (Gratton et al., 2018; Power et al., 2011; Schaefer et al., 2018; Seitzman et al., 2020). These converging results are encouraging as it suggests that our observed relation between cortical thickness across this network and cognitive performance are in line with previous work.

The most prominent associations in the vertex-wise analysis were temporal, lateral parietal, and medial parietal regions, which are parts of the default mode network (Gratton et al., 2018; Power et al., 2011; Raichle &amp; Snyder, 2007). The DMN is typically inhibited during demanding cognitive tasks (Anticevic et al., 2012; Anticevic, Repovs, Shulman, &amp; Barch, 2010; Gordon et al., 2015; Lustig et al., 2003) and successful suppression may help reduce distraction and support goal-directed cognition; the degree of inhibition often positively predicts task performance (Anticevic et al., 2012; Christoff, Keramatian, Gordon, Smith, &amp; Mädler, 2009). These regions show some of the greatest levels of atrophy tied to aging (Fjell et al., 2014, 2009; Raz et al., 2005; Rodrigue &amp; Raz, 2004) and in the context of AD these regions show the greatest levels of Aβ accumulation (Forsberg et al., 2008; Gordon, Blazey, et al., 2018; Klunk, Engler, &amp; Nordberg, 2004; La Joie et al., 2012; Wolk &amp; Klunk, 2009), tau deposition (Brier et al., 2016; Gordon et al., 2016), hypometabolism (Chételat et al., 2008; Edison et al., 2007; Gordon, Blazey, et al., 2018; La Joie et al., 2012) and atrophy (Gordon, McCullough, et al., 2018; La Joie et al., 2012).

Given the overlap between the regions identified in our vertex-wise analyses and the known presentation of AD pathology, we were interested in quantifying the impact preclinical AD might have on this structure-behavior relationship. We conducted a moderation analysis using Aβ deposition measured using PET as the moderating variable. When adding Aβ to our linear model, we found a modest attenuation in the relationship between cortical thickness and accuracy. Formal simple slope analysis revealed a significant moderation effect, where individuals with higher Aβ deposition were observed to have lower attentional control scores at independent of their cortical thickness. These results confirmed our hypothesis that at least some of the shared variance between structure and function was due to underlying preclinical AD. The degree of this moderation indicates that AD pathology accounts for an important portion of this relationship, and that variability across cognitively normal aging adults may partially reflect undetected preclinical AD pathology. Other factors such as cardiovascular health, obesity, education, and socioeconomic status are all known to impact the health of the brain (Fotenos, Mintun, Snyder, Morris, &amp; Buckner, 2008; Gordon et al., 2008; Hillman, Erickson, &amp; Kramer, 2008; Ho et al., 2011; Raji et al., 2010), and may be contributing to age-related differences in both behavior and brain structure.

Our results are in line with prior work suggesting that the unrecognized presence of preclinical AD could influence measures of brain volume, rsMRI connectivity, and cognition in aging adult populations (Brier et al., 2014; Fjell et al., 2010; Hassenstab et al., 2016). For example, Harrington et al. (2020; 2018), recently reported that the presence of Aβ in otherwise healthy adults influenced performance on verbal and working memory, even when these measures would otherwise remain stable. This suggests that Aβ might be biasing estimates of age-related cognitive decline in otherwise healthy adults. This is particularly important because post-mortem studies have estimated that between 60-98% of adults aged 60 years and older have some evidence of AD pathology at death (Monsell et al., 2014). In terms of the current cohort, we found that a quarter of individuals had abnormal levels of Aβ, which is consistent with prior publications examining the frequency of amyloidosis in vivo (Jack et al., 2017). A second implication of our work is that attentional control is a behavioral measure that is sensitive to the presence of preclinical AD pathology and therefore should be studied in addition to memory-based measures.

It is important to consider the relative strengths and weaknesses of the current study. A major strength is that our analyses utilized a large, well characterized adult cohort. Additionally, by drawing participants from studies of AD we were able to incorporate clinical examinations to exclude any individuals with any clinical diagnosis of mild dementia, ensuring we only analyzed individuals considered to be unimpaired. Another major advantage of using this cohort, was that it allowed us to include a subset of individuals with Aβ PET images. While Aβ PET is an established highly sensitive measure of amyloidosis, it is costly and typically constrained to major medical centers. Despite these advantages, our analyses are limited in their ability to address the question of whether this influence of Aβ is regionally dependent. There is currently no accepted approach to harmonize tracers at a regional level, and we therefore were restricted to uses global Centiloid units instead. A further major limitation of our analyses is that our research a priori focused on attentional control based upon prior work in our cohort (Aschenbrenner, Balota, Fagan, et al., 2015; Balota et al., 2010; Gordon et al., 2015), and therefore, may not be representative of the relationship between brain structure, Aβ deposition, and general cognition. Our decision to focus on attentional control was motivated by prior work showing attention is more sensitive to preclinical AD, compared to other memory domains (Aschenbrenner, Balota, Fagan, et al., 2015; Balota et al., 2010; Duchek et al., 2013; Twamley, Ropacki, &amp; Bondi, 2006), as well as a meta-analysis highlighting that despite this strong relationship very few studies include measures of attentional control (Hedden et al., 2013). Within the Knight ADRC studies, attentional control metrics are also least impacted by changes in cognitive batteries across the many years the center has been collecting data, allowing us to maximize our sample size and power.

Future iterations of this work should consider plasma measures of Aβ, which have shown good concordance with PET (Risacher et al., 2019; Schindler et al., 2019); and as such represent a way to cheaply and efficiently incorporate AD biomarkers in studies of healthy aging. Furthermore, PET and plasma measures of tau are of particular interest for us to pursue in similar analyses once they become widely available within our cohort. Given recent work highlighting the important of vascular health for cognition and brain health, inclusion of vascular health indicators is a further future direction for these analyses. In the upcoming years, an important direction for our center is to continue these analyses in the sub-population of individuals who have completed PET, MRI, and cognitive testing at multiple time points, allowing for longitudinal analyses to reveal how these relationships might change across time within an individual. Finally, it would be of high interest to extend these analyses to look at other cognitive processes, once equating of the heterogeneous forms of the memory and processing speed tasks at the Knight ADRC are complete.

Overall, the current study helps us better characterize the relationship of brain structure and behavior present in middle- and older-aged adult populations. We demonstrated a robust relationship between cortical thickness in areas previously implicated in attentional control, to accuracy on conflict trials in the Stroop, Simon, and CVOE tasks. Through subsequent linear models and a moderation analysis, we also found that Aβ deposition levels significantly moderates the relationship between cortical thinning and poor attentional control. Ultimately, these results show that preclinical AD is partially driving what would otherwise be considered advanced aging in a cognitively normal adult population.

A: Effect sizes are depicted on a scale of red-blue in order to show the whole-brain relationship between our two variables. B: Only statistically significant vertices are depicted in yellow and were binarized to create a region of interest mask that was used as our MRI variable in further analyses. In all cases, age and sex were used as covariates.

Figure 2. Scatterplots representing the relationship between attentional composite score and cortical thickness measured within the region of interest mask. Plot A depicts data for all individuals, while in plot B, only the subset of individuals who completed PET scans is displayed. Here, color represents the level of amyloid present with dark blue highlighting higher amyloid accumulation. Shape depicts the tracer used for the PET scan.

Figure 3. Graphical representation capturing how the relationship between attentional control and cortical thickness changes as a function of deposited amyloid. Those with at least one standard deviation above the mean level of amyloid (yellow) show a steeper negative relationship between these variables compared to those with average amyloid (red) or at least one standard deviation below the mean level of amyloid (blue).
