OBJECTIVE:

Public health recommendations promote social engagement to reduce risk of cognitive decline and dementia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal associations of social engagement and cognition in cognitively normal older adults with varying levels of neocortical amyloid-β, the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathologic marker.

METHODS:

217 men and women, age 63–89 underwent assessments for social engagement and cognitive performance at baseline and 3 years later using the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors questionnaire and the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC). Amyloid-β was measured using Pittsburgh Compound B-PET. Multivariable regression models estimated main and interactive effects of baseline social engagement and amyloid-β on cognitive change. Reciprocal models estimated main and interactive effects of baseline cognitive performance and amyloid-β on change in social engagement.

RESULTS:

Baseline social engagement was associated with PACC change as a modifier but not as a main effect. Lower baseline social engagement was associated with greater amyloid-β-related PACC decline while higher baseline social engagement was associated with relative preservation of PACC scores (β=0.05, p=0.03). Reciprocally, lower baseline PACC score was associated with decline in social engagement score (β=1.1, p=0.02). This association was not modified by amyloid-β and there was no direct association of amyloid-β with change in social engagement.

CONCLUSIONS:

Low social engagement may be a marker of neurocognitive vulnerability in older adults who are cognitively normal but have evidence of AD pathophysiologic change. Understanding changes in social engagement in older adults may lead to earlier diagnosis of AD and advances in evidence-based prevention and treatment.

INTRODUCTION

Social relationships are integral to healthy aging. Successful aging relies on the ability to engage with others and access sources of emotional and tangible support(1,2). Social engagement is a term that describes time spent with friends and family and in other social, religious or community-based activities(3). While there appears to be wide inter-individual variability in levels and rates of change in social engagement in older adults(2,4), low social engagement(3,5–7) and decline in social engagement(4,8) have been associated with worsening cognition, increased risk of dementia, and earlier mortality.

Low social engagement is widely recognized as a behavioral risk factor for cognitive impairment (9). Stronger social networks are understood to have broad effects on health by providing access to social support, by promoting self-efficacy and healthy behaviors, and by reducing psychological and physiological stress (10). It has also been proposed that higher social engagement may help preserve cognitive function by contributing to increased mental stimulation and the maintenance, efficiency and capacity of neural networks(5,11).

By comparison, there has been little research examining the reverse association of cognitive function and change in social engagement or the possibility that cognitive abilities and social function may be reciprocally-related in aging and in pathological processes such as early Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

AD is a decades-long biologic process defined by the accumulation of cerebral amyloid-β and tau pathologies leading to progressive cognitive and functional impairment (12). Recent positron emission tomography (PET) studies utilizing amyloid-β and tau-specific tracers have revealed new insights into the pathogenesis and natural history of early AD (13–15). These studies provide evidence that biologically affected individuals may experience subtle, disease related cognitive and neurobehavioral changes prior to the onset of overt cognitive and functional impairment, a period often referred to as the “preclinical” stage of AD(16). It is important to develop a clear understanding of these transitional cognitive and neurobehavioral changes and their relationship to AD biological markers in order to develop sensitive screening procedures and evidence-based interventions for these older adults who are at high risk of progression to cognitive impairment.

Using clinical and biomarker data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, we investigated longitudinal changes in both social engagement and cognitive function in a sample of carefully defined cognitively normal older adults who also underwent imaging assessments for brain amyloid-β deposition. We aimed to determine whether lower social engagement, higher amyloid-β or their interaction predicted poorer cognitive function over 3 years and, reciprocally, whether lower cognitive function, higher amyloid-β or their interaction predicted declines in social engagement over the same period. We hypothesized that declines in social engagement and in cognitive function are both transitional changes during the preclinical stage of AD, that they would be reciprocally associated, and that these associations would be modified by level of amyloid-β deposition.

MATERIALS and METHODS

Participants

Data were derived from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a longitudinal observational study of cognitively normal older adults aimed at defining the earliest clinical and neurobiological changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in order to inform the design and analytic strategies for AD prevention clinical trials(14). The sample was comprised of 217 community-dwelling, English-speaking, men and women ages 63 to 89 years, who were cognitively normal at enrollment based on a Clinical Dementia Rating (17) global score of 0 and normal education-adjusted performance on the Wechsler Logical Memory delayed recall subtest (18) and Mini-Mental State Examination(19). All participants were free from major psychiatric disorders and scored below the threshold value for mild depression on the Geriatric Depression Scale(20) at the beginning of the study. For further description of the cohort, see Supplemental Digital content, available online.

The Partners Human Research Committee approved this study, and all participants provided written informed consent.

Clinical Measures

Assessment of Social Engagement

Social engagement was assessed at baseline (Y1) and three years later (Y4) using five questions from the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire that asks participants to rate the amount of time per week spent in five types of social activities(21,22). The questionnaire asks: In a typical week during the past 4 weeks, did you…1) Visit with friends or family (other than those you live with)? 2) Go to the senior center? 3) Do volunteer work? 4) Attend church or take part in church activities? 5) Attend other club or group meetings? Non-endorsed responses were scored 0. For affirmative responses, participants rated time engaged in each activity per week based on six ordinal categories: “Less than 1 hour”, “1–2.5 hours”, “3–4.5 hours”, “5–6.5 hours”, “7–8.5 hours”, or “9 or more hours” (item scores 1–6). A social engagement total score was calculated as the sum of item scores (range 0–30). The social engagement change score was calculated as the difference between Y4 and Y1 social engagement total scores, with negative change indicating decline in social engagement. Social engagement ratings were completed in a blinded fashion with regard to other assessments and procedures.

Assessment of Cognitive Function

Cognitive performance was evaluated using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC), a set of neuropsychological tests assessing episodic memory, timed executive function, and global cognition. The PACC score was computed as the mean z score from the Logical Memory Delayed Recall (18), MMSE (19), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Digit Symbol coding (23), and the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (24,25). Change in PACC score was calculated by computing the difference between scores at Y4 and Y1. Annual PACC scores for Y1 through Y4 were included as outcome measures for a secondary linear mixed model.

Assessment of Other Covariates

Self-reported depression was calculated as the total score from the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)(20) (item score: 0–1; total score: 0–30; higher score indicating greater severity). Participants were classified by marital status as married or non-married. Cardiovascular disease risk (CVD) score was assessed as a marker of vascular health that could influence cognitive performance as previously described (26,27) (see Text, Supplemental Digital Content online).

Pittsburgh Compound-B Positron Emission Tomography

Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB)-PET imaging data were acquired and Aβ deposition was measured following established protocols at the Massachusetts General Hospital PET facility (13,28). PiB retention was expressed as a distribution volume ratio (DVR)(29) using a gray matter cerebellum reference region, and applying a Geometrical Transfer Matrix partial volume-correction (PVC) (30). Neocortical amyloid-β deposition was quantified using an aggregate PVC DVR from a set of FreeSurfer regions including frontal, lateral parietal, lateral temporal, and retrosplenial cortices (FLR) (28). Dichotomous high and low PiB groups were previously defined using Gaussian mixture modeling resulting in a threshold value &gt;1.32 for the high PiB group (31). A continuous measure of PiB binding was used in the main analyses.

Statistical Analyses

Unadjusted associations between baseline values for PACC, Social Engagement, PiB and demographic and clinical variables (age, sex, married/unmarried status, years of education, GDS) were tested using Pearson’s correlation, paired sample and Welch’s t-tests, and linear regression.

Multiple linear regression models examined the reciprocal associations of social engagement and PACC and whether these associations were modified by PiB binding. In the first series of models, we examined the separate main effects of baseline social engagement score and PiB binding on PACC change (Models 1a and 1b), and then the multiplicative interaction of social engagement score and PiB binding on PACC change (Model 1c). For each of these three models, covariates included baseline PACC score, age, sex, years of education, and GDS. In a second, reciprocal series of models, we examined the separate main effects of baseline PACC score and PiB binding on change in social engagement (Model 2a and 2b) as well as the multiplicative interaction of baseline PACC score and PiB binding on change in social engagement (Model 2c). Series 2 models were adjusted for baseline social engagement score, age, sex, years of education and GDS.

Additional secondary models tested whether the inclusion of other possible explanatory variables (marital status or baseline CVD score) impacted the associations observed in the main models.

To test the robustness of findings from the first series of models investigating PACC change, we repeated the final interaction model to estimate yearly PACC scores from Y1 to Y4, rather than the PACC change score, using a linear mixed effects model including a random intercept for each participant, and adjusting for age, sex, education, and GDS as in the earlier model. A similar secondary model estimating social engagement change was not possible as the CHAMPS questionnaire was administered only at Y1 and Y4.

Post-hoc models adjusting for medical, psychiatric and health related factors or for non-social physical activities (PA) or cognitively stimulating activities (CSA) are described in the Supplemental Digital content.

For all linear regression models, we report unstandardized coefficient estimates (β), with standard error of the mean (SEM), F-statistic with degrees of freedom (df), significance test results (p-values), and effect size (Cohen’s f), as well as percent variance accounted for by the full model adjusted for degrees of freedom (adjusted R2). Residual-vs-fits plots, normality plots and variance inflation factors were evaluated for each variable and model to ensure that distributions reasonably satisfied model assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity.

All statistical analyses were performed using R software (R, version 3.5.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

RESULTS

Baseline demographic, clinical and imaging data for the sample are shown in Table 1.

Unadjusted correlations of baseline variables indicated that better baseline PACC performance was associated with younger age [r(215)=−0.3, p&lt;0.001], more education [r(215)=0.3, p&lt;0.001], and lower CVD score [r(164)=−0.2, p=0.008]. Correlations of baseline PACC with social engagement, PiB, and GDS were not significant [social engagement r(215)=−0.08, p=0.3; PiB r(213)=−0.07, p=0.3; GDS r(215)=−0.1, p= 0.1]. There were no differences in baseline PACC by marital status [t(182)=0.5, p=0.6] or sex [t(201)=0.9, p=0.4].

At baseline, higher social engagement score was significantly correlated with lower depression [r(215)= −0.2, p=0.01], higher PiB [r(213)=0.2, p=0.02] and lower CVD score [r(164)= −0.2, p=0.04] but not age or education [age r(215)=0.06, p=0.4; education r(215)=0.005, p=0.9]. Baseline social engagement was higher in women compared to men [t(197)=3.6, p=0.0004] and in non-married compared to married participants [t(178)=3.5, p=0.0005].

Predicting Cognitive Change

In the whole sample, longitudinal PACC scores increased significantly from a mean z-score of 0.07 (SD=0.60) at Y1 to 0.17 (SD=0.77) at Y4 [t(216) =−2.5, p=0.01]. Mean change in PACC z-score was 0.20 (SD=0.50) in the low PiB group and −0.14 (SD=0.66) in the high PiB group, a significant difference [t(91)=3.4, p&lt;0.001].

In the first model, the main effect of baseline social engagement score was not significantly associated with PACC change adjusting for baseline PACC score, age, sex, education, and GDS (see Table S1, Model 1a, Supplemental Digital Content online). Higher baseline PACC score and greater age were associated with decline in PACC score in this model (Table S1, Model 1a). Higher PiB (as a continuous measure) was associated with decline in PACC score in the second model (Table S1, Model 1b), consistent with prior findings(25). Greater age and higher baseline PACC score were also significantly associated with decline in PACC score as in the first model (Table S1, Model 1b).

When examining the interaction of these two main terms, we found that decline in PACC score was greater at lower levels of social engagement and higher levels of PiB (Table 2, Model 1c; Figure 1). This finding was reproduced using a mixed effects approach to estimate yearly PACC scores, adjusting for the same covariates and a random intercept for each participant (see Table S2, Supplemental Digital Content online).

Predicting Change in Social Engagement

In the full sample, mean social engagement score declined significantly from 8.48 (SD=4.47) at baseline to 7.62 (SD=4.36) at Y4 [t(216)=2.99, p=0.003]. Mean change in social engagement score was −0.49 (SD=4.4) in the low PiB group and −1.78 (SD=3.7) in the high PiB group, a significant difference [t(135)=2.2, p=0.03] (Figure 2). The unadjusted association of PiB as a continuous measure was marginally associated with change in social engagement [β=−1.37, p=0.07, F(1, 213)=3.3].

Lower baseline PACC score was associated with decline in social engagement score adjusting for all covariates (Table 2, Model 2a; Figure 3a). There was no significant association of baseline PiB with change in social engagement score, adjusting for the same covariates. (Table S1, Model 2b; Figure 3b).

In the final model in this series, the interaction of PiB and baseline PACC was not significantly associated with change in social engagement (Table 2, Model 2c).

Predicting Change in Cognition or Social Engagement adjusting for Marital Status or Cardiovascular Risk Score

The social engagement-PiB interaction was significantly associated with PACC change when either marital status or cardiovascular risk score was included as an additional covariate in the final model [for interaction, β=0.049, F(1,205)=5.4, p=0.02, adjusted for all covariates and marital status; for interaction, β=0.051, F(1,154)=4.7, p=0.03, adjusted for all covariates and CVD score]. Similarly, in the reciprocal model, the association of low baseline PACC score with decline in social engagement remained significant after additional adjustment for marital status [for baseline PACC, β=1.1, F(1,209)=12.1, p=0.01] or after adjustment for cardiovascular risk [for baseline PACC, β=1.4, F(1,158)=12.5, p=0.009].

Post-hoc Models adjusting for Medical, Psychiatric and Health Factors or Non-Social Physical Activities or Cognitively Stimulating Activities

None of the medical or psychiatric conditions or other health-related factors impacted the association of the PiB-social engagement interaction with PACC change or the association of baseline PACC with change in social engagement (see Results, Supplemental Digital Content online). These variables included lifetime history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction/cardiac bypass surgery, cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack, hearing loss, depressive disorder or alcohol abuse, current antidepressant medication use and current alcohol use. Neither the PiB-PA interaction nor the PiB-CSA interaction were significantly associated with PACC change and neither of these interactions as a covariate impacted the association of the PiB-social engagement interaction with PACC change (see Results, Supplemental Digital Content online).

DISCUSSION

The purpose of this study was to evaluate longitudinal changes in social engagement and cognitive function in a sample of cognitively normal older adults with varying levels of amyloid-β pathology. First, we found that lower baseline social engagement was associated with greater amyloid-β-related decline while higher baseline social engagement was associated with relative preservation of cognitive function. We did not find a main effect of social engagement on longitudinal cognition in the sample as a whole. These findings provide new evidence for low social engagement as a marker of neurocognitive vulnerability in the specific subgroup of older adults who are cognitively normal but have neuroimaging evidence of AD pathophysiologic change.

Second, we found that participants with lower-range but normal cognitive performance at baseline showed declines in social engagement, independent of age, sex, education, baseline social engagement and depression scores. Contrary to our expectations, this reciprocal association was not modified by level of amyloid-β. Continuous measures of amyloid-β were also not associated with change in social engagement as a main effect in adjusted models. This is in contrast to the observation that participants classified as high amyloid-β had greater declines in social engagement compared to the low amyloid-β group in an unadjusted model. Collectively, these findings point to amyloid-β pathology as a possible indirect factor, and lower cognitive performance, as a stronger and more proximal factor impacting change in social engagement. Subtle decrements in cognitive function, even in a non-impaired range, appear to be associated with subsequent decline in social engagement. These paired behavioral changes could reflect AD-related tau accumulation and neurodegeneration that are known to be more directly associated with cognition than amyloid-β(14) or, they may reflect other processes unrelated to AD. Together, these reciprocal analyses support the hypothesis that changes in cognitive abilities and social function co-occur in older adults and these analyses provide partial support that amyloid-β influences this mutual association.

Numerous epidemiologic studies have established that older adults with less frequent social contact and community activities experience more rapid cognitive decline and increased incident dementia (3,6,32–34). Meta-analyses provide evidence for both low social engagement as a risk factor for dementia and high social engagement as a protective factor(32,35). Studies of quantitative aspects of social isolation, such as low social network and engagement, and qualitative aspects of social isolation, such as loneliness, point to elevated cardiovascular(36) and neuroendocrine(36,37) markers of stress, impaired sleep(38,39) and pro-inflammatory physiological effects(40–42) as possible mechanisms leading to accelerated neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Positive social interactions are hypothesized to enhance cognitive activity and neural network function, a form of neural reserve which may support cognitive function in the presence of brain pathology(43–45).

Examining a relatively small sample over a short period of follow-up, our results suggest that, among strictly-defined cognitively normal older adults, the association of social engagement with change in cognitive function may be sensitively detected in those with higher levels of amyloid-β. Unlike prior research, we did not find a main effect of social engagement on cognition in the group as a whole. This may be explained by the more favorable cognitive status and health characteristics of the HABS participants compared to earlier studies as well as the cognitive stability of this sample overall.

Prior observational PET studies indicate that among cognitively normal older individuals with high amyloid-β, cognitive trajectories are not uniform and only a minority (16–32%) progress to mild cognitive impairment during follow-up periods comparable to this study(46,47). Thus, while the effect size for the interaction of amyloid-β with social engagement was small in our sample as a whole, this effect may be clinically important in the subgroup of older adults with high amyloid-β. Based on these findings alone, we cannot resolve whether the interactive effect of amyloid-β and social engagement on cognitive change indicates protection from higher social engagement, hazard from low social engagement, reverse causation in which low social engagement is an early neurobehavioral marker, or a combination of these processes. Regardless of mechanism, however, these findings suggest that older adults with both high amyloid-β and low social engagement are at particularly high risk for cognitive impairment over a short period of follow-up.

In contrast to the strength of evidence correlating social engagement and cognitive outcomes, the relationship of cognitive performance to subsequent change in social engagement has been largely unexplored. In a secondary analysis from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, investigators found that baseline global cognitive function, indexed by an extensive neuropsychological battery, was not related to change in social activity over time, adjusting for age, sex, education and race (33). Our analysis differed from this study by implementing the PACC, a cognitive composite optimized to detect subtle variation in performance in older adults who perform within a normal range, particularly those with amyloid-β pathology(25). This enhanced our ability to detect the association of incremental differences in cognition with ensuing changes in social engagement. The moderate strength of this association suggests that this is a clinically significant effect. Further, we show that the association of cognition and social engagement was independent of a number of medical and other health-related factors. This association was also independent of depressive symptoms which we have linked to higher amyloid-β in a prior longitudinal study of the HABS cohort(15).

Other studies describe trajectories of social engagement during mid-life and late-life that provide additional perspective on how social engagement and cognition may influence each other. Saczynski and colleagues observed 2500 Japanese-American men over a thirty-year-period and found that a pattern of declining social engagement from midlife to late life was associated with the highest dementia risk, interpreted as a possible indication of reverse causation due to prodromal dementia (8). Beland and colleagues investigated 4-year conjoint trajectories of cognitive decline (weighted towards memory function) and social variables (including community involvement in groups and activities, and frequency of social contacts with family and friends) in a sample of Spanish older adults (48). Participants with greater social engagement with relatives demonstrated better cognitive function until age 80, after which, this protective effect diminished (48). This suggests that salutary effects of social engagement may be linked to certain capacities that diminish with age-related morbidities such as AD.

A limitation in the field is the lack of a standard measure of social engagement. Here, we used CHAMPS questionnaire items assessing time spent with family, friends and in community groups. While these questions are similar to social engagement measures in several prior studies, this instrument contains certain biased wording (“church” rather than “religious” activities) and it does not survey forms of contact such as phone calls, video chats or other digital communications. Our analyses adjusted for depression, but we did not collect contemporaneous measures for other potential confounders such as loneliness, anxiety or apathy, which have been implicated as neurobehavioral symptoms in preclinical and prodromal AD in previously published work from our group (49–51). Comparisons of these constructs to each other and in relation to AD biomarkers will be possible in future studies. This was a small, hypothesis-driven study that did not correct for multiple comparisons, therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility of Type I errors. Lastly, study selection criteria may have influenced certain findings. Baseline values for social engagement and amyloid-β were positively correlated in this sample, a finding that was unexpected and could indicate a survivor effect. This potential bias may have reduced our ability to detect a true association of higher amyloid-β with decline in social engagement.

In conclusion, we found that level of social engagement modified amyloid-β-related cognitive decline in cognitively normal older adults over a three-year period. Reciprocally, lower cognitive performance at baseline was associated with decline in social engagement. These findings emphasize the importance of social engagement as a resilience or vulnerability marker in older adults at risk of cognitive impairment due to AD and support recommendations promoting social engagement in older adults.

HIGHLIGHTS

What is the primary question addressed by this study?

Do cognitive decline and social disengagement co-occur in cognitively normal older adults and are these changes related to brain amyloid-β, a pathologic marker of Alzheimer’s disease?

What is the main finding of this study?

In a longitudinal study of 217 community-dwelling, cognitively normal older adults, lower baseline social engagement was associated with steeper cognitive decline in those with higher amyloid-β levels. Lower-range but normal baseline cognitive performance was associated with decline in social engagement independent of amyloid-β level.

What is the meaning of the finding?

Cognitive abilities and social function are related processes in older adults. Level of social engagement contributes to cognitive change in the high-risk group of older adults who are unimpaired but have evidence of Alzheimer’s pathologic change.
