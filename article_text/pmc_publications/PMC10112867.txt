In Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, amyloid beta (Aβ) and amyloid plaques can disrupt long-term synaptic plasticity, learning and memory and cognitive function. Plaque accumulation can disrupt corticocortical circuitry leading to abnormalities in sensory, motor, and cognitive processing. In this study, using 5xFAD (five Familial Alzheimer’s Disease -FAD- mutations) mice, we evaluated amyloid plaque formation in different cortical areas, and whether differential amyloid accumulation across cortical fields correlates with changes in dendritic complexity of layer 3 corticocortical projection neurons and functional responses in the primary somatosensory cortex following whisker stimulation. We focused on three cortical areas: the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), the primary motor cortex (M1), and the prefrontal cortex (PFC including the anterior cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic subdivisions). We found that Aβ and amyloid plaque accumulation is not uniform across 5xFAD cortical areas, while there is no expression in littermate controls . We also found that there are differential layer 3 pyramidal cell dendritic complexity changes across the three areas in 5xFAD mice, compared to same age controls, with no apparent relation to differential amyloid accumulation. We used voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDi) to visualize neural activity in S1, M1 and PFC following whisker activation. Control mice show normal physiological responses in all three cortical areas, whereas 5xFAD mice only display physiological responses in S1. Taken together our results show that 5xFAD mutation affects the overall dendritic morphology of layer 3 pyramidal cells across sensory-motor and association cortex irrespective of the density and distribution of the Aβ amyloid proteins. Corticocortical circuitry between the sensory and motor/association areas is most likely disrupted in 5xFAD mice as cortical responses to whisker stimulation are altered.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Several mouse studies used synthetic amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides or Aβ assemblies isolated from human brain tissue to explore the mechanisms of memory deficits associated with the aged brain. Reductionist studies in animal models provide evidence that Aβ and amyloid plaques disrupt long-term synaptic plasticity, learning and memory and cognitive functions, characteristic of AD/ADRD (Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias). Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain-derived soluble Aβ oligomers introduced to rodent brains can disrupt synaptic plasticity, alter synaptic properties, perturb glutamatergic transmission by down-regulating glutamate transporters, causing glutamate spillover, and activating extrasynaptic GluN2B- containing NMDA receptors (Li and Selkoe, 2020). In mouse models, Aβ-amyloidosis leads to neuronal hyperactivation initiated by the suppression of glutamate reuptake (Zott et al., 2019). Adeno-associated viral (AAV) constructs that drive the expression of oligomeric Aβ either intra or extracellularly, affect learning and memory, reduce the number of synapses, expression of synaptic-related proteins, and disrupt chemical long-term potentiation (Forner et al., 2019). Whether there is a causal relationship between Aβ oligomers, amyloid plaques, and AD has been a topic of interest.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin (PS-1, PS-2) gene mutations increase production of Aβ and carriers of these mutations show characteristics of Familial Alzheimer’s Disease (FAD). Oakley et al., (2006) generated APP/PS-1 double transgenic mice that co-express five FAD mutations (5xFAD mice) and additively increase Aβ42 production. The”5xFAD” transgenic mice overexpress mutant human amyloid β(A4) precursor protein 695 (APP) with the Swedish (K670N, M671L), Florida (I716V), and London (V717I) Familial Alzheimer’s Disease (FAD) mutations along with human presenilin 1 (PS-1) harboring two FAD mutations, M146L and L286V. They are bred on B6SJL background. Amyloid rapidly accumulates in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Amyloid deposition begins at 2 months of age, and rapidly accumulates in neuronal soma and processes. Several cortical and hippocampal circuit and morphological defects, and behavioral phenotypes are reported in these mice that are available from Jackson Laboratories (MMRRC Strain #034840-JAX).

To determine whether there is a correlation between the Aβ expression across cortical fields with changes in dendritic complexity and in peripherally-evoked sensory activity responses, we investigated the expression/accumulation of amyloid proteins across cortical fields using sections from flat mount brain hemispheres which allows for “birds-eye view” of the entire cortical surface. In a parallel series of immunohistochemistry experiments, we stained coronal sections through the prefrontal, motor cortex, and primary somatosensory cortical levels. This allowed us to compare the density of β amyloid expression in layers 2/3 of the three cortical fields of interest and across all cortical layers in these fields. We next analyzed morphology and dendritic complexities of layer 3 pyramidal cells located in the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex and in their downstream targets in the primary motor (M1) and prefrontal (PFC) cortices. S1 layer 3 pyramidal cells convey whisker sensory information to the motor and association areas of the same hemisphere (and some via the corpus callosum to the opposite hemisphere). While different subtypes of layer 3 pyramidal cells project to intra and interhemispheric targets, labeling them with genetic or chemical means to differentiate was not compatible with the Golgi staining we used to investigate their dendritic complexities. Therefore, this caveat should be taken into consideration in evaluating our dendritic tree analyses. In this study we treat intra and interhemispheric cortical projection cells as one large class of corticocortical projection (CCP) cells. We focused on layer 3 pyramidal cells because they are the main neuronal types that establish connections between different cortical areas (Molyneaux et al., 2007; Fame et al., 2011; Greig et al., 2013; Fenlon and Richards, 2015). We found that layer 3 pyramidal neurons from 5xFAD mice had reduced dendritic complexity all in three brain areas that we analyzed. However, these changes do not appear to correlate with differential expression and density of Aβ and amyloid accumulation in cortical fields, as assessed with immunohistochemistry and histochemistry.

Next, we investigated peripherally-evoked cortical activity in vivo, using voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDi) after whisker stimulation (Figure 1). Imaging of cortical activity in response to whisker stimulation showed that while activity spreads from the S1 cortex to the M1 and PFC in control mice, the 5xFAD cortex displays a response only in the S1 barrel field but not in other cortical areas.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Animals

5XFAD mice (B6SJL-Tg(APPSwFlLon, PSEN1*M146L*L286V)6799Vas/Mmjax) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained in our colony at the University of Maryland Baltimore, School of Medicine, in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited laboratory facility. Mice were genotyped by TransnetYX (Cordova TN) with APPsw gene and huPSEN1 gene probes applied to tail lysate DNA samples (Udin et al., 2021). We used B6SJL litter mate mice as controls. All animal procedures were performed according to the regulations of the University of Maryland Baltimore School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80–23) revised 1996. Please see supplemental table 1 for a complete list of the animal usage in each experiment.

Immunohistochemistry and Histology

We performed dual immunohistochemistry for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut-2), a commonly used marker for thalamocortical axon terminals in layer 4 of the cortex, to visualize the barrel cortex, and Aβ immunohistochemistry to visualize accumulation of Aβ with respect to the barrel cortex. We used Thioflavin S histochemistry to visualize amyloid accumulation, and cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry for barrel patterns. Thioflavin S (ThS) and Congo Red are the two major histological stains used to detect various forms of amyloid peptides (Rajamohamedsait et al., 2012). These dyes bind to the β-pleated sheet of amyloid.

After transcardial perfusion (4% paraformaldehyde, prepared in 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 7), we removed the neocortex bilaterally from each brain and flattened them between glass slides. We sectioned flattened cortices at 50 μm thickness on a vibratome (Leica 1000S). After three rinses in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 5 min. each, we incubated the free-floating sections in blocking solution (4% NDS, normal donkey serum, and 0.1% Triton-X in PBS) 1 hr. at room temperature (RT) and then in antibody solutions at 4°C for 48–72 hours. The primary antibodies we used were rabbit anti-Aβ (1:3000, abcam ab128886), guineapig anti-Vglut2 (1:1000 ,SIG-AB2251-I) in NDS blocking solution. This was followed by 3 washes × 10 min. in PBS, and then incubation in secondary antibody solution (Cy3 Donkey anti-Rabbit and 488 Donkey anti-Guineapig, 1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch) in NDS blocking solution, 2 hr. at RT. After 3 washes (each 10 min. in PBS), we mounted the sections on clean slides, some with blue-fluorescent DNA stain DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) medium. DAPI staining is used to visualize cell nuclei, and cellular organization.

For ThS staining we rinsed the sections 3 × 10 min. each in PBS, then 10 min. in staining solution (50% ethanol in 0.05 M PBS with 0.5% Thioflavin-S (Sigma, cat# SIG-T1892). We next mounted sections on glass slides and covered with fluorescent mounting medium.

For Cytochrome Oxidase (CO) histochemistry, we incubated free-floating cortex sections in cytochrome C solution (5 mg diaminobenzidine, 5 mg cytochrome C, 0.4 g sucrose in 90 ml 0.1 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6) on a rotator incubator for 12–24 hr. at 37°C, until the sections turned brown in color. We imaged the immunostained sections under epifluorescence and CO-stained sections under light field illumination and compared the staining pattern across different cortical areas.

A separate series of brains (ages:10–13 months old) from 5 males and 5 females were sectioned in the coronal plane and alternate sections were processed for immunohistochemistry and histochemistry as described above. We imaged and quantified the density of Aβ in upper cortical layers (above layer 4) and in slabs encompassing all cortical layers (1–6). Quantitative histological analyses of Aβ distribution were done across three cortical regions S1, M1, and PFC (coronal sections). T-test was used for statistical analysis.

Golgi-Cox staining for dendritic analyses

9–12 months old mice were transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl (pH 7.4). Brains were dissected and soaked using Golgi impregnation solution and following the experimental procedures from FD Rapid Golgi Stain kit (FD Neurotechnologies, cat# PK401). Brains were sectioned coronally at 150 μm with a cryostat (Leica M3050 S) and sections were mounted on glass slides.

We traced neurons using a drawing tube fitted onto a Nikon Labophot microscope with a Nikon plan 40X objective (0.70 aperture). We entered the tracings into Neurolucida 360 software (MBF bioscience, Williston, VT, USA) for cell morphology analysis. We reconstructed a total of 85 (control n=43, 5xFAD n=42) layer 3 pyramidal cells from S1, 81 cells (control n=41, 5xFAD n=40) from M1 and 82 cells (control n=42, 5xFAD n=40) from PFC. These cells were drawn from 6 control mice (3 males and 3 females) and from 6 5xFAD mice (3 males and 3 females) for each cortical area. We used the Paxinos and Franklin Mouse Brain Atlas in Stereotaxic Coordinates (2019) to determine the boundaries of each of these areas in coronal sections. We chose layer 3 pyramidal cells for our morphological analyses, because these cells form the majority of corticocortical connections. S1 layer 3 pyramidal cells receive most of their inputs from layer 4 below, the whisker-related “barrel” cells. Layer 3 pyramidal cells in turn project to the M1 and PFC and receive reciprocal connections.

An important caveat for interpreting our Golgi analysis of dendritic fields is that while layer 3 cells are corticocortical projection neurons, a subpopulation projects to the opposite hemisphere cortical fields (callosal projection neurons). The intrahemispheric and interhemispheric corticocortical projection cells can be identified by specific markers they express but none of these are compatible with the Golgi staining method.

In tracing dendrites, we selected cell bodies that are in the middle of the 150 μm thick section and reconstructed their dendritic processes. We note that the tips of higher order dendrites in some of the cells were cut but this was the case for all control and 5xFAD brains. Because the number of cells we used per animal and the number of cases (animals) we used for the two genotypes (control and mutant) were the same, we compare the differences between the two genotypes, even if some of the dendritic tips were cut in the selected samples. Dendritic branching pattern was analyzed using two dimensional Sholl analysis (Sholl, 1953, Rodger et al., 2012; Scholl et al., 2013) in Neurolucida 360, with concentric circles of 10μm increments starting from the soma. T-test was used for the statistical significance of cell dendritic morphology, including Sholl, Node and dendritic length. Dendritic segments, bifurcation points, terminals, and soma size for layer 3 pyramidal cell populations were analyzed using Neurolucida 360. Two sample T-test was used for statistical analysis. Photographic images were acquired with an Excelis™ MPX-20RC color camera attached to Nikon microscope. Photoshop software (Adobe) was used for image processing. Dendritic spine analysis was done using Excelis camera software, counting individual spines per 20 μm dendritic segments. We counted number of spines along 20 μm segments of the secondary and tertiary dendrites. We pooled the data from both the secondary and tertiary dendritic segments as they did not show any significant differences with respect to the two dendritic orders in either the control or mutant specimens. Data was entered into Excel, and Two sample T-test was used for statistical analysis. Data from male and female mice (3 mutant males, 3 mutant females, 3 control males, and 3 control females) were analyzed to account for sex differences.

Statistical Analyses

Statistical analyses performed for this study are presented in Supplemental table 1 describing data collection, displaying number of mice, sex, and ages for each experiment. Supplemental table 2 details dendritic complexity statistical analyses, displaying number of mice, sex, and p values for each experiment. Supplemental table 3 specifies sex differences statistical analysis, displaying number of mice, sex, and p values comparing males and females. Two sample T-test was used for statistical analysis.

In vivo imaging experiments

Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDi) is based on the electrochemical properties of the neural membrane. Voltage-sensitive dye molecules change the level of light absorbance or fluorescence in proportion to the membrane potential, allowing visualization of neural activity with a high temporal (less than 1 millisecond) resolution (Chemla and Chavane, 2010). VSDi is particularly useful for generating functional images of circuit dynamics in superficial brain structures such as the neocortex (Grinvald and Hildesheim, 2004; Tsytsarev et al., 2017, see also Figure 1).

We used 6 5xFAD and 6 control mice at 5–6months old and 4 5xFAD and 3 control mice at 10–13 month old (see Supplemental Table 1). The experiments were terminal and performed under urethane anesthesia (1.5g/kg body weight, intraperitoneal injection). Mice are fitted into a stereotaxic apparatus under full anesthesia, using sterile surgical approach. A large, unilateral craniotomy was made 6–7 mm anterior from Lambda and 5–6 mm lateral from sagittal line and the area washed with sterile artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). We applied voltage-sensitive dye RH-1691 (Optical Imaging Ltd, Rehovot, Israel; 1.5 mg/ml in ACSF). Approximately 1 hr. later, the exposed surface was rinsed with ACSF, and then covered with high density silicone oil and a 0.1-mm-thick glass coverslip. The exposed area is positioned below the objective of a MiCAM02 system (Brain Vision Inc. Tokyo, Japan) and the focusing plane was moved to the depth of 300 μm below the dura. Before imaging sessions, we clipped all of the whiskers on the contralateral side except for one whisker to be stimulated. For controlled whisker stimulation, a glass capillary (1.0mm in diameter) was fitted onto an XYZ-manipulator and aimed above the untrimmed whisker, and 20 msec. duration air puffs were applied through a Picospitzer controlled by the MiCAM02 imaging system. Before the imaging session, we saved a grayscale image of the craniotomy area as a graphic file. Each experiment consisted of 50–100 trials with 400 frames per trial with the intertrial interval 12 sec. Stimulus (air puff) was delivered 1 sec. after trial start. The change in fluorescence as ΔF/F (%) denotes the difference in fluorescence intensity at resting state before stimulation and the change in intensity after stimulation was calculated using the BrainVision Analyzer. A pseudocolor map was generated from the data using first frame analysis and then by averaging the data for each session. VSDi has a high temporal resolution, comparable to electrophysiological recordings. In our experiments time resolution is usually 5 msec., sometimes even 2 msec. (Figure 1). Spatial resolution reaches 30–50 microns. VSDi is a very sensitive method and we get a response to a single deflection of the whisker. We can also observe the development of the response over time. However, due to toxicity of voltage-sensitive dyes we can only use them in acute experiments.

RESULTS

Amyloid expression across cortical fields in 5xFAD mice

5xFAD mice have been used for almost 2 decades to understand the neurological defects and the biochemistry behind AD. In this study we sought to evaluate amyloid plaque formation in different cortical areas, and how differential amyloid accumulation across cortical fields may correlate with changes in dendritic complexity and functional responses. Using immunohistochemistry on flattened cortices (birds eye view, Figure 2), we can visualize the barrel fields (Fig. 2A) and reveal expression of Aβ in different cortical areas (Fig. 2B). Aβ accumulates differentially in cortical areas as early as in 2-month-old 5xFAD mice, as reported since the introduction of this mouse model (Oakley et al., 2006). We also examined the expression of Thioflavin S, a well-known marker for amyloid plaques, and found that like Aβ, thioflavin S expression was not found in the barrel cortex (Fig. 2C). Using VGlut2 staining (Fig. 2B) and cytochrome oxidase (CO, Fig. 2D), we confirmed that the barrel cortex (S1) is still present in 5xFAD mice and appears comparable to controls.

We also double immunostained coronal sections with VGlut-2, a generic marker for thalamocortical axons and β-amyloid (Figure 3). We quantified Aβ positive spots (Figure 4) in three brains areas, primary sensory cortex (S1), primary motor cortex (M1), and prefrontal cortex (PFC) using the NIS Elements software (Nikon). VGlut-2 also nicely delineates layer 4 or thalamocortical axon terminal fields and makes it easier to distinguish cortical layers (as marked in Figure 3B). In Fig. 3B blue rectangle indicates the ROI for all cortical layers in β-amyloid density measurements (Figure 4) and yellow rectangle the ROI for the same measurements in layer 2/3 only. We found that Aβ plaque densities are different between S1, M1 and PFC in both ROIs, and most notably across all cortical layers. M1 and PFC displayed more β-amyloid plaques in all cortical layers compared to S1 (t-test: M1 vs S1 upper layers, p value=1.25E-08; M1 vs S1 all layers, p value=1.99E-11; PFC vs S1 upper layers, p value=1.71E-06; PFC vs S1 all layers, p value=3.505E-10). We found no significant differences in β-amyloid plaque density between M1 and PFC in both ROIs (figure 4).

Dendritic complexity of layer 3 pyramidal cells across cortical fields in 5xFAD mice

To investigate whether differential Aβ accumulation across cortical fields correlate with dendritic field alterations in layer 3 corticocortical projection cells, we analyzed layer 3 pyramidal cells in three brains areas, primary sensory cortex (S1), primary motor cortex (M1), and prefrontal cortex (PFC) in Golgi-impregnated brain sections. Using methodical cell reconstruction, and Sholl analysis (Sholl, 1953, Rodger et al., 2012) we found that the morphology of layer 3 pyramidal cells was altered in all three cortical areas in 5xFAD mice compared to controls (Figs. 5, 6, and 7 and Supplemental Table 2). In S1, layer 3 pyramidal cells display less intersections and smaller dendritic lengths (Fig. 5 B, C). The total number of nodes, total dendritic length, and total number of terminals were also significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice compared to controls in the S1 cortical area (Fig. 6A), while the soma size was not affected.

5xFAD layer 3 pyramidal cells in M1 were also significantly less complexed and shorter, with a reduction in the number of intersections (Fig. 5B), and a reduction in the total number of nodes, and terminals (Fig. 6B). Both the dendritic length segments (Fig. 5C) and the total dendritic length (Fig. 6B) were reduced in the mutants. Layer 3 pyramidal cell soma size was similar in controls and 5xFAD mice (Fig. 6B). We next analyzed the dendrites of layer 3 pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex and found that all morphological parameters were affected (Fig. 5; Fig. 6C), including cell soma size. When comparing the dendritic complexity differences between cortical brain areas in 5xFAD mice, we found that the reductions in morphological parameters were very similar in all brain regions (Table 1).

We also considered possible sex differences between male controls versus female controls, and between male mutants versus female mutants. However, our analyses in this regard revealed no differences in S1 or M1 cortical areas. Differences between females and males in both controls (n=22 cells for the females, n=20 cells for the males) and 5XFAD (n=20 cells for the females, n=20 cells for the males) mice in prefrontal cortex brain area were not significant, except for the soma size (Fig. 6C, p value=0.0201, please see supplemental table 3 for the details of analysis of sex differences.)

Dendritic spine loss has been reported in several brain areas in the aged brain and brain specimens from AD/ADRD patients (Scheff et al. 2006; 2007; 2011). Our analysis of spine density in the 5xFAD mice showed that 1. There were no sex differences (Supplemental Table 3) between all groups studied (male (n=3) and female (n=3) control mice, male (n=3) and female (n=3) 5xFAD mice), and 2. All brains areas, S1 (n=6 mice and a total of 289 dendritic segments for control mice; n=6 mice and a total of 284 dendritic segments for 5xFAD mice), M1 (n=6 mice and a total of 248 dendritic segments for control mice; n=6 mice and a total of 243 dendritic segments for 5xFAD mice), and PFC (n=6 mice and a total of 247 dendritic segments for control mice; n=6 mice and a total of 242 dendritic segments for 5xFAD mice), showed a reduction in spines density. S1 cortical brain area displayed a spine density reduction of 29.595% (p value &lt;0.001), while for M1 cortical brain area the reduction was only 4.62% (p value=0.0015). For PFC we found a 11.89% reduction in dendritic spine density (p value &lt;0.001). To our surprise the S1 (barrel) cortex area with the least number of amyloid deposits was the most affected in dendritic spine density in 5xFAD mice.

Analysis of sensory-evoked cortical activation in 5xFAD mice

To specifically examine the effects of whisker stimulation on brain cortical areas S1, M1, and PFC, we imaged cortical activation patterns following single or multiple whisker stimulation. We successfully used this approach for several years (Liao et al., 2013; Lo et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017; Tsytsarev et al., 2014; 2017). We compared functional fluorescence responses in the S1 and M1 cortex between control and 5xFAD mice. The whisker stimulation protocol was standard in all imaging experiments, with the same stimulus intensity. VSDi data from 5xFAD mice indicate that single whisker stimulation induces response in the appropriate barrel area in S1, but this is not followed by subsequent responses in M1 and PFC areas, unlike responses seen in control mice (Figures 8, 9, 10). Previous electrophysiological studies all along the whisker barrel pathway demonstrated that whisker deflection velocity is far more important than whisker stimulation amplitude (Pinto et al., 2000; Shoyktet et al., 2000). With VSDi such electrophysiological properties are not readily distinguishable because the dye molecules fluoresce upon voltage changes (depolarization) in groups of neurons that are activated upon peripheral stimulation.

In both 5xFAD and control animals, VSD signal appeared 5–10 ms after the stimulus onset and reached its peak 30–40 ms after the stimulus onset, and then decreased and returned to baseline. However, in control mice optical signals were located in discrete areas corresponding to the barrel field (S1) and primary motor cortex (M1), adjacent to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In 5xFAD mice, optical signals were located almost exclusively in the area corresponding to the barrel field but not in the any other part of the cortex. For quantitative analysis, we calculated the number of pixels with the value of fluorescence value above 50% of all the pixels in the imaging at 40 ms after the stimulus onset (Lee et al., 2017). Our results showed that in 5xFAD mice at the period 30–60 ms after stimulus onset, the number of pixels with a fluorescence value above 90% of all the pixels in the imaging area were much lower compared to control animals, where Imaging area includes both BF and M1 (Figure 10). We calculated the standard deviation to quantify the dispersion of data set from single imaging sessions with the MiCAM02 imaging system. Standard deviation of 2σ indicated that repeatability of the whisker-evoked response is consistent between the first, the last, and in-between trials for both the control and mutant cases. Time course of the response following stimulation was similar between the control and mutant cases and the % change of fluorescence (ΔF/F) was no different between the two groups.

As indicated above, the VSDi signal peaks approximately 40 ms after stimulus onset. Therefore, cortical functional pseudocolor maps show distinct differences between 5xFAD and control animals approximately 40 ms after stimulation. Thus, even though sensory peripheral stimulation evokes activity in the barrel cortex of 5xFAD mice, it is weaker compared to the barrel field activation in control animals. Take together these results indicate that the activation of the cortex in mice by 5xFAD is lower than the control, since in control mice whisker stimulation activates multiple zones, whereas in mutants only one zone gets activated.

DISCUSSION

Soluble amyloid β (Aβ) oligomers and amyloid plaques alter neural circuits by disrupting neuronal form and function in the forebrain, in particular the strength of synaptic circuits. This has been mostly studied in the hippocampus and cortical “association” areas, and these changes have been suggested as predictors of preclinical AD/ADRD (reviewed in Li and Selkoe, 2020). AD/ADRD (frontotemporal dementias) involve cognitive impairment and loss of learning. Several proteins, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), Aβ and tau protein are implicated in the initiation and progression of AD/ADRD (Penke et al., 2019). The amyloid cascade hypothesis, which proposes that mutations on the APP and processing pathways are responsible for AD pathogenesis, has been around for over twenty years (Hardy and Higgins, 1992). A causal relationship between the accumulation and deposition of oligomeric or fibrillar Aβ peptide and AD has been challenged, in part based on failure of attempts to develop Aβ-targeting drugs to treat AD (Herrup, 2015; Cline et al., 2018; Kametani and Hasegawa, 2018; Morris et al., 2018). However, there is strong evidence from animal models that the Aβ protein and amyloid plaque accumulation disrupts long-term synaptic plasticity, memory, and cognitive performance (Puzzo et al., 2020).

The differential accumulation of Aβ and plaques across cortical areas may alter population responses and disrupt corticocortical circuitry, leading to abnormalities in sensory, motor, and cognitive processing. In the present study, we investigated AD-related changes to layer 3 pyramidal cells in S1, M1 and PFC. We found that a number of significant morphological changes occur in 5xFAD layer 3 pyramidal cells, compared to normal aging controls. Changes included reductions in interactions, dendritic length, number of nodes, total dendritic length, total number of terminals and also reduction in dendritic spine density (see table 1 for summary). 5xFAD mutation affected the overall cell morphological parameters in all 3 brain regions analyzed, but when assessed in detail, S1 5XFAD displayed shorter dendritic segments, and a larger reduction in spine density; M1 total dendritic length was the most reduced from all groups, and PFC displayed the least number of terminals, leading us to conclude that the 5xFAD mutation affected layer 3 pyramidal cells differently in those brain regions. Taken together our results showed that layer 3 pyramidal cells from S1, M1, and PFC all display disruption in dendritic morphology in 5xFAD mice, even though the density and distribution of the beta amyloid proteins differ in those brain regions.

APP/PS1 transgenic mice express high levels of Aβ and progressively develop extracellular Aβ plaques, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal abnormalities, However, voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDi) in the barrel cortex of APP/PS1 transgenic mice reportedly showed abnormal population responses (Maatuf et al., 2016). In this study, the investigators used ketamine anesthesia which is known to interfere with glutamatergic transmission by acting as NMDA receptor antagonist. In our study, we used urethane anesthesia in 5xFAD mice and find that single whisker stimulation induces response in the appropriate barrel area, but this is not followed by subsequent responses in the M1 and PFC areas, unlike that seen in control mice. The difference in our observations and that reported for the APP/PS1 mice could be due to transgenic strain differences or the type of anesthesia used.

The detrimental effects of amyloid proteins on the structure and function of neurons, including pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, and layer 5 cortex (Moreno-Gonzalez et al., 2009; Esquerda-Canals et al., 2017; Mariani et al., 2017; Torres-Flores et al., 2022) led us to hypothesize that differential accumulation of amyloid proteins across different cortical areas will accompany structural and functional impairments of the resident neurons, particularly layer 3 neurons which form the corticocortical connections. We are surprised to find and conclude that the most dramatic structural changes, in particular spine density of layer 3 neuron dendrites, have occurred in the S1 cortex of the 5xFAD mice, an area with relatively little or no evidence for amyloid accumulation at the ages studied. A previous study also revealed a significant spine loss on basal dendrites in the somatosensory and prefrontal cortices of a 5xFAD transgenic line crossed with a line that has YFP fluorescence expression in layer 5 cortical neurons (Crowe and Ellis-Davies, 2014).

While S1 cortex is responsive to sensory peripheral stimulation, as revealed by our VSDi data, the M1 and PFC areas show no activation following whisker stimulation, even though layer 3 pyramidal cells show lesser degree of structural alterations compared to the S1 cortex and higher levels of amyloid expression. This could be due to significant impairment in dendritic morphology of S1 layer 3 (corticocortical projection) cells, especially dramatic reduction in dendritic spine density. Functionally, these structural changes indicate reduced synaptic drive, reduced evoked activity through the thalamocortical pathway which brings the whisker-evoked activity to the S1 cortex. Consequently, the S1 projections to the M1 and PFC zones would be less effective. This conclusion is supported by our VSDi data. Additionally, as noted above, our results do not indicate any correlation between the structure and function of layer 3 corticocortical projection neurons and accumulation of amyloid deposits across different cortical fields.

Another possibility is that along with dendritic impairments, axonal projections from layer 4 below to layer 3 cells or the corticocortical projections from layer 3 cells may have deteriorated. Unfortunately, available anterograde axonal labeling techniques all have short comings. Even when the exact same volume of an axonal tracer (including AAVs) is injected in the exact same stereotaxic location, label uptake or viral transfection efficiency varies between animals resulting differential labeling between animals. Thus, quantification of axonal density becomes a challenge. One other caveat in interpreting our results is that 5xFAD mutation may also alter GABAergic interneurons’ synaptic release properties or the density of the GABA receptors in layer 3 cells. This could perhaps be resolved in future studies using whole cell recordings in brain slices.

Along with dendritic abnormalities of layer 3 pyramidal neurons and weak sensory-evoked activity in S1 cortex, one would anticipate that whisker-dependent behaviors would be affected in 5xFAD mice. A recent study investigated the cognitive and pain-related behavioral repertoire of the 5xFAD mice impairment (Udin et al., 2021). One of the tests used was short-term novel object recognition, and mice rely heavily on their whiskers for this task, the tested 5xFAD mice performed similar to the matched controls. Tactile sensitivity tests involving paws also did not reveal any notable differences. An earlier study examined social behavior in 5xFAD mice (Flanagan et al., 2014) and found that these mice exhibit excessive home-cage social behavior and impaired social recognition. They further found that a class of inhibitory interneurons in the cortex, the parvalbumin-positive neurons, were reduced in the barrel cortex. While the authors tie this reduction to aversive overstimulation responsible for the behaviors observed in 5xFAD mice, it could also be related to diminished sensory-evoked activity and deficits on corticocortical communication emanating from the S1 to other areas.

Layer 3 pyramidal cells of primary sensory cortices connect to the motor and association cortices and also form reciprocal circuits across the two hemispheres of the brain. Our study on one of the most commonly used mouse model of AD focused on the dendritic complexity of those cells in the primary somatosensory cortex, motor cortex and the prefrontal cortex in relation to Aβ and amyloid expression patterns in these areas. While we did not find correlation between amyloid expression and dendritic complexity in these areas, we found significant compromise in dendritic complexity in S1. Further, we found that whisker stimulation evoked reduced activity in S1 which did not spread to other areas. Our findings suggest that defects in cortical circuit activity and morphology can occur independent of amyloid deposition in an AD mouse model.

Figure 1. Principles of voltage-sensitive dye imaging in the cortex.

Voltage-sensitive dye RH-1691 molecules diffuse through the dura mater and enter the cerebral cortex, where they are embedded in neuronal membranes. Membrane depolarization (after peripheral sensory stimulation) changes the fluorescent properties of the dye. Optical imaging setup allows illumination of the cortical region, under examination, with light excitation and capture of the emitted photons. The fluorescence level in each pixel of the cortical area under study can be monitored. In off-line analysis, a change in the level of the fluorescence can be associated with a certain color allowing for creation of dynamic, functional pseudocolor maps of the cortical area excited by the peripheral stimulation (i.e., whisker stimulation in our case).

A and A’ show the same section double immunostained for VGlut2 (green) and β-amyloid (red) in a control animal (age 10-month-old) and a similar pair of photomicrographs from a same aged 5xFAD animal (B and B’). These sections are at the level of the M1 and PFC, and slightly caudal sections at the level of the S1 (barrel) cortex are shown in C, C’ and D, D’ pairs with dual immunostaining for control (C, C’) and 5xFAD (D, D’) cases. CC: corpus callosum, Str: striatum, AC: anterior commissure, Fi: fimbria, Sep: Septum. Cortical layers are marked in B and the blue rectangle indicates the ROI for all cortical layers in b-amyloid density measurements (Fig. 4) and yellow rectangle the ROI for the same measurements in layer 2/3 only. Note that the dense band of Vglut2 (green) immunostaining clearly marks layer 4 or the terminal zone of the thalamocortical axons. Arrows over S1 in C indicate thalamocortical axon patches that fill in the barrels. Scale bar in D’ is the same for all sections.

Figure 4. Density of β-amyloid in S1, M1, and PFC in 5xFAD mice.

We measured the density of β-amyloid plaques in two defined regions of interest (ROI), layers 2/3 only and across all cortical layers (indicated by the blue and yellow rectangles in figure 3B) in 5xFAD 10–13 month old mice. Note that the densities are different between these three areas in both ROIs, and most notably across all cortical layers. M1 and PFC displayed more β-amyloid plaques in all cortical layers compared to S1 (T-test: M1 vs S1 upper layers, p value=1.25E-08; M1 vs S1 all layers, p value=1.99E-11; PFC vs S1 upper layers, p value=1.71E-06; PFC vs S1 all layers, p value=3.505E-10). There were no significant differences between M1 and PFC in both ROIs.

A. S1 Cortex: Top panels are spine examples in S1 from control (left) and 5xFAD (right) mice. 289 segments of 20μm in control mice (black) and 284 segments in 5xFAD mice (white) were analyzed and showed dendritic spine reduction in 5xFAD mice (p value &lt; 0.001). No differences were seen between females and males in both controls (n=22 females, n=21 males) and 5XFAD (n=21 females, n=21 males) mice.

B. M1 Cortex: Top panels are spine examples in M1 from control (left) and 5xFAD (right) mice. 248 segments of 20μm in control mice (black) and 243 segments in 5xFAD mice (white) were analyzed and showed dendritic spine reduction in 5xFAD mice (p value=0.001). No differences were seen between females and males in both controls (n=22 females, n=21 males) and 5XFAD (n=21 females, n=21 males) mice.

Figure 8. Voltage-sensitive dye optical imaging pseudocolor maps showing single-whisker stimulation fluorescence changes.

A. Control mice. Yellow circle at 50ms shows physiological activation in S1. Yellow oval at 50ms shows response in the M1/PFC area. The time after stimulus onset is indicated at the bottom left corner of each image. B. 5xFAD mice lack physiological response in reply to the whisker stimulation in the M1 / PFC area. We can see a weak response only in the S1 cortex barrel field (yellow circle at 60ms). Imaging was done with 5 msec. time frame.

Figure 9. Voltage-sensitive dye optical imaging in the barrel cortex during whisker-evoked activity.

Time course of the integrated fluorescence signals averaged over 50 trials in one experimental session (A) 6 month old control mouse, (B) 6 month old 5xFAD mouse. Similar signals from a (C) 13 month old 5xFAD mouse and a 13 month old control mouse (D). The integrated fluorescence level in the 11×11 pixel area (blue, M1 area; green, no response area and red, S1 area), contained in the activity pattern has been calculated for each frame and each stimulus. This value was used to make a chart of the time courses of the fluorescence signals (on the right). Physiological responses were recorded from both whisker stimulation in M1/PFC area (blue), and barrel field S1 area (red). No physiological activation in response to the whisker stimulation in the M1/PFC area was recorded in 5xFAD mice, physiological response was only recorded in barrel field, S1. In 13 month old 5xFAD mice, it was possible to observe the response to stimulation only in the S1 area, and it was much weaker than in younger animals. In the M1 area the response was completely absent. Standard deviation is calculated based on the results of averaging all trials during the imaging session.

Y axis indicates the number of pixels in which the value of the fluorescent signal exceeds 50% for a given experimenter, that is, the size of the cortical region activated by stimulation. X axis indicates the time after whiskers stimulation. The number of pixels with the value of fluorescence above 50% of all the pixels in the imaging at 40 ms after the stimulus onset is shown for 6-month-old mice in E and for 13-months- old mice in F.
