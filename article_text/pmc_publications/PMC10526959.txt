Background:

Long-stay nursing home (NH) residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are at high risk of hospital transfers. Machine learning might improve risk adjustment methods for NHs.

Objectives:

To develop and compare nursing home risk-adjusted rates of hospitalizations and ED visits among long-stay residents with ADRD using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and logistic regression.

Research Design:

Secondary analysis of national Medicare claims and NH assessment data in 2012 Q3. Data were equally split into the training and test sets. Both XGBoost and logistic regression predicted any hospitalization and ED visit using 58 predictors. NH-level risk-adjusted rates from XGBoost and logistic regression were constructed and compared. Multivariate regressions examined NH and market factors associated with rates of hospitalization and ED visits.

Subjects:

Long-stay Medicare residents with ADRD (N=413,557) from 14,057 NHs.

Results:

8.1% and 8.9% residents experienced any hospitalization and ED visit in a quarter, respectively. XGBoost slightly outperformed logistic regression in Area Under the Curve (AUC=0.88 vs. 0.86 for hospitalization; 0.85 vs. 0.83 for ED visit). NH-level risk-adjusted rates from XGBoost were slightly lower than logistic regression (hospitalization=8.3% and 8.4%; ED=8.9% and 9.0%, respectively), but were highly correlated. Facility and market factors associated with the XGBoost and logistic regression adjusted hospitalization and ED rates were similar. NHs serving more residents with ADRD and having a higher registered nurse to total nursing staff ratio had lower rates.

Conclusions:

XGBoost and logistic regression provides comparable estimates of risk-adjusted hospitalization and ED rates.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Nursing home quality has long been a policy challenge faced by federal and state governments.1 To improve quality of care and inform patient choice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched Nursing Home Compare (now called Care Compare) in 1998.2 Care Compare currently reports 24 quality measures related to short-stay and long-stay residents, including hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, and function improvement.3 A recent review concludes that public reporting improved nursing home quality in reported measures.2

A common challenge in measuring the quality of care is how to account for differences in patient demographic and clinical characteristics that might be related to the outcome but not to the quality of care.2 CMS adopted a method called risk adjustment to potentially remove the impact of patient characteristics on quality measures.4 The risk-adjusted rate is calculated as ObservedratePredictedrate∗Nationalrate. The key process of calculating risk-adjusted rates is to have a fair and accurate predicted rate, which involves adjusting for proper covariates and using the correct statistical model. CMS currently includes covariates from both Medicare claims (e.g. age, sex) and MDS (e.g. function, clinical conditions, and treatments) to risk-adjust some measures like hospitalization.5 CMS employs the classical logistic regression to account for differences in patient characteristics,6 but the performances of some logistic models are not optimal. For example, the C-statistic, a measure of goodness of fit for binary outcomes in a logistic regression model, was only 0.61 for risk-adjusted ED rates and 0.69 for hospitalization rates.7 One potential limitation is that both logistic models adjusted for over 300 categorical predictors, with many predictors having a very low prevalence (e.g., &lt;0.1%).

Machine Learning is a novel computational method for automatic learning from experience to improve model performance.8,9 The extreme gradient boosting method (XGBoost) is a promising nonparametric tree-based algorithm.10-14 Compared to regression-based algorithms (e.g., logistic regression), XGBoost has several strengths that can benefit risk adjustment methods. In logistic regression, human decisions are needed to determine what factors go into the risk adjustment model. While XGBoost can decide factors based on their relative contributions to prediction in the model, simplifying the model-building process. Second, XGBoost allows non-linear relationships between the predictors and outcome and interactions among predictors, which are unavailable in logistic regression.10 Also, XGBoost can automatically improve the prediction by building tree classifiers sequentially to learn from the error from the previous tree.10 XGBoost has been shown to enhance the accuracy of risk-adjusted methods, as demonstrated for mortality and plan payment.15,16 Despite these potential benefits, XGBoost has been underused in risk adjustment methods for the nursing home population.

A major difference between risk adjustment and risk prediction is the number of predictors included in the model. When building a predictive model, we want to include as many predictors as possible to maximize the predictive power while maintaining a good bias-variance balance.8 In contrast, risk adjustment models do not intend to provide the best prediction. Risk adjustment models include only covariates that are relevant to population risk so that the models are not biased to variation due to processes. Thus, risk adjustment models are relatively simple and may not provide the best prediction.9

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are prevalent among nursing home residents, with over 50% of residents suffering from ADRD.4,17 About 28% of long-stay residents with ADRD have at least one hospitalization in a year.18 Despite CMS published rates of hospitalization and ED visits for the general nursing home population, no quality measure is specifically developed for ADRD. Constructing rates of hospitalization and ED visits for residents with ADRD provides opportunities to understand care quality and its determinants for one of the frailest populations.

To mitigate these knowledge gaps, this study analyzed 2012 national Medicare claims to 1) develop nursing home risk-adjusted rates of hospitalizations and ED visits for residents with ADRD; 2) compare risk-adjusted rates from XGBoost vs. logistic regression; and 3) explore facility and market factors associated with risk-adjusted rates. We hypothesize that risk-adjusted rates of hospitalizations and ED visits from XGBoost differ from rates from logistic regression, and facility and market factors (e.g., five-star rating, chain, number of dementia residents, and Medicare advantage penetration) are associated with lower risk-adjusted rates.

METHODS

We consolidated a resident-level dataset using national Medicare claims and nursing home Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 assessment data. Data were equally split into training and test sets to predict resident outcomes and evaluate model performance. Nursing home-level risk-adjusted rates were then constructed and compared. Finally, multivariate regressions examined what facility and market factors were associated with rates of hospitalizations and ED visits, as well as differences in rates between XGBoost and logistic regression . This study was reviewed and approved by the University of X Institutional Review Board. A data use agreement for Medicare claims and nursing home assessment data was signed with CMS.

Data sources

The 2012 resident-level data sources included the Medicare Beneficiary Summary File, Medicare Provider Analysis and Review File (MedPAR),19 Medicare outpatient claims,19 and MDS 3.0. We used 2012 data because more recent data were unavailable for this project. We extracted 2012 nursing home characteristics from the Care Compare website and the Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting (CASPER).4,20 The Area Health Resources File provided county market factors.4,21

Study cohorts

The resident cohort included long-stay residents who were ≥ 65 years old, diagnosed with ADRD, had continuous Medicare Part A and Part B coverage (i.e. not enrolled in Medicare Advantage) in 2012 Q3, and were from 48 contiguous states or the District of Columbia.5 ADRD were identified from MDS (Item I4200 and I4800). An active ADRD diagnosis in the MDS requires a physician or advanced practice provider documentation of the diagnosis within the last 60 days. Following CMS’ algorithm,4,22 we calculated the cumulative days in the facility using admission/reentry and discharge records from MDS. Residents with cumulative days in the facility ≥101 days in 2012 Q3 were considered as long-stay residents and were included in the cohort.4 In total, 413,557 residents with ADRD were identified in 2012 Q3. The nursing home cohort included freestanding nursing homes with ≥ 20 beds, resulting in 14,057 unique nursing homes.

Variables

Resident-level outcomes

In the resident-level dataset, two binary resident outcomes were defined from Medicare data: all-cause hospitalization and any ED visit in a quarter.4 These binary outcomes indicate whether the target event ever happened in a quarter, and do not count the recurrent events such as multiple hospitalizations or ED visits in a quarter.

Resident-level predictors

We extracted 58 resident-level predictors from MDS or Medicare claims that were previously used to predict hospitalization or ED visit among residents with ADRD.4,18,23-27 MDS variables were selected from qualifying target assessments with target dates that were no more than 120 days before the end of the target quarter or the end of a nursing home episode during 2012 Q3, whichever came first.4,23 As shown in Supplemental Table 1, predictors comprised of sociodemographic and enrollment information (e.g. age, gender, race/ethnicity, dual-eligible status),28 indicators of diagnoses (e.g. cardiovascular, diabetes),26 clinical conditions and treatments (e.g. pain, shortness of breath, vomiting, fever),18,26 physical and cognitive function (e.g. Activities of Daily Living,4 Cognitive Functioning Scale29), and two risk scores (narrowly defined low care,30 RUG-IV case-mix index).

Nursing home and market variables

Nursing home-level outcomes included four risk-adjusted rates of hospitalization and ED visit calculated separately from XGBoost and logistic regression.4 To compare rates from different models, we constructed the rate rankings as lowest 50%, medium 40%, and highest 10%, accounting for the fact that over 40% of nursing homes reported a zero rate.31 To examine facility and market factors associated with the discrepancy in risk-adjusted hospitalization and ED rates, we calculated differences in the rates between XGBoost and logistic regression (XGBoost - Logistic).

Nursing home characteristics included structure (e.g. overall five-star rating, Alzheimer’s unit, total beds), resident mix (e.g. % Medicaid/Medicare residents), and staffing.4,20,21,24,29 We calculated the total number of residents with ADRD and percent of Black, Indigenous, and Other Peoples of Color (BIPOC) residents in the nursing home. Facilities with more than 27.3% (75th percentile) of BIPOC residents were defined as high-proportion BIPOC facilities.32 We obtained market factors such as Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) for total nursing home beds,33 % county MA penetration, and total hospital beds.4,29

Statistical Analysis

We first built XGBoost and logistic regression models to predict hospitalization and ED visit at the resident level. XGBoost is a popular boosted classification tree algorithm that can learn nonlinear relationships among variables and outcome flexibly and accurately.34 Logistic regression is selected as the benchmark algorithm.6 Our analytic sample was equally and randomly split into the training set (N=206,788) and test set (N=206,769) to avoid overfitting of the model. XGBoost was tuned with 5-fold cross-validation in the training set.34 After models were trained in the training set, we applied them to the test set to predict hospitalization and ED visit, as well as calculate predicted probability. Model performances of XGBoost and logistic regression for both outcomes [Area Under a Curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV)] were derived from the test set.35 We also obtained Brier scores for each model, calculated as the mean squared error between predicted probabilities and the observed values.36 Calibration plots assessed the agreement between predictions and observations for each method.37 Down-sampling the majority group (i.e. residents without hospitalization or ED visit) did not significantly improve the model performance, so original imbalanced data were used for the model tuning.38

Quarterly risk-adjusted rates of hospitalization and any ED were calculated separately using XGBoost and logistic regression models and aggregated over all residents with ADRD to the nursing home-quarter level.4 After obtaining risk-adjusted rates, we examined distributions of the rates and also the correlations between rates from XGBoost and logistic regression using Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient. We also compared the consistency in ranks of rates from different models using K statistics.31 To account for the nested data structure (facilities nested in a state), we conducted mixed-effects linear regressions to examine facility and market factors (as described previously) associated with XGBoost-based risk-adjusted rates of hospitalization and ED visits. Similarly, we examined factors associated with logistic-based rates of hospitalization and ED visits. We also assessed what facility and market factors were associated with the difference in risk-adjusted rates from XGBoost vs. logistic regression, using similar mixed-effects linear models.

Machine learning algorithms were conducted in R 3.5.2.10 All remaining statistical analyses were performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and Stata 16.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX).

RESULTS

Supplemental Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of resident characteristics for all residents, the training set, and the test set in 2012 Q3. Of the resident population, 8.1% and 8.9% experienced any hospitalization and ED visit in a quarter. The average age was 85.3, and most residents were female (75.3%), non-BIPOC race/ethnicity (80.0%), and dually-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (82.0%). No statistical differences between the training set and test set were found, except for low care (4.4% vs 4.5%, P=0.02).

Model performances of XGBoost and logistic regression in the test set are shown in Table 1. For hospitalization, XGBoost outperformed logistic regression in AUC (0.878 vs. 0.857), and accuracy (0.927 vs. 0.925); XGboost had slightly lower sensitivity (0.984 vs. 0.987) but improved specificity (0.293 vs. 0.225). Brier score was 0.055 for XGBoost and 0.058 for logistic regression. Similarly, XGboost slightly outperformed logistic regression in predicting ED visit (Table 1). The variable importance is shown in Supplemental Figure 1, suggesting similar leading predictors for hospitalization and ED visit. Supplemental Figure 2 presents the distributions of the predicted hospitalization and ED visits, indicating that XGBoost predicted more residents at both lower and upper ends while logistic regression predicted more centered probabilities. The calibration plots suggest that XGboost had slightly better model accuracies than logistic regression (Supplemental Figure 3).

Descriptive results of nursing home-level risk-adjusted rates and facility and market factors are presented in Table 2. Hospitalization rates per 100 residents in a quarter from XGBoost and logistic regression averaged 8.29% (SD=12.52%) and 8.36% (SD=12.10%); ED rates per 100 residents in a quarter from XGBoost and logistic regression averaged 8.87% (SD=12.62%) and 8.98% (SD=12.54%). The average differences in rates of hospitalization (−0.07%) and ED visits (−0.11%) between XGBoost and logistic regression were small. Figure 1 further shows the relationships of risk-adjusted rates from XGBoost and logistic regression. Although both rates were highly correlated with Pearson correlation coefficient &gt; 0.9, some discrepancies existed. The agreements in nursing home rankings for hospitalization and ED visit are presented in Table 3. The overall agreement of XGboost ranking and logistic ranking for hospitalization and ED visit was 92.0% and 93.0% with K statistics being 0.862 and 0.879, suggesting high consistency in the rankings. The majority of nursing homes that ranked as the highest 10% by XGBoost were also generally ranked as the highest 10% by logistic regression (77.0% and 79.3% for hospitalization and ED visit).

Multivariate linear regressions examined nursing home and market factors associated with XGBoost-based rates of hospitalization and ED visits (Table 4). Nursing homes that were affiliated with a chain [β=−0.84%, 95% confidence intervals (CI): −1.43%, −0.26%], served a large number of residents with ADRD (β=−0.35%, 95% CI: −0.70%, 0%), and had a higher RN to total nursing staff ratio (β=−0.42%, 95% CI: −0.65%, −0.19%) reported lower rates of hospitalization. The % Medicare residents was associated with higher rates of hospitalization (β=0.68%, 95% CI: 0.28%, 1.08%). Similar associations were found in the rates of ED visits. Other facility characteristics such as overall five-star rating, having a high-proportion of BIPOC resident, Alzheimer’s unit, and direct care staff hours were not associated with risk-adjusted rates. We also found that market factors such as % Medicare Advantage penetration, total hospital beds, and household income were correlated with rates of hospitalization and ED visits. Supplemental Table 2 reported similar factors associated with logistic-based rates of hospitalization and ED visits. The model examining differences in risk-adjusted rates found that most facility characteristics were not associated with differences in rates from XGBoost vs. logistic regression (Supplemental Table 3).

DISCUSSION

Using national Medicare claims and nursing home assessment data, this study develops and validates a XGBoost risk-adjustment method for hospitalizations and ED visits of long-stay nursing home residents with ADRD. We demonstrated that XGBoost had good predictive power and slightly outperformed classical logistic regression. Risk-adjusted rates from XGBoost were highly correlated with rates from logistic regression with small discrepancies. Certain nursing home factors (e.g., chain affiliation, number of dementia residents, registered nurse to total nursing staff ratio) were associated with lower risk-adjusted rates of hospitalizations and ED visits.

Both XGBoost and logistic regression achieved good model performances in the independent test set. XGBoost models achieved an AUC of ≥ 0.85 for hospitalization and ED visit with over 0.92 accuracy, suggesting a good predictive power. Our model performances exceed many existing predictive models, which reported AUC around 0.7.12,39-41 One strength of our model is the inclusion of detailed resident-level predictors from MDS,4 which gave us more power to predict hospital transfers. Our XGBoost models only achieved a minimum improvement compared to logistic regression in predicting hospitalization and ED visit, consistent with previous studies.9,14,40,41

Interestingly, our models performed better than models used by Care Compare based on various metrics of performance.5 There are multiple reasons why this may have occurred. Our first hypothesis is the difference in study populations. Care Compare included post-acute residents who were clinically unstable after an acute hospitalization, which increases the difficulty of prediction. In contrast, long-stay residents in our study were more stable and hospitalization/ED visits are probably easier to predict. Which predictors were used can also explain part of the differences. Care Compare included over 250 clinical diagnoses (with many predictors having very low prevalence) from Medicare claims, while we relied on MDS assessments to obtain residents’ health status during their nursing home stay (e.g., case-mix index, function, symptoms).5 Another possibility is that CMS dichotomized many predictors (e.g., age) and separated variables into small subgroups (e.g., over 30 individual cancer diagnoses).5 Those methodological decisions can result in information loss and may introduce noises in predictive models, resulting in poor model performances. CMS may consider using similar predictors in this study to simplify their models and improve model performances.23

Our findings support that XGBoost algorithms can be used in the risk-adjustment methodology for nursing homes. Both the rates and rankings of rates from XGBoost were highly correlated with rates from logistic regression, suggesting XGBoost as a robust alternative model. The consistency in risk-adjusted rates also suggests that with proper risk adjustors, logistic regression is as good as XGBoost in evaluating nursing home quality. Rates from XGBoost were slightly lower but with more variation. The lower risk-adjusted rates were because of the higher predicted probabilities from XGBoost compared to logistic regression. Given the small improvement from XGBoost, logistic regression should continue to serve as the risk adjustment model.

This study also examined factors associated with risk-adjusted rates of hospitalization and ED visits from XGBoost. Nursing homes with chain affiliation had lower rates and may provide better quality of care.4 Nursing homes with a larger number of residents with dementia had lower rates, indicating that those facilities may provide better care to residents with ADRD. Nursing homes serving higher proportions of Medicare residents also reported higher rates. Facilities with more post-acute residents are more likely to hospitalize their long-stay residents with ADRD, which may be because of different patterns of practice or worse quality of care. Similar to a previous study, RN to total nursing staff ratio was associated with lower rates of both hospitalization and ED visits.18 RNs may be critical in managing emergent situations of residents with ADRD. The association of market factors and rates of hospitalization and ED visits was similar to that found in the general long-stay population.4 Moreover, facility and market factors associated with the XGBoost and logistic-regression adjusted hospitalization and ED rates were similar, indicating that using an alternative risk-adjustment model did not introduce systematic discrimination against a certain group of nursing homes. This also suggests that existing policy and quality improvement efforts should continue even if CMS switches to an alternate risk adjustment model.

What surprised us is that many facility factors that had previously been associated with resident outcomes were not correlated with rates of hospitalization and ED visits for residents with ADRD.4 For example, overall five-star rating, having a high proportion of BIPOC residents, and ownership were not significant in our models. This highlights the importance of developing ADRD-specific quality measures.

Our study has several limitations. 1. The study used data from 2012 which do not account for recent industry changes, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should examine model performances on more recent data. 2. While we anticipate no differences for those enrolled in Medicare Advantage, our study only included fee-for-service Medicare residents and additional work needs to assess the generalizability of our results to Medicare Advantage enrollees.42 3. The definition of dementia was based on diagnoses in the MDS and the number of residents with ADRD might be larger if Medicare claims were included to identify ADRD.43 4. Including race/ethnicity in the risk-adjustment models may inadequately adjust racial disparities, resulting in a smaller difference in the outcomes between nursing homes serving a large versus small proportion of BIPOC residents.44 5. Measurement error might be unavoidable for MDS items that can change over time (i.e. fever and vomiting).4

Conclusions and Implications

Machine learning models like XGBoost achieved good model performance for hospitalization and ED visits among long-stay residents with dementia. Resident assessment data provide strong predictive power for hospitalization and ED visits. XGBoost can be applied to calculate risk-adjusted rates that are consistent with classical logistic regression. Policymakers should continue using logistic regression in risk adjustment methods while evaluating the feasibility of using XGBoost in these methods.
