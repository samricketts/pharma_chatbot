INTRODUCTION

No treatments are currently available for Alzheimer disease (AD) (1). Serum levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), a large group of pro-oxidant and proinflammatory compounds, and particularly carboxymethyl lysine (CML) and the AGE precursor methylglyoxal (MG), are generated endogenously and by dietary consumption (2). Accumulating evidence in preclinical and small human clinical studies suggests that modifying dietary AGE consumption might affect the accumulation of AD pathology and dementia in older adults, especially those with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (3–5). However, there is a paucity of human data about the relationship of serum and brain levels of AGEs in older adults with postmortem indices of AD.

METHODS

We measured levels of AGEs in serum and brains of older adults. Clinical and postmortem diagnoses, brain harvesting procedures, tissue processing, and assessment of AD pathology are described in detail elsewhere (6). Serum from 12 months before death was used to avoid the potential effects of dying on serum AGE levels. Tissue from the superior temporal gyrus was used, as this region is affected early by AD (6). Four groups of decedents were included in this study: T2D+AD (n = 6); T2D/no AD (n = 10); no T2D+AD (n = 10); and no T2D/no AD (n = 10). T2D was defined based on the review of available medical records (a diagnosis of T2D or use of T2D medications). All T2D participants received sulfonylureas; none received insulin. CERAD criteria classified pathologic diagnosis of AD (6). Participants with stroke were excluded. Diagnoses of hypertension and myocardial infarction were defined according to the International Classification of Diseases—Ninth Revision. Frozen brain samples were thawed, and AGE protein content was determined by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for MG-H1 (3D11 mab) and CML (4G9 mab) (3). SPSS v. 24 was used for data analyses.

RESULTS

Clinical and AGE measures are summarized in Table 1. Analyses of variance demonstrated that adults with AD were older, but postmortem interval and sex were similar in all four groups. The groups significantly differed in levels of serum MG, brain MG, and serum CML, such that consistently the T2D+AD group had the highest levels of AGEs, while adults without T2D and without AD had the lowest. Results were essentially unchanged when analyses were adjusted for each of the demographic variables or cardiovascular diagnoses. There were strong correlations between serum and brain CML levels (r = 0.64; P&lt;.0001) and between serum and brain MG (r = 0.59; P&lt;.0001); higher levels in serum were associated with higher levels in the brain. Adjusting for each of the demographic or cardiovascular variables did not alter the results.

To compare each group to the non-T2D/non-AD (normal) group, we applied simple contrasts analyses. In all four comparisons, the group with both T2D/AD had significantly higher AGE levels compared to the non-T2D/ non-AD group (P values ranging from .002 for serum MG to .04 for brain CML). For serum MG, the T2D/non-AD group also had higher levels than the non-T2D/non-AD group (P = .03).

DISCUSSION

This study provides two novel observations. First, there is a strong and significant relationship between serum and brain AGE levels. Second, the highest brain levels of AGEs are found in participants who have both T2D and AD, and the lowest levels are found in those without either condition. Adjustment for sociodemographics or cardiovascular disease did not alter the results, supporting their robustness. Consistent with our results, CML, measured by immunocytochemistry in the hippocampus and frontal and temporal cortices, had the highest degree of expression in those with both AD and T2D and the lowest in those with neither of the conditions (7). We have previously shown similar relationships between serum and brain AGE levels in mice (3), but we believe this is the first demonstration of such associations in humans.

The correlations found were relevant to the superior temporal gyrus, a region affected by AD early in its course, potentially implicating AGEs in the pathogenesis of AD. This was a small cross-sectional study, and the findings need to be replicated in a larger clinico-pathologic longitudinal study.

We have previously demonstrated that a low-AGE diet may be effective in reducing circulating AGE levels in different clinical scenarios, including T2D (2). Despite their limitations, the current findings suggest that it may be possible to lower brain AGE levels by decreasing circulating AGEs and thereby reducing the risk of AD dementia in T2D and possibly in the elderly as a whole.
