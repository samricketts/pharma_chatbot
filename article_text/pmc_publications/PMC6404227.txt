Degradation of Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates has been considered as an attractive therapeutic and preventive strategy against Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, a in-situ, real-time, and label-free technique is still lacking to understand the degradation process of Aβ aggregates. In this work, we developed a novel method to quantitatively evaluate the degradation of Aβ fibrils by photoactive meso-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin under UV irradiation with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM).

Quartz crystal microbalance is a useful method to quantitatively evaluate the degradation of Aβ fibrils by porphyrin under UV irradiation.


Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder1 and has become a very serious health and social problem due to the increasing life-expectancy. The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque could be an important factor in the pathogenesis of AD.2 Therefore, there is considerable interest in understanding the process of Aβ aggregation and degradation, which is very helpful for new treatment development.3 A large number of studies have focused on the inhibition and degradation of Aβ aggregation.4 Prophyrin and its derivatives5 as one of the compelling therapeutic strategy have been widely applied to degrade amyloid fibrils by generating reactive oxidative stress (ROS). 6 The accumulation of amyloid-β aggregates can be degraded in the brain by photoactivatable compounds by Kanai’s group.7 To explore the degradation efficiency of AD’s amyloid fibrils is a significant work for evaluating the therapeutic strategy based photo-degradation. However, some widely used characterization methods of amyloid aggregation and degradation still have drawbacks. In Thiolfavin T (ThT) assay, it is difficult to real-time study amyloid aggregation or degradation process since small molecule may interfere with ThT test and the fluorescence would be decreased.8 Mass spectroscopy9 and western blot10 have the similar weakness of denatured procedures. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a powerful method to study the degradation of protein aggregates in real-time and with a label-free approach to address the problem above. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) can kinetically detect tiny mass change during chemical transformations and degradation process.11 Herein, we developed a QCM-based label-free method that can in situ quantitatively characterize the photo-degradation process of Aβ42 in real-time induced by meso-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrins (named as the porphyrins in the following text) with the UV light irradiation (Fig. 1).12 This work provided a feasible method to screen drug candidates to degrade amyloid fibrils in vitro, and evaluate the degradation efficacy of photo-active molecule and agent in photodynamic therapy not only on amyloid beta, also including tau,13 amylin,14 α-synuclein15 and mHtt (mutated form of the huntingtin protein)16 fibrils.

We studied the aggregation process of Aβ42 by ThT assay. The s-shape growth curve suggested a typical Aβ42 self-assembly (Fig. S1a). The short lag time could be ascribed to a quick nucleation of Aβ42 at 37°C. ThT fluorescence intensity reached a plateau in 24 hours, suggesting the conformation of β-sheet stabilized. β-sheet conformation was confirmed by CD (circular dichroism) spectra with the negative peak (215 nm) and the positive peak (208 nm) (Fig. S1b).17 The fibrillar morphology of Aβ42 aggregates were confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3a). Before the degradation of Aβ42 fibrils, we examined the stability and signal-to-nosise ratio of QCM in aqueous solution under UV light for 6 hours without and with porphyrin. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) can detect tiny mass change during the degradation process, that bases on the Sauerbrey equation to estimate the mass change of the sensor surface: (1) Δf =−2f02ΔmAμqρq

where ∆f is the shift of the frequency, ∆m is the mass change. f0 is the fundamental frequency of the QCM device, A the electrode area , μq is the shear modulus of quartz, and ρq the density of quartz. The ∆f decreasing represents the increment of the mass of the sensor surface.18 As shown in Fig. S2a, the frequency baseline of QCM is stable, which represents the mass variation per unit area. UV irradiation can cause a constant quantitative frequence uprush and go back to the normal when light is off. The addition of porphyrin cannot cause the baseline with any frequency shift (Fig. S2b).

The Aβ fibrils were added into the aqueous solution, and gradually adsorbed onto the gold chip as published by us. The adsorption of Aβ42 fibrils caused the frequency decreasing, and the frequency baseline was stable after 5-hours incubation until the adsorption is stabilized (phase I of Fig. 1, Fig. 2a). The addition of porphyrin didn’t interfere the frequency baseline after the adsorption of Aβ42 fibrils was stable (Figs. 2a and S2), suggesting porphyrin cannot degrade Aβ42 fibrils without UV irradiation. The adsorption of Aβ42 fibrils caused the frequency decreasing, termed as Δf1 (Fig. 2b). Three individual experiments were performed, and Δf1 is calculated to be ˜100Hz.

In the presence of porphyrin, the irradiation of UV can lead to the photo-degradation of Aβ42 fibrils (phase II of Fig. 1, Figs. 2b, 2c and 2d). The baseline can went back to normal when the UV light is off, exhibited the frequency increasing (phase III of Fig. 1, Fig. 2b). The increment of frequency was termed as Δf2, which is 72 Hz, 86 Hz, and 88 Hz in three independent experiments. Importantly, this novel method can quantitatively determine the degradation efficiency and rate by porphyrin. We defined the degrading efficiency of amyloid fibrils as: (2) η= Δf2/Δf1 × 100%

Where Δf1 is the frequency shifts caused by Aβ42 fibrils adsorption, and Δf2 is the increment of frequency, as measured by QCM.

The degradation rate is obtained via the derivation of the curve equation of the degradation process as: (3) Δ = dy/dt

Where y is the real-time frequency of the degradation process, and t is the real time of the degradation process.

With the different concentration of porphyrin (1 μM, 2.5 μM and 5 μM), the efficiency of degradation is 72%, 77% to 90%, respectively (Figs. 2b to 2e), which is obviously different from the sample without the treatment of photoactive porphrin. Interestingly, both the degradation process and the degradation rate of amyloid fibril conformed to the exponential function model by the nonlinear fitting, which presents an exponential variation (insert of Figure 2b, and Figure 2f). For instance, the porphyrin with the concentration of 5 μM presented the better degradation efficiency of Aβ42 fibrils, therefore, the degradation rate was explored further. In the real-time observation, the rate of degradation is not constant, the rate was high in the beginning, and gradually decreased exponentially over time. In general, the concentration effect of porphyrin on the degradation of amyloid fibrils displayed the difference.

QCM can provide a way to evaluate the degradation of amyloid fibrils with a label-free method based the systematic analysis above. To validate the accuracy of degradation level by QCM, we in-situ observe the morphology of Aβ42 fibrils mediated by photo-degradation on the gold chip by AFM. Compared to Aβ42 fibrils alone, obvious morphological changes of Aβ42 aggregates were observed in the presence of porphyrin after UV irradiation (Fig. 3). The heights of Aβ42 fibrils photodegradated by porphyrin with different concentrations were measured, and the average heights of Aβ42 fibrils alone is 6 nm (Fig. 3a), and decreased to 5.4 nm, 4.4 nm, and 3.6 nm, respectively with the concentrations 1 μM, 2.5 μM and 5 μM of porphyrin (Figs. 3b—e). Furthermore, in the presence of 2.5 μM and 5 μM of porphyrin, Aβ42 fibrils were photodegradated into Aβ42 particles. Strikingly, the amount of Aβ42 fibrils represented by the coverage on the gold chip dramatically decreased from 14.5% (Aβ42 fibrils alone) to 8.5%, 5% or lower photogradated by porphyrin with different concentrations (Figs. 3a—d, Fig. 3f). The heights of Aβ42 fibrils is positively correlated with the concentrations of porphyrin in the photodegradation, whereas the heights of Aβ42 particles is negatively correlated. The data of in-situ observation on QCM gold chips by AFM validates the QCM results, suggesting that the degradation effect of porphyrin is correlated with its concentrations. Importantly, QCM can be applied to interpret the kinetic of phorodegradation of protein aggregates, including degradation efficiency and rate. AFM can complementarily support the mechanism that Aβ42 fibrils were degraded into particles in the end stage. Therefore, QCM is a feasible, reliable and informative method to study the photodegradation of protein aggregates.

Finally, spectroscopy including the ThT assay and CD spectra were applied for validation. Under the same conditions, porphyrin with different concentrations was added into Aβ42 fibrils for 6-hours UV irradiation (Fig. 4a). A gradual decrement of ThT fluorescence intensity confirmed that porphyrin can strongly degrade Aβ42 fibrils in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 4a-b). Since the thioflavin T molecules binds to beta-sheet-rich structures,19 the fluorescence intensity represents the level of β-sheet secondary structures of protein aggregates. With the photodegradation, the β-sheet secondary structure as the major conformation of Aβ42 aggregates was also disrupted (Figs. 4a-b). CD spectra was applied further confirming the β-sheet secondary structure transformation of Aβ42 fibrils after the photodegradation (Fig. 4c). We observed that a gradual decrement of the CD spectra peak at 198 nm with the increasing concentrations of porphyrin (Figs. 4c-d), suggesting the photodegradation by porphyrin can lead to the decreasing of β-sheet secondary structure of Aβ42 fibrils. Therefore, spectroscopy (ThT and CD) and AFM all support the data of QCM as published.20

The degradation efficiency of amyloid fibrils by photo-active porphyrin under UV irradiation is proportional to the concentration of porphyrin with the other parameters constant. QCM is an easy way to evaluate the degrading efficiency of amyloid fibrils with photoactive porphyrin by QCM in-situ under UV irradiation, and also could become a novel strategy to analyze and assess the amyloid aggregate degradation.

In conclusion, we developed a novel label-free method that can kinetically and in-situ evaluate the degradation effect of photo-active porphyrin on Aβ42 fibrils under UV irradiation. This QCM method can provide quantitative analysis of the degradation efficiency and rate of Aβ42 fibrils combined with AFM, ThT assay and CD spectra, which makes up for the shortcomings of traditional methods. which provide may open up a route for assessing amyloid degradation and provides a new way for the investigation of various amyloid-targeted drugs aiming to eliminate the toxic amyloid aggregates.
