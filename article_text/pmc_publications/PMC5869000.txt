Multi-state models have been widely used to analyze longitudinal event history data obtained in medical and epidemiological studies. The tools and methods developed recently in this area require completely observed data. However, missing data within variables of interest is very common in practice, and it has been an issue in applications. We propose a type of EM algorithm, which handles missingness within multiple binary covariates efficiently, for multi-state model applications. Simulation studies show that the EM algorithm performs well for both missing completely at random (MCAR) and missing at random (MAR) covariate data. We apply the method to a longitudinal aging and cognition study dataset, the Klamath Exceptional Aging Project (KEAP), whose data were collected at Oregon Health &amp; Science University and integrated into the Statistical Models of Aging and Risk of Transition (SMART) database at the University of Kentucky.

1. Introduction

Longitudinal event history data commonly arise in medical and epidemiological studies, in which patients are observed over time and discrete types of events are recorded. Typically, events may be considered as transitions from one state to another (e.g., health to illness to death). The outcome data often consist of time to transition and the types of transitions that occur. Most often, patients are only observed at discrete time points (e.g., annually), which leads to interval-censored transition times and unobserved transitions.

Multi-state models [1,2] have been widely used to analyze such data. Siannis, Farewell, and Head [3] proposed a multi-state model for joint modeling of terminal and non-terminal events with application to a study of serious coronary heart disease. Abner et al. [4] built a six-state model to investigate the effects of two different types of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the development of dementia. Dodge et al [5] compared duration spent with different levels of functional disabilities between those with and without dementia by combining multi-state model with life table Kryscio et al. [6,7] provided a semi-Markov multi-state model to identify risk factors for transitions to MCI and dementia after accounting for the competing risk of mortality. Other applications of multi-state models can be found, for example, in the study of breast cancer [8] and liver cirrhosis [9].

This study was motivated by the Statistical Models of Aging and Risk of Transition project (SMART) at University of Kentucky. SMART aggregates data from 11 established extremely data-rich and well known longitudinal cohorts of older adults. The project was designed to study dementia in terms of the risk factors that lead to cognitive impairment or promote resistance to impairment [10]. Because studies collected data under different protocols, one issue with this project is that some risk factors of interest have a large proportion with missing values.

Missing values are an issue in a substantial number of statistical analyses. Most statistical analyses exclude observations with any missing variable values from the analysis. This method is called the complete case (CC) method. While applying the CC method is simple, it results in a loss of the information that resides in the incomplete cases as well as a potential for inducing bias. The limitations of CC method have been well discussed by [11]. Mean substitution (MS) is another method widely used in practice to deal with missing data. The MS method primarily works for missing continuous variables, and it imputes the missing values with the sample mean or its conditional mean calculated from the observed data. For missingness within binary variables, Schemper and Smith [12] proposed the method of probability imputation technique (PIT). By using the PIT method, the missing covariate values are replaced by an estimate for the probability that the unobserved value is equal to 1 based on the complete cases.

Multiple imputation (MI) has become one of the standard methods for dealing with missing values on the dependent variable [13]. MI assumes that the model used to analyze the multiple imputed data is the same as the model used to impute missing values [14]. When the dependent variable is missing at random inference is improved with MI. It is unclear if this strategy will improve inference when the missing data is confined to the covariates [15]. In addition, in most multi-state model applications, the dependent variable consists of a longitudinal vector of random length with unequal time spacing between successive components making it difficult to determine an appropriate imputation model for the missing covariates. An alternative solution is to impute the missing covariate values conditioning only on other observed covariates but this strategy could lead to bias [16,17].

To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies dealing with missing covariates data in the framework of multi-state models in the literature. The complete case (CC) method is the main option in applying multi-state models to such data. In this manuscript, we propose an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm when applying multi-state models to datasets containing multiple binary covariates with missing data. The application of this seemingly straightforward approach to account for missing data presents numerical challenges best handled in the discrete covariate case. Our simulation studies and empirical data application show that the proposed EM algorithm performs well for both Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) and Missing at Random (MAR) data.

The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the EM method in detail. In Section 3, simulation studies are carried out to compare the performance of the proposed method with the widely used CC method. We applied our method to the Klamath Exceptional Aging Project (KEAP) cohort in Section 4. In the concluding section, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the EM Algorithm.

2. The method

To detail the method, we will begin with a time-homogenous multi-state model with completely observed data. Then we will emphasize the EM algorithm in the case of multiple binary covariates with missing data. At the end of this section, we discuss the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix estimation.

2.1 Time-homogenous multi-state model

Let X(t), t≥0 be a continuous-time multi-state process [18] with a finite state space S={1,2,…,K}. Define the transition probability from state l at time s to state m at time t as plm(s,t)=P(X(t)=m| X(s)=l),s&lt;t.

The associated transition intensity is defined as αlm(t)={limΔt→0P(X(t+Δt)=m|X(t)=l)/Δtm≠l−∑k≠lαlk(t)m=l

In this study, we assume the Markov process is time-homogenous, thus we have αlm(t)=αlm. Let P(s,t) be the transition probability matrix with ( l, m)th entry as plm(s,t), and also let Q be the transition intensity matrix with (l, m)th entry as αlm. The transition probability matrix can be calculated from the transition intensity matrix by using the forward Kolmogorov equations [19], which leads to: P(s,t)=exp((t−s)Q),s&lt;t.

Suppose we have a baseline covariate vector Z=(Z1,Z2,…,Zp). A time-homogenous multi-state model with proportional intensities has the following form: αlm(Z|β)=αlm,0exp(βlmTZ)=exp(βlm,0+βlmTZ)

Here αlm,0=exp(βlm,0) is called the baseline intensity for the transition from state l to state m, and β=(βlm,0,βlm;l=1,⋯,K;m=1,⋯,K;m≠l), which represents all the parameters associated with the multi-state model.

2.2 Joint modeling of the response data and the partially missing covariates

Denote T=(T1,T2,…,TM) and X=(X1,X2,…,XM), where M is a random variable indicating the number of observations, Tj is the time of jth observation, and Xj is the corresponding state of the process X(t) at time Tj. Assume the observation process is ignorable [19] which means the observation time points Tj are determined by a process that is independent of the response X(t). Thus, we view the observation time points T as fixed. Rearrange the vector of covariates such that we have Z=(Zpm,Zcc). Here Zpm is the component whose values might be partially missing for some subjects, and Zcc is the observed component whose values are recorded for all subjects.

We assume that the covariate data are MAR. In this manuscript if a covariate is MAR, then the conditional probability of observing this covariate does not depend on the underlying value of the covariate, but may depend on the response X and the other observed covariates. We also assume that each component of Zpm is discrete. However, the completely observed covariates Zcc are allowed to be a mixture of both continuous and discrete variables.

We will view the partially missing covariates Zpm as random variables. The likelihood will be based on the conditional joint distribution of (X,Zpm) given (T,Zcc ), which we assume can be modeled as P(X,Zpm|T,Zcc,β,γ)=P(X|T,Z,β)P(Zpm|Zcc,γ).

Here β is the vector of parameters associated with the multi-state model, γ is a vector of the nuisance parameters associated with the distribution of the partially missing covariates; we assume β⊥γ, which means β is not a function of γ.

2.3 Likelihood under interval censored data and missing covariates

Let ti,j be the time point of the jth observation and xi,j be the corresponding observed state at time ti,j for subject i. Write ti={ti,1,ti,2,…,ti,mi}, and xi={xi,1,xi,2,…,xi,mi}. Since we make observations at a finite number of discrete time points, the transition times are interval-censored. If death is a state of interest, the exact death time can be retrieved generally, but the state just before death is unknown. In this example, we define δi=1 if the last observed state is death and δi=0 otherwise. Write zi=(zi,pm,zi,cc) and zi,pm=(zi,mis,zi,obs), where zi,mis and zi,obs are missing and observed components of zi,pm respectively. If the data are MAR, then the likelihood for subject i based on the observed data xi, zi,cc and zi.obs can be written as Li(β,γ|xi,zi,cc,zi,obs)=∑zi,misP(xi|zi,β)P(zi,pm|zi,cc,γ),

where the summation is over all possible underlying values of zi,mis.

Under the Markov assumption, we have P(xi|zi,β)=P(xi,1|ti,1)∏j=2miP(xi,j|xi,j−1,ti,j−1,ti,j,zi,β).

where, P(xi,1|ti,1) is the distribution of the baseline state, and the transition probabilities have the following form P(xi,j|xi,j−1,ti,j−1,ti,j,zi,β)={pxi,j−1,xi,j(tij−1,tij|zi,β)ifj≠mi[pxi,j−1,xi,j(tij−1,tij|zi,β)]1−δi[∑k≠Kpxi,j−1,k(ti,j,ti,j|zi,β)αkK(zi|β)]δiifj=mi

Since all components of zi,pm are discrete, we propose a multinomial logit model for P(zi,pm|zi,cc,γ). Suppose zi,pm has two components (zi,p1,zi,p2). Assume zi,p1 has A possible categories, and zi,p2 has B possible categories. We have log(πabπ00)=γab,0+γabTzi,cc, a∈{0,1,…,A−1},b∈{0,1,…,B−1}and(a,b)≠(0,0)

Here ∑a=0A−1∑b=0B−1πab=1;πab=P(zi,pm=(a,b)|zi,cc,γ),

and γ=(γab,0,γab;a∈{0,1,…,A−1},b∈{0,1,…,B−1}and(a,b)≠(0,0)).

The idea can be easily generalized to model zi,pm with more than two components.

The log-likelihood for all subjects is l(β,γ)=∑i=1nlog(Li(β,γ|xi,zi,cc,zi,obs)).

In most cases, the log-likelihood function l(β,γ) does not have a closed form, so directly maximizing the log-likelihood is not straightforward, especially when the nuisance parameter γ has a high dimension. To facilitate estimation, we propose using an EM algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs).

2.4 The EM algorithm

The E(xpectation)-step uses Qi(β,γ|β(s),γ(s))=E[li(β,γ|xi,zi)|xi,zi,obs,zi,cc,β(s),γ(s)]=∑zi,misli(β,γ|xi,zi)P(zi,mis|xi,zi,obs,zi,cc,β(s),γ(s)).

Here li(β,γ|xi,zi) is the complete data log-likelihood for subject i and has the form: li(β,γ|xi,zi)=log(P(xi|zi,β)P(zi,pm|zi,cc,γ))=lxi|zi(β)+lzi|zi,cc(γ)

Denote wi,(s)=P(zi,mis|xi,zi,obs,zi,cc,,β(s),γ(s)), then we have Q(β,γ|β(s),γ(s))=∑inQi(β,γ|β(s),γ(s))=∑i=1n∑zi,miswi,(s)lxi|zi(β)+∑i=1n∑zi,miswi,(s)lzi|zi,cc(γ)

Write Qx|z(β|β(s),γ(s))=∑i∑zi,miswi,(s)lxi|zi(β)

and Qz(γ|β(s),γ(s))=∑i∑zi,miswi,(s)lzi|zi,cc(γ),

now the “Q function” presented above is separated into two parts. Note that Qx|z(β|β(s),γ(s)) is a function of the multi-state model parameter β and does not contain the nuisance parameter γ. And Qz(γ|β(s),γ(s)) is a function of only the nuisance parameter γ. The calculation of weights wi,(s) can be done by using Bayes’ theorem. For subject i, we have wi,(s)=P(zi,mis|xi,zi,obs,zi,cc,β(s),γ(s))=P(xi|zi,β(s))∗P(zi,pm|zi,cc,γ(s))∑zi,misP(xi|zi,β(s))∗P(zi,pm|zi,cc,γ(s)).

For the M-step, maximization of the function Q(β,γ|β(s),γ(s)) can be achieved by maximizing Qx|z(β|β(s),γ(s)) and Qz(γ|β(s),γ(s)) separately. However, there is no closed form solution for maximization of Qz(γ|β(s),γ(s)) or Qx|z(θ|θ(s),γ(s)). Thus, we use the Newton-Raphson method for the maximization.

2.5 Asymptotic variance estimation

The EM algorithm does not provide the estimates of asymptotic variances as its byproduct. Here we obtain the variance estimates by finding the observed information matrix. One way to derive the observed information matrix is to take the derivatives directly from the observed data log-likelihood. Note that the observed data log-likelihood has the form l(θ,γ)=∑i=1nlog(Li(θ,γ|xi,zi,cc,zi,obs)), and it does not have a closed form. We use the forward difference method to compute the Hessian matrix of l(θ,γ). Suppose f(x) is a real function and twice differentiable regarding to a p-dimensional vector x, then the Hessian matrix of f(x) at x0 can be approximated as: ∂2f∂xi∂xj|x=x0=f(x0+hiei+hjej)−f(x0+hiei)−f(x0+hjej)+f(x0)hihj

Here ei is the ith coordinate vector, with its ith component equal to 1 and all others equal to 0, and hi is the step size.

3. Simulations

In this section, we study the performance of the proposed EM method through simulation studies. Four cases are considered here: MCAR data with about 45% of subjects missing covariate data.

MCAR data with about 70% of subjects missing covariate data.

MAR data with about 45% of subjects missing covariate data.

MAR data with about 70% of subjects missing covariate data.

To assess potential advantages of the proposed method (EM), we compare it to the widely used CC method as well as to the full data analysis (FULL). In the full data analysis, all covariate values are completely observed and there is no missing data. It is a benchmark for evaluating our method’s performance in general. The comparisons were made through percent bias (% Bias), empirical standard error (ESE), asymptotic standard error (SE) and 95% confidence interval coverage probability (95% CP). The total number of subjects in each simulated dataset is 500 or 1000. All results are based on 500 simulation datasets, and calculations are made by using PROC IML in SAS 9.3 [20].

3.1 Generating the Dataset

Datasets were generated from an “illness-death” model with backward transitions and three states, including one absorbing state (state 1 = Health, state 2 = Illness, state 3 = Death). The model has the following transition intensity matrix: Q(Z1,Z2)=(α11exp(β12,0+β12,1Z1)exp(β13,0+β13,2Z2)exp(β21,0) α22exp(β23,0+β23,1Z1)000).

Here α11=−(exp(β12,0+β12,1Z1)+exp(β13,0+β13,2Z2))

and α22=−(exp(β21,0)+exp(β23,0+β23,1Z1)).

There are 7 parameters , (β12,0,β13,0,β21,0,β23,0,β12,1,β23,1,β13,2), in this model. The first four parameters estimate the baseline transition intensities, and the last three parameters estimate the effects of covariates on the transition intensities. We set the true values of these parameters to be (2,−2.5,−3,−2, 0.5, 0.3, 0.4) respectively. Covariates (Z1,Z2) are both binary variables with the following joint mass function: P(z1,z2)={0.1if z1=0, z2=0 0.4if z1=0, z2=10.3if z1=1, z2=00.2if z1=1, z2=1

Observations are assumed to be taken annually. State 3 means death in this model; thus, the transition time into state 3 is recorded exactly, while the state just before death is unknown. A common censoring time of 25 years is used, which results in right-censored transition times for those who remain in state 1 or state 2 at that time. The covariates are baseline covariates, and their values do not change over time.

3.2 Estimations with MCAR data

We study two MCAR data cases. In the first case, we set covariates Z1 and Z2 missing for random observations. Z1 is missing with probability 0.2 and Z2 is missing with probability 0.3. Thus, about 6% of subjects are missing both Z1 and Z2, and about 45% of subjects have at least one covariate value missing. We denote this type of missing data MCAR 1. In the second case, we set Z1 missing with probability 0.4 and Z2 missing with probability 0.5. Here, about 20% of subjects are missing both Z1 and Z2, whileabout 70% subjects have at least one covariate value unobserved. We denote this type of data MCAR 2. Note that the data are MCAR since the probability of missingness is independent of both the observed data and the underlying values of missing covariates.

The results for the two MCAR cases are presented in Table 1. When the data are MCAR, both CC method and the proposed EM method work well. The percent bias (% Bias) is relatively small, the 95% confidence interval coverage probabilities (95% CP) hover around 95%, and the estimated asymptotic standard errors are close to the empirical standard error for all 7 parameters. Moreover, the results are close to those provided by the FULL data analysis. We note that the proposed EM method is more sufficient than the CC method since estimates provided by the EM method have smaller standard errors than those provided by the CC method. This is likely due to a larger sample size.

3.3 Estimations with MAR data

In the first case of MAR data, we set covariate Z1 missing if the first transition happens in the first year and set covariate Z2 missing if the second transition happens after year 8. Approximately 45% of subjects have at least one covariate value missing. In the second case, we set covariate Z1 missing if the first transition happens in the first 3 years and set covariate Z2 missing if the second transition happens after year 6. This results in a dataset with approximately 70% subjects having at least one covariate missing. Both types of data are MAR but not MCAR, since the missingness of covariates is dependent on the observed data but independent of the underlying values of the missing data.

The results for the MAR data are presented in Table 2. When the data are MAR but not MCAR, in general the CC method performs poorly. The bias of the estimates provided by the CC method can be very large, as large as 105% in our simulation studies. Also, the coverage95% CP could be much less than 95%. The proposed EM method still works well in both of these MAR cases.

4. Application

In this application, we used the KEAP cohort from the SMART database. KEAP is a population-based study of the oldest-old residents of the Klamath Basin, a rural area of Oregon. Subjects enrolled in this study were at least 80 years old. Subjects are visited in their homes by a geriatric research nurse every six months for neuropsychiatric testing and structured clinical interview [21].

The cognitive status of each patient was classified into one of the following two states at each assessment: No Dementia (ND) and Dementia. A third state, Death, is also included in the model as a competing risk for Dementia. State ND includes both normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Subjects who were in state ND at the previous visit may die before the next scheduled assessment or may transition to Dementia at the next scheduled assessment. Subjects who were in state Dementia may die before the next assessment. There are no backward transitions from state Dementia to state ND. Figure 1 presents the model state structure.

The dataset contains 419 subjects. At baseline, there were 351 (83.8%) subjects in state ND and 68 (16.2%) subjects in state Dementia. The number of observations for each subject ranges from 2 to 22 with mean±SD of 7.7±4.9. Cognitive assessments are administered to each subject with mean time interval between consecutive assessments 0.58±0.46 years.

Covariates to be examined as potential risk factors for transitions indicated in Figure 1 are: baseline age (Bage), female gender (Female), low education (LowEdu; defined as high school or less), APOE- ε4 (APOE4; with or without an ε4 allele), and baseline high blood pressure (HBP). Bage, Female, and LowEdu are all fully observed. APOE4 and HBP are missing for some subjects. There are 80 (19%) subjects with missing APOE4, 206 (49%) subjects with missing HBP, while34 (8%) subjects have both APOE4 and HBP missing, and 252 (60%) subjects have at least one of these missing. The missing values are MCAR due to administrative reasons. Table 3 lists a summary of these risk factors.

Table 4 lists the observed transition frequencies and row percentage for the original 419 subjects, as well as just the 167 subjects with complete data. In the original data, 4.1% ND subjects transitioned to Dementia state, and 6.9% ND subjects died without Dementia, and 26.8% of subjects with Dementia had died by the end of the study follow-up (as available in the SMART data). In contrast, for the CC data, 3.2% of ND subjects developed Dementia, and 3.4% died without Dementia. Among subjects with Dementia, 19.8% had died by the end of the study.

We used a time-homogenous Cox Markov model to investigate the effects of potential risk factors on these transitions, which have the following forms: αlm(Z)={exp(βlm,0+βlmTZ),if l≠m−∑h≠lαlh(Z),if l=m

Here Z=(Bage,Female,LowEdu,APOE4,HBP). Bage was centered at 80 prior to analysis.

First, we conducted an available-case (AC) analysis, in which we dropped the two covariates with missing values, APOE4 and HBP, out of the model. Without APOE4 and HBP in the model, the data are fully observed. The “msm” R-package [22] could be used to fit the model in this instance. Then, we fitted the data with the proposed EM method after adding APOE4 and HBP in the model. At last, we also conducted a CC analysis for the model.

Table 5 lists the estimated hazard ratios (HR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for risk factors on each transition path obtained by these three methods. The results from the AC method show that the baseline age increases the HR for all three paths, from ND to Dementia, ND to Death, and from Dementia to Death. Its effect on paths from ND to Dementia and from Dementia to Death are statistically significant (P value&lt;0.05). Neither female sex nor low education level had a statistically significant effect on any path. The estimated effects of baseline age, female gender and low education level obtained by applying the proposed EM method are close to those of the AC analysis. We also find that APOE4 has a statistically significant effect on increasing the HR for the transition path from ND to Dementia. High blood pressure has significant effects on paths from ND to Dementia and ND to Death. ND subjects with baseline high blood pressure have a decreased HR for developing dementia, while they have higher mortality rate than those without high blood pressure at baseline. Compared to the results of the AC analysis and the proposed EM method, the CC method is less efficient. The 95% CIs of the HRs are generally longer than those estimated by the AC method and the EM method. Also, due to a reduced sample size the CC method failed to indicate the significant effects of baseline age on transition path from Dementia to Death and of APOE4 on path from ND to Dementia. The significant effect on baseline age on path from Dementia to Death was indicated by both the AC method and the proposed EM method. The effect of APOE4 on the transition path from ND to Dementia is well studied in literature [4, 6,7, 23].

5. Discussion

Multi-state models are useful tools to analyze longitudinal event history data and have been widely applied. Missing covariate values in data has been an issue in practice. Most of the currently available methods and software packages use the CC method in the case of missing covariates data. The problem associated with the CC method is that it will provide biased estimates if the data are not MCAR. Even if the data are MCAR, dropping all cases with missing covariates is inefficient and might cause convergence problems in particular applications. In contrast, the proposed EM method worked well for both MCAR and MAR data. In the case of MCAR data, the proposed EM method was also more efficient than the CC method.

Standard multiple imputation methods are also very difficult to carry out for multi-state models. Constructing an appropriate imputation model for the missing binary covariates data is difficult when the observed data contains longitudinal response data with random lengths and unequal spaces. An even more challenging problem to consider is the case of a missing data on a continuous covariate since then the computation of the Q function involves multiple integrals.

Likelihood-based methods are common approaches to the analysis of missing data [11]. The observed data likelihood contains both model parameters and nuisance parameters used to model the distribution of missing covariates. When data have the general missing pattern with multiple missing data covariates, we would need a relatively large number of nuisance parameters to model the missing covariates, and directly maximizing the observed data likelihood is difficult. By using the EM algorithm, we were able to separate the model parameters from the nuisance parameters and make the maximization of the likelihood possible.

EM algorithms have been used to deal with missing data problems in other areas. Ibrahim [24] provided an EM algorithm for generalized linear models with incomplete covariate measurements. Lin and Ying [17] also used EM algorithm in the Cox regression model with missing covariate data. Applying EM algorithm in the multi-state model framework is more difficult than in the above mentioned areas. First, closed formulas usually do not exist for both the expectation step and the maximization step when applying the EM algorithm to multi-state models with missing covariate data. Numerical methods have to be used to get the expectation log-likelihood function and to maximize of the expected complete data log-likelihood. Another issue encountered with missing covariate data in the multi-state model is the number of unknown parameters, which is usually large. In applying maximum likelihood type methods to deal with missing covariates data, a probability model with nuisance parameters has to be constructed for the missing covariates. Plus, each covariate would have different coefficient parameters on different transition paths. These two factors lead to a relatively larger numbers of parameters compared to other situations. Our proposed EM algorithm would enable researchers to estimate the nuisance parameters and model covariates coefficients separately.

Our study showed that the proposed EM algorithm is efficient in dealing with missing covariates data with a general missing pattern. This method is limited to only missing discrete covariates and it is assumed that the missing covariate is binary. A discrete variable having multiple values can be always converted to multiple binary variables. However, a discrete covariate with multiple values might present problems if one value of the covariate is rarely observed. Further, in the case of the missing continuous covariate, the Q function in the E-step cannot be written as a weighted sum of the complete data log-likelihood. This follows because the Q function involves multiple integrands in the continuous covariate case. One possible solution to deal with missing continuous covariates in multi-state models is to approximate the E-step using Gaussian quadrature or Monte Carlo simulations.
