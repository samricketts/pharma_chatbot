INTRODUCTION:

Examination of pathologic, anatomic, and cognitive relationships have been limited in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) with underlying Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology.

METHODS:

Spatial relationships between tau PET, cortical thickness, age, and naming on the Boston Naming Test (BNT) in PPA with biomarker evidence of AD (PPA-AD) were examined.

RESULTS:

Higher tau PET burden was associated with atrophy and younger age. There was a significant left-lateralized relationship between lower BNT and more atrophy, and between lower BNT and increased tau burden. Variance in naming was primarily shared between tau and atrophy (51%), but naming was uniquely explained more by atrophy (32%) than tau (16%). Higher left anterior temporal tau burden was associated with greater 1-year rate of decline in naming.

DISCUSSION:

PPA-AD has a similar relationship between abnormal biomarkers as first described in amnestic AD, with differing spatial extent, reflecting the left-lateralized nature of the language network.

pmc1. Introduction

Biomarkers obtained in late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) suggest a temporal ordering of events1, including the detection of progressively abnormal amyloid, then abnormal tau, followed by neurodegeneration and downstream clinical deficits. Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is sometimes (~40%) caused by underlying AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) and called the aphasic variant of AD2. Previous biomarker studies have combined all non-amnestic (i.e., atypical) phenotypes with suspected ADNC, making it unclear to what degree the relationships between age, tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and cognition exist for PPA-AD. The present study focused on two primary analyses: (1) to explore the spatial relationships between atrophy, tau, and their covariance with age in PPA-AD; (2) to examine the relationship between decline in object naming with markers of atrophy and tau pathology in PPA-AD. Below, we describe the prior body of work and our accompanying hypotheses.

Previous studies using the tau PET tracer 18F-flortaucipir have found associations between markers of neurodegeneration and tau pathology in aging3–6 and in clinical syndromes with suspected ADNC7–10, consistent with post-mortem studies11–13. For PPA-AD compared to amnestic AD, post-mortem studies report increased NFT burden in left-lateralized language cortices and a higher language-cortex-to-entorhinal-cortex NFT ratio11,14. NFT density shows a strong association with premortem MRI atrophy within language regions in PPA-AD13. Four previous studies have examined PPA-AD in a mixed phenotype cohort with suspected ADNC (i.e., typical and atypical variants) and found elevated cross-sectional tau PET burden was associated with MRI8,10,15 or FDG PET7 markers of neurodegeneration. These studies likely did not have power to examine a PPA-AD group in isolation (5, 1, 7, and 6 PPA-AD participants, respectively)7,8,10,15. Prior studies have also found rates of tau accumulation associated with rates of atrophy in mixed Alzheimer cohorts10,16. To our knowledge, no previous study has examined the cross-sectional relationship between atrophy and tau PET burden in PPA-AD alone. In line with the studies above, we hypothesized that increased flortaucipir PET burden in PPA-AD would have a strong relationship with atrophy within the language network.

The importance of the relationship between age and pathology in atypical AD is an emerging concept. Post-mortem studies have found that hippocampal sparing AD, with higher cortical-to-hippocampal tangle pathology, was associated with younger age compared to typical or limbic predominant AD17. Imaging studies of impaired patients have found younger age is associated with a higher cortical-to-entorhinal tau PET ratio18, greater cortical tau PET uptake7,10,19,20, and higher rates of tau burden over time16. Thus, we hypothesized younger PPA-AD patient age would be associated with higher cortical tau burden.

Object naming impairments are common in PPA-AD21. Prior studies of PPA have established focal left-lateralized MRI atrophy patterns can be tied to specific subdomains of language22 and the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) as critical for naming23. Similar to atrophy, ATL flortaucipir burden explains the majority of variance in language composites7,9,24. Importantly, atrophy shows a stronger relationship with cognition compared to tau9. Similar to the studies of tau and neurodegeneration, these studies likely did not have sufficient numbers to investigate the relationship between cognition and tau PET in PPA-AD alone (5, 8, and 4 PPA-AD participants, respectively)7,9,24. We hypothesized that measures of atrophy and tau in the left ATL would have a strong association with object naming in PPA-AD. Further, given the proposed temporal ordering of biomarkers in AD1 and previous work above9, we hypothesized that atrophy would better explain the variance in naming compared to tau burden.

The relationship between biomarkers and future decline in cognition has been studied less extensively. Most studies have done classification experiments, using baseline biomarker data to predict future “conversion” between dementia diagnostic categories25. For example, a study found hippocampal atrophy and higher CSF total-tau-to-Aß1–42 ratio was associated with a higher risk of progression from amnestic mild cognitive impairment to dementia of the Alzheimer’s type26. Dumurgier and colleagues, in an aging cohort, examined the association between numerous imaging modalities and CSF measures with neuropsychological tests and found CSF total-tau was the best predictor of a 3-year decrease in the Mini-Mental State Examination27. No previous study has examined the relationship with tau PET and change in cognition in PPA-AD. Based on the previous studies in amnestic phenotypes and consistent with the notion that baseline tau predicts rate of atrophy10, which is tightly coupled to rate of cognitive decline1, we hypothesized that baseline tau PET would have a stronger association with rate of decline in naming compared to baseline atrophy in PPA-AD.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants

PPA-AD participants were retrospectively recruited from Northwestern’s Mesulam Center for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer Disease based on the presence of: (1) a root diagnosis of PPA made by a clinician (M.-M.M.), (2) a positive 18F-flortaucipir tau PET scan on a Siemens Vision scanner, (3) structural MRI on a 3T Siemens Prisma, and (4) neuropsychological testing. Below, we describe the details of data collection and processing for each modality.

As of March 2020, 19 PPA-AD participants fulfilled criteria, of which 15 had additional biomarkers of AD, including CSF, amyloid PET, and/or autopsy diagnosis. Twelve participants had returned for follow-up neuropsychological testing a year after the initial visit.

Thirty-eight cognitively normal controls (NC) with structural MRI were retrospectively recruited and used to visualize areas of peak atrophy. NC group demographics are available in Supplemental Table 1. There were no significant differences in age, sex, education, or handedness between PPA and NC groups (all p &gt; 0.05).

Northwestern’s Institutional Review Board approved the study. Informed consent was obtained from each participant in accordance with the principles established by the Declaration of Helsinki.

2.2. Neuropsychological measures

Object naming was assessed with the Boston Naming Test (BNT)28, where participants are presented with 60 line drawings of variable difficulty, administered in order from common objects (e.g., “tree”) to less familiar objects (e.g., “trellis”) based on their frequency of occurrence in language. The Western Aphasia Battery29 aphasia quotient (WAB-AQ) was used as a measure of aphasia severity. The 6 most difficult items (items 10–15) from the WAB repetition subtest were used to assess repetition. Auditory lexical-semantic processing was assessed with a subset of moderately difficult items (items 157–192) from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT). Grammatical processing was judged from 15 noncanonical sentences from the Northwestern Anagram Test30 and 15 noncanonical sentences from the Sentence Production Priming Test of the Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences. The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, and Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (ADLQ) were used to characterize non-language and functional integrity. Handedness was determined by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.

2.3. Imaging and fluid data acquisition

MR imaging for all PPA-AD and NC participants was performed on the same 3.0-Tesla Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Munich, Germany). A 1mm3 T1-weighted MPRAGE was acquired, using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3 (ADNI-3) sequence, recording 176 sagittal slices with TE=2.98ms, TR=2300ms, TI=900ms, 9° flip angle. A 0.8mm3 T2-weighted SPACE was acquired with real-time motion correction, recording 208 sagittal slices with TE=564ms, TR=3200ms.

Amyloid and tau PET data were acquired on either a Siemens Biograph TruePoint/TrueV or a Siemens Biograph Vision. All tau PET for the primary analyses were acquired on the same Siemens Biograph Vision. PPA-AD participants were administered a bolus intravenous injection of either 10.0 mCi (370 MBq ±10%) of 18F-flortauicipir, 10.0 mCi (370 MBq ±10%) 18F-florbetapir, or 8.1 mCi (300 MBq ±10%) 18F-florbetaben. At fifty minutes (florbetapir), 80 minutes (flortaucipir), or 90 minutes (florbetaben) post-injection, participants underwent a low-dose CT and counts were recorded for 20 minutes in list-mode. Four 5-minute frames were reconstructed with an iterative ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm with attenuation correction, using the ADNI-3 protocol, then motion corrected and averaged into a single 3D volume.

For participants that underwent a lumbar puncture, CSF was collected into polypropylene tubes, centrifuged, frozen on dry ice within one hour after collection, and shipped to Athena Diagnostics (Worcester, MA).

2.4. Imaging and fluid data processing

The T1 and T2 sequences above were input to FreeSurfer v6.0.0 (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) and Statistical Parametric Mapping v12 (fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and were used for surface reconstruction, calculation of cortical thickness, generation of Desikan-Killiany parcellations, tissue probability maps, and segmentation of the cerebellar lobules.

For the inclusion criteria of a positive flortaucipir PET scan, we used the previously described31 temporal meta region of interest (ROI) &gt; 1.27 SUVR threshold. Briefly, the meta-ROI is the volume-weighted average of Desikan-Killiany bilateral entorhinal, amygdala, fusiform, parahippocampal, inferior and middle temporal cortices referenced by the inferior cerebellar grey.

For the amyloid PET quantification, the FreeSurfer volume-weighted method was used to determine positivity, florbetapir &gt; 1.11 or florbetaben &gt; 1.20 SUVR32,33.

To generate CSF results, an Aβ1–42/t-tau index (ATI) was calculated as (Aβ1–42)/(240+1.18*t-tau). Abnormal ATI was &lt; 1.0 and abnormal p-tau &gt; 61pg/ml with bands of uncertainty from 0.8 to 1.2 ATI and from 54 to 68pg/ml p-tau.

Two types of partial volume correction (PVC) were applied to the tau PET images: (1) FreeSurfer’s modified Müller-Gärtner PVC for the surface-wise analysis and (2) the Rousset PVC from Baker and colleagues34 for the ROI-wise analysis. Based on studies of the Siemens Biograph Vision35, a 3.5mm3 point spread function was used for both PVC pipelines. The average intensity of the inferior cerebellar grey, after hot-spot clusters were removed34, served as the reference region for both methods.

2.5. Biomarker evidence of Alzheimer disease

As part of the inclusion criteria for the study, PPA-AD participants were required to have a positive flortaucipir PET scan, temporal meta-ROI &gt; 1.27 SUVR31. The average meta-ROI for the 19 PPA-AD was 2.32 SUVR, ranging from 1.62 to 3.12.

The majority of PPA-AD participants (n=15) underwent either CSF fluid collection or amyloid PET and had an amyloid biomarker consistent with underlying ADNC. Four logopenic variant PPA participants did not have an amyloid marker. The average CSF ATI and p-tau average was 0.28 (±0.18) and 134.3 (±37.3) pg/ml, respectively. The average florbetapir and florbetaben SUVR was 1.60 and 1.78, respectively. One mixed subtype PPA-AD participant came to autopsy with high ADNC, without secondary pathologies.

All participants were suspected to have a primary AD neuropathologic diagnosis. All flortaucipir images were manually reviewed for the patterns of off-target binding in white matter that have previously been shown in autopsy-confirmed corticobasal degeneration36 or TDP-43 cases37.

2.6. Statistical analysis

For the primary surface-wise analyses, to test the relationship between tau PET, atrophy, age, and naming, a general linear model was fit at each vertex in fsaverage space. Cluster-wise corrections for multiple comparisons were done with Permutation Analysis of Linear Models (PALM). Briefly, the tests were corrected with a family wise error rate of 5% (FWEcorr), additionally setting the cluster-wise pcorrected&lt;0.025 (0.05, Bonferroni for each hemisphere), with 5000 Freedman-Lane permutations per contrast. PALM corrected results are displayed at both FWEcorr cluster forming threshold of p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.001.

For the ROI-wise analyses, ten a priori left hemisphere Desikan-Killiany regions, previously found to have a strong association with progressive atrophy in PPA38, were used: temporal pole, inferior frontal, fusiform, supramarginal, inferior parietal, superior temporal, middle temporal, inferior temporal, transverse temporal cortices, and banks of the superior temporal sulcus. To test associations between tau PET, MRI atrophy, and BNT scores, the non-parametric Kendall’s rank correlation was used, and the alpha was set with a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) q=0.05.

To examine the shared and unique contributions of each modality to predict naming, we ran ROI-wise multiple regressions of BNT ~ ROIthickness + ROItau. In ROIs that remained significant after FDR correction, a commonality analysis was used to decompose the explained variance into shared and unique variance.

T-tests and χ2 were used to assess demographic differences. Percent change in neuropsychological test score was annualized and calculated with respect to the baseline visit: Test%change=V2test−V1testV1test×yearsbetweenV1,V2×100

V1=baseline visit #1; V2=return visit #2; years between V1,V2=days between baseline and follow-up divided by 365

3. Results

3.1. Participants

Table 1 provides the PPA-AD cross-sectional and longitudinal subgroup characteristics. The 19 PPA-AD participants were right-handed, 65.7 years old on average, with an average of 57% correct on the BNT. On non-language measures, the average Rivermead total correct was 8.9 out of 10, ADLQ was 21% on average, with only 1 participant indicating moderate impairment (&gt;33%). The CDR-global frequency of 0, 0.5, and 1.0 scores were 4, 14, and 1, respectively.

One year after the first visit, a subgroup of 12 PPA-AD participants returned for follow-up neuropsychological testing. Naming, assessed with the BNT, declined 42% on average. Importantly, word comprehension remained intact, with an average decline of 7% on the PPVT.

3.2. Patterns of left lateralized atrophy and tau burden in PPA-AD

As expected, the pattern of atrophy and tau PET binding were highly left lateralized (Fig. 1A and B, respectively).

3.3. Tau PET is associated with cortical thickness and age

First, we explored the relationship between atrophy and tau burden. In line with previous reports8,10, increased MRI-measured cortical atrophy was significantly associated with increased tau PET burden, predominantly in the bilateral inferior and middle temporal gyri, ATL, insula, and cuneus (LH cluster FWEcorr p=0.0002; RH cluster FWEcorr p=0.0002; Fig. 2A).

Next, we examined the role of age on tau burden and MRI atrophy independently. Consistent with previous reports in early-onset AD10,39, higher tau PET intensity was significantly associated with younger participant age within the temporoparietal junction and adjacent superior temporal regions (LH cluster FWEcorr p=0.036; RH temporoparietal cluster FWEcorr p=0.007; RH frontal cluster FWEcorr p=0.043; Fig. 2B). There was no significant relationship between age and cortical thickness.

Given the relationships between tau and atrophy and then age and tau in spatially distinct cortical regions, the next analysis included all three measurements in a combined model. The Vertextau ~ Vertexthickness + age model identified significant clusters across left and right association cortices. Higher tau was associated with lower thickness and younger age (LH cluster FWEcorr p=0.0002; RH cluster FWEcorr p=0.0002; Fig. 2C).

3.4. Atrophy and tau PET are associated with baseline naming

A significant vertex-wise relationship was identified between lower cortical thickness and lower BNT scores, with a left-lateralized temporal lobe dominant pattern expected for a language test. Areas included the LH temporal pole, inferior and middle temporal, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; LH FWEcorr cluster p=0.0062; Fig. 3A). In the right hemisphere, only parts of the RH ATL, and the most anterior parts of the RH insula and OFC survived multiple comparisons (RH cluster FWEcorr p=0.027).

Higher tau PET burden was associated with lower BNT scores throughout the left and right inferior temporal lobes, fusiform, temporal poles, OFC, and parts of each hemisphere’s insula (LH cluster FWEcorr p=0.0026, RH cluster FWEcorr p=0.0018; Fig. 3B). The notable difference in the association between cortical thickness or tau PET on naming was the RH inferior temporal lobe, which was significant for the association between naming and tau PET only.

3.5. Regional analyses replicates surface-wise comparisons and shows naming is explained more by atrophy than tau burden

An ROI-wise analysis was completed to: (1) replicate the surface-wise approach above with a different PVC algorithm34 that has been widely used in past studies examining tau, atrophy, and cognition6,10; (2) conduct an ROI-wise commonality analysis, decomposing the variance explained across cortical thickness and tau PET to predict naming. A total of 10 LH a priori perisylvian temporal ROI were examined.

The surface-wise results were largely similar to the ROI-wise results, 7 regions were significant for the positive correlation between BNTbaseline and ROIthickness or ROItau after FDR correction (Kendall τ and p-values in Supplemental Fig. 1A and B, respectively).

The commonality analysis examined the shared and unique variance in atrophy and tau PET to predict BNT, within each ROI independently. To determine which ROIs should be used, a linear model was fit with BNTbaseline ~ ROItau + ROIthickness. Nine out of 10 regions survived FDR correction, only the transverse temporal was non-significant (p=0.593; Supplemental Fig. 1C). The majority of variance explained (average R2 = 0.57 ± 0.12) was shared between tau and thickness (ROItau and ROIthickness together shared 51% of the variance on average ± 19% across the 9 ROIs). Consistent the with notion that neurodegeneration is temporally synced closer in time to cognition1, ROIthickness uniquely accounted for 32% ± 21% of the variance in BNT scores compared to ROItau, which accounted for 16% ± 5% (Fig. 4).

3.6. Greater left anterior temporal tau burden is associated with larger decline in future naming

Last, we examined the relationship with longitudinal decline in naming. The 1-year decline in naming was not significantly associated with cortical thickness (Fig. 5A); however, greater left ATL tau burden was associated with a larger decline on the BNT (cluster FWEcorr p=0.017; Fig. 5B).

4. Discussion

The development of PET tracers that bind to paired helical filament tau has provided the opportunity to explore the spatial relationships between AD tau pathology, loss of cortical thickness, age, and cognition. This study examined the associations between tau burden with 18F-flortaucipir PET, structural MRI derived atrophy, age, and naming performance on the BNT in participants with PPA and suspected ADNC.

The relationship between tau PET and atrophy has been studied in older cognitively normal participants3–6 and amnestic or non-amnestic dementia7,8,15. Significant associations have been previously found, but they have frequently been weak, not surviving multiple comparisons correction, or in small, localized regions scattered throughout the brain. We found a relationship in the inferior, middle, and medial temporal regions between baseline thickness and tau PET. Compared to previous studies, our findings may be explained by the earlier age of onset in PPA-AD compared to late-onset AD and therefore lower probability of co-pathology40.

The relationship between higher tau PET burden and younger age in posterior temporal and parietal cortex has been described previously in mixed Alzheimer cohorts7,10. Whitwell and colleagues found a similar direction of effect in PPA-AD in an ROI-wise analysis of tau PET burden and age19. Given that we did not find a relationship between cognition and age, it may be that younger patients require a higher burden of pathology to present with significant clinical symptoms.

Previous studies found the strongest associations with the BNT or naming tasks in the left ATL measured with structural MRI23,41,42, FDG PET43, tau PET7,9, or post-mortem measured pathology44. Mesulam and colleagues found the left ATL was the critical neural tissue for mediating the transcription of non-verbal concepts into verbal words, essential for object naming23. Prior studies found an association between the BNT and inferior or middle temporal atrophy in either PPA, amnestic dementia, or frontotemporal dementia41,42,45. A recent PPA study found spatially distinct anatomical correlates of the BNT when accounting for error types46. We found significant associations between naming and either tau PET or cortical thickness throughout the left perisylvian temporal cortex. The relationship between tau PET and BNT was more widespread and included right inferior temporal regions. This is consistent with previous studies in amnestic Alzheimer dementia47, which found correlations between cognition and tau PET are more widespread compared to atrophy. But the findings are at odds with the more focal finding of tau PET on composite measures of naming, confined to the left ATL, in studies with mixed Alzheimer cohorts7,9,24. The composition of the participant groups may have played a role in the differences as the nature of naming disruptions may be different.

Using a statistical technique called commonality analysis to decompose the variance explained, we found that atrophy and tau PET shared half the variance explaining naming. Of the remaining ~50% variance, cortical thickness explained twice as much variance in the BNT compared to tau PET, in line with studies showing the tight coupling between cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of neurodegeneration and cognition21,38,48.

One of the novel parts of this study was the examination of longitudinal decline in cognition with baseline tau PET in PPA-AD. We found that a single cross-sectional assessment of tau burden is associated with the 1-year decline in naming, while there was no relationship between cross-sectional measures of atrophy and subsequent decline in naming. In line with the hypothetical curves of progressively abnormal AD biomarkers1 that describe progressively abnormal tau, then atrophy, then cognition, the leading indicator of cross-sectional tau may better predict downstream decline in cognition. These results are in line with previous studies, showing cross-sectional tau burden is associated with future rate of atrophy10, which is associated with rate of cognitive decline38. Future studies will be needed to assess longitudinal tau, longitudinal atrophy, and cognition together.

This study examined tau pathology with flortaucipir PET binding, which may not detect early forms of Alzheimer tau pathology49. Further, Alzheimer pathology may be found alongside TDP-43, vascular, Lewy body, or argyrophilic grain pathology50, which may contribute synergistically with AD pathology to explain cognitive changes. Early-onset forms of AD have been shown to have less extensive co-pathology compared to late-onset40, and co-pathology is uncommon in PPA2. This limitation may be resolved as more robust in vivo biomarkers are developed and as autopsy-confirmed studies emerge. A secondary limitation of the present study is differing clinical presentations of PPA may have varying spatial distributions of pathology. Further research with larger sample sizes will be needed to validate these findings.

The present study found a relationship among cross-sectional tau PET burden, age, and cortical thinning. Spatially similar cortical atrophy and tau burden were associated with loss of naming. While PPA-AD has a different clinical presentation than typical late-onset amnestic Alzheimer dementia, the relationship between tau, atrophy, and cognition was in line with the hypothetical model of cumulative biomarker burden1 where tau burden, a leading indicator, was more predictive of future decline in cognition, while atrophy, a lagging indicator, explained more variance in current cognition.
