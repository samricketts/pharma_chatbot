Background and Purpose

The limitations inherent to the current methods of diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) have constrained the use of early therapeutic interventions to delay the progression of MCI to dementia. This study evaluated whether quantifying enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) observed on MR imaging can help us differentiate MCI from cognitively healthy controls and, thus, have an application in the diagnosis of MCI.

Methods

We automated the identification of EPVS in brain MR Images using a custom quantitative program designed with MATLAB. We then quantified EPVS densities for MCI patients (n=14) and age-matched cognitively healthy controls (n=15), and compared them to determine if EPVS density can serve as an imaging surrogate for MCI diagnosis.

Results

Quantified as a percentage of volume fraction, EPVS densities were calculated to be 2.82±0.40 v/v% for the controls and 4.17±0.57 v/v% for the MCI group in the subcortical brain (p&lt;0.0001), and 2.74±0.57 v/v% for the controls and 3.90±0.62 v/v% for the MCI cohort in the basal ganglia (p&lt;0.0001). Maximum intensity projections exhibited a visually conspicuous difference in the EPVS distributions for an MCI and a control patient. Using ROC curve analysis, the sensitivity and the specificity for using EPVS as a differentiating biomarker between MCI and controls were determined to be 92.86% and 93.33% respectively.

Conclusion

EPVS density was found to be significantly higher in MCI compared to age-matched healthy control subjects. EPVS density, therefore, may be a useful imaging biomarker for the diagnosis of MCI.


INTRODUCTION

Perivascular spaces (PVS) are cavities filled with cerebrospinal and interstitial fluids that lie between the perforating blood vessels of the brain and the pia mater.1,2 They act as conduits for the drainage of interstitial fluid and solutes from the brain.3 These spaces can become dilated and are termed enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) when large enough to be visible by imaging.4 The presence of EPVS has been shown to be increased in a variety of physiological and pathological neurological conditions, such as aging, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and Parkinson’s disease.5–8

Current research suggests that MCI can be a harbinger of AD development, with annual rates of progression variably reported to be 10% to 15%.9–12 People with MCI exhibit cognitive impairment beyond that expected for their age, a feature shared with AD, with no overt impact on their activities of daily living.13 The MCI population is of particular clinical interest since it is hypothesized that early therapeutic interventions can be used to delay or even thwart their deterioration to AD.14 The challenge lies in detecting MCI early enough for such interventions to be successful. Several assessment tools, such as the Mini Mental State Exam15, are used by physicians to clinically assess for MCI. However, a failure to detect the condition, especially in its early stages, is a significant limitation of these tools11,16,17 and underscores an emergent need for more quantitative diagnostic approaches.

Aided by a discovery of several sensitive and specific imaging biomarkers, including the EPVS, MR imaging continues to find an increasing utility in the diagnosis of AD.18 Logically, these biomarkers hold the most promise for becoming indicators for MCI as well.19,20 Owing to the difficulties involved in their quantification, EPVS are a relatively under-studied biomarker.21 Current evaluation of their properties, such as their shape, size, and numbers, remains a subjective process.22 Development of objective methods for quantifying these properties is, thus, highly desirable with a significant potential for clinical utility.

A quantitative method for mapping brain PVS in MR images of healthy and AD patients acquired on a 7T whole-body MR scanner has previously been reported in Cai et al.23 Using a train of algorithms, including pixel-wise spatial gradient, the hyperintense PVS were segmented and their density calculated as a percentage of volume fraction (v/v%). The initial results demonstrated that the PVS density is significantly higher in the AD patients when compared to healthy controls.23

In this retrospective study based on brain imaging datasets collected previously for other research purposes24, we aim to evaluate if the quantitative EPVS MRI at clinically prevalent 3 Tesla (3T) can help us differentiate MCI from age-matched healthy controls. We will test our method on patients diagnosed with amnestic MCI (aMCI), one of the two main subtypes of MCI, the other being non-amnestic MCI. Individuals with aMCI have memory impairment as their predominant symptom and have a higher risk of conversion to AD than non-amnestic MCI individuals, who present with a decline in cognitive domains other than memory and convert more frequently to other dementia forms, such as Lewy body dementia.25,26

METHODS

Subjects

The subjects, 15 controls and 14 patients who met the Peterson (2004) criteria for aMCI, were recruited from the Penn Memory Center/Alzheimer’s Disease Center at the University of Pennsylvania between year 2011 and 2014.

To be included, all subjects had to be 55–89 years old, at least two years post-menopausal or surgically sterile if female, fluent in English, with 6 grades of education or sufficient work experience to exclude mental retardation, in good health without any diseases that could interfere with the study, possess visual and auditory acuity to allow for neuropsychological testing, have a geriatric depression scale of less than 6, and willing and able to complete all the required study procedures. Additional inclusion criteria for the patients included a diagnosis of probable aMCI, and a MMSE score between 24 and 30. Exclusion criteria included significant neurological diseases other than aMCI or AD, presence of devices contraindicated to MR Imaging, history of major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse or dependency within the past 2 years, illnesses or medical conditions that could lead to difficulty complying with the study protocol, anxiety disorders, and pregnancy.

The mean age for the controls and the aMCI patients were 66.3 ± 9.5 years and 71.9 ± 6.2 years respectively (p = 0.07). The male to female ratios were 7:8 and 6:8 for the control and the aMCI groups respectively (p = 1.00). Education, measured in years of schooling, was 15.6 ± 2.6 years for the controls and 16.9 ± 2.8 years for the aMCI cohort (p = 0.19). The subjects’ performance on the Mini Mental State Exam was 29.5 ± 1.0 for the controls and 26.9 ± 1.7 for the aMCI group (p &lt; 0.001), on the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease Word List Memory Task was 24.7± 2.9 for the controls and 16.2 ± 3.2 for the aMCI group (p &lt; 0.001), and delayed recall was 8.7 ± 1.8 for the controls and 3.4 ± 2.1 for the aMCI group (p &lt; 0.001).27

All of the subjects provided informed consent, and the research was performed in compliance with the standards set by the National Institutes of Health, the Institutional Review Board, and the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association. All subjects underwent high-resolution T2-weighted MRI of brain.27

MRI

T2-weighted MR images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Trio scanner with an 8-channel array head coil at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. In total, 30 coronal slices of the middle brain were acquired with slice thickness of 2 mm and 0.6 mm gap, covering a total of 78 mm. The other parameters for the T2-weighted scans included TR/TE = 5310/68 ms, echo train length = 15, echo spacing = 18.3 ms, phase oversampling = 0%, field of view = 180 × 180 mm2, image matrix = 448 × 448, rendering in-plane resolution of 0.4 × 0.4 mm2. The total acquisition time for the T2-weighted dataset is about 7 min.27

Image Processing

To automate the segmentation of EPVS in the brain scans, a custom script was written using MATLAB (R2012b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). We will focus on the EPVS in the white matter and the basal ganglia, areas which previous research has identified as regions of interest for studying the EPVS.4

For each image, first, pixels of background noise were excluded using a preset threshold to create a brain mask. To segment out the white matter and the subcortical nuclei from the brain, two successive rounds of three-level and six-level k-means clustering were performed to filter out the cerebrospinal fluid and the cortical grey matter respectively. Hole-filling, edge-detection, and contrast-enhancement algorithms were employed throughout this process to prevent EPVS from being filtered out as well as keep the edges, with their high spatial gradient, from being erroneously labeled as EPVS in the subsequent steps. Pixel-wise spatial gradient was then calculated using MATLAB function “imgradient”. EPVS were then automatically identified as pixels with a spatial gradient and top 92% of gradient values. The threshold was determined heuristically given that pixels for brain tissues have 8% of the lowest gradient values. Eventually, the function, “bwconncomp,” was applied to preserve the fusiform structures corresponding to the EPVS with prescribed object size (20 to 200 pixels) and generate EPVS maps of the brain. False positives and false negatives rates for the automatic EPVS segmentation method were estimated based on visual counting from 10 randomly selected brain slices from 10 distinct subjects, of which 5 were aMCI and 5 were controls.

The density of EPVS as a volume fraction (v/v%) was calculated as the total volume of segmented EPVS divided by the total volume of the white matter and the subcortical nuclei.

EPVS images from brain slices were interpolated to create a 3D volume of isotropic voxels (0.4mm × 0.4mm × 0.4mm) as was done in Cai et al.28 Using ImageJ (U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA), maximum intensity projections (MIPs) were created. These projections were color-coded using the cyan-hot color map.

MIPs and the calculation of EPVS density were limited to the brain volume bounded anteriorly by the anterior-most part of the hippocampus and posteriorly by the anterior-most part of the cerebellum because of two reasons. Firstly, this is consistent with previous studies that have identified this region, which contains structures such as the subcortical nuclei, as the most relevant area for studying the EPVS distribution.4 Secondly, the cerebellum was excluded given that it contains fine linear structures with high and positive spatial gradients that can be erroneously labeled as EPVS by our algorithms.

To specifically study the EPVS distribution within the basal ganglia, the region of interest for most previous studies on EPVS4, masks corresponding to these subcortical nuclei were manually drawn in reference to the original T2-weighted brain images. MIPs and the calculation of EPVS density in the basal ganglia were then separately performed.

Statistical Analysis

Experimental results are presented as mean ± standard deviation. To determine whether a statistically significant difference existed between the EPVS densities in the healthy controls and the MCI cohorts, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests were performed with the statistical significance defined as p &lt; 0.05. A Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) was generated to evaluate the performance of our method for differentiating aMCI individuals from controls using EPVS density as an imaging biomarker. EPVS densities were used as the test variables where the state variable was considered to be the ‘true’ group category obtained from thorough clinical evaluation. The best cut-off sensitivity and specificity values of the ROC curves were determined using Youden's index that maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity. The performance of our method for differentiation of aMCI from healthy controls was subsequently assessed by these sensitivity and specificity cut-off values as well as the diagnostic accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC). The ROC analysis was carried out in MATLAB (R2012b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).

RESULTS

Figure 1 outlines the major steps involved in the automatic identification of EPVS on an MR image of an aMCI subject. The algorithm sequentially masked the brain (Figure 1b), removed cerebrospinal fluid with the 1st order k-means clustering (Figure 1c), removed cortical gray matters with the 2nd order k-means clustering (Figure 1d), created pixel-wise spatial gradient map after manually removing the brain stem and generated the mask for pixels with high and positive spatial gradient values (Figure 1e), and select EPVS based on object size after removing edges of the brain structures (Figure 1f). Finally, the EPVS were color-coded and subsequently overlaid on the original brain image (Figure 1g).

Figure 2 shows side-by-side comparison of the automatically segmented EPVS on MR images of a cognitively normal (Fig 2a, b) and an aMCI subject (Fig 2c, d). Compared to visual counting of the number of EPVS pixels, the automatic EPVS segmentation from 10 randomly selected brain slices produced 0.77 ± 0.29% of false positive pixels and 19.39 ± 6.92% of false negative pixels. The difference between the false positive and false negative pixels amongst the control and the aMCI subjects was not statistically significant (p = 0.44).

Figure 3 depicts the MIPs generated from ordered middle-brain slices of EPVS images in a control and an aMCI subject. These MIPs images were generated for the white matter and subcortical nuclei as a whole (Figure 3a, b) and separately for the basal ganglia (Figure 3c, d). There is a visually appreciable increase in the density of EPVS in the aMCI subject as compared to the cognitively healthy subject in both the white matter and subcortical nuclei as well as the basal ganglia.

Quantified as a percentage of volume fraction, EPVS density in the white matter and the subcortical structures was calculated to be 2.82 ± 0.40 v/v% for the controls and 4.17 ± 0.57 v/v% for the aMCI group with p &lt; 0.001. EPVS density in the basal ganglia was 2.74 ± 0.57 v/v% for the controls and 3.90 ± 0.62 v/v% for the aMCI cohort with p &lt; 0.001. Figure 4 depicts these findings in a box plot form.

Figure 5 depicts the ROC for using EPVS as a differentiating biomarker between aMCI and controls. The AUC is 0.96, with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) between 0.89 and 1.00 and the standard error (SE) being 0.04. The threshold value that achieves the best compromise between sensitivity (92.86%) and specificity (93.33%) is 3.35 v/v%.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we quantified the EPVS density with an automatic segmentation algorithm in MCI patients and investigated if EPVS density may be a useful imaging biomarker for the diagnosis of MCI at the clinically available magnetic field strength of 3T.

Improving upon the previous study at 7T,23 we implemented the EPVS quantification method for the MRI dataset collected at a clinical 3T scanner. Compared to 7T EPVS MR imaging, the lower magnetic field strength of these scanners entails a lower detection sensitivity and a reduced signal to noise ratio.29 However, it carries the benefit of a more homogenous radiofrequency B1 field, a feature that is appreciated for segmenting EPVS based on pixel-wise spatial gradient. Most importantly, EPVS quantification from clinically accessible 3T MRI has a higher potential for clinical applications.

The algorithm used in this study performed better at correctly identifying true EPVS at the cost of capturing all of the true EPVS pixels in any given brain slice, as evidenced by its lower false positive rate and the comparatively higher false negative rate. This can be explained by the threshold values used in the segmentation process. These values were selected via trial-and-error with the aim of maximizing identification of true EPVS, minimizing segmentation of unrelated structures, and utilizing consistent threshold parameters across all subjects. Assuming healthy brains are associated with smaller PVS, this conservative PVS recognition strategy may overestimate the difference between MCI and healthy subjects to some extent. Our results show that the EPVS density in aMCI patients is significantly higher than that in the controls, both in the subcortical brain as a whole and in the basal ganglia separately. This suggests that quantitative EPVS density may be a sensitive imaging biomarker with utility in aiding the diagnosis of aMCI.

The detection of MCI remains one of the biggest clinical challenges in the management of neurological pathologies.11,16,17 MCI is a relatively common condition in the elderly, with its prevalence reported to be 15 to 20% in people aged 65 or older.30 Current research suggests that the MCI population progresses to dementia at a greater rate than those without this condition.31,32 Anywhere from 32 to 38% of people with MCI progress to AD in 5 years or longer.32,33 Annual rates of progression have been estimated to be 10 to 15%.9–12 These findings have naturally generated an interest in using disease modifying agents to not only preserve cognitive function in MCI individuals but also slow their conversion to dementia.14 Given the significant difference between the EPVS densities in MCI patients and cognitively intact individuals as evidenced by our results, incorporating EPVS quantification into the diagnostic workup of MCI could help eliminate some of the prevailing uncertainty surrounding its diagnosis, allowing for earlier intervention and better clinical outcomes.

Past literature has demonstrated that the entire CSF space and the cerebral ventricular volume increase due to brain tissue atrophy in MCI and AD patients.34 Measurements of total CSF space or cerebral ventricular volume with MRI may provide a simpler quantitative method to examine neuropathological changes associated with MCI and AD.35 However, given that PVS functions as a conduit for the drainage of interstitial fluid and solutes from the brain, the measurement of EPVS reflects brain functionality that may be independent from brain tissue atrophy. Hence, EPVS may be an earlier functional signature than structural brain atrophy during the aging process. Testing such a hypothesis will be our future research interest.

Although ROC analysis demonstrated over 90% of sensitivity and specificity for the differentiation between MCI patients and healthy controls based on the quantified EPVS density, some caution is warranted since fundamentally increased EPVS density may not be a specific feature of MCI. It has been observed in a variety of other physiological and pathological neurological conditions, such as normal aging, hypertension, and Parkinson’s disease.36–39 EPVS density may therefore be best used to substantiate a suspected diagnosis of MCI in the presence of its other clinical features as opposed to being used as a screening test. Nevertheless, our method’s higher sensitivity underscores its potential as a confirmatory test for the early diagnosis of MCI.40

One limitation of this study is that we confined our analyses to the middle region of the brain because the cerebellum posed a unique challenge to our segmentation process. A large volume of the cerebellum is occupied by its finely-structured cortex41, which appears hyperintense with respect to its surrounding tissues in T2-weighted MR images, a feature it shares with EPVS. This leads our algorithm to misidentify the cerebellar cortex as part of the EPVS. Thereafter, we excluded this brain region from our analysis. Additionally, given that the quantification of pixel-wise spatial gradient can be affected by signal to noise ratio, spatial resolution, and so forth, our technique for EPVS segmentation requires the MR images to be collected under the same imaging setups as well as with the same acquisition sequence and parameters. This may pose a challenge for large-scale multi-center studies, or studies involving the use of MRI scanners from different vendors. A way to make the EPVS quantification consistent across multiple sites and vendors remains to be studied.

A second limitation of this study is the lack of data on the prevalence of vascular disease, such as diabetes and hypertension, within the study populace. Such conditions can precipitate microvascular changes within the brain and are well-known risk factors for lacunar infarcts. The presence of subcortical infarcts was additionally not assessed within these subjects. Since both lacunar and subcortical strokes leave MRI footprints within the regions that contain the PVS, they can confound our algorithm, causing it to mistake those footprints for EPVS. Whether our algorithm performs just as well in patients with known vascular disease and brain infarcts would be an intriguing question to probe in our future studies. Additional features of the MCI-afflicted brain, such as the severity of hippocampal atrophy, could also be incorporated in future investigations in order to provide a more detailed picture of the imaging features of MCI.

Another limitation is the lack of 3T MRI data for AD patients. Although Cai et al. has already established that the EPVS density is similarly increased in AD patients in MR images acquired at 7T,23 it would be interesting to compare the EPVS level between MCI and AD patients at 3T in order to understand the time course of PVS enlargement during the development of AD from cognitively intact, to MCI, and finally, to clinically manifest dementia or AD. With large sample size, it will also be interesting to see if EPVS density may discriminate out MCI patients whose clinical symptoms are less evident and who have low neuropsychiatric testing scores. This would further enhance the utility of EPVS quantification as a tool for monitoring dementia progression and regression in response to treatments.

CONCLUSION

Quantitative EPVS segmentation method allows for automatic mapping of EPVS from MR images acquired at a clinical 3T MRI scanner. EPVS density was found to be significantly higher in aMCI compared to age-matched cognitively healthy control subjects. Therefore, EPVS density may be a useful imaging biomarker for the diagnosis of MCI.
