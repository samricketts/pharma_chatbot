Purpose of Review

Neurodegenerative diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, and related traits have highly complex etiologies but are also highly heritable and identifying the causal genes and biological pathways underlying these traits may advance the development of treatments and preventive strategies. While many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified variants contributing to polygenic neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric phenotypes including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder (BPD) amongst others, interpreting the biological roles of significantly-associated variants in the genetic architecture of these traits remains a significant challenge. Here we review several ‘omics’ approaches which attempt to bridge the gap from associated genetic variants to phenotype by helping define the functional roles of GWAS loci in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders and traits.

Recent Findings

Several common ‘omics’ approaches have been applied to examine neuropsychiatric traits, such as nearest-gene mapping, trans-ethnic fine mapping, annotation enrichment analysis, transcriptomic analysis, and pathway analysis, and each of these approaches has strengths and limitations in providing insight into biological mechanisms. One popular emerging method is the examination of tissue-specific genetically-regulated gene expression (GReX), which aggregates the genetic variants’ effects at the gene-level. Furthermore, proteomic, metabolomic, and microbiomic studies and phenome-wide association studies will further enhance our understanding of neuropsychiatric traits.

Summary

GWAS has been applied to neuropsychiatric traits for a decade, but our understanding about the biological function of identified variants remains limited. Today, technological advancements have created analytical approaches for integrating transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, pharmacology and toxicology as tools for understanding the functional roles of genetics variants. These data, as well as the broader clinical information provided by electronic health records, can provide additional insight and complement genomic analyses.

Introduction

Developments in Neurodegenerative and Neuropsychiatric Genetics

Thousands of analyses have been undertaken to identify genomic variants that influence neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric traits, motivated by observations of enrichment of these traits in families and high estimates of heritability [1, 2],. The complex polygenic etiology of many neurodegenerative disease and neuropsychiatric traits has been theorized for more than 50 years [3], laying the foundation for the persistent effort to identify many genetic risk factors of modest to small effect. Among the most popular approaches to identify such genetic risk factors is the genome-wide association study (GWAS), which compares the frequency of variants in genomic DNA sampled from persons with these diseases or traits to the frequency of variants in genomic DNA sampled from unaffected individuals in order to estimate variant-specific effect sizes [4].

More than a decade of work has now been invested in elucidating the genomic factors underlying neuropsychiatric traits via GWAS. Fueled by inexpensive genotyping technologies and powerful computational tools, these unbiased, large-scale genomic studies of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric traits have identifed hundreds of risk-associated variants in large samples [5], some with as many as 500,000 cases and controls [6]. Unlike potentially causal environmental risk factors, heritable genetic risk factors are typically considered immutable and are likely to point to biological mechanisms which more directly influence these traits and thus may point to therapeutic targets [7]. However, more often than not, the precise biological function of a trait-associated variant is unclear.

Current Challenges in Interpreting GWAS Results

The causal influence of a genomic variant identified by GWAS is rarely direct; most GWAS associations have been detected outside of protein-coding regions or functional elements in the genome [8]. Often, researchers will ascribe the effects of such variants to genes or functional elements located physically nearby, a practice that leads to weak assumptions about the relevant molecular pathways impacting disease risk [9]. This can lead to the implication of the wrong gene affecting the phenotype of interest, as happened with the association of variants in the FTO gene with obesity. Detailed multi-omics characterizations of the associated variants in this locus demonstrated that FTO variants interacted with the promoter of the homeobox gene IRX3, regulating expression of IRX3 in the brain, and Irx3-deficiency in a mouse model was correlated with large reductions in body mass [10].

When GWAS signals emerge on large haplotypes with strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) spanning multiple genes or other functional elements, identifying the putative causal locus is greatly complicated and may require additional information such as functional validation or fine mapping in more genetically diverse populations.

Further complicating interpretation is that genomic effects may operate indirectly. Two examples of such effects include variants associated with type 2 diabetes that impact risk through a direct effect on body mass index [10, 11] and lung cancer variants that are associated with smoking [12]. Alternatively, detected variants may produce pleiotropic effects that impact a range of clinical outcomes. For instance, CACNA1C is reported to be associated with both bipolar disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) [13]. Therefore, understanding the broader clinical significance of genomic variants is an essential step in the challenge of characterizing the genetic etiology underlying neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric traits.

Today, technological advancements in transcriptomics [14], metabolomics [15], proteomics [16, 17], pharmacology [18] and toxicology [19], as well as the broader availability of clinical data through large repositories of electronic health records can provide additional insight and complement genomic analyses [20, 21].

Previous Methods to Identify the Function of GWAS Loci

Several popular methods currently exist to bridge the gap from significant GWAS associations to biological functions or disease mechanisms. These include nearest-gene mapping, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis, pathway analysis, and functional annotation. As we detail below, each of these approaches integrates current understandings of and assumption about the human genome, which may introduce limitations in understanding the molecular causes of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric traits.

Nearest-Gene Mapping

Since over 90% of variants with statistically significant associations are not located in protein-coding regions [8], nearest-gene mapping has been historically the most common way to interpret the potential biological function of GWAS signals. Nearest-gene mapping is premised on the idea that loci in close proximity to associated variants in the genome are often co-inherited and exhibit LD. Therefore, although the identified variants might not be located within genic regions, the assumption in nearest-gene mapping is that the observed effect is due to strong LD between the tested variant and an untested functional variant in the neighboring gene. For example, in a large GWAS of SCZ, 108 significant SNPs were identified, however only 8% of them fell within 20kb of either side of the nearest neighboring genes [5]. Further complicating interpretation, the distance used to identify the “nearest gene” is not consistent across studies. The NCBI SNP database dbSNP suggests a cutoff of 2 kilobases (kb) upstream of a gene and 0.5kb downstream [22], but some studies have used wider ranges, as far as 100-500kb [23, 24]. Although the typical LD region is about 12-25kb, only about two thirds of phenotype-associated SNPs in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) GWAS catalog are located 10kb or less away from the nearest gene, and 15% are greater than 100kb from any gene [25]. Because the functional genomic risk variant may be transacting, SNPs may affect distant genes instead of the nearest one [26]. Today it is unknown how many SNPs associated with neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric traits have been incorrectly mapped because the assumptions required by nearest-gene mapping may not reflect actual biology [24, 27].

LD can also result in association signals that span broad segments of the genome, making the process of identifying a sentinel signal that is causal within a GWAS peak difficult. LD patterns vary between populations, meaning that trans-ethnic fine-mapping approaches provide an opportunity to leverage naturally-occurring differences in LD around causal variants to sometimes drastically reduce the search space. This approach was recently used as follow-up to a large-scale GWAS of SCZ in East Asians, allowing for further refinement of 70% of GWAS-identified loci [28], and has similarly been applied to studies of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) across individuals of African, East Asian, and Israeli-Arab ethnicity [29].

Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis

Since most identified loci are in non-coding regions of the genome, an alternate approach to nearest gene mapping is assessing the involvement of the effect variant in gene regulation to assess their function. An eQTL is a variant that is associated with RNA expression levels in datasets where RNA abundance and genomic data have both been measured, such as GTEx [30–32]. Cis-regulatory eQTLs are typically located within in 1Mb of transcription start sites [33]. Thus, eQTLs link genetic variants to transcript expression levels, and offer an opportunity to identify a possible underlying biological function of trait-associated SNPs. Indeed, associated SNPs identified via GWAS are more likely to be eQTLs than the other SNPs captured on high-throughput GWAS platforms [34]. In AD, 12 SNPs identified by GWAS were evaluated to examine their function on gene expression in brain tissue; three were found to be significantly correlated with gene expression [35]. Similar results have been reported in SCZ. A total of 40 significant eQTLs were found in 6,192 SCZ candidate SNPs, after multiple test correction in an analysis of whole blood expression [36].

Beyond the SNP-level, several methods have been proposed which attempt to integrate GWAS-identified loci and eQTL data to identify candidate genes, such as summary data-based Mendelian randomization analysis (SMR) [27] and the Bayesian test for colocalisation (Coloc) [37]. In SCZ, 34 genes were reported from SMR analysis, of which only two genes were the nearest gene to associated variants [27]. Because, RNA expression can be tissue-specific, time-dependent, and affected by environment, large sample sizes are often needed to detect eQTLs robustly and determine accurate estimates of their effect size on gene expression [28]. Additionally, measuring eQTLs in the pathogenically-appropriate tissue can be challenging, especially for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric traits. Furthermore, unobserved non-genetic factors may confound the effects of genetic variants on gene expression and bias the estimation of eQTL effects [38, 39].

Pathway analysis

Pathway analysis is an approach to aggregate the effects of individual variants or genes at the level of biological pathways. The EMBL-EBI GWAS Catalog has collected over 2,400 studies and over 28,000 trait-associated SNPs; 1,223 of these SNPs have genome-wide significant associations with neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric phenotypes [40, 41]. However, it is a challenge to directly interpret the underlying mechanism of disease from large numbers of significant variants or even genes. Biological pathway datasets collect genes with similar functions, cellular components, or metabolic pathways. There are several available pathway annotation databases using different criteria, e.g. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [42], Gene ontology (GO) [43, 44], Reactome [45], and Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) [46]. Pathway analysis has been used in studies of several different neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including AD [47, 48], SCZ [49, 50], and BPD [51]. As pathway analyses are still based on the variant-level associations and their mapping to identified genes, linking GWAS loci to candidate genes is both critical and highly challenging. Furthermore, biological pathway annotation databases are all knowledge-based, with some resources focusing heavily on experimentally-derived information and others including more loosely-defined connections through literature mining; thus, the completeness and accuracy of the pathway annotation datasets determines the reliability of the pathway analyses using them.

Functional Annotation

Functional annotation integrates different sources of knowledge regarding potential functions of genetic variation and aims to provide a possible pathological link from genetic variant to disease outcome. Information from functional annotation varies by annotation tool, and may include information on transcriptional regulation, RNA splicing, translational modification, protein function, and even evolutionary implication [52]. There are several software tools available for annotation now, including ANNOVAR [53], SnpEff [54], SeattleSeq Annotation [55], and dbNSFP [56]. Previously, functional annotation has been applied to the GWAS findings in some neuropsychiatric diseases, e.g. SCZ [57], mood disorder [58], and AD [48, 59]. Although functional annotation can provide a variety of possible functional explanations, only a small proportion of variants can be successful annotated with bioinformatic methods given our current knowledge of molecular interactions. For instance, in AD, only six SNPs can be annotated with a biological function from 195 total AD-associated SNPs from GWAS [48].

Multi-Omics Methods for Estimating Genetically-Regulated Gene Expression

Recently developed methods coming into wider use examine tissue-specific effects of genetic variation and allow for the consideration of the aggregated effects of associated variants. As noted above, gene expression is influenced by many factors, including genetic variation via eQTLs. This portion of variation in gene expression explained by genetic factors (so called “genetically-regulated gene expression” or, GReX) may avoid some of the pitfalls of measured gene expression at a single time point, because genetically-controlled traits often represent lifelong influences, but will not account for the environmental, batch, or temporal effects included in measured gene expression [60]. GReX achieves two simultaneous goals: 1) the aggregation of multiple SNP effects into a single functional unit which increases statistical power for discovery by reducing the burden of multiple test correction, and 2) the immediate implication of a specific gene (and potentially higher biological mechanisms) for each significant result as a candidate for influencing disease risk. Furthermore, because gene expression has become a critical factor in identifying new drug targets [61], genes whose effect on risk is mediated through gene expression are strong candidate targets for therapeutics.

Methodologically, two approaches to GReX estimation have been proposed: elastic net regression, as implemented in PrediXcan [62], and Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Models (BSLMM), as implemented in TWAS [63]. In PrediXcan, GReX panels are built with elastic net regression using cross-validation to prevent model over-fitting [62]; elastic net regression is an excellent variable selection method for “wide” datasets with many predictors/features [64] and a sparse architecture, where a limited number of features have relatively large effect sizes. The TWAS-implemented BSLMM approach for GReX estimation assumes a mixture of both sparse and broad polygenic effects [63], allowing for many small effect sizes distributed across many predictors. Comparisons of these two approaches indicate that on the tissue level, gene expression traits appear to be driven by a set of sparse, large-effect variants [65]. Previous analyses also illustrate that interactions among eQTL variants from lymphoblastoid cell lines likely do not influence gene expression traits to any strong degree [66], though this hypothesis remains to be tested in primary tissues.

Challenges in Using GReX

There are multiple difficulties involved in using the GReX approach, as noted in Wainberg et al. [67]. The primary difficulties are not unique to these methods but are limitations of GWAS and other association methods as well. Much as GWAS-identified variants cannot be interpreted as definitely causal, GReX association does not imply that there is a causal link between gene and disease. Results of both approaches should be interpreted in a hypothesis-generating fashion and functional follow-up should be performed to validate any gene-trait associations believed to be causal. Similarly, both methods may identify additional genes or variants surrounding the sentinel signal; in GWAS, this is due to LD, while in GReX association, this can occur due to co-regulation with a putatively causal gene. An additional concern is that GReX association is essentially a weighted burden test, however we note that the weights in GReX are based on the functional impact of each eQTL on gene expression and thus are more biologically-driven.

Two other difficulties pertain to the availability of reference data for building GReX models. For many phenotypes, eQTL enrichment in GWAS signals is tissue-specific [68], suggesting the function of the GWAS signals is operating through a tissue-specific impact on expression. In brain tissue, this effect has not been observed [69], however sample sizes for brain tissues in GTEx are among the smallest and this issue may be driven more by power limitations than by a true biological difference. Additional GReX models for brain tissue are available for TWAS, including models trained on 452 pre-frontal cortex samples from the Common Mind Consortium [63]. While the GTEx project has proven to be a valuable dataset, it is clear that for some phenotypes the 53 examined tissue types do not include specific tissues highly relevant to disease, e.g., microglial cells for AD. Efforts are also being made to create reference resources for additional tissues of interest.

Current State of the Art and the Future of GReX Methods

Reference datasets are already growing in total sample size: the pilot phase of GTEx (V3), released in 2012, included 1,641 RNA-Seq samples from 9 tissues, whereas the most recent release (V7) included 10,294 RNA-Seq samples from 48 tissues [30–32]. We expect that overall sample size will continue to increase, allowing for greater precision in modeling the effects of common eQTLs and inclusion of rare eQTLs. Efforts are also being made to address the lack of eQTL and other omics data in non-European populations; GTEx V7 now includes 101 individuals of African American, Native American, or Asian ancestry. Expanding reference datasets to reflect ethnic diversity will allow for identification of ancestry-specific eQTLs and effects due to allele frequency and LD differences between ancestral groups. These data will enable development of ancestry-specific expression models and improve the predictive ability of GReX and other similar approaches in minority populations.

In addition, advance methods have been proposed to improve accuracy and reliability of GReX approaches. For example, UTMOST has been developed to perform cross-tissue expression imputation and expression-trait association analysis [70]. With cross-tissue imputation, it is possible to address multiple hypothesis testing issues from parallel analyses of different tissue types and to deal with the limited sample size of specific tissues. One drawback to using this approach is that some tissue-specific associations are likely to be missed.

Despite the challenges posed by transcription-based prediction methods, in the last two years numerous publications have leveraged these methods to explore gene-based effects in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric traits, including SCZ [71], general cognitive ability [72], marijuana use [73], and BPD [74]. These studies have identified novel genes not previously implicated by GWAS, and have allowed for further understanding of disease mechanism. For example, in SCZ, a TWAS analysis linked GReX of 157 genes to disease, including 35 novel genes and 42 genes that were additionally associated with a TWAS of chromatin activity in HapMap samples. These results suggest that many of the identified SCZ risk variants may operate through alteration of chromatin structure [71]. The application of PrediXcan in a large BPD study also demonstrates its ability to enhance our understanding: out of the 125 significant tissue-specific associations with BPD, 29 associations were novel, and this study also found that disease-related genes are involved in mitochondrial function, circadian rhythm, and postsynaptic density [74].

Potential Omics Approaches

To date, integration of comprehensive molecular assessments in the interpretation of GWAS signals have been illuminating, however, many ‘omics’ technologies have yet to be widely adopted. Improvements to available reference datasets, accessibility, and affordability of ‘omics’ technologies in individual datasets will make these increasingly popular tools for ascribing a biological mechanism of effect to GWAS findings. We expect that, as much as high-throughput techniques have reduced genotyping and sequencing costs, advances in ‘omics’ technologies will similarly reduce costs and make these data sources more widely available when they are used at-scale. For example, recent approaches have been developed for performing high-throughput assessments of enhancers and other regulatory elements using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) [75, 76]. These approaches mimic traditional enhancer assays, which examine reporter genes within a vector transcribed into cell lines or model organisms. MPRAs, rather than performing these assays one-by-one, synthesized distinct enhancer sequences in parallel and measure via RNA-seq of barcoded reporter sequences [77]. MPRA methods will provide further evidence of the functional impact of regulatory variation.

These approaches have already provided functional insights into a number of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric phenotypes, a few examples of which are described in Table 1 for AD and PD.

Proteomics

Proteomics moves a step beyond transcriptomics, evaluating protein products by assessing protein content in a tissue of interest. Because mRNA and protein levels for a given gene are imperfectly correlated [78], proteomics may give a more complete picture of the consequences of genetic variants that impact transcription and post-transcriptional processes. Currently, many proteomic studies are small, but have produced insights into several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. A recent study identified a known AD risk variant acting as a protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) that is both cis-acting for APOE and trans-acting for SNRPF; the association was further strengthened when they considered the ratio of APOE to SNRPF as the outcome of interest [79]. The authors point to additional evidence that SNRPF produces protein components of the spliceosome and that knock-down of some of these components has been demonstrated to increase amyloid protein precursor, proposing a compelling biological mechanism underlying the role of this variant. A small-scale proteomics and transcriptomics study of Parkinson’s disease (PD) identified eight genes were both eQTLs and pQTLs associated with PD and implicated pathways related to mitochondrial processes [80]. For most existing proteomics datasets, sample sizes are small, the scale of data capture is often not proteome-wide, and many studies seem to be at the stage of evaluating colocalization of GWAS signals with pQTLs, rather than testing protein levels in disease, much like the first eQTL studies.

Metabolomics

Other emerging ‘omics’ that may provide additional context to genetic signals for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric traits, as well as being potential biomarkers of disease, include metabolomics, microbiome studies, and epigenomics.

Metabolomics is the systematic study of small molecule metabolites resulting from cellular processes in tissues of interest, and enables assessment of changes in metabolic endpoints due to disease. One of the first large-scale metabolomics efforts, including 7,824 European ancestry adults, observed overlap of identified metabolite QTLs and GWAS hits, particularly SNPs previously associated with drug response [81]. Metabolomic studies focused on identifying disease-specific metabolite differences to use as biomarkers (independent from genetic variation) have already provided insights about multiple neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including AD, PD, BPD, SCZ, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [82].

Evaluating GWAS signals in terms of their effect on pharmacological (and toxicological) response may be both directly translatable to clinical practice and help disentangle the impacts of identified variants. Pharmacogenomic assessments of response to psychiatric medications may aid in the development of personalized drug selection and dosage determination according to individual metabolomic profiles. Applications of metabolomics in medicine are emerging and might have potentially major impacts on how neuropsychiatric care is delivered as we enter the era of precision medicine [83, 21].

Microbiome Studies

Increasing evidence points to a strong connection of the human microbiome, particularly the gut microbiome, with the brain [84, 85], and several studies have identified host genetic factors that impact the structure and function of the gut microbiome [86–88]. A number of these studies have described an enrichment of genes implicated in a GWAS of obesity with gut microbiome QTLs. Obesity is a complex phenotype with both neurological and behavioral components [89], and it is conceivable that other traits with neurological components may be similar influenced by the gut microbiome.

Epigenomics

Epigenetic alterations across the genome affect the accessibility of transcription factor machinery to promoter regions, impacting gene expression. These alterations include methylation, histone modification, and chromatin structure, and are known in some cases to be impacted by genetic variation [90, 16]. Two recent studies of DNA methylation in SCZ demonstrated significant methylation changes in brain tissue in SCZ cases, showing also that methylation effects were primarily operating through changing gene expression, especially in fetal development, and that methylation QTLs identified had substantial overlap with GWAS-identified SCZ risk variants [91, 92]. CpG sites near known AD genes such as ABCA7 and BIN1 have also shown replicable changes in DNA methylation, and point to novel genes in amyloid processing and microglia activation [93].

As systematic characterizations of epigenetic, bacterial, and cellular processes improve and become more widely available, they are likely to provide not only important context for detected genomic signals, but may also prove to be key mediators in disease pathogenesis.

Phenome-related approaches

Complementing these comprehensive bioinformatic and experimental strategies to expand our understanding of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric traits are new initiatives in precision medicine and biobanking [94] that have enabled much broader capture and characterization of human phenomes (the set of all observable phenotypes). As GWAS emerged from microarray technologies to capture the majority of common genetic variation in the genome in a rapid and cost-effective manner, the concept of phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) emerged in part from the availability of dense electronic health records (EHR) and longitudinal phenotype data [95].

The Electronic Medical Records &amp; Genomics (eMERGE) I network, a collaboration of five US biorepositories linked to EHRs [96], has already demonstrated the utility of analyses of deep phenotype data, published studies identifying genomic contributors to a multitude of phenotypes including cardiac conduction [97, 98], cataracts [99], dementia [100], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [101], peripheral artery disease [102], and type 2 diabetes [103]. Studies in the eMERGE network are almost indistinguishable from those using traditional epidemiologic cohorts, however the density and diversity of longitudinal clinical data afforded by EHRs provides an ascertainment-agnostic design. As such, EHRs and other densely phenotyped studies have enabled the transition from “candidate phenotype” studies to phenome-wide studies. PheWAS tests the hypothesis that at least one genomic variant is associated with one of multiple phenotypes, and allows for complex and insightful investigations examining multiple facets of the effects of genomic variants: the phenomic consequences of functional genetic variants; pleiotropic effects; clinical significance of genetic variants; and genetically dysregulated expression [20].

Finally, common complex disease can be highly heterogeneous. Genomic risk factors alone can be utilized to characterize disease subtypes and risks, for example recent study demonstrated the use of polygenic risk scores as clinical tools to identify patients at high risk for Alzheimer’s [104]. Sub-phenotyping methods, some based on ‘omics’ measures, can identify distinct patterns of disease in subsets of cases that may be more genetically or molecularly similar to one another. These methods have been applied in major depressive disorder and its subtypes (typical and atypical) compared to polygenic risk scores for other psychiatric and metabolic phenotypes, revealing significant overlap [105]. Subtypes of BPD are increasingly recognized as having identifiable genetic heterogeneity [106]. Phenotypic heterogeneity is likely to manifest in other ‘omic’ measures as well.

Conclusion

The GWAS era delivered thousands of robust, reproducibly disease-associated genetic loci. The next puzzle to solve is understanding the mechanism by which they confer disease risk, and by natural extension, how to mitigate that risk. This challenge will involve breaking out of single-dimensional silos of expertise and building collaborations across cellular, molecular, genomic, bacterial, pharmacological, epidemiological, neurological, and clinical researchers while simultaneously prioritizing funding for well-powered ‘omics’ assessments in large and diverse populations. The initial explorations that have put genomic findings into their larger biological and clinical context have produced exciting results that will impact therapeutic research and help usher the treatment of neurodegenerative disease and neuropsychiatric disorders into the era of precision medicine. Enormous opportunities for not only interpreting genetic signals but performing truly high-dimensional poly-’omics’ analysis are within reach.
