BACKGROUND:

Research criteria for prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) were published in 2020, but little is known regarding prodromal DLB in clinical settings.

METHODS:

We identified non-demented participants without neurodegenerative disease from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set who converted to DLB at a subsequent visit. Prevalence of neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms were examined up to five years prior to DLB diagnosis.

RESULTS:

The sample included 116 participants clinically diagnosed with DLB and 348 age and sex-matched (1:3) Healthy Controls. Motor slowing was present in approximately 70% of participants three years prior to DLB diagnosis. In the prodromal phase, 50% of DLB participants demonstrated gait disorder, 70% had rigidity, 20% endorsed visual hallucinations, and over 50% of participants endorsed REM sleep behavior disorder. Apathy, depression, and anxiety were common prodromal neuropsychiatric symptoms. The presence of 1+ core clinical features of DLB in combination with apathy, depression, or anxiety resulted in the greatest AUC (0.815; 95% CI: 0.767, 0.865) for distinguishing HC from prodromal DLB one year prior to diagnosis. The presence of 2+ core clinical features was also accurate in differentiating between groups (AUC = 0.806; 95% CI: 0.756, 0.855).

CONCLUSION:

A wide range of motor, neuropsychiatric and other core clinical symptoms are common in prodromal DLB. A combination of core clinical features, neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment can accurately differentiate DLB from normal aging prior to dementia onset.

pmcIntroduction

Lewy body dementia is estimated to be the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1]. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a significant health burden due to cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms, changes in sleep, and motor dysfunction [2], which result in higher costs of care compared to patients with AD [3, 4]. In 2017, the DLB Consortium published updated consensus criteria for the clinical and pathological diagnosis of DLB [5]. Currently, core clinical features of DLB include fluctuating cognition, recurrent visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and one or more cardinal features of parkinsonism. A diagnosis of probable DLB requires the presence of dementia and two or more core clinical features, or one core clinical feature and one biomarker, the latter including indicative functional imaging or polysomnogram findings. Criteria for possible DLB require the presence of dementia and one core clinical feature without biomarkers or a positive biomarker without core clinical features.

Patients with DLB often experience delays in diagnosis relative to other dementia subtypes [6]. Previous research has found that the core features of DLB are often present in the prodromal phase of dementia; however, many of these studies were either retrospective or cross-sectional in nature and typically included sample sizes between 10–60 participants [7–14].

One of the largest samples of prodromal DLB patients comes from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort; comparing cognitive and neuropsychiatric data in 61 patients with prodromal DLB and 124 patients with prodromal AD, parkinsonism was the most common core symptom during the prodromal phase of DLB. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were more common in the prodromal DLB group compared with the prodromal AD group, particularly apathy, depression, and hallucinations [14].

Despite the increase in prodromal DLB research recently, critical gaps remain in our understanding of the prodromal features of DLB, including the prevalence of clinical features and the typical progression of these symptoms prior to diagnosis. In 2020, the DLB Diagnostic Study Group proposed research criteria for prodromal DLB, which largely follow the core clinical features outlined in the 2017 DLB criteria [15]; however, the authors indicated there may be additional neuropsychiatric or neuropsychological features in the prodromal stage which may aid researchers, and eventually clinicians, in earlier detection of the disease.

The first objective of this report was to explore the feasibility of identifying patients with DLB in the prodromal phase for later comparison with other disease processes. The second objective was to characterize neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms in a relatively large, prospectively-collected sample of individuals without dementia or neurodegenerative disease who later developed DLB. Finally, we sought to examine which combinations of core clinical features and other neuropsychiatric symptoms best differentiate DLB patients the prodromal phase from normal aging.

Methods

We analyzed data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set (NACC-UDS) database between September 2005 and May 2020. The NACC-UDS is a data repository aimed at collecting standardized clinical information from approximately 39 past and present Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) across the United States and is funded by NIA/NIH Grant U01 AG016976. The NACC-UDS goals and design have been previously described [16]. Version 1 of the NACC-UDS was established in September 2005. Version 2 was established in 2008 and included the addition of variables assessing RBD and cognitive fluctuations. The most recent update to the protocol, Version 3, occurred in March 2015 and contains additional questions regarding RBD. The visits occur at approximately annual intervals. Informed consent is obtained at study enrollment by the ADRC staff.

Participants:

To develop the cohort for this study, we identified NACC participants without a diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease at their initial study visit who converted to DLB at a subsequent visit. For inclusion in this study, at the time of dementia diagnosis, participants were required to have a primary etiology of DLB for two consecutive years, absence of PD, and an indication that AD was not the primary cause of observed cognitive impairment. Depending on the individual ADRC’s protocol, diagnosis is made by either a consensus team or a single trained physician conducting the examination. We identified age and sex-matched, (1:3) non-demented, healthy controls (HC) to serve as the comparator group. Groups were matched based upon the first visit with a DLB diagnosis.

Measures:

We examined collateral informant responses on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). For the purposes of this study, it should be noted the NPI-Q item regarding hallucinations includes both visual and auditory modalities. In this context, motor disturbances refer to repetitive actions, such as pacing and fidgeting with buttons, strings, or other stimuli. Sleep disturbances are defined as waking during the night, waking too early, and excessive naps during the day [17]. The Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) [18] was utilized as a standardized measure of the participant’s ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living. Higher scores reflect greater impairment. Previous studies indicate that a cutoff score &gt;6 has good clinical utility in discriminating mild cognitive impairment from early-stage or mild dementia [19–20]

We also included data from a structured clinical interview regarding the presence of RBD, visual hallucinations, and cognitive fluctuations across annual visits leading up to DLB diagnosis. Parkinsonian symptoms were measured through structured clinical interview and clinical exam findings and were defined as the presence of either rigidity, resting tremor, motor slowing, parkinsonian gait disorder, or postural instability. Cognition was measured using the Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE [21]; NACC-UDS Versions 1–2) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA [22]; Version 3), which have been studied in DLB [23] utilizing standard cutoff values.

Analysis:

We analyzed data from all visits leading up to and including the first visit with a DLB diagnosis. Participant demographics at the first visit with a DLB diagnosis were summarized. The proportion of participants with motor symptoms (based upon neurologic exam or clinical interview) or neuropsychiatric symptoms (based on NPI-Q or clinical interview) were described for each preceding annual visit. The frequency of core and supportive features at visits preceding the DLB diagnosis were assessed descriptively, as were changes in the frequencies over the years approaching the DLB diagnosis. The percentage of participants with one or more clinical features of DLB, including parkinsonism, RBD, cognitive fluctuations, and visual hallucinations was also noted. Demographic variables between the DLB and HC groups were compared using Two-sample t-test, Chi-square test; Fisher’s exact test, and Wilcoxon rank sums test, as appropriate.

We next assessed group classification accuracy one year prior to DLB diagnosis or one year prior to last visit for healthy controls using varying combinations of (1) cognitive impairment (MMSE &lt; 24 or MoCA &lt;26), (2) the four core clinical features (CCF; visual hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations, RBD, and parkinsonism) and (3) neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) other than psychosis (depression, apathy and anxiety from the NPI-Q). We calculated and compared sensitivity, specificity, and area under the empirical receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) using assumptions of paired data (i.e. multiple diagnostic tests measured on the same subjects). We used a combination of (2+ CCF) OR (1+ CCF and low MMSE/MoCA) OR (1+ CCF and 1+ NPS) as the reference diagnostic test for comparing AUCs.

Results

Demographics:

We identified 116 participants without a diagnosis of dementia at their initial study visit who were clinically diagnosed with DLB at subsequent visit by trained specialists and 348 age and sex-matched (1:3), non-demented HC. Demographic information is provided in Table 1. Of note, 13 participants with DLB and 14 HC completed Version 1. Approximately half of the participants in the DLB and HC groups reported a first-degree family member with cognitive impairment. The average time from the initial visit to DLB diagnosis was slightly over two years.

Cognitive and Functional Impairment:

As expected, the DLB group demonstrated more cognitive impairment than the HC group at the time of diagnosis (Table 1). Approximately 35% of the DLB participants demonstrated evidence of cognitive impairment on cognitive screening measures one year prior to dementia diagnosis. Slightly over 50% of the DLB participants demonstrated impairment on either the MMSE or the MoCA at the time of dementia diagnosis. See Supplemental Table 1 for cognitive screening performances over the course of five years leading up to a diagnosis of dementia. The median and interquartile ranges for the FAQ are provided in Table 1. Also as expected, at the time of dementia diagnosis, the DLB group demonstrated significantly more impairment in instrumental activities of daily living than the HC group.

Neuropsychiatric Symptoms:

At the first visit with a DLB diagnosis, the most common symptoms endorsed by a collateral informant on the NPI-Q included disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle (e.g., “nighttime behaviors”; 58.6%), apathy/indifference (51.7%), depression/dysphoria (46.6%), and anxiety (44.8%; Table 2). In contrast, no more than 11% of the HC group experienced similar symptoms at any time point. Approximately 1/3 of the DLB participants were reported to experience depression, disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle, and/or apathy three years prior to conversion to dementia, while &lt;5% of the HC group endorsed similar behaviors. Up to five years prior to a dementia diagnosis, 35–40% of patients demonstrated NPS of depression, apathy, and anxiety compared to &lt;7% of HC (See Table 2).

Core Symptoms of DLB:

Based upon structured clinical interview and motor exam, motor slowing (90.5%), gait disorder (79.3%), and rigidity (69.8%), were common parkinsonian symptoms at the time of DLB diagnosis. Similarly, parkinsonian gait and rigidity were present in approximately half of the DLB participants three years before they were diagnosed with DLB. Motor slowing was present in 50% of the individuals with DLB five years prior to conversion to dementia. Tremor symptoms were present in 30–35% in the prodromal phase. Finally, falls were endorsed by 20–25% of participants prior to dementia diagnosis.

RBD was present in nearly 40% of DLB participants three years prior to dementia diagnosis and in 66% of participants at the time of diagnosis. Visual hallucinations were reported in 20–25% of DLB participants two years prior to conversion to dementia. Cognitive fluctuations were endorsed by over 30% of participants two years prior to dementia diagnosis. (See Table 3).

Grouping of Symptoms

We evaluated the proportion of participants who demonstrated one or more core diagnostic features of DLB based upon clinical examination and structured clinical interviews prior to conversion to dementia. At least one core diagnostic criterion was present in at least 85% of the DLB group in the 3–4 years leading up to a dementia diagnosis. As expected, 100% of the sample demonstrated at least one of the core diagnostic criteria at the time of DLB diagnosis, consistent with a diagnosis of possible DLB. Approximately 40% of the sample met two or more core criteria 3–4 years prior to, and 60% two or more criteria 1–2 years prior to, DLB diagnosis utilizing the 2017 clinical criteria [5] (See Table 4).

Sensitivity, Specificity, and AUC:

Diagnostic accuracy measures of various combinations of CCF, NPS, and cognitive impairment indicators at one year prior to DLB diagnosis or last visit are presented in Table 5. All combinations achieved high specificity, but only when all three categories were considered (clinical, neuropsychological, and cognitive) were high sensitivities and AUCs achieved. The set of criteria that achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC=0.896) was presence of (2+ CCF) OR (1+ CCF and low MMSE/MoCA) OR (1+ CCF and 1+ NPS defined as depression, apathy, and anxiety).

Discussion

We have defined a unique cohort in which to study prodromal DLB. Participants entered the study without a diagnosis of dementia or neurodegenerative disease and were clinically diagnosed with DLB at a subsequent visit by trained specialists. Consistent with previous literature, RBD or sleep disturbances (e.g., excessive naps during the day, waking during the night, waking too early) were present in about half of the participants prior to conversion to DLB [8, 10–14]. Depression, apathy, and anxiety also are common prodromal NPS as many as five years prior to dementia diagnosis. Similar to the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort, the participants in this study also demonstrated a wide variety of clinical symptoms in addition to cognitive impairment prior to conversion to DLB [14].

The results of the current study also suggest most individuals with DLB experience motor changes several years prior to dementia diagnosis, which may have implications for diagnosis given the “one-year rule.” [5] It is unknown from NACC documentation whether the pattern and degree of symptoms observed was sufficient for a PD diagnosis, as the presence of tremor does not necessarily indicate a resting tremor and motor slowing may not reflect true bradykinesia. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society published clinical diagnostic criteria for PD in 2015, and dementia at the time of diagnosis is no longer an exclusion [24]. Researchers have established the presence of cognitive impairment in prodromal [25] and early-stage PD [26], further blurring the “one-year rule.” Notably, motor symptoms in the prodromal DLB group tended to reflect rigidity and slowing rather than tremor and postural instability and according to the updated 2015 diagnostic criteria for PD, bradykinesia is specified as the primary motor symptom. It is not uncommon for healthy older adults to demonstrate symptoms of parkinsonism. [27] In our sample, a relatively small proportion of HC demonstrated parkinsonian symptoms; however, these symptoms were more prevalent among the DLB group within the prodromal phase. Previous studies with smaller sample sizes have also found that individuals with prodromal DLB present with more motor symptoms than those in the prodromal phase of AD [8–9, 12, 14].

MoCA and MMSE screening measures were selected to examine global cognition in this analysis, as they are commonly used in clinical practice. A percentage of the participants in this study demonstrated evidence of cognitive impairment on MoCA/MMSE screening measures several years prior to DLB diagnosis, but not all participants scored below the cutoff at the time of dementia diagnosis despite evidence of functional impairment on a standardized assessment measure. This may reflect the limited sensitivity of cognitive screening measures in prodromal and early DLB [28], but the reliance on a clinical diagnosis of DLB in this study may also be a factor. Fluctuations in attention may also influence cognitive performance, as individuals with DLB may be able to engage in a brief cognitive screening measure, yet demonstrate difficulty with sustained attention during the course of a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Nonetheless, the study raises concern that waiting for overt impairment on a screening instrument may underestimate cases that experienced clinicians determine to have DLB, highlighting the importance of evaluating for core symptoms of the disease.

Approximately 90% of the participants in this study had one or more core features of DLB in the prodromal phase; however, only 40–60% had two or more core features in the 2–3 years prior to conversion to dementia. At least 30% of the sample experienced clinical symptoms of depression, anxiety or apathy up to two years prior to conversion to DLB. The criteria that achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy was the presence of at least one core clinical feature and at least one other neuropsychiatric symptom. The greatest diagnostic accuracy was achieved when multiple combinations of features were considered (i.e., 2 or more clinical features OR 1 or more core clinical feature and 1 or more other neuropsychiatric symptom OR 1 or more core clinical feature and low MMSE/MoCA). The fact that use of multiple combinations of clinical characteristics improved sensitivity without significantly lowering specificity underscores that DLB may present with diverse manifestations in the prodromal phase.

McKeith et al. [15, 29] suggested there may be more than one prototypic prodromal DLB syndrome, with either predominant cognitive impairment, delirium, or psychiatric disturbances at onset; however, it is likely individuals may experience symptoms of more than one prodromal syndrome in clinical practice [15]. Although the prodromal research criteria for the psychiatric-onset syndrome highlight hallucinations in non-visual modalities and systematic delusions, these data are not explicitly captured in NACC. The current findings suggest a high prevalence of one or more core features of DLB with one or more comorbid neuropsychiatric symptom. Including symptoms of depression, apathy, and anxiety, in combination with core clinical features improved diagnostic sensitivity. Recent research suggests depression is a risk factor for earlier onset of DLB and mixed AD/DLB [30–31]. Together, these studies provide evidence for early psychiatric manifestations in DLB. It is possible that the inclusion of non-visual hallucinations and systematic delusions may further improve diagnostic sensitivity. Future research will use data from this sample to further examine the proposed prodromal syndromes.

Our approach has several strengths. First, the NACC-UDS database includes a large sample size with prospectively-collected clinical data from multiple sites. The current study includes the largest sample of prodromal DLB participants to date, [7–14] but similar to other studies, the current sample is selective and not population-based. The sample is overwhelmingly Caucasian with relatively high levels of education, so our findings may not be generalizable to diverse populations. Although DLB and HC participants were matched on sex and age, they were not matched by ADRC location, which may introduce selection bias. [32] Reliance on clinical interview to assess core CCF including RBD, cognitive fluctuations, and visual hallucinations rather than standardized assessment instruments is a limitation of the NACC-UDC. A notable limitation of the current study is the lack of pathological confirmation of the diagnosis. The longitudinal aspect of the NACC cohort design will allow for the examination of pathology as participants undergo autopsy.

In summary, neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms are prevalent in the prodromal phase of DLB. The identification of these symptoms may aid clinicians in the differentiation between early DLB and normal aging, particularly if there are two core clinical features present, or one core clinical feature combined with presence of cognitive impairment. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and apathy are non-specific in nature, but our findings suggest that when they are present in the context of RBD, fluctuating cognition, or visual hallucinations or misperceptions, they can support a diagnosis of prodromal DLB.
