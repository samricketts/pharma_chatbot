Background:

Perivascular spaces (PVS) are fluid-filled compartments surrounding small intracerebral vessels that transport fluid and clear waste. We examined associations between PVS count, vascular and neurodegenerative risk factors, and cognitive status among the predominantly Hispanic participants of the FL-VIP Study of Alzheimer’s Disease Risk.

Methods:

Using brain MRI (n=228), we counted PVS in single axial image through the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO). PVS per region were scored as 0 (none), 1 (&lt;10), 2 (11–20), 3 (21–40), and 4 (&gt;40). Generalized linear models examined PVS associations with vascular risk factors and a composite vascular comorbidity risk (VASCom) score.

Results:

Our sample (mean age 72±8 years, 61% women, 60% Hispanic, mean education 15±4 years, 33% ApoE4 carriers) was 59% hypertensive, 21% diabetic, 66% hypercholesteremic, and 30% obese. Mean VASCom score was 2.3±1.6. PVS scores ranged from 0–4 in the BG (mean 1.3±0.7) and CSO (mean 1.2 ±0.9), and 0–7 combined (mean 2.5±1.4). In multivariable regression models, BG PVS was associated with age (β=0.03/year, p&lt;0.0001), Hispanic ethnicity (β=0.29, p=0.01), education (β=0.04/year, p=0.04), coronary bypass surgery (β=0.93, p=0.02). CSO PVS only associated with age (β=0.03/year, p&lt;0.01). ApoE4 and beta-amyloid were not associated with PVS.

Conclusion:

BG PVS may be a marker of subclinical cerebrovascular disease. Further research is needed to validate associations and identify mechanisms linking BG PVS and cerebrovascular disease markers. PVS may be a marker of neurodegeneration despite our negative preliminary findings and more research is warranted. The association between BG PVS and Hispanic ethnicity also requires further investigation.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Perivascular spaces (PVS) or Virchow-Robin spaces are fluid-filled compartments surrounding brain small blood vessels that serve as conduits for fluid transport and clearance of waste products. When enlarged, PVS are visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Whether PVS relate to dementia has been the object of recent research with conflicting results. PVS are considered a neuroimaging marker of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and impaired interstitial fluid drainage. Both SVD and impaired interstitial fluid drainage may mediate a relationship between PVS and dementia. PVS have also been associated with pathological hallmarks of dementia. Beta-amyloid has been observed to travel with PVS in mouse models [1], which could lead to both direct and indirect effects - decreased clearance of beta-amyloid may lead to accumulation of beta-amyloid within the PVS, which in turn further compromises interstitial fluid drainage [2]. PVS have also been associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid levels of dementia markers, namely phosphorylated tau protein, total tau protein, and neurogranin [3]. Despite these clues, the clinical impact of PVS count remains unclear. In this manuscript we examined associations between PVS count, vascular and neurodegenerative risk factors, and cognitive status among 228 predominantly Hispanic participants of the Florida Vascular Imaging Phenotypes (FL-VIP) Study of Alzheimer’s Disease Risk.

To address the technical limitations and heterogeneity of PVS quantification, the STRIVE (Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging) international group [4] developed standards for reporting PVS on imaging for research studies. They defined PVS as fluid-filled spaces following the typical course of a vessel, with signal intensity similar to CSF, and with a cross-sectional diameter smaller than 3 mm. PVS are most commonly seen in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO). They are less seen in the hippocampus, midbrain, and pons. Rarely, PVS are also seen in the cerebellum [5]. PVS are visible on imaging in 16–100% of individuals, depending on the imaging methods, scanner resolution, and criteria used for PVS assessment [6–9]. As the association between the size of PVS and clinical outcomes are not understood, and as PVS visibility depends on MRI methods, the STRIVE consensus recommends calling them ‘PVS’ rather than ‘enlarged PVS’.

Several PVS visual rating scales have been developed using very similar approaches, driven by a shared constraint: manual counts of all visible PVS are time consuming [5]. Most visual scales have therefore focused on attempting qualitative estimates of the burden of perivascular spaces for representative brain subregions: the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO) [10]. Though there is no single standard scale, several authors have rated PVS from 0 (none), 1 (1–10), 2 (11–20), 3 (21–40) to 4 (&gt;40) per region in a single axial slice or in multi axial slices 1–3 mm apart, using the hemisphere with the higher score. Visual rating scales for PVS have moderate to high reliability for both BG and CSO [10–12]. Visual rating scales are limited by their subjectivity as well as the floor and ceiling effects that can occur when grouping the numbers of PVS per slice into limited categorical bins [13]. Visual rating scales accuracy are also affected by PVS variability between MRI slices, frequency of lacunar infarcts that could be mistaken for PVS, and image quality, while reliability is affected by rater experience levels [13]. Automated image analysis algorithms are currently under development. In time, these may improve reliability, expand the dimensions by which PVS are characterized beyond frequency and size, and facilitate more research studies investigating clinical relevance of PVS by reducing the burden on researchers. Currently the amount of time required to perform counts limits the number of slices and brains that can be analyzed.

Cerebrovascular disease is likely an important contributor to the pathogenesis of dementia [14]. As PVS are widely considered markers of cerebrovascular disease [15–18], PVS might be expected to be more common in patients with cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, associations between PVS and cognitive impairment have been mixed. In a population-based longitudinal study of 1,778 non-demented adults, PVS predicted incident all-cause dementia [19]. However, a meta-analysis of five population-based studies totaling 3,575 adults (mean age 63 years) found no cross-sectional association between PVS and cognitive status [20]. With the exception of the association between hypertension and BG PVS, associations between vascular risk factors and PVS have been mixed [21–23]. Our analysis of the Florida Vascular Imaging Phenotypes Study (FL-VIP) of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) Risk implements the STRIVE criteria to determine the associations of demographic factors, vascular risk factors, and genetic factors with PVS burden. This study also aims to identify associations of PVS burden with cognitive status (normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia) and measures of cerebral beta-amyloid burden. The identification of demographic, vascular risk, and genetic factors associated with PVS may help define imaging biomarkers of dementia and suggest shared mechanisms between PVS and cognitive dysfunction.

METHODS

Study Population

The study population comprises all participants in the FL-VIP Study of AD Risk enrolled in the One Florida Alzheimer Disease Research Center (OF-ADRC, one of 32 National Institute on Aging Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers). Our analytical sample consisted of FL-VIP Study of Risk participants with available 3T MRI and who were at least 45 years of age (n=228). The institutional review boards of the University of Florida College of Medicine (Gainesville, FL), Mount Sinai Medical Center (Miami Beach, FL), and the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (Miami, FL) approved this study. Participants in this study completed a medical, neurological, psychiatric, and neuropsychological evaluations, including all elements required by the National Alzheimer’s Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) [24]. Neuropsychological tests were administered by an experienced geriatric psychiatrist, who was blinded to the test results. All other evaluations were conducted by a board-certified Neurologist at our ADRC. The CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score was used as a global cognitive/functional measure for clinical dementia rating scale, while assignation to groups (normal, preMCI, MCI, dementia) was determined via consensus adjudication at our ADRC [25]. PreMCI classification was described previously by Lowenstein, et al. [26]. PreMCI was defined as those clinically judged to have normal cognition with impairment of at least 1.5 standard deviations below expected levels (based on normative data as a function of age and education) on at least one of three memory measures or as those clinically judged to have MCI without any cognitive measures (memory or non-memory) less than 1.0 standard deviations below expected levels. Details on the OF-ADRC participants enrollments, methods and data collection instruments have been described previously [27,28]. Race and ethnicity were each determined independently of each other using self-report [29]. For race, participants chose either White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, Asian, Other, or Unknown. For ethnicity, participants chose from Hispanic, non-Hispanic or unknown. We calculated a composite vascular comorbidity risk score (VASCom) as the sum of the presence (1) or absence (0) of the following vascular factors: current smoking, obesity (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2), hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, prior cardiac disease, prior stroke, and history of coronary artery bypass.

MR Imaging

All participants in the OF-ADRC underwent a comprehensive brain MR imaging protocol performed on a Skyra 3-Tesla scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) at Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach [30]. Four sets of structural images were obtained for analysis using conventional spin-echo techniques. High-resolution T1-weighted imaging with a resolution of 0.98×0.98×1 mm3 was carried out using a 3D Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) sequence to quantify brain atrophy. Additionally, T2-weighted imaging (0.45×0.45×3 mm3) was acquired in all 228 participants. Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) imaging (0.36×0.36×3 mm3) was acquired in 18 of the 228 participants, while Turbo Inversion Recovery Magnitude (TIRM) imaging (1.2×.1.×5.2 mm3) was acquired in the other 210 participants. FLAIR and TIRM are both fluid-attenuated imaging modalities with similar contrasts used to image white matter lesions.

We implemented the STRIVE criteria and the PVS Rating Scale User Guide from Potter et al. [10] to identify the BG and CSO and to quantify PVS burden per region. Potter et al. reported ranges of inter-rater kappa statistics for BG (0.8–0.9) and CSO (0.61–0.8) PVS. Our inter-rater concordance (for two raters) for BG and CSO PVS were in agreement with these values at 77% (BG) and 73% (CSO) in a subset of 30 participants. PVS were identified on T2-weighted imaging as parenchymal hyperintensities less than 3mm in cross-sectional diameter and which followed the orientation of perforating arteries in the BG and CSO. PVS counts were estimated by the rater for each axial slice of BG and CSO. The slice and hemisphere (right or left) with the greatest PVS count was used to determine PVS burden per region. PVS counts in a single slice and hemisphere were stratified into categories that represented PVS burden: 0 (no PVS), 1 (1–10), 2 (11–20), 3 (21–40), and 4 (&gt;40) (Figure 1). BG and CSO scores for that side were then summed to yield a 0–8 total. Subjects with scans in which imaging artifact prevented accurate counting (in the estimation of the rater) were excluded from the analysis [4].

STRIVE criteria and the PVS Rating Scale User Guide were also used to differentiate PVS from lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions. Lacunar infarcts were defined as fluid-filled spaces surrounded by a rim of hyperintensity on FLAIR or TIRM imaging, 3mm to 15mm diameter, in the territory of perforating arterioles, and within periventricular white matter, internal or external capsule, thalamus, basal ganglia, brainstem, or cerebellum. White matter lesions, such as white matter hyperintensities, were defined as hyperintensities on FLAIR or TIRM imaging in white matter regions. White matter hyperintensities can obscure PVS in regions of extensive white matter hyperintensities. In such cases, PVS number was estimated by extrapolating from PVS counts in similar regions containing sufficiently non-involved white matter, where similarity was determined by rater attention to anatomy and location and prioritized by proximity. Post analysis review of the scans by a second rater indicated this issue arose in at most 5% of subjects (11/228 scans).

Amyloid Imaging

Cerebral amyloid imaging was obtained in 199 of the 228 participants in the study sample, as described by Loewenstein et al. 2018 [31]. Participants were scanned for 20 minutes on a Siemens Biograph 16 PET/CT scanner operating in 3-dimensional mode (55 slices per frame, 3mm slice thickness, 128 × 128 matrix) 70–90 minutes after the infusion of 300 MBq of NeuraCeq (18F-florbetaben; Piramal Imaging, Boston, MA) in 83% of participants or 50 minutes after infusion of 370 MBq of Amyvid (18F-florbetapir; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) in 17% of participants. Composite Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) were calculated as the ratio of the mean volume-weighted SUVR of 5 bilateral cortical regions (frontal, temporal, parietal, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex) to the cerebellar gray matter [32]. We employed the Centiloid method to compare cortical composite SUVR’s for the two amyloid tracers used in this study [33]. Centiloid scores were calculated using the equations Centiloid = (SUVR × 153.4)-154.9 for florbetaben and Centiloid = (SUVR × 183)-177 for flobetapir [34,35].

Statistical Analyses

No significant differences were observed in distributions of PVS across different cognitive categories or amyloid status in our analyses, so PVS spaces were analyzed as a total sample. Sample characteristics were calculated for the total sample, for groups stratified by BG PVS score ≤ 1 and &gt; 1, and for groups stratified by CSO PVS score ≤ 1 and &gt; 1. Sample characteristics were presented as means with standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and reported as frequencies with percentages for categorical variables. Characteristic means and frequencies were compared between groups with PVS score ≤ 1 and &gt; 1 in both the BG and CSO. For univariate analysis, student t-tests (for two groups) or F-tests (for more than two groups) was used to compare group mean differences in PVS scores, whereas simple linear regression was used to examine the association between PVS and each continuous variable. For multivariable analysis, a multiple linear regression was performed to identify the factors associated with PVS with a p-value &lt;0.1. Due to the relatively low number of 0 PVS scores in the BG and the CSO, a composite PVS score of ≤1 (sum of PVS score 0 and 1) per region was used in analyses. Variance of inflation factors were calculated to test for multicollinearity among the variables used in multivariate analysis. In the sensitivity analyses, we have included cognitive status and presence of amyloid positivity in multivariable analysis. Both univariate and multivariable analyses were performed for PVS in BG and CSO separately. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.).

RESULTS

Analytic Sample Demographics

Of the 251 participants with available MRI, 23 were excluded from the analyses due to missing essential MRI sequences (21 participants) and imaging artifacts that prevented the visual scoring of PVS (2 participants). The demographic and clinical characteristics of our analytic sample (n=228) are described in Table 1. Mean age was 72±8 years with 15±4 mean years of education. 61% were women and 33% were ApoE4 carriers. Ethnically, our sample was 60% Hispanic and 40% non-Hispanic regardless of race. Racially, our sample was 90% White, 4% Black, and 2% other/unknown, regardless of ethnicity. Racial data was missing for 4% of our sample. In a total sample, the prevalence of hypertension was 59%, diabetes 21%, dyslipidemia 66%, and obesity 30%. Mean VASCom score was 2.3±1.6. This sample included 16% of individuals without cognitive impairment (cognitively normal), 18% with pre-mild cognitive impairment (preMCI), 46% with MCI (all but 2 participants had amnestic MCI), and 20% with dementia. Nine participants had a missing diagnosis but had a CDR-B score. Of the 44 participants with dementia, 27 had AD, 2 had mixed AD and vascular dementia, 8 had suspected non-amyloid pathology, 1 had frontotemporal dementia, 1 had Parkinson’s disease dementia, and 5 had indeterminate dementias. No significant differences were observed among the demographic and clinical characteristics between BG PVS scores ≤1 or &gt;1 and between CSO PVS scores ≤1 and &gt;1. The sample’s demographic characteristics and PVS scores were stratified by cognitive categories (Supplemental Table 1) and by amyloid status (Supplemental Table 2). PVS scores were similar across all cognitive category groups. PVS scores were slightly increased in amyloid positive participants, but this difference was not statistically significant.

PVS Scores

Overall PVS scores ranged from 0–7 (mean 2.5±1.4). The prevalence of total PVS score greater than 1 was 77% (prevalence of PVS=0 was 4%), the prevalence of BG PVS scores greater than 1 was 29% (prevalence of BG PVS=0 was 8%), and the prevalence of CSO PVS scores greater than 1 was 30% (prevalence of PVS=0 was 21%). Frequency distributions of PVS scores overall and per region are depicted in Figure 2. PVS score greater than 1 was associated with older age both in the BG and CSO. PVS score greater than one in the BG was associated with greater frequencies of Hispanic ethnicity, hypertension, prior cardiac disease, and coronary artery bypass. PVS score less than 1 in the CSO was associated with greater frequencies of obesity and diabetes (Table 1). In univariable analysis (Table 2), PVS in BG were associated with hypertension (β=0.262, p&lt;0.01), prior cardiac disease (β=0.300, p=0.04), and coronary artery bypass (β=0.944, p&lt;0.01), in addition to age (β=0.026, p&lt;0.01) and Hispanic ethnicity (β=0.202, p=0.04). PVS in CSO were associated with obesity (β=−0.299, p=0.03), dyslipidemia (β=−0.272, p=0.04), and age (β=0.026 per a year, p&lt;0.01). PVS in both BG and CSO were not associated with presence of dementia, ApoE4 status, amyloid positivity, or global amyloid Centiloid score.

In multivariable regression models (Table 3), all variables had variance of inflation factors &lt; 1.4, indicating the absence of strong multicollinearity among variables. PVS in BG remained associated with age (β=0.03 per year, p&lt;0.01), being Hispanic (β=0.29, p=0.01), coronary bypass surgery (β=0.93, p=0.02), marginally with hypertension (β=0.22, p=0.07), and a new significant association was observed with education (β=0.04 per year, p=0.04). PVS in CSO remained associated with age (β=0.03 per year, p&lt;0.01), and no longer were associated with obesity and dyslipidemia. Associations with other factors were not significant. In sensitivity analyses, which included cognitive status and amyloid positivity, no significant changes in associations were found. Cognitive status or amyloid positivity were not associated with PVS count.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we aimed to determine the associations between PVS count, vascular and neurodegenerative risk factors, and cognitive status in the OF-ADRC. PVS were common in our community sample of 228 subjects (77%). In keeping with prior studies [17,20,36–39] we focused on PVS in those areas where they are believed to be most common: the BG and CSO. PVS were associated with older age in both BG and CSO. Determinants of PVS burden differed between the BG and CSO. Hypertension and prior coronary bypass surgery were the most prominent factors associated with greater PVS burden in the BG, but not in the CSO. In addition, Hispanic/Latino background and more years of education were associated with greater PVS burden in the BG, but not in the CSO. Though PVS burden was associated with vascular risk and demographic factors, it was not associated with cognitive outcomes or neurodegenerative risk factors. We did not see a statistical association between PVS presence or count with either cognitive, amyloid, or ApoE4 status. We purposefully did not analyze dementia subtypes, as the pathophysiology of dementia is often heterogeneous, and cerebrovascular contributions to dementia are likely not specific to any dementia subtype.

Vascular risk factors, comorbidities, and PVS

The association found in this study between PVS in the BG and hypertension are consistent with observations in previous studies [21–23], while the association between PVS in the BG and coronary artery bypass surgery is novel. Prior studies have also noted associations between PVS in the BG and other markers of vascular disease including prior lacunar stroke [17,22], white matter hyperintensities [18,22,40,41], and neopterin, an inflammatory marker of monocyte/macrophage activation [42]. By contrast, CSO PVS burden has not consistently been associated with cardiovascular disease markers in meta-analyses [22].

Differences in anatomy between the BG and the CSO might contribute to these differences [21]. First, PVS are contained within different tissue types depending on their location. PVS in the CSO are contiguous with arteriolar smooth muscle, contained between an inner layer of arteriolar smooth muscle and an exterior layer of basal lamina [5]. PVS in the BG are contained between two layers of meningeal membrane, both of which are outside the arteriolar smooth muscle [5]. Second, PVS differ in their communications with the subarachnoid space. Direct communication between BG PVS and basal subarachnoid spaces has been observed in both animal and human studies, [5,43] but not in the CSO [2,43].

Associations between regional PVS burden and cardiovascular markers might also differ due to methodological limitations. Lacunar infarcts can be difficult to differentiate from PVS and are more prevalent in the BG, potentially leading to an overestimation of BG PVS burden [4].

This study did not demonstrate any associations between PVS and other cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking, or obesity. This also accords with prior studies, in which these associations have been inconsistent or absent [22,23]. There are some caveats. Dyslipidemia was associated with higher CSO PVS in one study, but only in patients with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage [44]. Another study looking at adiposity did reveal an association between visceral adipose tissue area and PVS in the CSO [45]. It is unclear why some vascular disease markers are associated with greater PVS burden while others are not. One possibility is that hypertension and coronary artery bypass surgery represent processes more proximally associated with PVS physiology while other risk factors (diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking), may represent processes more distally related to PVS physiology. More research is needed to understand the relationships between vascular risk factors, vascular disease, and PVS.

Demographics and PVS

The association between older age and greater PVS burden in the BG and CSO observed in this study is consistent with previous observational studies [17,21]. A meta-analysis of 13 studies (N=8,395) demonstrated that older age was most strongly associated with PVS within the BG, less so within the CSO, and least so within the hippocampus [22]. Aging is the sum of many heterogenous processes, many of which are unknown and unaccounted for in covariate adjustment. There are several aging-related processes that could mediate the association between older age and greater PVS burden in this study and in prior studies. Age-related atrophy is one process hypothesized to mediate the relationship between age and PVS burden [46]. Alternatively, age-related microvascular amyloid deposition [47] could influence PVS burden with increasing age. PVS burden itself could be a biomarker of aging, or one of many processes responsible for aging.

Hispanic/Latino background was associated with PVS burden in this study. Although study results cannot explain this relationship, we speculate that this association could be mediated by undiagnosed and undertreated cardiovascular risk factors, greater vulnerability of brain health to cardiovascular risk factors, or a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment. Hispanic/Latino background has been associated with high rates of untreated hypertension [48]. Compared to their White counterparts, Hispanic/Latinos also have higher rates of undiagnosed diabetes [49] and dementia [50]. Hypertension and higher BMI are also associated with greater detrimental impacts on cognition in Hispanic/Latinos than White counterparts [51]. Considering the complex ethnic, racial, and genetic components of the US Hispanic/Latino population, understanding the relationship between Hispanic/Latino background and PVS requires further study. Nevertheless, the high prevalence of ethnically diverse Hispanics/Latinos in our study expands the generalizability of PVS research.

Years of education were also associated with greater PVS burden in our study. Prior studies have identified education as an indicator of cognitive reserve [52]. For example, greater educational attainment mitigated the association between AD pathology (beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) and lower cognitive function proximate to death [53]. Our study results cannot explain the relationship between education and greater BG PVS burden. As education may serve as a compensatory process mitigating cognitive decline and dementia, we speculate that BG PVS may also serve as a compensatory process preserving cognitive function. Alternatively, higher education in minority populations has been associated with lower sleep quality relative to similarly educated white counterparts [54]. Poor sleep among the most educated of this predominantly minority cohort may drive the association between education and BG PVS burden, implying that PVS in the BG might be a pathologic and not a compensatory biomarker. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between PVS and education.

Role of PVS in brain health

The function of the PVS is not well understood. Brain homeostasis could be mediated anatomically at the PVS as the interplay among the immune system, cerebrovascular system, and the glymphatic system. The glymphatic system is proposed as a cerebral network of perivascular efflux of interstitial fluid that serves to clear extracellular soluble proteins and metabolites, such as beta-amyloid [1]. PVS are thought to be the anatomic space through which glymphatic drainage occurs. Flow within the PVS is dependent on microvasculature pulsatility [55], while the integrity of the PVS is dependent on the integrity of the cerebrovasculature at its core. Microvascular breakdown inherent to cerebrovascular disease can decrease glymphatic drainage and increase blood-brain barrier permeability, exposing immune cells from outside the brain to antigen presenting cells in the PVS, triggering inflammatory cascades thought to play a role in cerebrovascular, neuroinflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases [56]. As such, PVS could represent glymphatic stasis that occurs because of glymphatic pathology, immune-mediated inflammation, or cerebrovascular disease. Alternatively, PVS may be markers of adaptive changes to the PVS to overcome glymphatic, immune, or cerebrovascular pathology.

The absence of significant associations between PVS and dementia, amyloid burden, or ApoE4 status in univariate analysis was noteworthy. PVS may be a stronger and more specific marker of vascular disease than dementia. While amyloid burden and ApoE4 status were not independently associated with PVS, each may serve to moderate the relationship between vascular disease markers and PVS. For example, the associations between markers of vascular disease and PVS may be stronger among ApoE4 carriers (versus non-carriers) or among those with amyloid burden (versus without amyloid burden). Alternatively, if amyloid or ApoE4 status are more associated only with the highest densities of PVS, then the use of PVS as a binary categorical outcome stratified at a PVS score of 1 may not serve to demonstrate an association between ApoE4 or amyloid status and PVS. Finally, the association between ApoE4 and risk for dementia is highly variable and depends on both global genetic ancestry and the local genetic ancestry of the ApoE4 allele (European, African, and Amerindian), particularly among Hispanic/Latino adults [57–59]. The complex genetic ancestry of our ethnically diverse sample may contribute to the absence of statistically significant associations between ApoE4 and PVS.

Limitations

This study had methodological and technological limitations. First, the study sample is biased as subjects with cognitive impairment and dementia were oversampled. This limits the generalizability of the results and introduces bias to the study. Second, causality cannot be inferred from the cross-sectional design of this study. Third, detailed quantification and characterization of PVS burden (i.e., number, area, or volume) is not possible with the visual rating scale implemented in this study. The visual rating scale dichotomizes the quantity of PVS. PVS burden is either present (score &gt; 1) or absent (score ≤ 1), which introduces floor and ceiling effects. The visual rating scale is also labor-intensive, subjective, and susceptible to inter-rater variability. These limitations inherent to the visual rating of PVS underscore the need for automated methods of PVS quantification and characterization. Whether subjective or automated, methods of PVS characterization also need to be harmonized across studies to maximize comparability and clinical relevance [4]. Our analyses are exploratory and hypothesis generating, and further work will be required to validate and expand on these initial results.

Conclusion

Aging and vascular risk factors are the most important determinants of PVS. Specifically, PVS in BG may be an important marker of subclinical cerebrovascular disease, providing a mechanistic link between cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive decline. The role of PVS in CSO is less clear or may be less important. We have observed greater burden of BG PVS in the Hispanic/Latino population, and this finding needs validation and further investigation. The role of PVS in cognitive performance and decline needs to be investigated in longitudinal studies. Our study together with other recent studies that have reported the associations of PVS with aging, small vessel disease, stroke, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s Disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s Disease may spark more research and interest in the potential clinical implications of PVS in brain health.
