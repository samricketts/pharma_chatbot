INTRODUCTION:

Presence of APOE ε4 has shown greater predisposition to medial temporal involvement in posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Little is known about its influence on memory network connectivity, a network comprised of medial temporal structures.

METHODS:

Fifty-eight PCA and 82 LPA patients underwent structural and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Bayesian hierarchical linear models assessed the influence of APOE ε4 on within and between-network connectivity for five networks.

RESULTS:

APOE ε4 carriers showed reduced memory and language within-network connectivity in LPA and increased salience within-network connectivity in PCA compared to non-carriers. Between-network analysis showed evidence of reduced DMN connectivity in APOE ε4 carriers, with reduced DMN-to-salience and DMN-to-language network connectivity in PCA, and reduced DMN-to-visual network connectivity in LPA.

DISCUSSION:

The APOE genotype influences brain connectivity, both within and between-networks, in atypical AD. However, there was evidence that the modulatory effects of APOE differ across phenotype.

pmcBackground

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) allele ε4 is an important genetic risk factor for developing late-onset amnestic Alzheimer’s disease (AD)1 but it also influences risk for atypical young-onset non-amnestic clinical presentations of AD2,3. Two of the most common atypical presentations of AD are posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) that is characterized by visuospatial and visuoperceptual deficits, with features including simultanagnosia, Gerstmann’s syndrome, oculomotor apraxia, dressing apraxia and optic ataxia4,5 and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) that is primarily characterized by dominant language deficits such as anomia, sentence repetition deficits and phonological errors6,7. Both PCA and LPA show relatively preserved episodic memory early in the disease4.

The frequency of the APOE ε4 allele is increased in both PCA and LPA compared to controls3 and increases with older age in both syndromes8, with no differences in frequency observed between PCA and LPA8. Presence of the APOE ε4 allele is not associated with Aβ burden in atypical AD8, but there is evidence that APOE ε4 is associated with atrophy and tau burden3. PCA is typically associated with atrophy and tau deposition in the occipito-parietal cortices9,10, while LPA shows involvement of the left lateral temporoparietal cortex11,12. Our previous study showed that APOE ε4 carriers had greater medial temporal atrophy and tau deposition compared to APOE ε4 non-carriers in both PCA and LPA, with this effect being greater in LPA3. This implies that APOE genotype likely plays a role in the pathophysiology of the atypical AD variants3 but raises questions on whether the APOE genotype also influences brain connectivity, particularly in the memory network which is comprised of medial temporal structures.

There are a few functional connectivity studies in atypical AD, reporting visual network disruptions in PCA13,14 and altered language network connectivity in LPA13,15, with connectivity from the medial temporal lobe typically spared. However, to our knowledge no previous studies have assessed the influence of APOE status on the functional connectivity profiles of PCA and LPA. Hence, in this study we aimed to evaluate how APOE ε4 status influences functional connectivity within and between brain networks in PCA and LPA. We hypothesized that APOE ε4 genotype would influence the memory network, particularly in LPA, since APOE ε4 carriers showed greater involvement of the medial temporal lobe in LPA than PCA, in our previous study3. In addition to assessing the memory network, we assessed the visual network, predominantly affected in PCA13,14 and the language network, predominantly affected in LPA13,15. We also explored the default mode network (DMN), a core network that becomes engaged during random episodic silent thinking as opposed to more focused episodic memory activity and is involved in cognitive processing16 and the salience network, a core network critical for social-emotional functioning17, communication, self-awareness and some aspects of cognition18. Together these findings will considerably further our understanding on the influence of APOE genotype on breakdown of brain network connectivity.

Methods

2.1 Patients

Fifty eight patients that fulfilled clinical diagnostic criteria for PCA4 and 82 patients that fulfilled clinical diagnostic criteria for LPA7 were recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research group (NRG) from the Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, between November 29, 2010 and February 28, 2020. All patients were enrolled into the study regardless of age and underwent extensive neurological evaluations by one of two behavioral neurologists (KAJ or JGR) and neuropsychological testing overseen by a neuropsychologist (MMM). All patients also completed a structural MRI that included a resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) protocol, and a Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) scan. All 140 patients in this study showed evidence of beta-amyloid deposition on PET based on the established cut-offs for PiB positivity. All clinical diagnoses were rendered blinded to imaging results. APOE genotyping was performed as previously described19.

2.2 Patient consent and protocols

The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. All patients gave written informed consent to participate in this study.

2.3 Clinical testing

The neurological evaluations performed on the PCA and LPA patients included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for assessing general cognitive function20, Movement Disorders Society sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale III (UPDRS III) to assess for parkinsonism21 and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire to assess for neuropsychiatric features22. A battery of test for simultanagnosia was also administered, which included: 1) Ishihara color plates; 2) images of overlapping line drawings, 3) color images of complex picture scenes, and 4) Navon figures, with performance scored on a 20-point scale (scores under 17 were considered abnormal based on performance in normal controls)23. The neuropsychological evaluation included the 15-item Boston Naming Test (BNT) for assessing confrontational naming24, Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Exam (BDAE) repetition subtest for assessing sentence repetition25, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test – Recognition Percent Correct (AVLT-RPC) for measuring episodic memory26, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (Rey-O) for assessing visuospatial constructional ability27, Visual Object and Space Perception Battery (VOSP) Cubes for assessing visuospatial ability and VOSP Letters for assessing visuoperceptual ability28.

2.4 Image acquisition

All patients underwent scanning with a 3T volumetric MRI on GE scanners (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN that included a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (TR/TE/T1 = 2300/3/900ms; 26 cm field of view, slice thickness = 1.2mm, in plane resolution = 1mm)29, and rsfMRI scanning using gradient echo planer imaging (TE = 30ms; slice thickness = 3.3mm, in plane resolution = 3.3mm and 160 volumes). Participants were instructed to keep their eyes open during the scan30.

2.5 Image processing

All fMRI images were preprocessed using CONN functional connectivity toolbox31 (www.nitrc.org/projects/conn). The preprocessing discarded the first 10 volumes to generate a steady state magnetization, slice time correction, re-alignment (motion estimation and correction), with outlier detection, segmentation and direct normalization to MNI template space, smoothing with a gaussian kernel of 6mm full width, half maximum, nuisance regression for white matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal, denoised for six head motion parameters with their first and second order derivatives32, and bandpass filtered in the 0.01–0.1 Hz frequency to reduce low frequency drift and noise effects33. After preprocessing, the functional images were parcellated into cortical and subcortical areas using the Harvard-Oxford atlas and CONN’s network parcellations atlas which was generated using independent component analysis (ICA) on the HCP dataset (N=497). The mean blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) time series within each region of interest (ROI) of the atlas were extracted. Pearson’s R correlation coefficients were calculated across all ROIs and were transformed to Fisher’s R-to-Z transformations. Voxel (ROI-to-voxel) and network (ROI-to-ROI) level connectivity maps were generated for five networks. The default mode network, visual and salience networks were defined using CONN’s network parcellations atlas, while the language and memory network were defined using meaningful language or memory specific ROIs from the Harvard-Oxford atlas, where the functional connectivity of a network was generated by averaging the signal across multiple regions of interest within that network. For the language network, ROIs were placed in left inferior frontal cortex and posterior superior temporal gyrus, and for the memory network ROIs were placed in amygdala, hippocampus and anterior parahippocampal gyrus. These networks were chosen as they have been associated with the cognitive functioning34 and the dominant aspects of PCA14and LPA15. The memory network, in particular, was chosen based on the results of our previous study3.

2.6 Statistical analysis

2.6.1 Bayesian hierarchical linear models

Bayesian hierarchical linear models (BHLM) were used to address the main questions of interest in this study, namely whether within and between-network connectivity in PCA (APOE ε4 carriers vs non-carriers) and LPA (APOE ε4 carriers vs non-carriers) differ. BHLM are well suited to analyze information-rich imaging data because they manage the repeated measures (multiple connectivity metrics per scan per person), answering many questions simultaneously while using shrinkage estimators via prior distributions and partial pooling of variance parameters to avoid the need for post hoc corrections for multiple comparisons35–37. More specifically, the first BHLM used within-network functional connectivity as the outcome predicted by network- and group-specific fixed effects for an intercept, age, and sex. This model also included a random intercept per person to account for the multiple measures per person in this single model. The second and third models were analogous, using between-network functional connectivity from each network to all other networks using PCA APOE ε4 carriers and non-carrier cases, then between-network functional connectivity from each network to all other networks using LPA APOE ε4 carriers and non-carrier cases. These models were fit using the statistical software R38 version 4.1.2 using the rstanarm39,40 package version 2.21.1 in conjunction with STAN version 2.21.0. These posterior samples provided distributions for each model parameter, and we then summarize these distributions as posterior probabilities. We can answer questions using probabilities, i.e., assessing the proportion of the distribution that was greater than zero and comparing the proportion of samples from one estimate that were greater than a second estimate. The results of these comparisons were reported as posterior probabilities, denoted as Pb in this paper, and we considered Pb&gt;0.90 or &lt;0.10 as moderate evidence of a difference and Pb&gt;0.99 or &lt;0.01 as strong evidence of a difference.

2.6.2 Voxel and network level analysis

The CONN functional connectivity toolbox31 (www.nitrc.org/projects/conn) was used to generate voxel-level and network-level maps for each network within each group: PCA APOE ε4 carriers, PCA APOE ε4 non-carriers, LPA APOE ε4 carriers and LPA APOE ε4 non-carriers. Group average connectivity maps (one-sample t-test) were corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) at p&lt;0.001 and the difference maps between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers (two-sample t-test) were uncorrected at p&lt;0.05 at both the voxel-level, with cluster size corrected for family wise error (FWE) at p&lt;0.05 and network-level, with cluster size corrected for FDR at p&lt;0.05.

Results

3.1 Study demographics

The demographic and clinical features of the cohorts are shown in Table 1. Based on the APOE genotyping, 30 PCA (52%) and 39 LPA (48%) patients APOE ε4 carriers. There was no evidence of PCA APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers differing on sex, education, age at onset, and disease duration. LPA APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers also did not differ on sex, education and disease duration but there were significant differences in age at onset, with younger age at onset in LPA APOE ε4 carriers. On clinical testing, there was no difference between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers for both phenotypes.

3.2 APOE ε4 influences within-network connectivity

3.2.1 Memory network

There was strong evidence of reduced within-network connectivity for the memory network in APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers (Pb=0.998) in LPA (Figure 1). Similarly at the network-level in LPA, APOE ε4 carriers showed reduced connectivity in the memory network (Figure 2 and Supp Figure 1), with voxel-level reductions in connectivity in hippocampal, amygdala and entorhinal areas compared to non-carriers (Supp Figure 2). No differences in the memory network were observed in PCA (Figure 2).

3.2.2 Default mode network (DMN)

There were no significant within-network changes in APOE ε4 carriers, compared to non-carriers for both PCA and LPA (Figure 1, 2, Supp Figure 1 and 2).

3.2.3 Salience network

In PCA, we found moderate evidence of increased within-network connectivity for the salience network in APOE ε4 carriers, compared to non-carriers (Pb=0.932) (Figure 1). At the network-level, there was an increase in salience within-network connectivity (Figure 2 and Supp Figure 1), with increased connectivity observed particularly in the right hemisphere, in carriers compared to non-carriers (Supp Figure 2). In LPA, there was a weak reduction in connectivity in the salience network in carriers compared to non-carriers observed at the network and voxel-level (Figure 2, Supp Figure 1 and 2).

3.2.4. Language network

We found moderate evidence of reduced within-network connectivity in the language network in APOE ε4 carriers (Pb=0.942), compared to non-carriers (Figure 1) in LPA. However, these findings were not observed at both network and voxel-level (Figure 2, Supp Figure 1 and 2). No differences in the language network were observed in PCA (Figure 2, Supp Figure 1 and 2).

3.2.5. Visual network

There were no significant within-network changes in APOE ε4 carriers, compared to non-carriers in the visual network for either PCA and LPA (Figure 1 and 2). However, at the voxel-level, weak reductions in the left hemisphere in the occipital lobe were observed for LPA (Supp Figure 1 and 2).

3.3 APOE ε4 alters between-network connectivity

In PCA, for the memory network there were no significant between-network changes in APOE ε4 carriers, compared to non-carriers (Figure 3). However, there was strong evidence of reduced DMN-to-salience connectivity (Pb=0.999), with moderate evidence of reduced DMN-to-language connectivity (Pb=0.901) and salience-to-visual connectivity (Pb=0.930) in PCA APOE ε4 carriers, compared to non-carriers (Figure 3). At the network and voxel-level, concurring with the BHLM findings, PCA APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers showed a decrease in DMN-to-salience connectivity (Figure 2), in the form of reduced connectivity from the DMN ROIs to the lateral frontal lobe, and reduced connectivity from the salience ROIs to the parietal and temporal lobes (Supp Figure 2). Decreased DMN-to-language and salience-to-visual connectivity were also apparent but not significant at the network-level (Figure 2 and 3).

In LPA, for the memory network there were no significant between-network changes in APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers (Figure 3). However, there was strong evidence of reduced DMN-to-visual connectivity (Pb&gt;0.997) and language-to-visual connectivity (Pb=0.999), with moderate evidence of reduced salience-to-visual connectivity (Pb=0.939) in LPA APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers (Figure 3). In contrast to the BHLM, APOE ε4 carriers showed increased memory-to-visual connectivity at the network-level (Figure 2), with increased connectivity between the memory network ROIs and the occipital lobe (Supp Figure 2). Decreased DMN-to-visual connectivity was also apparent but not significant at the network-level.

Discussion

This study investigated functional connectivity networks in APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers in the two most common atypical AD variants, PCA and LPA. We found disruptions in the within-network connectivity across a few brain networks, particularly reductions in the memory and language networks in LPA APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers. Additionally, we also found that APOE is related to alterations in functional connectivity between multiple networks in both syndromes. These findings suggest that APOE genotype may have an influence on the pathophysiology of these AD phenotypes.

The memory network included regions of interest in the medial temporal lobe, the locus of episodic memory in the brain41. In LPA, APOE ε4 carriers showed strong evidence of reductions in the within-network connectivity of the memory network compared to non-carriers, with reduced connectivity observed in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. This is supported by the results from our previous study where we observed smaller medial temporal volumes in LPA APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers3. Previous studies have also consistently shown a relationship between APOE ε4 genotype and greater medial temporal lobe atrophy across the AD clinical spectrum42,43. In contrast, PCA APOE ε4 carriers did not show any reductions in memory network connectivity compared to non-carriers, suggesting that the modulating effect of APOE ε4 on this network may not be consistent across all AD phenotypes. In our previous study we found evidence that APOE ε4 influences the medial temporal lobe in both LPA and PCA, where APOE had stronger effects on volume in LPA, and stronger effects on tau uptake on PET in PCA3. Given a potential time lag between tau deposition and atrophy, it is possible that the influence of APOE occurs at a different stage of the disease in these AD phenotypes with disruption to the memory network occurring later in the disease in PCA. Longitudinal follow-up will be needed to test this hypothesis. Indeed, we observed faster declines in memory performance over the first year from diagnosis in LPA compared to PCA44. We also observed greater disruption within the language network in APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers in LPA, suggesting that APOE may influence connectivity throughout the temporal lobe. This finding brings up the possibility that APOE may influence the phenotypical presentation of the disease in LPA and could theoretically influence patterns of clinical decline in these patients.

The salience network showed higher within-network connectivity in PCA APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers. This may be implying oversensitivity to salient events, such as apathy and anxiety, which may be particularly strong in PCA patients45,46 due to the preservation of insight into their visuospatial and perceptual symptoms5 and these may be driven by the APOE ε4 genotype. Although an oversensitivity of salient events, manifesting as irritability and anxiety has been reported in LPA patients47, there was no significant difference in the within-network connectivity in LPA APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers, suggesting that this phenomenon was not driven by the APOE ε4 genotype, but could implicitly be caused by the pathophysiology of LPA. Currently there are no reports in PCA and LPA, however, in tAD patients a relationship between APOE ε4 and neuropsychological symptoms, such as anxiety and apathy, has been noted, with APOE ε4 carriers having a higher percentage of these symptoms compared to non-carrier48. However, the exact role of APOE ε4 remains under debate and further research on the subject is warranted. The salience network is strongly anticorrelated to the DMN in AD, whereby decreases in DMN connectivity are related to increases in salience network connectivity34,49. We did not observe a decrease in DMN within-network connectivity in the APOE ε4 carriers in PCA. However, we did observe a strong increase in salience within-network connectivity and a reduction in connectivity between the salience network and DMN and weaker reductions in connectivity between the salience and visual networks. These reductions in between network connectivity reflect stronger anticorrelations between the salience network and both the DMN and visual network in the PCA APOE ε4 carriers. The exact reason for these reductions is unknown but one possible explanation could point towards the role of the salience network as a switch to generate transient control signals to deactivate the DMN during stimulus driven cognitive tasks50 and to some extent regulate the visuospatial network in visuospatial memory response tasks51. Another possibility would be that this functional disconnection seen between salience and DMN may be associated with both normal aging and disease progression52. Therefore, a reduction in connectivity between these networks could be hinting towards an alteration in the engagement and disengagement of the salience, DMN and the visuospatial networks and the possibility of APOE genotype influencing this event. Further, reductions in the connectivity between the DMN and language network were also noted in APOE ε4 carriers in PCA, which could have been triggered by disruptions in the DMN, however the exact reason for this finding is unclear. Nevertheless, previous studies with APOE genotype have reported disruptions in DMN connectivity, specifically reduced connectivity of the frontal and posterior DMN53 with more pronounced DMN disruptions in the left hemisphere54 in APOE ε4 carriers.

We did not observe any alterations in connectivity between the salience network and DMN in LPA, but we did see reductions in connectivity between the salience and visual networks, like in PCA. In fact, the visual network also showed reduced connectivity to the DMN and language network in LPA. This could reflect clinical overlap between both phenotypes, as visuospatial difficulties have been reported to develop in LPA44,55. This overlap could be intensified in the presence of the APOE ε4 genotype. In contrast to these reductions in between-network connectivity, we found evidence for an increase in connectivity between the visual and memory networks. This apparent increase in fact reflects weaker/fewer anticorrelations between the two networks, possibly as a consequence of lower within-network connectivity in the memory network in APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers.

Strengths of this study include the large PCA and LPA cohorts, split based on their APOE status that allowed us to evaluate the influence of APOE ε4 on functional connectivity, with greater statistical power, along with comprehensive clinical evaluations, and the fact that our models controlled for differences in age and sex. Our findings call attention to the stark differences in connectivity in APOE ε4 carriers versus non-carriers, which highlights the influence of genotype on these atypical AD phenotypes. A potential limitation is the influence of atrophy on our brain connectivity measures, given that APOE ε4 is associated with medial temporal volume in atypical AD3. However, we performed a sensitivity analysis and found that including medial temporal volume as a covariate had little effect on our estimates of APOE ε4 differences in memory network functional connectivity. Other limitations include accounting for the influence of scanner and software versions, which we examined through a sensitivity analysis and found essentially no detectible variability and the absence of longitudinal data to assess how these network changes evolve are needed.

Conclusion

Our results showed that the APOE genotype modulates both within-network and between-network connectivity, with distinct network disruption patterns in PCA and LPA. APOE ε4 carriers showed reductions in the memory and language within-network connectivity in LPA, with increased salience within-network connectivity in PCA. Between-network analysis showed evidence of reduced connectivity from the DMN in APOE ε4 carriers for both groups, with disruptions to the visual network in LPA and to the salience and language networks in PCA. Together, these findings suggest that the modulatory effect of the APOE genotype differed across the AD phenotypes and did not target only the memory network. APOE status should be considered in studies investigating connectivity in atypical AD variants.
