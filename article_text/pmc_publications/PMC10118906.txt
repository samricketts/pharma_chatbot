Animal models of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are attractive tools for preclinical, prodromal drug testing. The TgF344-AD (Tg) rat exhibits cognitive deficits and 5 major hallmarks of AD. Here we show that spatial water maze (WMZ) memory deficits and proteomic differences in dorsal CA1 were present in young Tg rats. Aged learning-unimpaired (AU) and aged learning-impaired (AI) proteome associated changes were identified and differed by sex. Levels of phosphorylated tau, reactive astrocytes and microglia were significantly increased in aged Tg rats and correlated with the WMZ learning index (LI); in contrast, no significant correlation was present between amyloid plaques or insoluble Aβ levels and LI. Neuroinflammatory markers were also significantly correlated with LI and increased in female Tg rats. The anti-inflammatory marker, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2), was significantly reduced in aged impaired Tg rats and correlated with LI. Identifying and understanding mechanisms that allow for healthy aging by overcoming genetic drivers for AD, and/or promoting drivers for successful aging, are important for developing successful therapeutics against AD.

pmc1. Introduction

The ‘amyloid cascade’ hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been a major conceptual framework in the search for a cure for AD. Based on discoveries that plaques observed in AD patient brains were composed of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides and that mutations in the amyloid precursor proteins (APP) were causative for early-onset AD (Hardy and Allsop 1991, Hardy and Higgins 1992, Selkoe and Hardy 2016), much research to reduce the amyloid burden in the brain was generated. One of the many potential factors for failed clinical trials is that the participants already had impaired cognition (Mehta, Jackson et al. 2017, Elmaleh, Farlow et al. 2019, Yiannopoulou, Anastasiou et al. 2019). Therefore, there is a push for clinical trials to use prodromal subjects with Aβ and/or tau pathologies verified with positron emission tomography (PET) scans or other biomarkers (Jack and Holtzman 2013, Jack, Bennett et al. 2018). Hence, animal models of AD with characterized aging-related behavioral and pathological stages are attractive tools for preclinical, prodromal drug testing.

Given the strong hereditary nature of APP mutations with early-onset AD, much work has been done to test the amyloid hypothesis with transgenic mouse models of AD (Jankowsky and Zheng 2017, Myers and McGonigle 2019, Vitek, Araujo et al. 2020). While mouse models of AD-like pathology engineered to overexpress APP and Aβ peptides are extremely useful to examine the effects of Aβ (e.g., 5xFAD, Tg2576, PSAPP), they fail to recapitulate the complex range of human AD pathologies without the addition of a human tau mutation (e.g., 3xTgAD) (Oddo, Caccamo et al. 2003).

The TgF344-AD rat was designed to overcome these limitations and expresses human APP with the Swedish mutation and human presenilin 1 with the ΔE9 mutation on the Fischer 344 rat background (Cohen, Rezai-Zadeh et al. 2013). The advantage of the TgF344-AD model is that all 5 major hallmarks of AD pathology present without additional human transgenes: (1) Aβ plaques, (2) cognitive deficits, (3) neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), (4) neuronal loss, and (5) chronic neuroinflammation. Two possible reasons for the lack of NFTs and neuronal loss in APP-overexpressing mice have been postulated. First, the abundance of neurotoxic soluble oligomeric Aβ species is less in PSAPP mice than it is in the TgF344-AD rat (Cohen, Rezai-Zadeh et al. 2013). Second, mice are evolutionarily 4–5 million years further away from humans than rats (Yang, Smit et al. 2004), and rats express the full complement of six tau isoforms present in humans, while mice only express three of the human tau isoforms (McMillan, Korvatska et al. 2008, Hanes, Zilka et al. 2009).

Additional similarities of the TgF344-AD rat model with human AD include neurovascular network dysfunction (Joo, Lai et al. 2017), neuronal network dysfunction (Bazzigaluppi, Beckett et al. 2018), altered hippocampal synaptic transmission (Smith and McMahon 2018), connectivity impairments (Munoz-Moreno, Tudela et al. 2018), locus coeruleus dysfunction (Rorabaugh, Chalermpalanupap et al. 2017) and vision disturbances (Tsai, Lu et al. 2014). Therefore, the TgF344-AD rat model is a more appropriate animal model of preclinical AD that recapitulates a broader and more complete repertoire of AD-like pathologies than any other currently available Aβ-overproducing AD animal model.

It is important to note that inbred animal models do not demonstrate identical gene expression and identical behavior. Even identical, monozygotic twins (humans) do not have identical (100%) gene expression (Gregersen 1993, Bruder, Piotrowski et al. 2008, Jonsson, Magnusdottir et al. 2021). Behavioral heterogeneity has been reported in numerous aging research studies (Gallagher, Burwell et al. 1993, Thompson, Moyer et al. 1996, Knuttinen, Gamelli et al. 2001, Knuttinen, Power et al. 2001, Tombaugh, Rowe et al. 2005, Lin, Sherathiya et al. 2020). Our behavioral findings demonstrate that a small percentage of the aged Tg and wild-type (WT) rats have memory scores like young-adult WT animals. Identifying and understanding mechanisms that allow for successful aging by either overcoming genetic drivers for AD pathologies, or promoting drivers for successful aging, or both mechanisms, are important for developing successful therapeutics against AD.

2. Methods and Materials

2.1. Subjects.

Male and female TgF344-AD and WT littermate rats were bred at the Center for Comparative Medicine facilities at Northwestern University using male TgF344-AD rats obtained from Dr. Terrance Town (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) via MTA and female F344 rats obtained from the National Institute of Aging (NIA) aged rodent colony (maintained under contract by Charles River Laboratories). Genotype was verified by Transnetyx using ear punches collected at postnatal day 21 during weaning. Additional male and female F344 WT rats were obtained from the NIA aged rodent colony. There was no significant difference between the learning performance of these NIA rats from the WT littermates. Therefore, the behavioral data from the NIA and WT littermates were combined to form the WT groups. The rats were housed in a climate-controlled vivarium on a 14:10 light:dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Animal care, breeding and experimental protocols were consistent with National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

2.2 WMZ training.

Male and female TgF344-AD and WT rats were behaviorally characterized at 6–8 or 18–21 months of age using the WMZ task following the methods previously described and routinely used in our laboratory (Oh, Kuo et al. 2003, Kuo, Lee et al. 2006, Curlik, Weiss et al. 2014, Yu, Curlik et al. 2017). Rats were trained for 5 days (3 trials/session, 2 sessions/day) in a circular pool (180 cm diameter) with 24 ± 1 °C water with the escape platform submerged 2 cm below the surface of the water. The platform location was held constant, but the starting locations were changed on each trial. On each trial, rats were allowed 60 s to find the hidden platform location. If the rat failed to swim to the hidden platform after 60 s, the experimenter gently guided it to the platform. The rats were allowed to remain on the hidden platform for 15 seconds before being removed from the maze. A 60 second probe trial, with the escape platform unavailable, was given one hour after the last training session every day. The data were collected and analyzed using WaterMaze software (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL). Spatial learning and memory of the hidden platform location were analyzed using the cumulative proximity and learning index (LI) as described by Gallagher and colleagues (Gallagher, Burwell et al. 1993). The LI score is a calculation of the average distance spent by the rats from where the escape platform was located prior to removal during the 60 second probe trial on probe trials 2–4. Therefore, the higher the LI score, the lower the rat’s average cumulative proximity to the platform and thus the worse the performance on the WMZ task.

Four-weeks after WMZ training, the rats were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 1x PBS. This is a common practice to maximize the detection of stable proteomic expression and minimize the influence of learning and training effects (Tombaugh, Rowe et al. 2005, Rowe, Blalock et al. 2007, Haberman, Colantuoni et al. 2011, Ianov, De Both et al. 2017), especially since learning-related intrinsic excitability changes in hippocampal pyramidal neurons have been shown to return to basal state in two-weeks (Moyer, Thompson et al. 1996, Thompson, Moyer et al. 1996, Tombaugh, Rowe et al. 2005). Brains were hemisected. One hemisphere was drop fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and stored at ~4°C for 2–3 days, after which it was stored in 1x PBS with 0.02% sodium azide at ~4°C until use. The other hemisphere was microdissected on ice using a Zeiss Stemi DV4 stereo microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC, White Plains, NY), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use for proteomics.

2.3. Immunohistochemistry (IHC).

The brains were cryoprotected for 24 hours in 30% sucrose in PBS. For light microscopy experiments, brain tissue sections were cut at 40μm using a Leica SM2010 R sliding microtome (Leica Biosystems, Deer Park, IL). For immunofluorescence experiments, brain tissue was embedded in paraffin and cut at 4μm using a Microm Model H325 microtome.

The following primary antibodies were used: 6E10 (BioLegend, 803001) at 1:1500 for Aβ, AT8 (ThermoFisher, MN1020) at 1:1500 for phospho-tau, and CD68 (BioRad, MCA341R) at 1:500 for activated microglia. Anti-mouse secondary antibodies were used.

Sections were mounted and imaged using TissueFAXS CHROMA (TissueGnostics GmbH, Austria) or Zeiss Axio Imager M2/Z2 (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT).

2.4. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics.

Quantitative tandem-mass-tag (TMT) mass spectrometry was performed to determine relative proteomic changes in bulk extracts from dorsal CA1 region of young adult male WT and Tg rats as previously reported (He, Arroyo et al. 2019). The CA1 sections were homogenized in lysis buffer (RIPA buffer, 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail). The fold change of each protein was calculated as the difference in TMT reporter ion intensity between WT and Tg rats, normalized to WT levels.

The tandem mass spectra were searched against UniProt rat protein database (downloaded on 04–01-2013), (UniProt Consortium) and matched to sequences using the ProLuCID/SEQUEST algorithm (ProLuCID version 3.1) with 10 ppm peptide mass tolerance for precursor ions and 600 ppm for fragment ions. ProLuCID searches included all fully and half-tryptic peptide candidates that fell within the mass tolerance window and had no miscleavages. Carbamidomethylation (+57.02146 Da) of cysteine was considered as a static modification. Peptide/spectrum matches (PSMs) were assessed in DTASelect2 using the cross-correlation score (XCorr), and normalized difference in cross-correlation scores (DeltaCN). Peptide probabilities and false-discovery rates (FDR) were calculated based on a target/decoy database containing the reversed sequences of all the proteins appended to the target database (Elias and Gygi 2007). For each brain region per biological replicate, proteins identified had a FDR of 1% at the protein level. Each protein identified was required to have a minimum of one peptide of minimal length of six amino acid residues.

2.5. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).

Sandwich ELISAs were performed to quantify target proteins identified from mass spectrometry. Meso Scale Diagnostics (MSD) panels and MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 (Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC, Rockville, MD) were used to validate the amyloid pathology and assess proinflammatory cytokine levels in the dorsal CA1 region from WT and Tg rats using standard procedures as described by MSD. CA1 was specifically chosen for all brain analyses due to its crucial role in memory retrieval and the specific degeneration and impairment in CA1 neurons in AD (Takamura, Mizuta et al. 2021). Furthermore, as initial mass spectrometry was conducted solely on CA1 homogenates, the same brain region was used in the subsequent immunoassays for consistency. CA1 tissue from WT and Tg rats were homogenized with lysis buffer: 1x PBS, 2x Protease/Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, #PPC2020), Triton X-100 (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (ThermoFisher Scientific Pierce™). Each homogenate sample was run in duplicates in the ELISA and MSD assays to ensure enough data and measure the precision of the assays. Note that the same rats were not used in all proteomic and ELISA analyses presented in this study. Soluble oligomer-associated Aβ was extracted by centrifuging the homogenates at 16,000x g speed at 4C for 30 minutes and separating the supernatant. Plaque-associated insoluble Aβ peptides were extracted by suspending the pellet with 70% formic acid and neutralizing with 1M Tris-HCl. Soluble and insoluble Aβ peptides (1–38, 1–40, 1–42) were quantified with the MSD V-PLEX Aβ Peptide Panel 1 (4G8) Kit. Proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, KC/GRO, TNF-α) were measured with MSD V-PLEX Proinflammatory Panel 2 Kit. The following ELISA sandwich kits were used to quantify the listed proteins: phosphorylated tau [Ser388/Ser489] (MyBioSource #MBS029585), CD44 (LSBio #LS-F33573–1), CD68 (MyBioSource #MBS705029), AKT3 (LSBio #LS-F55992–1), APOE (MyBioSource #MBS263133), GFAP (MyBioSource #MBS700870), TREM2 (MyBioSource #MBS907817), GRIN1 (MyBioSource #MBS075740) and VCAM1 (MyBioSource #MBS027532).

2.6. Statistical analyses.

Statistical analyses were performed using t-test, Mann-Whitney, or analysis of variance (ANOVA) and, where appropriate, significant effects were evaluated using post hoc tests (GraphPad Prism v9).

3. Results

F344 rats from NIA and WT littermates were not behaviorally different on the WMZ task, and thus, their behavioral data were combined to form the WT group.

3.1. Spatial water maze memory deficits begin at a young age in TgF344-AD rats.

The rats were behaviorally characterized as cognitively unimpaired or impaired based upon their LI scores obtained from their performance on probe trials on the spatial WMZ task (Gallagher, Burwell et al. 1993). The cut-off value to be considered as unimpaired was the mean plus 2 standard deviations of LI values from young adult WT rats. There were no significant differences between male and female rats. Therefore, the LI values for males and females of each group were combined for analysis. Nearly all young adult WT rats (22/23) remembered the hidden platform location, whereas, only about half of the young adult Tg rats (15/28) were unimpaired. Moreover, 40% of aged WT rats (32/79) were unimpaired, whereas only ~20% of aged Tg rats (20/97) were unimpaired. These data show that young adult Tg rats show memory deficits early in life that are similar to that observed in aged WT rats, and that these memory deficits become severe with aging (Fig. 1A).

While the spatial memory for the hidden platform location was significantly impaired in young Tg rats as compared to young WT rats, there were no statistically significant differences for the rate of learning the hidden platform location during the hidden-platform trials among the young WT, young Tg unimpaired, and young Tg impaired rats: group by session ANOVA, F (18, 411) = 1.406, p = 0.1241 (Fig. 1B). These results are similar to previous studies that reported young adult (4–6 month old) Tg rats were not impaired on learning the spatial water maze nor Barnes maze, (Cohen, Rezai-Zadeh et al. 2013, Rorabaugh, Chalermpalanupap et al. 2017, Berkowitz, Harvey et al. 2018, Pentkowski, Berkowitz et al. 2018). Moreover, only the aged, impaired Tg rats had significantly worse proximity scores for the hidden platform location by the end of the tenth training session as compared to the other groups of rats (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, an analysis of the latency and of the path length to find the escape platform did not indicate statistical differences among the groups. Overall, the escape latency decreased significantly from a mean of 46.6 seconds to a mean of 16.2 seconds (F7,483=36.6, p&lt;0.0001), and the path length shortened significantly from a mean of 1108 cm to a mean of 438 cm (F7,483=23.2, p&lt;0.0001). A similar analysis of swim speed indicated a significant increase in swim speed across sessions from 24.0 cm/s to 27.3 cm/s (F7,483=13.3, p&lt;0.0001).

Note, that as previously reported (Gallagher, Burwell et al. 1993, Tombaugh, Rowe et al. 2005, Foster and Kumar 2007, Yu, Curlik et al. 2017, Gant, Blalock et al. 2018, Kumar, Rani et al. 2018), we observed the normal aging-related memory deficit for the hidden platform location on the WMZ task in the WT rat (WT: F344 rats from NIA colony and WT littermates from breeding). In addition, if the rats were still not finding the platform on the day 4 training sessions, visible platform trials were run on day 5 to determine if the rats had compromised vision. Such rats generally swam in circles near the edge of the pool. We excluded 8 rats from the analysis that were suspected of being blind because they didn’t find the platform on visible platform trials; all of those rats were male Tg rats.

3.2. Mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis revealed significant differences in protein levels in dorsal CA1 region between young adult WT and TgF344-AD rats.

Dorsal CA1 region from male young adult tissue from WT (N =7), Tg unimpaired (N = 4), and Tg impaired (N =4) rats were analyzed using TMT-based quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. This experiment revealed that 100+ proteins were expressed at significantly different levels in dorsal CA1 region in Tg relative to WT rats (Fig. 2). Among them, we found elevated App (as expected) levels, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP: a marker of astrocyte activation (Eng and Ghirnikar 1994, Ben Haim and Rowitch 2017, Liddelow, Guttenplan et al. 2017)) in the Tg rats.

Proteins involved in neuroinflammatory and tau-kinase pathways were uniquely altered in the Tg impaired rats as compared to the WT and Tg unimpaired. For example, proteins involved in neuroinflammatory pathways such as GFAP were significantly elevated in the Tg impaired rats as compared to the WT (Fig. S2A), and this alteration was not present in the Tg unimpaired. GFAP levels from MS were also significantly correlated with performance on the WMZ task as the impaired Tg rats had higher GFAP levels as compared to both WT and the unimpaired Tg rats.

Moreover, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) and ApoE were elevated in the Tg rats and significantly correlated with WMZ performance (Fig. S2B, C). Increased VCAM1 levels in the aging brain have been recently shown to increase microglial activation, disrupt the BBB and increase leukocyte recruitment to the brain, thereby elevating inflammatory responses in the brain (Heneka, Carson et al. 2015, Yousef, Czupalla et al. 2019). Thus, the higher VCAM1 levels observed in the impaired Tg rats substantiate the finding that enhanced neuroinflammatory pathways accompany cognitive impairment. On the other hand, elevated ApoE expression in the impaired Tg rats suggests that the inability of microglia to effectively clear Aβ and prevent Aβ fibrillization might be contributing to their cognitive impairment since ApoE is one of the main lipoproteins secreted by microglia for Aβ phagocytosis (Wisniewski and Drummond 2020).

Lastly, the MS analysis revealed significantly altered relative expression levels of proteins involved in tau phosphorylation, mainly AKT serine/threonine kinase 3 (AKT3) from the Akt protein kinase family (Fig. S2D). AKT3 was significantly downregulated in the impaired Tg compared to the unimpaired Tg while there was no correlation with WMZ performance among the WT rats. Downregulation of AKT3 in the impaired Tg rats implies enhanced GSK3β phosphorylation and activity, which may lead to tau hyperphosphorylation. However, as tauopathy manifests later in AD pathology (Bilousova, Miller et al. 2016), AKT3 downregulation in the young Tg rats indicates that tau is dysregulated in an age-dependent fashion by a cascade of biological pathways beginning early in AD pathogenesis. Taken together, these data from MS suggest a crucial role for neuroinflammatory pathways and tau-kinase activity for cognitive impairment in the TgF344-AD rats.

3.3 No correlation between amyloid plaque Aß peptide levels and LI.

A combination of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ELISA experiments were conducted to visualize the Aβ load in the WT and Tg rats as well as to assess the effect of Aβ accumulation on WMZ performance. The IHC results revealed significantly increased deposition of 6E10-stained Aβ plaques in the aged Tg rats as compared to WT and young Tg (Fig. 3A). The Mann-Whitney test showed that the median percent staining of the two age groups is significantly different (p &lt; 0.0155). However, the percentage of 6E10 plaque coverage in the dorsal hippocampus did not correlate with WMZ performance (R2 = 0.003502, p-value = 0.8215) (Fig. 3B). Additionally, insoluble Aβ levels (fAβ), which constitute the plaques and fibrils, and soluble Aβ (sAβ), which constitute the oligomers, were significantly elevated in the aged Tg compared to WT and young Tg (Fig. 4A, B). None of the insoluble Aβ peptides correlated with performance on WMZ (Fig. 4D): (fAβ1–38: R2 = 0.05028, p-value = 0.2513), (fAβ1–40: R2 = 0.1144, p-value = 0.0783), (fAβ1–42: R2 = 0.06999, p-value = 0.1737).

3.4. Soluble Aβ is elevated in the TgF344-AD rat and correlates with LI.

Soluble Aβ peptides showed a stronger correlation with WMZ performance, particularly sAβ1–40 and sAβ1–42 (Fig. 4C): (sAβ1–38: R2 = 0.02660, p-value = 0.3979), (sAβ1–40: R2 = 0.2087, p-value = 0.0127), (sAβ1–42: R2 = 0.2091, p-value = 0.0126). These significant correlations were mainly driven by the very low sAβ levels in the young Tg and WT rats compared to the drastically higher sAβ levels in the aged Tg rats. Among the aged Tg, the increase in sAβ1–40 and sAβ1–42 levels in the aged impaired (AI) rats as compared to the aged unimpaired (AU) rats was not significant (sAβ1–40: p-value = 0.7765, sAβ1–42: p-value = 0.7367). All in all, these results indicate that Aβ plaque deposition is most likely not the root cause of cognitive decline in AD. In addition, soluble Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 might be causing Aβ-driven toxicity while in contrast, soluble Aβ1–38 might be a negative regulator of disease progression and neurotoxic downstream events caused by Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42.

3.5. Levels of phosphorylated tau and tau kinase Akt3 are significantly increased in aged TgF344-AD rats and correlated with LI.

The pathological significance of tau hyperphosphorylation in AD and myriad other types of neurodegenerative disorders such as frontotemporal dementia led to our pursuit of its expression levels in our Tg rats and its impact on WMZ performance. As expected, immunofluorescence microscopy images uncovered a significant deposition of phosphorylated tau (pTau) and Aβ in the aged Tg as compared to the WT (Fig. 6C). pTau levels were significantly correlated with WMZ performance in young and aged male rats, with aged Tg exhibiting the highest pTau levels (Fig. 5A) (R2 = 0.3815, p-value &lt; 0.0001). The young Tg rats exhibited similar pTau levels as young WT and did not show a significant correlation with pTau levels and WMZ performance (Fig. S3B). In addition, the AI Tg rats had significantly higher pTau levels as compared to AU Tg rats (p-value &lt; 0.0001) and as compared to AI WT rats (Fig. S3A) (p-value &lt; 0.0001). The AU Tg rats also had significantly elevated pTau levels as compared to the AU WT rats (p-value = 0.0495).

In addition to the CA1 tissue from male WT and Tg rats, we examined the levels of pTau from female Tg rats. pTau signal in aged females was higher as compared to the males (Fig. 5D). However, that difference did not reach statistical significance. Young and aged female WT and Tg rats exhibited a more variable yet similar positive trend with cognitive impairment and pTau levels (Fig. 5B) (R2 = 0.2431, p-value = 0.0026).

Similar to the proteomic results, the AI Tg rats exhibited significantly lower levels of AKT3 compared to the AU Tg rats (p-value = 0.0126) (Fig. 5E). Among the young and aged Tg animals, AKT3 levels significantly correlated with WMZ performance (R2= 0.3434, p-value = 0.0066) (Fig. 5F). There was no correlation between AKT3 levels and WMZ performance among the WT animals (R2= 0.06718, p-value = 0.2839). These results suggest that Tg rats with higher brain AKT3 levels are protected against AD-associated cognitive decline through higher inhibition of tau phosphorylation. Since no correlation was observed among the WT rats, higher AKT3 expression is most likely not protective against normal age-associated cognitive deficits.

A summary of biomarker findings with respect to age, genotype and learning index correlations is shown in Table 1.

3.6. Levels of reactive astrocytes and microglia are significantly increased in TgF344-AD rats and are correlated with LI.

To determine if levels of activated astrocytes and microglia are altered in the Tg rats with aging, we examined the levels of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP: marker for activated astrocytes (Eng and Ghirnikar 1994, Sofroniew and Vinters 2010, Ben Haim and Rowitch 2017, Liddelow, Guttenplan et al. 2017)) and the cluster of differentiation 68 protein (CD68: marker for activated microglia (Wasserman, Yang et al. 2008, Kodali, Parihar et al. 2015, Jurga, Paleczna et al. 2020)). CD68 levels increased significantly with age in both WT and Tg animals (Fig. S5) (p-value = 0.0790 for young vs aged WT and p-value &lt; 0.0001 for young vs aged Tg), while there was not a significant age-dependent increase in GFAP levels (p-value = 0.1799 for young vs aged WT and p-value = 0.4428 for young vs aged Tg). The aged Tg animals had significantly higher CD68 and GFAP levels than the aged WT (CD68: p-value &lt; 0.0001, GFAP: p-value = 0.0109). As per the immunoassay results, the aged Tg rats exhibited a high deposition of CD68 staining (Fig. 6A).

Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between GFAP and CD68 levels with spatial memory (Fig. 6B, C) (CD68: R2= 0.4444, p-value = 0.0007), (GFAP: (R2= 0.3365, p-value = 0.0030). There was no significant correlation in CD68 levels and WMZ performance in the aged WT animals (p-value &gt; 0.9999) and in the young WT (p-value = 0.9965). Among the aged Tg rats, the AI animals had significantly elevated CD68 levels as compared to the AU animals (Fig. 6D) (p-value = 0.0154). The AI Tg rats had significantly higher CD68 levels than the AI WT rats (Fig. 6E) (p-value = 0.0023), indicating that chronic microglial activation is exacerbated in our transgenic model. As for GFAP, AI Tg animals exhibited significantly higher GFAP levels as compared to the AU Tg (p-value = 0.0247). GFAP expression was higher in the AI Tg rats as compared to the AI WT (p-value = 0.0015), and there was no significant difference in GFAP levels between AU WT and AI WT (p-value = 0.9959).

3.7. Proinflammatory cytokines are significantly increased in aged TgF344-AD rats and correlated with LI.

The increases in astroglial proteins, GFAP and CD68, suggested that inflammatory cytokine levels may also be elevated in the Tg rats. Therefore, we examined the levels of two proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and interleukin 5 (IL-5). These cytokines are among the main indicators of inflammation as they are signaling molecules released predominantly by macrophages to upregulate inflammatory responses. Levels of IL-1β are significantly increased in aged Tg female rats as compared to aged WT male and female and aged male Tg rats (Fig. 7A). Notably, the young WT and Tg female rats had similar levels of IL-1β that were significantly higher than those from young WT and Tg male rats. These increases in IL-1β levels are correlated with spatial memory deficits: greater the IL-1β level, worse the spatial memory (Fig. 7B,D) (Male: R2= 0.1524, p-value = 0.0247), (Female: R2= 0.1814, p-value = 0.0069). IL-1β levels were also significantly elevated in AU Tg rats as compared to the AU WT rats (p-value = 0.0103) and similarly in AI Tg rats as compared to the AI WT rats (p-value = 0.0012).

Although there were no significant differences in IL-5 levels between male and female, young and aged WT and Tg rats, IL-5 levels were signficantly increased in aged Tg rats as compared to the other groups. Along with IL-1β, the IL-5 levels in the female rats were significantly correlated with spatial memory (Fig. 7C) (R2= 0.3362, p-value = 0.0001).

These findings indicate that proinflammatory cytokine levels are exacerbated in aging and AD pathology, and that there are sex differences in their expression levels in the brain, particularly for IL-1β and IL-5.

3.8. Anti-inflammatory marker, TREM2, is significantly reduced in aged impaired TgF344-AD rats and correlated with LI.

TREM2 is found exclusively in microglia in the brain (Gratuze, Leyns et al. 2018). Moreover, loss-of-function TREM2 mutation significantly increases the risk for developing AD, similar to those with APOE4 (Ulland and Colonna 2018). Notably, the levels of TREM2 protein are negatively correlated with spatial memory (R2= 0.3065, p-value = 0.0027). AU Tg female rats had significantly higher TREM2 levels as compared to the AU WT (p-value = 0.0002), the AI WT (p-value = 0.0014) and the AI Tg (p-value &lt; 0.0001), indicating that animals, especially transgenic rats, with high levels of TREM2 have unimpaired spatial memory as compared to those rats with significantly less TREM2 (Fig. 8).

3.9. VCAM1 is significantly correlated with LI while CD44 is not.

VCAM1 ELISA results on young and aged WT and Tg males revealed a strong correlation with LI (Fig. 9A) (R2= 0.3529, p-value = 0.0073). This correlation was mainly driven by the aged Tg and partially by the young Tg as the young WT and aged WT exhibited very similar VCAM1 levels (p-value = 0.9997). The aged Tg exhibited higher VCAM1 levels as compared to the young Tg, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p-value = 0.2456). These results suggest that increased microglial inflammatory response and leukocyte recruitment to the CNS contribute to the cognitive deficits in the Tg rats. In contrast, another aging and inflammatory marker, CD44, did not correlate with LI (R2= 0.1662, p-value = 0.0535) (Fig. S6) but was significantly elevated in the aged Tg rats as compared to the aged WT rats (p-value 0.0245) and young Tg rats (p-value = 0.0453) (Fig. 9B).

4. Discussion

4.1. Neuroinflammation and Tauopathy in AD

Our data solidify the significance of neuroinflammatory pathways and hyperphosphorylated tau for cognitive impairment in the Tg rats. Proinflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-1β, as well as CD68, VCAM1 and GFAP showed statistical significance for cognitive impairment in both the young and aged Tg rats. Elevated levels of IL-1β, VCAM1, CD68 and GFAP indicate a leaky and disrupted BBB, enhanced leukocyte recruitment to the brain and elevated activation levels of microglia and astrocytes, which lead to neuronal death and thus exacerbate cognitive deficits. As a result of defective axonal transport, oxidative stress and ineffective clearing of protein aggregates likely induced by neuroinflammation and tauopathy, our results indicate mechanisms for the neuronal loss and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of the Tg rats, as previously reported (Cohen, Rezai-Zadeh et al. 2013). The levels of proinflammatory cytokines and proteins significantly increased with age, indicating that neuroinflammatory signals start contributing to the cascade of pathways that eventually lead to Aβ and tau pathology very early in AD. This trend was mostly absent in the WT rats, suggesting that these proteins are predominantly driving AD-specific neurotoxicity by enhancing inflammatory responses triggered by Aβ and tau accumulation. However, some proinflammatory proteins such as IL-5 exhibited a significant positive correlation with WMZ performance in the WT rats as well. Therefore, findings from this study suggest that neuroinflammatory signals can similarly account for cognitive heterogeneity in healthy subjects albeit the effect is much stronger in the AD subjects.

On the other hand, pTau only exhibited statistical significance for cognitive impairment among the aged Tg animals. The ELISA results from this study suggest that Aβ and neuroinflammation precede tauopathy in AD as the difference in pTau levels between young WT and young Tg was not statistically significant. This is consistent with findings that Aβ levels correlate with microglial activation in prodromal AD, both of which contribute to tau deposition and tangles that aggregate later in AD pathogenesis (Bilousova, Miller et al. 2016, Ismail, Parbo et al. 2020). The double immunofluorescence staining for CD68 and IBA-1 shown in Figure 8A also supports the suggestion that neuroinflammation precedes tauopathy, i.e., there are many more cells staining for CD68 than for IBA-1, and many staining for IBA-1 are double labelled for both markers, i.e. they appear yellow. Furthermore, the pTau results indicate that the effects of pTau on memory loss are not solely localized to AD as the AI WT also exhibited a significant increase in pTau as compared to the AU WT. This conforms with experimental findings on other neurodegenerative disorders such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) that have reported similar elevations in pTau levels in patients compared to healthy controls (Rosso, van Herpen et al. 2003), solidifying the detrimental impact of pTau accumulation on different types of dementia including AD and FTD. Lastly, the elevated pTau levels in aged rats are further exacerbated in aged female Tg rats, which aligns with previous findings reporting a higher prevalence of AD and elevated levels of pTau epitopes such as pTau-181 in females as compared to males (Schmidt, Kienbacher et al. 2008, Sundermann, Panizzon et al. 2020).

Since the pTau ELISA kit utilized in this study detected tau phosphorylated at Ser388 and Ser489, future studies on TgF344-AD rats should investigate other phosphorylation sites such as Thr231, which has been shown to be a critical epitope in tau hyperphosphorylation and subsequent neurodegeneration in AD (Lin, Cheng et al. 2007, Ando, Maruko-Otake et al. 2016). Further research on tau isoforms and phosphorylation sites is essential for the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic agents as there are 85 potential serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation sites on tau, approximately 50% of which have been identified in the human AD brain (Noble, Hanger et al. 2013). Some phosphorylation sites might be phosphorylated earlier in AD pathogenesis than other phosphorylation sites, rendering them an early and thus significant biomarker of tau dysfunction. One such example is Ser422, which has been reported as one of the earliest markers for tau pathogenesis in cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain (Voss, Koren et al. 2011). While our results show a significant role of pTau (Ser388/Ser489) on cognitive decline in the aged Tg rats, there might be a stronger manifestation of tau phosphorylation at other sites in the young Tg.

While the young Tg did not exhibit a significant accumulation of pTau, both MS and ELISA results showed significantly lower levels of AKT3 in the young impaired Tg as compared to the unimpaired. This indicates that in addition to regulating tau phosphorylation, AKT3 might be involved in other pathways that alter cognitive function in the young Tg. One such possibility is related to CNS insulin signaling and the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis through blood glucose levels (De Felice, Gonçalves et al. 2022). Insulin signaling has been characterized as a trigger of tau hyperphosphorylation as it is involved in the phosphorylation cascade of GSK3β and Akt, which are both involved in tau phosphorylation. Specifically, insulin promotes the inhibition of GSK3β phosphorylation via the activation of Akt, which suppresses tau phosphorylation. Defective insulin-Akt signaling relieves the inhibition of GSK3β phosphorylation, leading to increased tau phosphorylation. In addition, accumulation of pTau has been shown to trigger insulin resistance in the CNS, causing a vicious cycle of insulin dysfunction and tauopathy that exacerbates cognitive deficits in AD due to increased pTau aggregation and disrupted insulin signaling (Gonçalves, Wijesekara et al. 2019). In terms of cognitive function, insulin promotes synaptic modulation and plasticity through the regulation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Furthermore, insulin has been shown to be reduced in the CSF and postmortem brains of AD patients, suggesting a role for insulin dysregulation in AD and neurodegeneration (Craft, Peskind et al. 1998, Akhtar and Sah 2020).

The findings with respect to pTau and AKT3 suggest that the reduction in AKT3 levels in the young impaired Tg might be exacerbating memory deficits by promoting insulin resistance and laying the groundwork for tau hyperphosphorylation. As tau hyperphosphorylation is triggered by multiple kinases and pathological events in AD, only some of which are aberrant in the young Tg animals such as the insulin-Akt pathway, it is unsurprising that the young Tg are yet to exhibit tauopathy. It is likely that an interplay of multiple pathways including amyloidosis and disrupted tau kinase activity leads to the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the aged Tg animals. On the other hand, increased AKT3 expression in the young unimpaired Tg most likely protects them from impaired insulin signaling and developing tauopathy in the future as the AU Tg animals exhibited pTau levels similar to the aged WT. Therefore, as the aged Tg animals with lower AKT3 levels tended to exhibit higher pTau levels, the AKT3 ELISA results substantiate the role of Akt in inhibiting cognitive decline driven by tau hyperphosphorylation. However, since pTau levels were not elevated in the young Tg, the cognitive deficits that begin to emerge in the young Tg animals are most likely driven by insulin dysfunction in the CNS and enhanced neuroinflammatory signals rather than tauopathy. The results from this study thus show that a combination of neuroinflammatory signals and tau kinases significantly contribute to cognitive decline in the young Tg, which is further exacerbated by tauopathy in the aged Tg.

The AU Tg rats might be compensating for AD pathology by overexpressing AKT3. However, this is likely not the case as AKT3 levels in the AU Tg were not significantly higher than those in the aged WT. Therefore, it appears that instead of the unimpaired Tg overexpressing AKT3 to override AD pathologies such as amyloidosis, the impaired Tg simply have reduced AKT3 levels as a result of impaired insulin signaling, which drive cognitive decline through tau hyperphosphorylation and insulin resistance.

4.2. Insoluble and Soluble Aβ Peptides in AD

Immunohistochemistry and immunoassay analyses on Aβ revealed that plaques did not correlate with WMZ performance in the Tg rats, aligning with previous findings reporting a lack of correlation between dementia and Aβ levels in both humans (Price, McKeel et al. 2009) and mice (Games, Adams et al. 1995). While neither Aβ plaque load nor insoluble Aβ levels exhibited statistical significance in cognitive impairment, soluble Aβ levels showed a stronger trend with WMZ performance in the Tg rats. This trend was especially strong for sAβ1–40 and sAβ1–42 levels, solidifying the role of toxic soluble Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 oligomers in driving cognitive deficits. Moreover, sAβ1–38 exhibited a statistically significant decrease in the AI Tg rats as compared to the AU Tg rats, which suggests a protective effect of soluble Aβ1–38 levels in AD. In past studies, Aβ1–38 has been shown to downregulate Aβ1–40- and Aβ1–42-driven toxicity on mitochondrial respiration and reduce long-term progression of disease from MCI to AD (Hatashita and Wakebe 2017), highlighting its neuroprotective role in AD pathology (Spies, Verbeek et al. 2012). While this study has validated the role of insoluble Aβ plaques and soluble Aβ oligomers in AD-driven cognitive decline, it also supports a neuroprotective species of soluble Aβ, Aβ1–38.

The present study has demonstrated that neuroinflammatory signals precede tauopathy and that both are strongly correlated with impairments in spatial learning and memory. Moreover, this study substantiates the lack of correlation between insoluble Aβ plaques and cognitive impairment while corroborating that Aβ deposition is one of the earliest pathological events in AD. Likewise, the weak correlation between soluble Aβ levels and cognitive decline reinforces that Aβ is not the main contributor to cognitive impairment. However, since soluble Aβ levels were correlated with cognitive impairment at a more significant level than insoluble Aβ, this study highlights the role of soluble Aβ species in Aβ-driven neurotoxicity and cognitive decline in AD. Proteins identified from MS and validated by ELISAs likely allow the unimpaired animals to escape AD pathology and age-dependent cognitive impairment by maintaining intrinsic neuronal excitability, tau phosphorylation and inflammatory signals at a young-like state. These pathways appear to be defective or absent in the impaired subjects, leading to exacerbated AD neuropathology and cognitive deficits.
