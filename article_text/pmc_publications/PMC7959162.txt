Metacognition, self-awareness, self-knowledge, and insight each refer to the process by which individuals reflect upon and appraise their own abilities. Self-awareness is a complex, dynamic, and multifactorial construct that spans various domains such as motor, sensory, functional and cognitive abilities. Various disciplines including cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, psychiatry and neurology have attempted to understand healthy and pathologic self-awareness of cognition in particular. Although intrinsically connected, the study of healthy and pathologic states of self-awareness have remained relatively discrete from one another. Indeed, different disciplines examining self-awareness of cognition have operationalized and measured awareness through distinct theoretical frameworks. More recently, however, various authors have attempted to bridge constructs across disciplines in an effort to develop a unitary theoretical model for self-awareness of cognitive abilities. In this commentary, we summarize the study of self-awareness of cognitive abilities across various disciplines, highlighting translational aspects between them.

Metacognition or self-awareness of cognitive abilities, is a complex and elusive construct that can be operationalized in many different ways depending on the field of study. Throughout the past century, various disciplines including cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, neurology and psychiatry have attempted to understand the mechanisms by which individuals are able to reflect upon their cognition. Within cognitive psychology, research into metacognition has largely involved cognitively healthy adults. Conversely, researchers within clinical disciplines such as psychiatry, neurology and neuropsychology have focused primarily on the deterioration of self-awareness in clinical populations (Sunderaraman &amp; Cosentino, 2017). Though inherently interconnected, these bodies of research have remained relatively discrete. In this short commentary, we discuss the study of metacognition or self-awareness of cognitive functioning from both cognitive and clinical perspectives, highlighting the translational aspects between these disciplines and the implications of such translational work.

The study of healthy metacognition in Cognitive Psychology

In the context of cognitive psychology, the study of self-awareness generally falls under the rubric of metacognition (i.e., cognition about cognition) (Fleming &amp; Frith, 2014). The term metacognition was first conceived by Flavell (1979), who distinguished between metacognitive knowledge (i.e., knowledge about one’s own cognitive processes) and metacognitive experience (i.e., a person’s ability to actively monitor his or her cognitive performance). Shortly thereafter, Nelson and Narens (1990) identified two cardinal aspects of metacognition: monitoring and control. Monitoring is the process by which individuals assess the accuracy of their own knowledge or cognitive abilities; while control refers to the decisions or actions individuals make based on the information obtained through the monitoring process. These processes are necessary for effective everyday functioning in healthy adults (Devolder &amp; Pressley, 1992; Shaked et al., in press). For example, a young adult crams for an exam and realizes he is performing extremely poorly (i.e., monitoring). He therefore exercises control by studying for a week before his next exam. In the context of aging, individuals must also monitor and control a series of cognitive and functional changes to adapt to the aging brain and body, and to enhance everyday functioning. Indeed, recent research has shown that healthy older adults modify a number of different everyday behaviors (e.g., how best to manage medications and travel to new destinations) based on concerns about changes in their cognitive functioning (Shaked et al., in press).

Within the broad theoretical framework of monitoring and control, some of the most influential experimental paradigms for the measurement of metacognition have been developed. Regarding monitoring abilities, such paradigms include: 1) Judgments-of-learning, which occur during or after acquisition of to-be learned information, and are predictions about future test performance on currently recallable items; and 2) Feeling-of-knowing or tip-of-the-tongue judgments, which also occur during or after acquisition (e.g., during a retention session), but are judgments about whether a currently non-recallable item is known and/or will be identified on a subsequent recognition test (Nelson and Narens, 1990). In contrast to monitoring, control has traditionally been measured with paradigms that assess behavioral modification linked to the information being monitored, such as allocating a greater amount of study time to certain items.

The study of disordered self-awareness in clinical populations

In the context of clinical disciplines such as neuropsychology, neurology and psychiatry, the study of self-awareness has focused on the clinical symptom of impaired awareness, termed anosognosia (Prigatano, 2010). Anosognosia, literally meaning lacking knowledge (“gnosis”) of disease (“nosos”), has been defined as unawareness of deficits in sensory, motor, affective/behavioral and/or cognitive functioning (e.g., memory loss), in the context of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), brain damage, or psychiatric disorders (Mograbi &amp; Morris, 2018).

Within the context of disordered awareness in clinical populations, various models have attempted to explain how awareness of cognitive deficits is both enabled and disabled (Agnew &amp; Morris, 1998; Clare, Marková, Roth, &amp; Morris, 2011). For example, Agnew and Morris (1998) proposed the Conscious Awareness Model (CAM)—a multileveled, neurocognitive model of anosognosia. This model operationalizes awareness as a hierarchical structure where lower levels (i.e., monitoring of ongoing performance) underlie higher levels of awareness (i.e., overall judgments of one’s general abilities). Within this hierarchical structure, three particular forms of cognitive impairment are hypothesized to give rise to different types of anosognosia, specifically: executive dysfunction, memory loss, or a specific deficit in accessing information about one’s own deficit (Agnew &amp; Morris, 1998; Morris &amp; Mograbi, 2013). Another influential model has been proposed by Clare et al. (2011) in which awareness, also described as a hierarchical construct, operates within a biopsychosocial framework in which psychological, social and biological factors influence the accuracy of self-awareness. These models both contribute importantly to the theoretical conceptualization of disordered self-awareness in clinical populations. Indeed, within the study of self-awareness it is increasingly accepted that many different factors can underlie anosognosia such as cognition (Morris &amp; Mograbi, 2013), mood and personality traits (e.g., Colvin, Malgaroli, Chapman, MacKay-Brandt, &amp; Cosentino, 2018; Mograbi &amp; Morris, 2013; Prigatano, 2010), regional brain integrity (e.g., Cosentino et al., 2015; Pacella et al., 2019) and social factors (Clare, Marková, Roth, &amp; Morris, 2011).

As in healthy populations, awareness of cognitive functions has critical consequences in clinical populations for both patients and their caregivers. Approximately half of patients with mild AD demonstrate impaired awareness of their memory loss (Cosentino, Metcalfe, Butterfield, &amp; Stern, 2007). Individuals in this stage of disease have impairments in multiple cognitive domains that undermine their ability to engage independently in everyday functioning. Impaired self-awareness therefore threatens patients’ capacity to safely navigate functional deficits; indeed, patients who are unaware of memory loss demonstrate reduced capacity to manage their medications, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents (e.g., Conde-Sala et al., 2014; Cosentino, Metcalfe, Cary, De Leon, &amp; Karlawish, 2011; Cotrell &amp; Wild, 1999). Similarly, among patients with schizophrenia, impaired illness awareness contributes significantly to illness morbidity, leading to poor treatment adherence and outcomes (Amador et al., 1994; P. F. Buckley et al., 2007). Given the clinical implications of disordered awareness, it is crucial that self-awareness and its underlying mechanisms are elucidated in order to improve treatment outcomes for patients by providing specific rehabilitation plans. Studies are now needed to bring current models of awareness together, and integrate them with clinically relevant outcomes to optimize performance on cognitively demanding tasks (i.e., driving, bill paying, cooking, shopping, managing medications, etc.) among individuals with cognitive impairment secondary to pathologic cognitive aging, psychiatric disorders or brain injury.

Translational aspects between cognitive and clinical disciplines

Paradoxically, while disordered awareness in the context of various clinical syndromes from anosognosia to blindsight has been a key rationale for the study of metacognition across a number of cognitive psychology experiments (Chua, Pergolizzi, &amp; Weintraub, 2014; Fleming, Huijgen, &amp; Dolan, 2012; Lau &amp; Passingham, 2006) these constructs have largely been investigated from different perspectives, and using distinct theoretical frameworks: metamemory through the study of learning and memory in healthy populations, and anosognosia through examination of impaired self-awareness in clinical cohorts (Souchay, 2007). In recent years, however, researchers have endeavored to construct a theoretical bridge, exploring the symbiotic relationship between these two phenomena (see Cosentino, 2014; Ernst, Moulin, Souchay, Mograbi, &amp; Morris, 2015). In particular, experimental self-evaluative paradigms assessing monitoring and control processes (e.g., feeling-of-knowing, judgments-of-learning, study time allocation) have been applied to advance the understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to anosognosia in diseases states. Translational efforts in the study of self-awareness can advance and consolidate theories of awareness and thus help develop gold standard assessments and guidelines for managing disordered awareness.

Examining monitoring abilities, Ansell and Bucks (2006) evaluated the extent to which the pattern of metamemory performance in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) reflected the memory-based anosognosia described by the aforementioned CAM model. Their study investigated judgments-of-learning across a list-learning task (monitoring), and global evaluative judgments of memory administered pre- and post-list learning. Results showed that the AD group reduced their confidence ratings, both for task-specific and global judgments of learning, immediately after exposure to the task and these ratings increased again after a delay. Such a pattern supports the idea that memory loss may contribute to reduced self-awareness; however, confidence ratings did not fully return to pre-task levels, suggesting that the basis of impaired awareness in AD is likely multi-factorial and not simply a reflection of memory loss. Indeed, it is clear that individuals with early AD who have comparable memory impairment can have drastically different levels of awareness. Cosentino et al. (2007) highlighted the need to consider such heterogeneity in self-awareness when studying metamemory in Alzheimer’s disease. Toward this aim, Cosentino et al. (2007) examined patients’ performance on a modified feeling-of-knowing task in relation to clinically-rated awareness of memory loss (i.e., anosognosia) and found that those with anosognosia made less accurate predictions for their own performance on the feeling-of-knowing task. A more recent study using metacognitive paradigms to characterize the nature of anosognosia in AD, found that deficits in ongoing monitoring of one’s own performance are specific to memory abilities and do not extend to the motor domain (Chapman et al., 2018). Dissociations between specific monitoring abilities have also been observed in patients with traumatic brain injury, highlighting how neural injury can selectively impact certain monitoring abilities while sparing others (Chiou, Carlson, Arnett, Cosentino, &amp; Hillary, 2011).

Translational work on metacognitive abilities has also examined control processes. For example, among patients with schizophrenia, monitoring abilities have shown to be inconsistently impaired, however various studies have shown impairments in control strategies. Specifically, Bacon, Izaute, and Danion (2006) showed that patients with schizophrenia lacked specific strategies that allowed for more efficient learning when allocating study time compared to controls. Moreover, Koren et al. (2005) showed that difficulties both in monitoring and control strategies on an executive function task were associated with patients’ ability to consent to treatment, highlighting: 1) the link between experimentally measured and manipulated metacognition, and everyday abilities relying on accurate self-evaluation, and 2) the importance of measuring metacognitive functioning when providing treatment plans and decision in this population.

Directions for future research

More recently, the translational utility of metacognitive experimental tasks has become evident in the context of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) —a “pre-clinical” state receiving growing attention as a potential harbinger to the objective cognitive symptoms that occur in mild cognitive impairment and later in dementia (R. F. Buckley, Laming, Chen, Crole, &amp; Hester, 2016; Cosentino et al., 2018). SCD is characterized by the subjective perception that one’s cognition has declined prior to objective evidence of such decline on diagnostic testing (Jessen et al., 2014). Early research suggests that SCD may hold promise as a preclinical indicator of AD and may reflect a global, higher order awareness of underlying cognitive decline; however, SCD is not always indicative of such a process and can instead reflect a variety of other factors including mood disturbance, personality traits, or inaccurate metamemory (Reid &amp; Maclullich, 2006). Determining the integrity of metamemory among individuals with SCD may thus shed important light on its utility as a marker of preclinical AD. Indeed, recent work is attempting to use metamemory frameworks to investigate whether deficits in lower levels of awareness mediate how SCD maps onto objective cognition (R. F. Buckley et al., 2016; Cosentino et al., 2018). Results from preliminary studies are mixed, and much work is needed to determine how assessing metacognition and integrating it into the conceptualization of SCD can enhance the utility of this potential biomarker.

Conclusion

The translational use of metacognitive paradigms has been key in the experimental examination of the cognitive mechanisms which underlie disorders of self-awareness. Ultimately, the use of rigorous experimental metacognitive measures has allowed for careful characterization of self-awareness of cognitive abilities across various clinical samples such as acquired brain injuries, degenerative disorders and psychiatric disease. Such observations have important implications for everyday management of awareness deficits in these samples and can help build a common model of awareness and specific treatment targets for patients and for their caregivers.

Statement of public significance:

This commentary highlights the need for collaborative, interdisciplinary research on self-awareness of cognitive abilities (i.e., metacognition) in order to build an integrated model of self-awareness that guides the optimization of everyday functioning in healthy adults, and guides therapeutic strategies for patients with disordered awareness and their caregivers.
