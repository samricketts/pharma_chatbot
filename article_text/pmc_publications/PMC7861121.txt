Objective:

To examine associations between tau and amyloid-beta (Aβ) molecular PET and both Alzheimer-related pathology and 4-repeat tau pathology in autopsy-confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).

Methods:

Twenty-four patients had [18F]-Flortaucipir PET and died with FTLD (progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) n=10, corticobasal degeneration (CBD) n=10, FTLD-TDP n=3 and Pick’s disease n=1). All but one had Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) PET. Braak staging, Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts and semi-quantitative tau lesion scores were performed. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a temporal meta-region-of-interest (ROI), entorhinal cortex and cortical/subcortical regions selected to match the tau lesion analysis. Global PiB SUVR was calculated. Autoradiography was performed in one PSP patient, with digital pathology used to quantify tau burden.

Results:

Nine cases (37.5%) had Aβ plaques. Global PiB SUVR correlated with Aβ plaque count, with 100% specificity 50% sensitivity for diffuse plaques. Twenty-one (87.5%) had Braak I-IV. Flortaucipir correlated with neurofibrillary tangle counts in entorhinal cortex, but entorhinal and meta-ROI SUVR were not elevated in Braak IV or primary age-related tauopathy. Flortaucipir uptake patterns differed across FTLD pathologies and could separate PSP and CBD. Flortaucipir correlated with tau lesion score in red nucleus and midbrain tegmentum across patients, but not in cortical or basal ganglia regions. Autoradiography demonstrated minimal uptake of flortaucipir, although flortaucipir correlated with quantitative tau burden across regions.

Interpretation:

Molecular PET shows expected correlations with Alzheimer-related pathology but lacks sensitivity to detect mild Alzheimer pathology in FTLD. Regional flortaucipir uptake was able to separate CBD and PSP.


INTRODUCTION

Molecular PET ligands can detect the two main proteins found in Alzheimer’s disease, amyloid-beta (Aβ) and 3R+4R paired helical filament (PHF) tau. One of the most common Aβ tracers is 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB),1 with studies showing that it matches well with Aβ distribution at autopsy.2-6 One of the most commonly used tau tracers is 18F-flortaucipir (formerly 18F-AV-1451/18F-T807).7 Flortaucipir exhibits strong binding to PHF-tau in autoradiographic studies.8-10 Furthermore, a PET-autopsy study showed that flortaucipir uptake correlated strongly with tau burden and uptake in a temporal lobe meta region-of-interest (meta-ROI) was elevated at Braak stage IV and steadily increased in stages IV to VI.11 Flortaucipir uptake in the meta-ROI was also elevated in all cases with a pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, but not in primary age-related tauopathy (PART12).11 This suggests that flortaucipir PET is an excellent biomarker for identification of PHF-tau in patients with Braak stage IV or greater.

The value of PiB-PET and flortaucipir-PET in other neurodegenerative disorders in which primary protein deposits are not Aβ or PHF-tau is less clear. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) represents a group of neurodegenerative disorders with distinct pathologic protein deposits, including TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) (FTLD-TDP), 3R tau (e.g., Pick’s disease) and 4R tau (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD)). At postmortem, comorbid Aβ and PHF-tau pathologies can be observed in FTLD, especially in older patients.13-18 It is unclear the degree to which molecular PET can detect these co-pathologies. PiB-PET studies of patients presumed to have FTLD show a relatively large proportion has Aβ uptake on PET,19-21 although the interpretation of positive PiB-PET findings in these patients, and whether they have high likelihood Alzheimer’s disease, is unclear. Furthermore, flortaucipir studies have shown elevated uptake in patients that are presumed to have FTLD, including semantic dementia (presumed TDP-43),22, 23 as well as PSP,24, 25 corticobasal syndrome,21, 26 and progressive apraxia of speech (presumed 4R tau).27 We have shown flortaucipir uptake in frontotemporal lobes of a patient with autopsy-confirmed Pick’s disease.28 These findings have been consistently observed despite the fact that autoradiographic studies have found little or no binding of flortaucipir to TDP-43, 3R or 4R tau,8-10 raising the question of whether the ligand is binding to some off-target material. Single case-studies have shown that flortaucipir uptake correlates with tau burden across brain regions in CBD,29, 30 although no large PET-autopsy study has evaluated the degree to which flortaucipir relates to underlying tau burden in FTLD.

We aimed to describe flortaucipir uptake in autopsy-confirmed FTLD and evaluate the degree to which flortaucipir and PiB correlate to underlying pathology in FTLD. We aimed first to assess the degree to which PET findings relate to concomitant Alzheimer-type pathology (i.e. Aβ and PHF-tau), and second to assess the degree to which flortaucipir uptake relates to tau pathology in 4R tauopathies. We also aimed to assess whether autopsy and PET measures were related to clinical outcomes in FTLD. FTLD represents a unique opportunity to assess relationships between molecular PET and Alzheimer neuropathological changes in patients without Alzheimer’s dementia.

METHODS

Participant cohort

We identified all participants who had been recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research Group (NRG), undergone 18F-flortaucipir PET, and had autopsy with pathologic confirmation of FTLD (n=24). The NRG recruits patients with neurodegenerative diseases and follows them to autopsy. The 24 patients had been evaluated between July 1st 2015 and October 10th 2019. Of these 24, autopsy diagnoses were PSP in 10, CBD in 10, FTLD-TDP type A in three and Pick’s disease in one (This case has been previously published).28 All three FTLD-TDP patients were tested for mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN), and one was found to have a GRN mutation. All participants underwent longitudinal neurologic, neuropsychologic and speech/language evaluations. All had standardized neuroimaging that included a volumetric MRI and a flortaucipir PET. All but one case had also PiB-PET. The PiB-PET and flortaucipir PET images obtained closest to death were analyzed in this study.

The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB) and all patients consented to participate in the study.

Neuropathologic evaluations

All cases had neuropathological evaluations by an experienced neuropathologist (DWD or JEP), in accordance with current diagnostic methods.31, 32. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a battery of antibodies including antibodies to TDP-43 (rabbit polyclonal; 1:3,000, ProteinTech Group, Chicago, IL, USA); Aβ (6F/3D, 1:250, human Aβ8-17 and C-terminal Cys, Dako, Carpinteria, CA), phospho-tau (CP13; 1:1000; IgG1 to phospho-serine 202, gift from Peter Davies, Feinstein Institute, Long Island, NY) and 3R-tau (RD3, 1:5000, Millipore, Temecula, CA). Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) were evaluated with thioflavin S fluorescent microscopy, as well as Bielschowsky silver stains in most cases. Pathological diagnoses were rendered according to published pathological criteria. Pick’s disease was diagnosed based on the presence of argyrophilic and tau immunoreactive round Pick bodies33 that were argyrophilic, but negative on Gallyas silver stain. PSP was diagnosed based upon presence of characteristic neuronal and glial lesions (tufted astrocytes and oligodendroglial coiled bodies) in vulnerable cortical and subcortical regions.34 CBD was diagnosed by the presence of cortical and subcortical neuronal and glial lesions (astrocytic plaques) and thread-like processes in gray and white matter.35 FTLD-TDP type A had TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and dystrophic neurites, as well as neuronal intranuclear inclusions, in vulnerable cortical and subcortical areas.36 Each case was also assigned a Braak NFT stage37, and the presence of Aβ senile plaques was assessed using Thal phases38. A case was classified as having concomitant Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC) if senile plaques detected with silver stains, thioflavin S and Aβ immunohistochemistry were present. If NFTs were detected in the absence of Aβ plaques, the pathology was classified as definite primary age-related tauopathy (PART).12 Other concomitant pathologies, such as age-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), argyrophilic grains disease (AGD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) were recorded.

Quantitative neuropathologic methods

For 21 cases, counts of senile plaques and NFTs were performed with thioflavin S fluorescent microscopy. For cortical regions, senile plaque counts were truncated at 50 (twice the number required to meet Khachaturian criteria for AD39). Senile plaque counts in middle frontal cortex, superior temporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, motor cortex and visual cortex were averaged to generate an overall cortical Aβ burden. NFT counts in the entorhinal cortex layer II and lower cortical layers were averaged.

For PSP and CBD cases burden of tau was assessed using immunohistochemistry with CP13. Tau pathology was assessed in cerebellar dentate, midbrain tegmentum, substantia nigra, red nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, ventral thalamus, globus pallidus, neostriatum, superior frontal cortex, and motor cortex for 17 cases with PSP or CBD. For each region, NFTs (including pre-tangles), coiled bodies, tufted astrocytes (PSP) or astrocytic plaques (CBD), and threads were scored using a semi-quantitative 4-point scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). For each region, lesion score was summed across the four lesion types to provide a total lesion score.

Digital pathology analysis

In Patient 4 (PSP), quantitative tau burden was assessed with digital pathologic methods on sections immunostained with CP13 and also with PHF1 (1:1000 mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-serine 396/404 tau from Peter Davies). Immunostained slides were scanned with Aperio ScanScope AT2, and digital images were assessed with ImageScope using a custom-designed color deconvolution algorithm, as previously reported.29 For digital pathology, 14 cortical and subcortical regions (middle frontal, superior temporal, inferior parietal, motor, visual, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, globus pallidus, putamen, amygdala, caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate gyrus, midbrain and cerebellar dentate) were assessed.

Autoradiopgraphy

Flortaucipir autoradiography was performed on adjacent 5 μm sections for the motor cortex, thalamus, midbrain and cerebellar dentate for Patient 4. Autoradiography and blocking experiments were performed as previously described,8 and visual comparison of autoradiographic flortaucipir uptake with immunohistochemistry was performed to assess flortaucipir binding.

PET analysis

All participants underwent a standardized MRI protocol at 3T that included a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence. PET scans were acquired using a PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin), as previously described.19 Voxel-level comparisons of 18F-flortaucipir uptake across FTLDs were performed using SPM12. All MPRAGE scans were normalized to the Mayo Clinic Adult Lifespan Template (MCALT) and segmented via unified segmentation40 with MCALT priors/settings. Flortaucipir images were co-registered to the MPRAGE using 6 degrees-of-freedom registration in SPM12. All voxels in the MPRAGE-space flortaucipir images were divided by median uptake in the cerebellar crus gray matter to create standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images. SUVR images were normalized to MCALT and smoothed at 6 mm full-width-at-half-maximum. Voxel-wise t-tests in SPM12 were used to compare the FTLDs to a group of 30 controls and against each other, including age and sex as covariates. The 30 unimpaired controls were recruited by NRG and had undergone identical neuroimaging assessments (median age=60 (IQR 57-62), 63% female). Results were assessed at p&lt;0.001.

Region-level data were calculated for both the MPRAGE-space PiB-PET and flortaucipir-PET to allow correlations with neuropathology. For PiB-PET, a global PiB SUVR was calculated as previously described41. A cut-point of 1.48 was used to define PiB-PET positivity.41 For tau-PET, we analyzed two different sets of ROIs using regions from the left hemisphere to match the hemisphere sampled at autopsy. First, in order to assess relationships between flortaucipir and NFT pathology, we analyzed uptake in entorhinal cortex and also in the temporal lobe meta-ROI (includes amygdala, entorhinal, fusiform, parahippocampal, inferior temporal, and middle temporal gyri),11, 42 and utilized cut-points of 1.27 and 1.29 respectively.11 Second, in order to assess the relationship between flortaucipir and tau lesion counts in the 4R tauopathies, we selected ROIs that matched the regions assessed at autopsy. The MCALT atlas was used to assess uptake in all cortical ROIs, thalamus, globus pallidus, putamen and caudate (as well as amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus for patient 4 to match autoradiography). The Deep Brain Stimulation Intrinsic Template43 atlas was used to output uptake in the substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus and red nucleus. Lastly, we used in-house developed midbrain and cerebellar dentate atlases, as previously described25. Uptake values were divided by uptake in the cerebellar crus gray matter to create SUVRs. Analyses were performed without partial volume correction (PVC), and then repeated with two-compartment PVC. However, all PiB and flortaucipir cut-points were generated using data without PVC and are hence not applicable to the data with PVC.

Statistical analysis

Continuous variables were compared across FTLD groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests and categorical variables were compared using Chi-Squared tests. Correlations were performed between pathological and PET variables using Spearman Rank Correlations using PET data without and with PVC. Correlations between PET and Aβ and NFT counts were performed across the entire cohort. Correlations between PET and CP13 tau lesion scores were performed only within the PSP/CBD cases; since correlations were performed across 10 regions, with and without PVC, a false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons was applied. Partial correlations were performed to assess the relationship with both pathological and PET variables and four clinical indices (the Montreal Cognitive Assessment battery to assess general cognition, the Movement Disorders Sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III to assess parkinsonism, the frontal assessment battery to assess frontal lobe function, and the Boston Naming Test to assess naming). Partial correlations were corrected for either time from clinical exam to autopsy, or time from clinical exam to PET, with FDR correction for multiple comparisons.

Flortaucipir SUVR was compared between PSP and CBD for each ROI, accounting for age at PET, using logistic regression. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to summarize differences between PSP and CBD from the logistic regression. A partial least squares model, including age at PET scan and using K-fold cross validation, was used to compare flortaucipir SUVR for all 10 regions between PSP and CBD. A partial least squares model was chosen when modelling all 10 regions due to collinearity between flortaucipir measures.

Statistical analysis was performed in R statistical software or JMP software (version 15; SAS Institute).

RESULTS

Demographic and pathological findings

Pathological findings are summarized in Table 1. Of the 24 FTLD cases, nine (37.5%) had senile plaques and were classified as having ADNC. In all but one case, plaques were diffuse and non-neuritic. Plaque severity was sparse in two cases, sparse-to-moderate in three cases, moderate-to-frequent in two cases, and frequent in two cases. Thal phases were 3 or lower in all cases except one which had a Thal phase of 5. Twenty-one cases (87.5%) had Alzheimer type NFTs, with Braak stages of I in four cases, II in four, III in eight and IV in five. No case had a Braak stage of V or VI. Thirteen (54%) cases had definite PART. Secondary pathologies of ARTAG were detected in 12 (50%), AGD in 5 (22%) and CAA in 6 (25%).

The PSP, CBD and FTLD-TDP groups differed in age at onset, age at PET, and age at death, with youngest age observed in FTLD-TDP, followed by CBD and then PSP (Table 2). Braak stage did not differ across groups, although there was a difference in frequency of Aβ plaques, with highest frequency observed in PSP.

Flortaucipir across FTLDs

The PSP cases showed elevated uptake in midbrain and left dentate nucleus of the cerebellum compared to controls, CBD and FTLD-TDP (Figure 1). The CBD cases showed elevated uptake bilaterally in the premotor and motor cortices and globus pallidus compared to controls, only. The FTLD-TDP cases showed elevated uptake in the right fusiform, middle temporal gyrus and angular gyrus, as well as bilateral orbitofrontal cortices compared to controls, and, with the exception of the fusiform gyrus, compared to PSP and CBD. The single Pick’s disease case showed uptake throughout prefrontal and anterior temporal white matter, bilaterally, as well as in right posterior temporal regions, compared to controls, PSP and CBD, with similar although less extensive patterns of uptake compared to FTLD-TDP.

Molecular PET associations with Aβ and PHF-tau

Of the 23 cases with PiB-PET, four (17%) showed evidence of Aβ deposition with global PiB SUVR&gt;1.48. Three of these cases were PSP and one was CBD (patients 1, 8, 9 and 15) (Table 1). All four of these cases had moderate-frequent senile plaques on autopsy, with Thal phases ranging from 1 to 5 (Figure 2). However, four cases with senile plaques at autopsy were negative for Aβ on PET (patients 5, 6, 18 and 23). These four patients had sparse or sparse-moderate diffuse senile plaques, with Thal phases ranging from 2 to 3 (Figure 2). The 15 patients who did not show evidence for senile plaques at autopsy were all negative for Aβ on PET. Hence, PiB PET had a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 50% for detecting diffuse senile plaques. Global PiB SUVR was moderately correlated with cortical Aβ plaque count, both without and with PVC (Figure 2).

The tau meta-ROI was negative in all patients, except patient 11 (Pick’s disease) and patient 21 (CBD). All of the Braak IV cases had a negative tau meta-ROI and there was no evidence for meta-ROI SUVR to increase with Braak stage. Entorhinal tau SUVR increased slightly in Braak III and IV compared to Braak I and II, although only one of the four Braak IV cases (patient 8) showed an SUVR greater than the cut-point of 1.27 (Figure 2). No association was identified between entorhinal SUVR and NFT count at autopsy (Figure 2). However, the Pick’s disease case had striking uptake in temporal lobe despite having Braak stage 0, suggesting that flortaucipir was binding to something other than PHF-tau NFTs in this case. When the Pick’s disease case was removed, a moderate correlation was identified between entorhinal SUVR and tangle count (rs=0.45, p=0.04 no PVC; rs=0.44, p=0.05 with PVC). We also did not see any evidence that the tau meta-ROI or entorhinal SUVR differed across cases classified as having PART or ADNC (Figure 2). The results were unchanged after PVC (Figure 2).

Flortaucipir associations with tau pathology in 4R tauopathies

Flortaucipir uptake in the cerebellar dentate and red nucleus differed between the PSP and CBD cases, with higher uptake observed in PSP (Table 3, Figure 3). The partial least squares analysis showed a higher coefficient for the red nucleus compared to the cerebellar dentate in differentiating PSP and CBD. There was also a trend for uptake in globus pallidus to be greater in CBD compared to PSP. The ratio of globus pallidus to red nucleus (GP/RN) SUVR provided excellent separation of PSP and CBD, with the highest AUROC of 1 representing complete separation (p&lt;0.0001) (Figure 3). These results remained the same using PVC PET data (Figure 3).

Flortaucipir SUVR correlated with total tau lesion score in the red nucleus, with a trend for an association in the midbrain; the red nucleus correlation survived FDR correction (Figure 3). No associations were observed between tau lesion count and flortaucipir SUVR in the other eight regions (Figure 3). These results remained the same using PVC PET data.

Autoradiography showed minimal uptake of flortaucipir in all four regions in PSP patient 4 (Figure 4). Furthermore, in this patient a moderate correlation was observed between flortaucipir uptake and regional tau burden across regions when using both PHF1 and CP13 immunohistochemistry, both without and with PVC (Figure 4).

Clinical associations with PET and autopsy measures

Very few correlations were observed between clinical indices and either autopsy or PET measures of tau and Aβ (Figure 5). The only correlation that survived FDR correction was between greater superior frontal tau lesion score at autopsy and poorer performance on the Boston Naming Test. The PET correlations remained the same after PVC.

DISCUSSION

In this study we assessed the relationship between molecular PET and different brain pathologies at autopsy in FTLD. Molecular PET showed expected correlations with Alzheimer-related pathology although lacked sensitivity to detect mild Alzheimer-related pathology in FTLD. Regional patterns of flortaucipir uptake showed utility for differentiating autopsy confirmed PSP and CBD, with some evidence for flortaucipir uptake to be associated with tau lesion score in 4R tauopathies, although relationships were not consistent across regions.

All cases in our cohort had a pathological diagnosis of FTLD, although 91.5% had comorbid Aβ senileplaques and/or NFTs; over a third had ADNC and over half had PART.12 In all cases except one the plaques were diffuse non-neuritic Aβ deposits and all had a Braak stage of IV or lower. No cases in this study met criteria for high ADNC.32, 44 Other series have similarly shown that concomitant plaques and NFTs are relatively common in FTLD,13-18 with frequencies of NFTs ranging from 38-80%13, 14, 17 and plaques ranging from 22-63%.14-17 Co-existence of high likelihood of ADNC is rare.14, 16, 17 We found the highest frequency of plaques in PSP, although this was likely related to the older age of PSP cohort.

We found the expected correlation between Aβ uptake on PiB-PET and Aβ plaque count at autopsy. Global PiB SUVR was abnormal in the majority of patients that had a Thal phase 3 or more, as previously reported.2 One Thal phase 1 case showed abnormal global PiB which was likely explained by the high Aβ plaque count in this case. Generally, plaque count was key to determine global PiB SUVR. PiB-PET detected all cases with moderate-to-frequent plaques, but was unable to detect cases with sparse or sparse-to-moderate diffuse plaques. This concurs with previous studies showing PiB-PET failure to identify most cases with sparse diffuse plaques.4, 45 The proportion of non-concordant cases is high in our cohort since we had a high proportion of cases with sparse-to-moderate diffuse plaques. Nevertheless, our findings stress that in FTLD one can expect a high proportion of cases with Aβ pathology to be misclassified as Aβ-negative with PiB-PET. We also found a correlation, albeit weaker, between flortaucipir PET and NFT count in the entorhinal cortex. However, flortaucipir PET SUVR was not abnormal in either the meta-ROI or entorhinal cortex in the majority of cases suggesting limited ability to identify even Braak stage IV; likely due to low lesion burden. The finding that flortaucipir does not detect Braak stages I-III is concordant with a previous study.11. In that study, elevated flortaucipir in the meta-ROI and entorhinal ROI was observed in two Braak IV cases,11 although both cases were pathologically diagnosed as AD with neuritic plaques. It is likely that they had more severe NFT burden than our Braak IV cases.. One of our Braak IV cases did show elevated uptake in entorhinal cortex, although this case did not have the highest entorhinal NFT count and so it is unclear why elevated uptake was observed in this case but not others. We cannot rule out the possibility that 4R tau was present in this region and may have influenced the flortaucipir signal. Overall, our findings suggest that flortaucipir does not reliably detect NFTs in FTLD cases with Braak stage IV. Furthermore, similar to the previous study,11 flortaucipir did not detect NFTs in most PART cases.

Flortaucipir PET uptake was observed in PSP and CBD, both 4R tauopathies. We observed uptake in midbrain (particularly red nucleus) and cerebellar dentate in PSP and globus pallidus and premotor/motor cortices in CBD. In addition, an age-adjusted GP/RN ratio completely separated PSP from CBD cases and provided excellent discrimination between these disorders. It is possible that these patterns could be diagnostically useful antemortem biomarkers of pathology, although one must be cautious since it is unclear to what degree these patterns are related to syndrome plus pathology rather than pathology alone. Clinical PSP and CBS cohorts have shown similar flortaucipir characteristics to those observed in our autopsy-confirmed cases.21, 24-26 The majority of our PSP cases did indeed have the classic Richardson syndrome while the CBD cohort was more mixed, with six having corticobasal syndrome and four Richardson’s syndrome. Larger cohorts are needed to determine to what degree flortaucipir patterns are related to clinical syndrome versus underlying pathology, to validate the GP/RN ratio and determine whether other regional ratios may perform well.

Across our cohort of 4R tauopathies, we only observed correlations between flortaucipir uptake and tau lesion score in red nucleus and midbrain. We did not observe correlations in other subcortical or cortical regions. These regional discrepancies make interpretation challenging. It is possible that flortaucipir may be detecting 4R tau and relationships in the other regions could be more influenced by other factors, such as age-related off-target binding in basal ganglia,8, 46 the large size of the cortical ROIs which may have failed to adequately capture focal cortical pathology, or lower general 4R tau burden. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that flortaucipir uptake in red nucleus and midbrain is also related to non-tau targets, such as melanin-containing cells in the substantia nigra8, 24, 47 or cellular markers of neurodegeneration.22 The autoradiography showed minimal uptake of flortaucipir in PSP, similar to previous studies.8, 10 We did find a moderate correlation between flortaucipir uptake and tau burden at autopsy across brain regions in one of the PSP patients using both CP13 and PHF-1 phospho-tau antibodies. In AD, it has been found that flortaucipir binding corresponds better with PHF-1 that stains more advanced tau pathology compared to CP13 that stains early tau pathology8. While we did not observe a difference in correlation strength between antibodies, we only assessed one non-AD case. Previous case reports have similarly found good correlations between tau burden and flortaucipir uptake across brain regions in CBD.29, 30 We have also previously reported significant correlations between tau burden and flortaucipir in our case of Pick’s disease, a 3R tauopathy.28 It is clear, however, that further work is needed to fully understand the pathological correlates of flortaucipir in 4R and 3R tauopathies.

Interestingly, we demonstrate flortaucipir uptake in FTLD-TDP type A, with uptake observed predominantly in right temporoparietal regions. These findings concur with the temporoparietal lobes being the predominant site of neurodegeneration in FTLD-TDP type A, often with asymmetrical atrophy.48 Autoradiographic studies, however, have shown that flortaucipir does not bind to TDP-43,8-10 and hence, the biological explanation for these findings is unclear. Elevated flortaucipir uptake has been observed in patients strongly suspected to have FTLD-TDP22, 23, in patients with FTLD-TDP genetic mutations,49 and in one case with FTLD-TDP type B pathology.49 Possible explanations for uptake that have been suggested include spill over from binding in white matter due to the expression of monoamine oxidase B by reactive astrocytes, low levels of abnormal tau that coexists with TDP-43, some cellular marker of neurodegeneration, or low level binding to TDP-43.22 Our findings suggest that uptake in FTLD-TDP is not being driven by Alzheimer-type tau pathology.

We found greater lesion count in the superior frontal lobe to be associated with worse performance on the Boston Naming Test suggesting that frontal cortical pathology may have a role in cognitive performance in FTLD. We did not, however, find any associations between PET measures of tau and Aβ with clinical measures. The lack of association with Aβ is not surprising as Aβ has not been found to have much of an effect on cognition in 4R tauopathies.19 The lack of an association with flortaucipir PET uptake in the ten 4R tauopathy-related regions could reflect heterogeneity in the cohort, relatively small sample size, or, perhaps confounding effects from off-target binding. Previous studies have also failed to find associations between flortaucipir uptake and clinical metrics in PSP.10, 19, 24, 50

Our FTLD cohort provides unique insight into how molecular PET imaging relates to pathology in mild ADNC, as well as to tau pathology in 4R tauopathies. The cohort included four different FTLD pathologies, although it was heavily weighted towards 4R tauopathies, which may limit generalization to other FTLD cohorts. A strength is that the time between flortaucipir PET and autopsy was less than two years in 80% of patients, with only one patient having an interval longer than three years. There was a greater range in time between PiB-PET and death, although correlations were nevertheless identified between PiB uptake and plaque counts, and the few patients with plaques that were misclassified on PiB-PET had been scanned within two years of death. It has previously been reported that flortaucipir binds more strongly with helical tau in AD rather than straight filaments that predominate in 4R tauopathies.9 We were unfortunately not able to assess the relative strength of binding between helical and straight filaments in our sample given regional differences in the location of these filament types. Although our findings regarding ADNC and PART were observed in the setting of FTLD, the findings have implications for interpretation of molecular PET in other proteinopathies, as well as in cognitively normal individuals who may also have mild tau pathology.

Results are shown uncorrected for multiple comparisons at p&lt;0.001.

Figure 2: Relationships between PET and autopsy measures of Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles.

Top row depicts relationships between global PiB-PET SUVR and both cortical Aβ plaque count and Thal phase at autopsy. Scatter-plot for cortical Aβ plaque count includes 22 patients who had both PiB-PET and semi-quantitative Aβ plaque counts. One PiB positive patient did not have Aβ plaque counts available and so is not represented on the plot. Spearman rho and p value is shown. Middle row depicts relationship between flortaucipir measures (meta-ROI and entorhinal SUVR) and both Braak stage and presence of ADNC and PART pathology. Bottom row show scatter-plots of flortaucipir uptake and neurofibrillary tangle count for the entorhinal cortex. Horizontal lines on box-plots indicate positivity cut-points. Results are shown without PET partial volume correction (PVC) and with PVC.

Figure 3: Relationships between flortaucipir PET and tau pathology in 4R tauopathies.

The top panel shows fitted values from the logistic regression model that included age at flortaucipir PET for the red nucleus, globus pallidus to red nucleus (GP/RN) ratio and cerebellar dentate for CBD and PSP. The bottom panel shows forest plots depicting Spearman rho estimates for the relationship between flortaucipir SUVR and tau lesion count for each region. Black horizontal solid lines represent 95% confidence intervals of the correlation estimates. Uncorrected and FDR-corrected p values are shown.

Figure 4: Autoradiography and correlations between tau burden and flortaucipir in PSP.

First column shows CP13 immunohistochemistry for motor cortex (MTR), dentate nucleus of the cerebellum (DN), thalamus (Thal), and substantia nigra (SN), magnification x20. Second column shows autoradiography (ARG) with flortaucipir (FTP) for the same four regions. Third column shows blocked slides for the same four regions. Some specific binding is observed in the grey matter, e.g. MTR-ATR where the grey matter signal is blocked on BLK-ARG. Scatter-plots show relationship between quantitative tau burden, measured with PHF1 or CP13 immunohistochemistry, and flortaucipir SUVR. Spearman rho and p values are shown on the plots and points are color-coded by region. Pallidum and midbrain show the highest tau burden in both plots. Results are shown without PET partial volume correction (PVC) and with PVC.

Figure 5: Relationships between clinical metrics and regional pathological and PET measures.

Black dots represent Spearman’s partial correlation estimates (adjusting for time from clinical exam to death for pathology and time from clinical exam to tau PET for PET). Black horizontal solid lines represent 95% confidence intervals of the correlation estimates. Lines that do not cross the red dashed line represent significant results. However, after FDR correction only the relationship between superior frontal lesion count (pathology plot) and Boston Naming Test remained significant. Variables above (n=17 only 4R tauopathies) and below (n=24 entire cohort) gray horizontal dashed lines have different sample sizes. MoCA = Montreal Cognitive Assessment Battery; FAB = Frontal Assessment Battery; UPDRS III = Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III.
