There is evidence that exercise benefits the brain, but the mechanisms for this benefit are unclear. The chronic benefits of exercise are likely a product of discreet, acute responses in exercise-related blood biomarkers and brain metabolism. This acute exercise response has not been compared in aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). It is known that acute exercise elicits a powerful peripheral response in young individuals, and exercise-related biomarkers such as glucose and lactate readily penetrate the brain. How this changes with aging and neurodegenerative disease is less clear. It is critical to characterize and understand the acute effects of exercise, including different exercise intensities, in terms of the peripheral metabolic response and relationship with brain metabolism. This will help determine potential mechanisms for brain benefits of exercise and better inform the design of future clinical trials. The primary goal of the AEROBIC study is to characterize the acute exercise response of brain glucose metabolism and exercise-related blood biomarkers. We will measure how cerebral metabolism is affected by an acute bout of moderate and higher intensity exercise and characterize the extent to which this differs between cognitively healthy older adults and individuals with AD. Related to this primary goal, we will quantify the peripheral biomarker response to moderate and higher intensity exercise and how this relates to brain metabolic change in both groups.

pmc1. Introduction

Dementia is growing in prevalence and projected to affect over 130 million people by 2050 [1]. A critical goal of dementia research is to identify an effective intervention to prevent and/or treat the disease. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, and there is some evidence that physical exercise may improve functional ability in individuals with AD [2]. Additional work in cognitively healthy individuals suggests that the duration and frequency of participation in exercise may modulate gains in cognitive performance and lower dementia risk [3,4]. Importantly, prior work from our laboratory shows that, in AD, the degree of benefit to important outcomes such as memory and brain structure is dependent on change in cardiorespiratory fitness [2].

Although the mechanism that modulates the benefit of exercise is unknown, these benefits may be determined by individual differences in acute physiological responses to exercise. This includes transient responses in circulating fluid biomarkers that permeate the brain [5], which is not well characterized in AD. These factors include exercise-related neurotrophic and growth factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), vascular derived neurotrophic factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), and irisin. One understudied effector, lactate, has been shown to act as an essential neuronal fuel [6,7] and is positively associated with the previously mentioned neurotrophins [8,9]. Though traditionally thought of as a waste product, lactate is used efficiently by tissues [10-12], including the brain [13,14]. Notably, the improvement in cognition demonstrated by some trials of acute exercise [15], has been shown to positively associate with lactate uptake by the brain [16].

Lactate is transported throughout the entire body, and during physical exercise, lactate provides a key source of energy for muscle and brain [17-21]. In humans, there is a linear relationship between systemic lactate concentration and brain lactate uptake at physiological concentrations, and lactate can contribute to as much as 60% of cerebral metabolism when transporters are saturated [13]. The kinetics of lactate entry into brain indicate the blood brain barrier is about half as permeable to lactate as glucose, but that intracellular uptake of lactate is greater [22]. Because lactate is used efficiently by the brain even at rest [13,14], we hypothesized that metabolism of lactate in the brain may contribute to the drop in cerebral glucose metabolism observed with exercise [15]. Importantly, this exercise-induced decrease in glucose metabolism is only observed at exercise intensities sufficient to increase systemic lactate concentrations [23]. Existing work has compared the effect of different exercise intensities on cerebral glucose metabolism in young adults [24], and clinical trials of higher intensity exercise have begun in non-demented populations [25]. However, the effects of moderate and high intensity acute exercise on cerebral glucose metabolism has not been compared in healthy (CH) older adult and AD populations.

This paper outlines the clinical trial protocol of the Acute Exercise Response On Brain Imaging and Cognition (AEROBIC) study. This trial seeks to compare the effects of acute, moderate intensity and acute, higher intensity exercise on cerebral glucose metabolism in CH older adults and AD subjects. CH (n = 30) and AD (n = 30) subjects undergo a single bout of moderate intensity or higher intensity exercise to assess the effect of exercise intensity on the acute changes in brain glucose metabolism (rest to exercise). We hypothesize that both moderate and high intensity exercise will elicit a drop in global brain glucose metabolism compared to quiet rest, but that the effect will be greater with higher intensity vs. moderate intensity exercise, and greater in CH subjects than in AD subjects. The effect of exercise intensity on acute biomarker response and cognition (memory and executive function) will also be examined.

2. Methods

2.1. Trial design

AEROBIC is a randomized, counter balanced, prospectively enrolling trial that compares the effects of two levels of exercise intensity on cerebral responsiveness to exercise in CH (n = 30) and AD (n = 30) subjects. Participants will undergo a single bout of moderate intensity (45–55% heart rate reserve (HRR)) or higher intensity (65–75% HRR) exercise to assess the effect of exercise intensity on the acute change in brain glucose metabolism compared to rest. The flow of the study is illustrated in Fig. 1.

2.1.1. Trial registration and outcome measures

The Acute Exercise Response On Brain Imaging and Cognition (AEROBIC) study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04299308). The primary outcome is change in cerebral glucose metabolism (Fluorodeoxyglucose [18F] PET; FDG-PET) from the resting to exercise state. The secondary outcome measures are values for change in circulating blood lactate area under the curve (AUC) and BDNF change..

2.2. Recruitment &amp; participants

Participants are recruited through the University of Kansas Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, as a convenience sample of individuals interested in research. All participants are provided a written consent on the day of their first visit. Eligible participants are 60 years and older and have been diagnosed as either cognitively healthy (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0) or cognitively impaired (CDR 0.5 or 1) due to AD due to a single clinician diagnosis and CDR evaluation. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in Table 2. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Kansas (IRB STUDY00142140).

2.3. Procedures

Overall study flow is shown in Fig. 1 and list of procedures at each study visit is given in Table 1. First, participants are screened by phone and basic demographic information collected. Once deemed eligible, all subsequent screening procedures and 4 in-person study visits are completed over the course of about five weeks. Approximately 24 h prior to all in person visits, and upon arrival for the study visit, participants are screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following participant consent, medical history and medications are collected prior to a graded maximal exercise test (GXT). The test follows a modified Bruce protocol specifically designed for populations of older adults [26]. After the GXT visit, participants are administered a neuropsychometric exam (National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set telephone cognitive battery; T-Cog) by a trained psychometrician, as well as a telephone diagnostic assessment (Telephone CDR; T-CDR) by a clinician. A computer algorithm is used to randomize participants to moderate or higher intensity exercise 1:1 using an allocation table based on sex, age, and cognitive status (CH or AD, as determined by the T-CDR) to ensure approximately equal representation amongst exercise groups. At each of the two subsequent visits, participants are administered flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) prior to the positron emission tomography scan (PET), to measure brain glucose metabolism. Proper characterization of the cerebral response to acute exercise warrants strict control of timings (e.g. time elapsed between tracer injection and scan initiation). Blood samples are collected during the resting and exercise visits, and cognitive testing using the NIH toolbox is performed following each PET visits to determine exercise-related effects, as detailed below. During the final visit, each participant completes a MRI scan.

2.3.1. GXT visit

The GXT visit is scheduled in the morning following an overnight fast. Each participant is consented for the in-person visits at this time. Following consent, information regarding demographics, medical history, current medications, and anthropometric data is collected. Height and weight are recorded prior to setup of a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The participant remains seated for 5 min before being fitted with an oro-nasal face mask with 2-way non-rebreathing valves [Hans Rudoph, hansrudolphkc.com]. Following the 5 min of quiet rest, the participant remains seated for an additional 5 min while resting HR and BP are measured. An exercise physiologist familiarizes participants with the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale prior to the GXT. The GXT is performed by an exercise physiologist or clinician trained in the administration of a GXT who is CPR certified.

Our ADC has previously validated VO2 peak cardiorespiratory fitness testing using the GXT in both cognitively healthy individuals [3] and those with AD [26]. .Subjects who meet guidelines [27] for early termination of the treadmill test are excluded from subsequent participation… If abnormal ECG results are observed but do not result in early termination, participants are only allowed to proceed with subsequent visits after physician clearance. In previous studies, we have experienced treadmill test with “false positive” ECG signs frequently (~80% of positive results).

2.3.2. PET visits

The resting and exercise PET visits are counterbalanced and identical with the exception of the exercise procedure that occurs during the exercise PET visits. A timeline for the procedures administered during these visits is shown in Fig. 2. Both visits are scheduled in the morning, at fasting, as the first scan of the day to ensure consistency in terms of diurnal rhythm and metabolic outcomes. PET scanning includes two, four-minute PET 18 [F]-fluordeoxyglucose (FDG) frames that are attenuation corrected and reconstructed into a single into a single PET image.

2.3.2.1. Resting PET visit.

At the resting PET visit, HR and BP are measured after 5 min of seated rest. HR is captured with an optical heart rate sensor (OH1 Polar Electro, Inc. polar.com) and BP was taken with an automatic blood pressure monitor (Series 100 Blood Pressure Monitor, CVSHealth™). If needed, BP is also taken manually. If the participant’s blood pressure is (&gt;140 systolic or &gt; 90 diastolic), they are allowed to rest for 5 more minutes to ensure their blood pressure hasnormalized. An IV catheter is placed for blood collection throughout the study visit. A stopwatch timer is used as a running clock throughout each PET visit to keep all trials consistent, and to record any deviations from intended timings.

Following placement of the IV catheter, Blood Draw 1 is taken at baseline, and the timer is started. Subsequent blood draw timings are detailed in Fig. 2. FDG is injected 5 min following the first draw, as the participant rests seated in a chair. Following 30 min of rest, PET scan frames are acquired. Following the PET scan, the participant is brought back to the uptake room where they complete a NIH Toolbox-based neuropsychological testing on an iPad (Apple Inc.). This battery begins at minute 50 and lasts approximately 20 min. The NIH toolbox was developed as an effort to standardize neurological and behavioral outcomes with minimal subject burden and cost [28]. For the present study, cognitive assessment aimed to capture performance in three subdomains from the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery (www.nihtoolbox.org) [29], These domains include executive function/attention, episodic memory, and processing speed. Exercise trials have tended to show benefits in such domains, so we chose tests to assess these areas acutely.

Briefly, the Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test measures executive function, specifically tapping inhibitory control and attention. Scoring consists of both an accuracy component and reaction time component. If accuracy levels for the participant are less than or equal to 80%, the final “total” computed score is equal to the accuracy score. If accuracy levels for the participant reach more than 80%, the reaction time score and accuracy score are combined; a 2-vector scoring method is employed that uses accuracy and reaction time, where each of these “vectors” ranges in value between 0 and 5, and the computed score, combining each vector score, ranges in value from 0 to 10. Higher scores indicate higher levels of ability to attend to relevant stimuli and inhibit attention from irrelevant stimuli. The Picture Sequence Memory Test measures of episodic memory and is scored using item response theory methodology. A theta score is computed from the number of adjacent pairs placed correctly for each of trials 1 and 2, with higher scores indicating more ability in the episodic memory construct. These scores can be used for simple comparisons over time, with higher scores representing better episodic memory. The Pattern Comparison Test is a measure of speed of processing. The participant’s raw score is the number of items answered correctly in a 90-s period, with a range of 0–130. The raw score obtained is converted to the Age-Adjusted, Fully Adjusted and Unadjusted Scale Scores and an age-adjusted National Percentile based on the Toolbox normative sample. Higher scores indicate faster speed of processing.). Detailed description of administration and validity of these measures is available in Weintraub et al. 2013 [30]. Vitals and a final blood draw are taken following testing at minute 75, which completes the visit.

2.3.2.2. Exercise PET visit.

Procedures during the Exercise PET visit are identical to the Resting PET visit, with the exception of the exercise itself. Immediately upon arrival to the visit, participants are fitted to a Lode bicycle ergometer. They are then acclimated to the RPE scale (rating of perceived exertion) prior to the start of exercise. Again, all blood draws and the PET scan again occur at timings detailed in Fig. 2. Following Blood Draw 1, the baseline timepoint, exercise is initiated in a manner dependent on whether the participant had been randomized to moderate or high intensity exercise (as depicted in Fig. 3). Participants are instructed to keep the RPM between 60 and 70 throughout the entire exercise. As an additional indicator of effort, we collect RPE values after exercise begins and every 2 min throughout the exercise bout to ensure we are falling within target ranges. During the first three minutes of the warm-up, watts remain the same. During the last two minutes of the warm-up, HR is checked every 15 s and watts are adjusted accordingly to bring the participant into their target HR zone. Following warm-up, the standard 15-min exercise bout begins.We use GXT-determined heart rate ranges for the exercise groups, and HR is checked every minute during the exercise and watts is adjusted to keep HR within target range. At 20 min (warm-up plus exercise bout) power is reduced to 10 W and participant are instructed to pedal at a self-selected cadence for 5 min to cool down. We then obtain an overall RPE value post exercise. At 25 min during both the exercise and rest visit participants are escorted to the PET scan room and offered ~8 oz. water to drink.

2.3.3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visit

Participants complete an MRI safety screening upon arrival to Hoglund Biomedical Imaging Center. All scans are performed with a Siemens 3.0 Tesla Skyra MRI scanner (Siemens Skyra, Erlangen, Germany). We obtain high resolution T1 weighted images (MP-RAGE; 1 × 1 × 1 mm voxels; TR = 2300, TE = 2.98, TI = 900, FOV 240 × 256, 1 mm slice thickness, flip angle 9 degrees) following the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3 (ADNI3) standard. High-resolution T1 weighted anatomic images provide gross anatomy with high gray-white matter contrast. Images are processed via Freesurfer. MRI is used to determine individualized native-space ROI’s, that will be used to calculate PET Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR). Additional MRI sequences for secondary analyses include resting state fMRI (rsfMRI; Axial, Eyes Open, 3.4375 × 3.4375 × 3.4 mm voxels, TR = 3000, TE = 30, FOV 64 × 64, flip angle 90 degrees, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI; Axial, 2x2x2mm voxels, TR = 9600, TE = 82, FOV 1044 × 1044, flip angle 90 degress), Arterial Spin Labeling (pcASL; pseudocontinuous, 3.125 × 3.125 × 2.5 mm voxels, TR = 4300, TE = 22.42, FOV 672 × 672, flip angle 120 degrees), and T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST; 3.4375 × 3.4375x5mm voxels, TR = 3000, TE = 7.1, FOV 64 × 64, flip angle 90degrees).

2.4. Neuroimage processing

PET images will be analyzed using custom software written for Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12). For each participant, the PET images from both the resting and the exercise condition will be co-registered to theparticipant’s anatomical MRI image. A priori individualized, native space region of interest masks will be generated from the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12) for SPM. The PET images will be standardized to the uptake value (SUVR) of the cerebellum . Regional SUVR will be compared using paired t-tests or linear mixed models as appropriate.

2.5. Blood processing

At the Blood Draw 1 of the first PET visit, we collect whole blood for apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotyping. During each PET visit, the participant has blood drawn at 6 different time points shown in Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B. We have previously optimized sample collection and processing procedures to ensure accurate and consistent collection of both platelet rich plasma (PRP) and platelet poor plasma (PPP). Lavender top (EDTA) vacutainer tubes were used for plasma collection. PRP is generated during each draw by centrifuging whole blood (1500 x g for 10 min) and carefully removing plasma. PPP is generated during Blood Draw 1 and Blood Draw 6 by drawing off an aliquot of PRP for an additional centrifugation step (1700 xg for 15 min, 4C). Lactate is analyzed in real time using a Lactate Meter (Nova Biomedical). PRP and PPP aliquots are frozen immediately post processing and stored for future analyses of exercise-related factors at −80C.

2.6. Statistical analysis plan

We will conduct two, parallel analyses to assess acute changes in cerebral metabolism in response to a single bout of either moderate intensity or higher intensity exercise. Analysis 1 will involve AD subjects who will be randomly allocated 1:1 to a single acute bout of either moderate or higher intensity exercise. Analysis 2 will be similar, but in CH subjects. The primary outcome measure is change in global FDG standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from the rest to exercise condition. A secondary outcome measure is change in lactate AUC from the rest to exercise condition. The analysis will be done in parallel within AD and within CH study cohorts. We will also use the change scores to assess whether individuals systematically differ under the exercise condition (regardless of intensity) across all subjects and explore differences between diagnosis groups.

The primary statistical analyses will contrast change scores in brain metabolism following acute exercise (i.e., rested state vs. exercise-stimulated differences) between the intensity groups (moderate vs. higher intensity) using two-sample paired t-tests. We will conduct residual analyses to assess the appropriateness of this methodology to evaluate assumptions of common variance, normally distributed errors, etc. In the event any of the measures do not conform to these foundational assumptions, the nonparametric analogs will be used instead, such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test of the within-subject resting vs. exercise-stimulated change score (difference) measures. These measures will follow the intent-to-treat principals. Though a randomized design, we will also construct exploratory analyses that incorporate other adjustments using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on the change scores as the outcomes, also with residual analysis and modified approach if indicated. This will allow for model adjustment to further examine these relationships. Again, one further relationship will involve combining first the intensity groups and then the AD and CH subjects in a single model. We will use OLS in this context to test for interactions between AD and CH subjects with respect to the acute exercise response (moderate vs. higher intensity) for these rest/exercise change score outcomes. Finally, we will model change score outcomes as functions of the various other change score measures. This approach will enable us to observe how changes in cerebral glucose metabolism are driven by acute exercise-influenced changes in circulating biomarkers. We will conduct similar residual analyses appropriate to the regression models utilized to ensure appropriate inferences are drawn. While descriptive and exploratory in nature, we anticipate that this approach will illuminate and/or confirm our pre-conceived metabolic processes that are related to the acute exercise response, and that it will help identify likely reasons for prior exercise trial successes and failures through mechanistic discovery.

Sample size. We powered our study based upon our primary variable of interest, cerebral glucose metabolism. Based on previous literature [24], the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose following acute exercise at (70% VO2max) (3.18 ± 0.68) was significantly lower compared with that of resting controls (4.25 ± 0.27). This study produced an effect size of 2.07 (Cohen’s d) based on the independent t-test design. However, given the small sample size of that initial study, we conservatively estimated much lower effect sizes. A two sample paired t-test design with an effect size of 1.25 and a sample size of 15 AD subjects allocated to high intensity and 15 AD subjects allocated to moderate exercise would yield an estimated power of 91% using a conservative estimated effect size of 1.25. Dropping down to less than half the effect size produced in the preliminary data to 1.00 still provides 75% power, and using a still conservative 1.50 for the effect size indicates &gt;95% power. (Power calculations were produced by nQuery Advisor® 7.0, 1995–2007). We plan to recruit the same number of cognitively healthy older adults in the study. Accounting for a possible 10% attrition rate over the course of the study visits, we propose a total sample size of 60 (30 subjects in each diagnosis group with 15 individuals assigned to moderate and higher intensity acute exercise) Thus, we anticipate recruiting the sample size of 66, which will provide over 90% power based on a conservative estimate of the effect size from the literature and the use of paired difference scores for the primary endpoint, which should reduce variation in the response. All data collected is stored in a secure RedCAP database.

2.7. Safety

The cardiorespiratory fitness test and acute exercise protocol present risks associated with exercise. Adverse events during monitored exercise are extremely rare, and participants are screened for risk of cardiovascular disease and symptomology. The acute exercise protocol requires effort well below maximal and is within standard exercise prescription for healthy adults. MRI scanning is not generally associated with any health risks. Individuals with claustrophobia or non-compatible implanted devices are excluded from the study. The PET scan requires radiation exposure, though the amount of radiation and health risk associated therein are minimal. Remaining safety concerns are minimal, and include typical risks associated with blood draw (site swelling, pain, bruising) and cognitive testing.

3. Discussion

Previous work by our group suggests both cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships association between cardiorespiratory fitness, brain structure, and cognition [31,32]. However, the benefits of clinical trial exercise interventions on these measures have been inconsistent, and vary greatly between individuals [2,3,33]. This is likely due to differences in the acute physiological response to exercise within each individual. The acute response to exercise has not been well characterized in populations with or at risk for developing dementia. This presents a clear need for characterization of the cerebral response to exercise in cognitively healthy older adults and those with AD. Prior work on this acute exercise response has been explored in young adults, typically male [15,16,23,34]. This study is novel in that it will compare the acute exercise response between cognitively healthy older adults and those with AD, characterize different intensities, and link together blood biomarker and neuroimaging outcomes. The outcomes could inform the design of future exercise trials, including those aiming to “prescribe” exercise meant for improving brain health and delaying AD-related cognitive decline.

We chose to examine cerebral glucose metabolism as a measure of cerebral responsiveness to exercise. Our marker of cerebral glucose metabolism, FDG-PET, is well-characterized in older adults. In participants with AD, the brain displays a clear signature of glucose hypo-metabolism [35]. Technological limitations have restricted our understanding of how glucose and lactate interact at the cellular level, but FDG-PET has demonstrated brain glucose metabolism to be inversely related to lactate supply [23,24]. One possible explanation for the observed benefits of cardiorespiratory function in AD is that neurons are repeatedly being supplied with an alternative fuel, transiently sparing glucose. It is important to note that even individuals with similar levels of fitness may have different “lactate threshold” values – the point when lactate availability in the plasma increases exponentially. This suggests that different individuals likely experience different biomarker responses even when exercising at similar intensities. We anticipate a link between cerebral glucose metabolism and exercise, and that this relationship is in part mediated by systemic lactate concentration. It is possible that characterization of the acute response to exercise will provide a useful biomarker for tailoring exercise intensity which benefits brain health in older adults.

Increased circulating lactate can cross the blood brain barrier via monocarboxylate transporters (MCT’s). If lactate results in glucose sparing, we expect this will be reflected by a drop in brain glucose metabolism between exercise and resting conditions. It is important to note that the directionality of change in brain glucose metabolism following acute exercise likely will not reflect the directionality of change in brain glucose metabolism following chronic exercise. Prior work suggests that chronic exercise interventions result in increased cerebral glucose metabolism longitudinally [36]. Mechanistically, preclinical studies have shown that acute exercise modulates a region-specific upregulation of both MCT and glucose transporters that remain elevated at least 18–24 h post-exercise [37,38]. Although the effect on other transporter isoforms is unclear, this suggests that GLUT1 is impacted by acute exercise. Over time, acute exercise-related effects may elicit more lasting changes in metabolic transporter expression and localization, improving resting brain metabolism with a chronic intervention.

In addition to the effects on cerebral glucose metabolism, increased lactate may directly affect additional biomarkers that have been previously linked to brain health. For instance, BDNF is a potential mediator of exercise-related brain benefit [39], but the acute relationship between lactate and BDNF have not been analyzed in AD. Studies in human cell lines suggest that short-term lactate exposure increases BDNF expression [40]. Lactate is positively linked to both BDNF and VEGF levels following exercise [8,9], and lactate has been suggested to mediate BDNF levels in response to exercise [41]. BDNF is also known to be released by platelets in response to shear stress [42] and my thus also be affected by other exercise-related factors independent of lactate, such as changes in blood flow. Additional work in this area to understand the dynamic impact of acute and chronic exercise is needed.

4. Limitations

There are some limitations to the current study design that we must acknowledge. First, we are using a GXT to evaluate fitness, and it is possible that a higher workload on the bicycle may be needed to achieve the same heart rate as on a treadmill (used for the GXT). We only have one Lode bicycle ergometer that is located at the external PET scanning site where rest/acute exercise visits occur, and it cannot be transported between sites. However, we use GXT-determined heart rate ranges for the exercise groups and during the PET visits we adjust workload as heart rate changes. To further determine effort, we also gather measures of RPE when exercise begins and every 2 min throughout the exercise to ensure we are falling within target ranges, as well as obtain an overall RPE value post exercise. An additional limitation is that a within-subjects study design was not employed in the study (with each individual doing both exercise intensities, requiring a minimum of 3 PET scans). We chose the study design that provided the most reasonable amount of burden, cost, and safety for the participants given that this is the first study to acquire these measures in cognitively impaired participants.

5. Conclusion

Here, we have described a small pilot clinical trial to explore the effects of acute exercise on cerebral and peripheral metabolism in aging and AD. Time course and blood processing outcomes are performed with the highest degree of scientific rigor. The results from this study will provide critical information regarding potential mechanisms that may mediate the beneficial but highly variable effects often seen in exercise intervention trials.
