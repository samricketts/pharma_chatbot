Background/Objectives:

Dementia affects one in ten adults over age 65. Paradoxically, dementia (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias) is underdiagnosed, with approximately 50% of those with dementia lacking a formal diagnosis. This limits options for care, support and research engagement. To address this gap, we developed and implemented a telehealth-based ECHO (Extension of Community Healthcare Outcomes) program, “Dementia 360,” to provide education and support for clinicians and allied team members.

Design:

We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of this telementoring educational offering and the effect it had on clinician confidence in diagnosing and treating dementia.

Participants:

Clinicians from across Oregon (n=67) attended learning sessions via videoconferencing technology.

Intervention:

The sessions, which focused on dementia diagnosis and treatment, included didactic information provided by experts, followed by case discussions.

Measures:

We assessed clinician acceptability using surveys, and confidence in identifying and treating those with dementia prior to and after Dementia 360 using paired t tests.

Results:

Dementia 360 was acceptable to clinicians and significantly increased their comfort levels in identifying and treating those with dementia.

Conclusion:

The technology-based program provided support and instruction that was acceptable by clinicians, even those in frontier areas of the state.


pmcIntroduction

Almost 70,000 Oregonians have Alzheimer’s Disease or a related dementia (ADRD), and over 188,000 family members care for them (2020 Alzheimer’s disease facts and figures, 2020). About half of those with ADRD (referred to hereafter as “dementia”) do not have a formal diagnosis (Lang et al., 2017), limiting access to clinical research and family support opportunities. Underdiagnosis is driven by stigma, time demands, inexperience and therapeutic nihilism (“nothing can help”) (Aminzadeh, Molnar, Dalziel, &amp; Ayotte, 2012). Often a clear diagnosis is elusive and this ambiguity can result in clinician anxiety, conflict and disillusionment (Domen, 2016).

To address these challenges, we developed and implemented “Dementia 360” a program modeled on the Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) framework. ECHO programs use tele-mentoring to educate clinicians about specific conditions using a case-based approach (Arora et al., 2014). Recent developments with COVID-19 have highlighted the need for effective distance education that allows for equitable access for all learners. To date, however, only a few papers address dementia education with ECHO (Catic et al., 2014; De Witt Jansen et al., 2018; Gordon et al., 2016; Zhou, Crawford, Serhal, Kurdyak, &amp; Sockalingam, 2016). Thus, our work is unique in that it tests using ECHO to diagnose this emotionally taxing and costly neurodegenerative condition.

The purpose of this project was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of our ECHO program, “Dementia 360,” with Oregon nurses, physicians and allied team members (referred to in this paper as “clinicians”). We evaluated the effect of Dementia 360 on clinician comfort levels in diagnosing and treating dementia.

Methods

Participants.

Dementia 360 was developed by the faculty authors and administered by the Oregon ECHO Network (OEN). The OEN and the faculty team invited clinicians across Oregon to join this free, videoconference-based educational offering. Information about Dementia 360 was posted on the OEN website (https://www.oregonechonetwork.org/) and discussed at meetings with rural teams. The primary focus of this educational program was test feasibility and accessibility. Thus, we did not do a power analysis or have an enrollment target.

Procedures.

There were two Dementia 360 cohorts, the first, funded by the Interprofessional Hartford Award for Research and Practice and the Oregon Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, was 10 weeks in length. The second, funded by the OEN was 12 weeks. The content was the same for both except for the addition of the topic of advanced care planning which was added to the second cohort. The two sessions were provided between January and June, 2019. A request for determination was submitted to the Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) IRB to ascertain if approval was necessary. Due the quality improvement focus, the IRB deemed approval was not needed (IRB #18843; #21940). To align with HIPAA rules, no PHI was collect from the participating clinicians.

The OHSU-based faculty team collaborated with the OEN to design, develop and implement Dementia 360. The faculty team developed the curriculum and the outcome measures. The OEN provided guidance on the curriculum and assessments, managed the technology, and administered the surveys. Dementia 360 was provided via Zoom, a HIPAA-compliant videoconferencing program. Clinicians used their own computers to participate, but were provided with free technical support.

Dementia 360 followed the typical ECHO program model in which faculty (the “hub”) met with clinicians at remote “spokes” (Arora et al., 2010). Hub neurology and nursing faculty (AL, KW, AN, DM) provided lessons on cognitive, physical, and functional assessments, best practices for laboratory and radiological tests, pharmaceutical therapies, and strategies for providing support for families. External subject experts provided information on pharmacologic management of behavioral symptoms, community resources, elder abuse and neglect and driving issues.

The didactic sessions were followed by case presentations by participants. One spokes clinician presented one case per week. Feedback and encouragement was provided from the spokes and the hub.

Participants had access to a password-protected ECHO website which provided the weekly schedule, readings, patient handouts and email addresses for all participants (including faculty). The OEN maintains this website and the information posted, including the roster and emails, indefinitely.

Measures.

Rural status and clinician type was documented. We assessed program satisfaction with a weekly survey (1=poor to 5=excellent). Clinicians were invited to join a focus group to provide feedback on Dementia 360. We assessed clinician comfort levels with assessing and treating memory loss, and assessing and treating individuals with dementia-related behavioral symptoms. The surveys were modeled on OEN surveys that measure the impact of their programs.

Analysis.

Demographic data was collated and survey completion rates tabulated. Focus group sessions were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using a qualitative descriptive approach using NVivo (Version 12) (QSR International Pty Ltd., 2018). Using paired t tests (SAS 9.4) (SAS Institute, 2013), we assessed pre-post changes in the four areas of clinician comfort in diagnosing and treating dementia.

Results

Sixty-seven clinicians registered for Dementia 360 (39 in Cohort 1; 28 in Cohort 2). Of these, 14 dropped out (21%) (Figure 1). Of the 67 registered clinicians, 35 (52%) were from rural clinic and/or provided care for medically underserved. The majority of the clinicians were physicians (Figure 2); the average age was 45 (range 27–69).

Program satisfaction.

On average, 15 (range 8–19) clinicians in Cohort 1 filled out the weekly satisfaction surveys, and 20 (range 11–20) in Cohort 2 completed them. The ratings ranged from “good” (3.65) to “very good” (4.76). The most highly-rated sessions focused on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic management of behavioral symptoms of dementia.

Clinician confidence.

Paired data was available for 29 of the 50 clinicians who filled out the pre-post surveys (survey completion was not a program requirement). Significant improvement in comfort levels post-Dementia 360 was seen across the four domains (p-value 0.0002–0.03; Table 1). Effect size as determined by Cohen’s d (small as 0.020, medium as 0.50; large as 0.80) indicates medium effects (0.56–0.75) (Cohen, 1988).

Focus group attendees (n=11) noted barriers to engagement included limited time to discuss complex cases and difficulty finding resources on the website. Participants reported some frustration with accessing Dementia ECHO 360 materials.

Clinicians also noted frustration with the “grey zones” to dementia diagnosis “…we always kind of get really frustrated because there’s so many grey zones.” Clinicians knew “there’s something is not lining up right…” with their patients with memory loss and wanted “a better understanding of what are the signs…” The Dementia 360 appeared to provide support for clinicians as they navigated the challenging process of diagnosing dementia: “…and I think it was reassuring that we don’t really necessarily have to know what type of dementia it is in order to start to treat them…” Participants appreciated the use of case studies: “And I really like the case studies, um, because it allowed us as a group to apply what we’ve learned…”

Discussion

Dr. Alzheimer identified the eponymous disease over 100 years ago, but to date, no conclusive tests are available to diagnose dementia and there is no cure. This combination leaves clinicians unsettled about how to diagnose and treat this oft-stigmatized condition. Our intervention, Dementia 360, was feasible for and acceptable to participating clinicians and measurably improved clinician confidence in diagnosing and treating dementia. The statistically significant improvement in confidence is meaningful in that, post-intervention, almost half of the participants felt confident enough to provide education and consultation for their own clinic teams. Objective data on diagnostic rates were not collected and thus we do not know if this intervention changed practice. Qualitative data suggests more instruction is needed on treatment options, both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic, for persons with dementia.

Similar to DeWitt et al. (De Witt Jansen et al., 2018), we found strong clinician acceptance and a significant increase in confidence in their skills. This is a divergence from other authors whose focus was on the clinical changes noted in the patients in those studies (Catic et al., 2014; Gordon et al., 2016). While the minimal focus on patient outcomes may be a limitation, the first step to program development is to assess user acceptance. Future versions the Dementia 360 program will incorporate recommendations from participants. For example, the case presentation may be presented first during the 60 minute sessions, allowing more time for collegial exchange.

Many participants did not fill out the weekly evaluations and a little over half filled out the pre-post assessments of comfort levels. This suggests that completing the weekly and pre-post surveys was too demanding for these busy professionals. Future efforts should limit survey burden, and provide incentives for those that complete the surveys.

We modeled our surveys on those used across the OEN programs. However, the surveys have not been validated. Future work should use surveys with known internal and external validity, such as the General Practitioner Attitudes and Confidence Scale for Dementia (Mason et al., 2016). Further, future research should assess the impact Dementia 360 has on clinician accuracy in diagnosing dementia as well as the impact it has on increasing diagnostic rates. Despite these limitations, our Dementia 360 experience demonstrates that this telehealth-based effort increased clinician confidence, which is especially relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for technology-based education that can be easily accessed from any location. Project ECHO has been providing a platform for case-based education since 2006. There are now over 800 ECHO programs in 39 countries, serving 90,000 learners (UNM Project ECHO, 2020). The availability of the educational template, combined with easy access to Project ECHO training has allowed for a rapid response to the pandemic. ECHO programs that include courses on medical and epidemiologic information about COVID-19, care of the older adult with COVID-19, and how to discuss advance directives via telehealth are free and available to health care providers (https://echo.unm.edu/covid-19). ECHOs also address the needs of specific populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as community health workers, patients in the Indian Health Service, and the homeless (UNM Project ECHO, 2020). While these programs are not specific to dementia, they provide evidence that dementia-focused ECHOs can be used to address the needs of hard-to-reach populations, such as incarcerated individuals, where the prevalence of cognitive impairment can be as high as 70% (Ahalt et al., 2018).

An important consequence of COVID-19 is the recognition that telehealth-delivered care is essential to providing care and education. While some argue that telehealth-based education is “less than ideal” (Mian &amp; Khan, 2020), we maintain that the well-established protocols and support embedded in Project ECHO make this mode of education exemplary. The move away from place-based education allows for wider exposure to ideas, therapies, and cultures. The team-based approach allows for interprofessional support and reduces isolation (Arora et al., 2014).

The Dementia 360 ECHO provided evidence-based, interactive education on dementia diagnosis and treatment for clinicians across Oregon. The resulting improvement in clinician confidence indicates this model can be successful in transmitting important information about dementia care. This program aligns with Weiss et al.’s recommendations to increase access to education to foster a dementia-capable workforce (Weiss et al., 2020). Project ECHO’s philosophy encourages liberal sharing of ideas, curriculum and assessment tools. The basic infrastructure allows for nimble implementation of educational offerings that promote wide dissemination of learning opportunities to any clinician with a computer and internet connection.

Findings from this paper were presented as a poster at the Gerontological Society of America Annual Meeting, Austin, Texas, November 2019 and at the University of California Davis, Family Caregiver Institute’s Innovations in Workforce Education for Family Caregiving virtual summit, September 2020. Funding was provided by the NIA (P30AG008017; P30AG024978), the Interprofessional Hartford Award for Research and Practice Program and the Oregon ECHO Network.

We certify this work is novel and adds to the extant literature by providing methods and findings for telementoring primary care providers in identifying and treating dementia.
