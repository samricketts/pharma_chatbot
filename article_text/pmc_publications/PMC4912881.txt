Longitudinal neuroimaging data plays an important role in mapping the neural developmental profile of major neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and normal brain. The development of such developmental maps is critical for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of many brain-related diseases. The aim of this paper is to develop a spatio-temporal Gaussian process (STGP) framework to accurately delineate the developmental trajectories of brain structure and function, while achieving better prediction by explicitly incorporating the spatial and temporal features of longitudinal neuroimaging data. Our STGP integrates a functional principal component model (FPCA) and a partition parametric space-time covariance model to capture the medium-to-large and small-to-medium spatio-temporal dependence structures, respectively. We develop a three-stage efficient estimation procedure as well as a predictive method based on a kriging technique. Two key novelties of STGP are that it can efficiently use a small number of parameters to capture complex non-stationary and non-separable spatio-temporal dependence structures and that it can accurately predict spatio-temporal changes. We illustrate STGP using simulated data sets and two real data analyses including longitudinal positron emission tomography data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and longitudinal lateral ventricle surface data from a longitudinal study of early brain development.

1 Introduction

Large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies have collected a rich set of ultra-high dimensional imaging data, behavioral data, and clinical data in order to better understand the progress of neuropsychiatric disorders, neurological disorders and stroke, and normal brain development, among many others [Evans and Group., 2006, Almli et al., 2007, Skup et al., 2011, Meltzer et al., 2009, Kim et al., 2010, Weiner et al., 2013]. Three primary goals of longitudinal neuroimaging studies are (i) to characterize individual change in brain structure and function over time;

(ii) to characterize the effect of some covariates of interest, such as diagnostic status and gender, on the individual change; and

(iii) to study the predictive value of early brain developmental trajectories for later brain and cognitive development and disease progression.

Moreover, the objective 2 of the recent National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Strategic Plan is to chart mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene by using novel techniques (e.g., imaging). To achieve these goals (i)-(iii), it requires the development of advanced image processing and statistical tools.

A distinctive feature of longitudinal neuroimaging data is that it contains both spatial and temporal dimensions. Specifically, imaging measurements of the same individual usually exhibit positive correlation and the strength of the correlation decreases with the time separation. Moreover, due to the inherent biological structure and function of brain, neuroimaging data are spatially correlated in nature and contain spatially contiguous regions. However, since longitudinal neuroimaging data usually has strong heterogeneity in longitudinal trajectories across space, their spatial and temporal dimensions are typically non-separable. Such non-separability has posed unprecedented challenges to most existing statistical methods for achieving goals (i)-(iii). As shown in Derado et al. [2010], appropriately accounting for correlation structure in statistical modeling and estimation can lead to substantial gains in statistical power. Furthermore, accurately modeling the spatial and temporal dependencies is even more critical for prediction [Cressie and Wikle, 2011, Derado et al., 2013, Demel and Du, 2015].

There are two major groups of spatio-temporal models for longitudinal neuroimaging data. The first one is to use temporal evolution models for non-linear image registration to estimate longitudinal spatial transformations that capture time-varying images [Ashburner and Ridgway, 2012, Singh et al., 2015, Hong et al., 2012]. Such temporal evolution models are usually characterized by some regularizing term and identified either by fitting parametric progression models on geometric features of the transformation or by choosing an opportune metric in the space of transformations to characterize specific evolution models in the image space. These models usually cannot capture complex spatial-temporal correlation of longitudinal neuroimaging data. The second one, usually identified as voxel-based analysis, is to fit some parametric or semi-parametric regression models (e.g., linear mixed effects and estimating equations) at each voxel of registered images [Bernal-Rusiel et al., 2013, Li et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013, Guillaume et al., 2014, Skup et al., 2012]. These models usually ignore the moderate-to-long range spatial correlation of imaging data, even though local spatial correlation is usually introduced by the use of Gaussian smoothing with some apriori kernel size.

Recently, there is a growing interest in modeling complex spatial-temporal correlation of longitudinal neuroimaging data [Marco et al., 2015, Lorenzi et al., 2015, Derado et al., 2013, Guo et al., 2008, Woolrich et al., 2004, Gössl et al., 2001, Brezger et al., 2007, Penny et al., 2005]. Such models are important for using longitudinal neuroimaging to guide treatment selection for individual patients and predict the progression of disease. For instance, in Guo et al. [2008], a predictive statistical model for PET and fMRI data was proposed to forecast a patient's brain activity following a specified treatment regimen. In Derado et al. [2013], a Bayesian spatial hierarchical model was proposed for predicting follow-up neural activity based on an individual's baseline functional neuroimaging data. In Marco et al. [2015] and Lorenzi et al. [2015], two novel spatio-temporal generative models were proposed by using either the Kronecker product of spatial and temporal covariance matrices or the kernel convolutions of a white noise Gaussian process. In general, borrowing strength from the spatial correlations as well as capturing temporal correlations between brain activity can significantly improve predictive performance.

The aim of this paper is to develop a spatio-temporal Gaussian process (STGP) framework to efficiently and flexibly model the spatial and temporal correlation structure of longitudinal neuroimaging data. Compared with the existing literature [Marco et al., 2015, Lorenzi et al., 2015, Derado et al., 2013, Guo et al., 2008, Woolrich et al., 2004, Gössl et al., 2001, Brezger et al., 2007, Penny et al., 2005], we make several novel contributions. (i) Our STGP uses a functional principal component model (FPCA) to capture a large portion of spatio-temporal dependence structure, while it uses a partition space-time covariance model to capture some local spatio-temporal correlations. In particular, the basis functions for FPCA are directly learnt from data and can capture some key features of longitudinal neuroimaging data, which may not be easily modeled by using specific parametric models (e.g., Markov random field). In contrast, most existing models either assume some specific parametric models (e.g., autoregressive and Markov random field) or use the kernel convolutions of a white noise Gaussian process for a fixed kernel function. (ii) We develop a three-stage efficient estimation procedure to estimate all parameters associated with the spatio-temporal dependence structure. (iii) We propose a prediction method that borrows strength from the spatial and temporal correlations to achieve much better prediction of spatio-temporal changes. (iv) We use two real data sets to illustrate that STGP is a powerful tool for quantifying and/or predicting the spatio-temporal changes of brain structure and function. A more general software package is under development and will be made publicly available at the URL http://www.bios.unc.edu/research/bias/software.html.

2 Methods

2.1 Model formulation

Consider a longitudinal neuroimaging study with n subjects. We observe neuroimaging measures (e.g., cortical thickness), denoted by {yi(d, tij)}, at voxel d of a three-dimensional (3D) volume (or 2D surface), denoted by 𝒟, and a p×1 vector of covariates (e.g., age, gender, and diagnostic status), denoted by xi(tij) = (xi,1 (tij), …, xi,p (tij))T, for the i–th subject at time tij ∈ 𝒯 for i = 1, …, n and j = 1, …, mi, where mi denotes the total number of time points for the i-th subject. Without loss of generality, 𝒟 and 𝒯 are assumed to be compact sets in ℝ3 and ℝ, respectively, and ND denotes the number of voxels in 𝒟.

The measurement model of our spatio-temporal Gaussian process (STGP) is given by

(1) yi(d,t)=μ(d,xi(t))+ηi(d,t)+εi(d,t)fori=1,…,n,

where μ(d, xi(t)) is the mean structure for characterizing the effects of covariates xi(t) = (xi,1(t), …, xi,p(t))T on longitudinal neuroimaging data across (d,t). The ηi(d,t) are random functions that characterize both individual image variations from μ(d, xi(t)) and the medium-to-long-range dependence of longitudinal imaging data. Moreover, εi(d, t) are measurement errors that capture the local spatio-temporal dependence structure of longitudinal imaging data. It is assumed that ηi(d,t) and εi(d,t) are mutually independent and ηi(d,t) and εi(d,t) are, respectively, independent and identical copies of GP(0, Ση) and GP(0, Σε), where GP(μ, Σ) denotes a Gaussian process with mean function μ(d, t) and covariance function Σ((d, t), (d′, t′)).

We consider a functional principal component analysis (FPCA) model for the process ηi(d, t) or a spectral decomposition of Ση((d, t), (d′, t′)). Let λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ … ≥ 0 be the ordered eigenvalues of the linear operator determined by Ση with ∑l=1∞λl&lt;∞ and the ψl(d,t)'s be the corresponding orthonormal eigenfunctions [Yao and Lee, 2006, Hall et al., 2006, Chiou et al., 2004]. Then the spectral decomposition of Ση((d, t), (d′, t′)) is given by

(2) ∑η((d,t),(d′,t′))=∑l=1∞λlψl(d,t)ψl(d′,t′).

Then ηi(d,t) admits the Karhunen-Loeve expansion as follows:

(3) ηi(d,t)=∑l=1∞ξi,lψl(d,t),

where ξi,l = ∫𝒯 ∫d∈𝒟 ηi(d,t)ψl(d,t)d𝒱(d)dt is referred to as the l-th functional principal component score of the i-th subject, in which d𝒱(s) denotes the Lebesgue measure. The ξi,l's are uncorrelated random variables with E(ξi,l) = 0 and E(ξi,l2)=λl. If λl ≈ 0 for l ≥ L0 + 1, then (3) can be approximated by

(4) ηi(d,t)≈∑l=1L0ξi,lψl(d,t).

Compared with Lorenzi et al. [2015], a key advantage of using FPCA is that ψl(d,t) are directly estimated from the data.

To accurately characterize Σε, we consider a partition covariance model for the local spatio-temporal dependence structure of imaging data. Specifically, we partition 𝒟 into K mutually exclusive brain regions of interest, denoted as {Ck : k = 1, …, K}, and then fit a parametric spatio-temporal model for each Ck. Moreover, εi(d,t) are assumed to be independent across partitioned brain regions, while the spatial-temporal correlation is preserved within each subregion. If we set K to be 1, then it reduces to the use of a single parametric model to fit residuals across all voxels in 𝒟. When K is relatively large, the partition covariance model can dramatically increase flexibility and robustness in capturing local correlations.

There are at least two approaches for determining exclusive brain regions of interest. The first one is to use some existing anatomical parcellations of brain regions [Derado et al., 2013]. A major drawback is that residuals εi(d,t) within each of these pre-defined regions may not be spatially correlated. Instead, we use the second approach based on a Gaussian mixture model to cluster 𝒟 into K homogeneous regions. We will describe such mixture model in Section 2.2.

We add a subscript k(d) to denote the functional cluster to which voxel d belongs. Finally, for the k–th region of interest, we obtain an approximation of model (1) given by

(5) yi,k(d)(d,t)≈μ(d,xi(t))+∑l=1L0ξi,lψl(d,t)+εi,k(d)(d,t),

where εi,k(d)(d,t) satisfies

(6) Cov(εi,k(d)(d,t),εi,k(d′)(d′,t′))={∑ε((d,t),(d′,t′);θk)ifk(d)=k(d′),0otherwise,

in which θk is a vector of unknown parameters in Σε((d, t), (d′, t′);θk). If the observation indices are rearranged such that the observations within a cluster are grouped together, the covariance matrix Σε = (Σε((d, t), (d′, t′))) is block-diagonal.

2.2 Estimation procedure

We develop a three-stage estimation procedure as follows.

Stage (I): Estimate the parametric (or nonparametric) regression function μ(·, ·).

Stage (II): Estimate the covariance function Ση((d, t), (d′, t′)) and its associated eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

Stage (III): Estimate the unknown parameters in the partition covariance model by using a restricted maximum likelihood estimation.

Stage (I) is to estimate the mean function μ(d, xi(t)) at voxel d by pooling the data from all subjects. There is a large literature on the estimation of μ(d, xi(t)). We need to distinguish two scenarios. The first one is the dense sampling design, in that the number of observations per subject is relatively larger, that is, mini mi → ∞. It often assumes that μ(d, xi(t)) is a nonparametric function of xi(t). In this case, we need to resort to some nonparametric methods (e.g., penalized spline or local polynomial) to approximate μ(d, xi(t))[Yao and Lee, 2006, Ruppert et al., 2003, Fan and Gijbels, 1996]. The second one is the sparse sampling design, in that the number of observations per subject is relatively small, that is, maxi mi &lt; ∞. In this case, we may consider a parametric function of μ(d, xi(t)) based on either linear (or nonlinear) mixed effects models or generalized estimating equations μ(d, xi(t)) [Bernal-Rusiel et al., 2013, Li et al., 2013, Guillaume et al., 2014, Skup et al., 2012]. Moreover, even under this scenario, if time points tij are randomly drawn, we may fit a nonparametric function of μ(d, xi(t)).

Stage (II) is to estimate Ση(·, ·) and its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Stage (II) consists of three steps as follows.

Step (II.1) is to calculate all individual functions ηi(d,t) using nonparametric regression techniques. For the dense sampling design, we apply a local linear regression method to smooth ri(d,t) = yi(d,t) − μ̂(d, xi(t)) over (d,t). Let Kh(dm−d)=h−3∏j=13K((dm,j−dj)/h) be the rescaled kernel function with a bandwidth h, where K(·) is a univariate kernel function. For each i, we estimate ηi(d,t) by minimizing

(7) ∑m=1ND∑j=1mi{ri(dm,tij)−β0−β1T((dm−d)T,tij−t)T}2Kh(dm−d)Kh1(tij−t)

with respect to β0 and βl, where Kh1 (tij − t) = K((tij − t)/h1)/h1. The local linear estimator of ηi(d,t), denoted as η̂i(d,t), is given by β̂0. We pool the data from all n subjects, and the optimal bandwidth (h, h1) is selected by minimizing the generalized cross-validation (GCV) score.

However, for the sparse sampling design, we use the local linear regression method to smooth ri(d,t) = yi(d,t) − μ̂(d, xi(t)) over d ∈ 𝒟 at each time point tij, which leads to a local linear estimator of ηi(d,tij), denoted as η̃i(d,tij). Then, at each voxel, we pool out all observations {η̃i(d,tij) : i = 1, …, n; j = 1, …, mi} to estimate ηi(d,t) by using a random effects model given by

(8) η∼i(d,t)=zi(t)Tγi(d)+δi(d,t),

where zi(t) is a pz × 1 vector of components that depends on time and/or some covariates, γi(d) is a pz × 1 vector of random effects, and δi(d,t) are measurement errors. It is also assumed that γi(d) and δi(d,t) are independent and follow N(0, Σγ(d)) and N(0,σδ2(d)), respectively. For instance, we may set zi(t) as (1, t, t2)T or a vector of spline basis functions. We can estimate Σγ(d) and σδ2(d) by using restricted maximum likelihood estimation and then calculate a prediction of γi(d), denoted as γ^i(d)=∑^γ(d)ziT∑^ηi(d)−1η∼i(d), where zi = (zi(ti1), …, zi(timi))T, ∑^ηi(d)=zi∑^γ(d)ziT+σ^δ2(d)Imi, and η̃i(d) = (η̃i(d,ti1), …, η̃i(d,timi))T. Finally, we set η̂i(d, t) = zi(t)T γ̂i(d) across (d, t).

Step (II.2) is to estimate Ση((d, t), (d′, t′)) by using the empirical covariance matrix of η̂i(d,t) as follows:

(9) ∑^η((d,t),(d′,t′))=n−1∑i=1nη^i(d,t)η^i(d′,t′).

Then, we can use the singular value decomposition of (9) to estimate the eigenvalue-eigenfunction pairs of Ση((d,t), (d′, t′)) in (2). Let (t1, …, tNT)T be an NT × 1 vector of evenly spaced (or distributed) grid points in an interval [mini,j(tij), maxi,j(tij)] such that t1 = mini,j(tij) &lt; t2 &lt; … &lt; tNT = maxi,j(tij). Let η̂i(t) = (η̂i(d1, t),…, η̂i(dND, t))T and η̂i = (η̂i(t1)T, …, η̂i(tNT)T)T be an ND × 1 vector and an NDNT × 1 vector, respectively. Then, we have an NDNT × n matrix V = [η̂1, …, η̂n]. Since n is much smaller than NDNT, it is easier to calculate the eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs of the n × n matrix VTV, denoted by {(λ̂i, ψ̂i) : i = 1, …, n}. It can be shown that {(λ̂i, Vψ̂i) : i = 1, …, n} are the eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs of the NDNT × NDNT matrix VVT. It is common to choose a value L0 in (4) based on the proportion of explained variance [Greven et al., 2010]. We chose the number of principal components so that the proportion of the cumulative eigenvalue is above a prefixed threshold.

Step (II.3) is to compute the functional principal component scores ξi,l. it follows from (3) that estimating ξ̂i,l is equivalent to solving a linear model given by

η^i(d,t)≈∑l=1L0ξi,lψ^l(d,t).

Let ψ̂l(t) = (ψ̂l(d1, t), …, ψ̂l(dND, t))T and ψ̂il = (ψ̂l(ti1)T, …, ψ̂l(timi)T)T, respectively, be an ND × 1 vector and an miND × 1 vector of the estimated l-th eigenfunction. Then, we have an miND × L0 matrix Ψ̂i = [ψ̂i1, …, ψ̂iL0]. We consider an estimate of the functional principal component score for the i-th subject as follows:

(10) ξ^i=(ξ^i,1,…,ξ^i,L0)T=(Ψ^iTΨ^i)−1Ψ^iT(η^i(ti1)T,…,η^i(timi)T)T.

Stage (III) is to estimate all parameters in the partition covariance model as follows. We can estimate εi(d,tij) by using ε^i(d,tij)=yi(d,tij)−μ^(d,xi(tij))−∑l=1L0ξ^i,lψ^l(d,tij) and concatenate them into a vector ε̂(d) = (ε̂i(d, tij) : i = 1, …, n; j = 1, …, mi)T for each voxel. Specifically, we use a penalized likelihood approach with an L1 penalty function for a Gaussian mixture model to cluster all residual vectors {ε̂(d) : d ∈ 𝒟} into K homogeneous regions [Pan and Shen, 2007, Huang et al., 2015].

Let ε̂i,k(t) = (ε̂i,k(d)(d,t) : d ∈ Ck) be a |Ck| × 1 vector for k = 1, …, K. Then we can write an mi|Ck| × 1 vector ε̂i,k = (ε̂i,k(ti1)T, …, ε̂i,k(timi)T)T and an miND × 1 vector ε̂i = (ε̂i,k : k = 1, …, K). We also define ε^=(ε^1T,…,ε^nT)T and θ=(θ1T,…,θKT)T. Second, we calculate a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimate of θ by maximizing the REML log-likelihood given by

(11) L(θ|ε^)=−12∑i=1n∑k=1Klog|∑i,ε(θk)|−12∑k=1Klog(∑i=1n1mi|Ck|T∑i,ε(θk)−11mi|Ck|)−12∑i=1n∑k=1K(ε^i,k−1mi|Ck|μ^(θk))T∑i,ε(θk)−1(ε^i,k−1mi|Ck|μ^(θk)),

where Σi,ε(θk) is an mi|Ck| × mi|Ck| covariance matrix of εi,k = (εi,k(ti1)T, …, εi,k(timi)T)T, where εi,k(t) = (εi,k(d)(d,t) : d ∈ Ck), and 1mi|Ck| is an mi|Ck| × 1 vector having all the entries 1. Furthermore, μ̂(θk) is given by

μ^(θk)=(∑i=1n1mi|Ck|T∑i,ε(θk)−11mi|Ck|)−1∑i=1n1mi|Ck|T∑i,ε(θk)−1ε^i,k.

2.3 Prediction procedure

We present a prediction procedure based on a kriging technique. We start with splitting the data set into a training set and a test set. We fit the proposed model to the training set to estimate the fixed main effect, denoted as μ̂, eigenvalue-eigenfunction pairs, denoted as {(λ̂l, ψ̂l(d,t)) : l = 1, …, L0}, and the parameters in the partition covariance model, denoted as θ̂. Then we use the prediction procedure given below to predict the image at time t0 for the i0-th subject in the test set, based on the images at time ti0j ≠ t0 and the fitted model.

Given μ̂ estimated from the training set, it is straightforward to calculate μ̂(d, xi0(t)). Then we obtain ri0(d, ti0j) = yi0(d,ti0j)−μ̂(d, xi0(ti0j)). Given {(λ̂l, ψ̂l(d,t)) : l = 1, …, L0}, we can follow Stage (II) in Section 2.2 to calculate {ξ̂i0,l : l = 1, …, L0} for the i0-th subject in the test set. Thus we can calculate

ε^i0,k(d)(d,ti0j)=yi0,k(d)(d,ti0j)−μ^(d,xi0(ti0j))−∑l=1L0ξ^i0,lψ^l(d,ti0j)

across all voxels d at time ti0j ≠ t0. Then, we can use the spatio-temporal kriging to calculate ε̂i0,k(d)(d, t0) for all voxels d as follows. Let Σε,k = Var(εi,k) and c0,k = Cov(εi,k(t0), εi,k). The kriging predictor is given by ε̂i0,k(t0) = c0,k(Σε,k)−1ε̂i0,k for k = 1, …, K. In practice, c0,k and Σε,k are estimated by plugging in the REML estimates, θ̂k. Finally, we predict yi0,k(d)(d,t0) according to

(12) y^i0,k(d)(d,t0)=μ^(d,xi0(t0))+∑l=1L0ξ^i0,lψ^l(d,t0)+ε^i0,k(d)(d,t0)fordεD.

2.4 Model validation

For each subject in the test set, we apply the prediction procedure described in Section 2.3 to predict the measurements across all voxels at time tij. We evaluate the prediction accuracy of STGP by quantifying the prediction error at each voxel d and time tij. Specifically, the square root of the mean squared prediction error (rtMSPE) for each voxel d is given by

(13) rtMSPE(d)=1|STE|∑i∈STE(y^i,k(d)(d,tij)−yi,k(d)(d,tij))2,

where 𝒮TE denotes the index set of all the subjects in the test set and |𝒮TE| is the cardinality of STE. The overall rtMSPE is calculated as follows:

(14) rtMSPE=1|STE|ND∑i∈STE∑d∈D(y^i,k(d)(d,tij)−yi,k(d)(d,tij))2.

3 Simulation studies

In this section, we use simulations to evaluate the predictive performance of STGP. For the REML function optimization, we used the Matlab function fmincon, which implements a Quasi-Newton method (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method). The computation was done on Intel Corei3-2120, CPU 3.30 GHz and 8 GB RAM.

3.1 Study I: local linear regression approach

We simulated imaging data at all 1,000 voxels of a 10 × 10 × 10 phantom for n = 80 subjects at three time points. At a given voxel d = (d1, d2, d3)T, the data were generated from a spatio-temporal Gaussian process model according to

(15) yi,k(d)(d,tij)=μ(d,xi(tij))+ηi(d,tij)+εi,k(d)(d,tij),i=1,…,80;j=1,…,3.

The covariate vector xi(t) = (xi,1(t), xi,2(t), xi,3(t), xi,4(t))T was fixed at their values obtained from our clinical data in Section 4.1, and its components represent gender, diagnostic status (NC, MCI, AD), and age, respectively. The fixed main effect function μ(d, xi(t)) was specified using the estimates calculated from our real imaging data in Section 4.1. We set ηi(d,t)=∑l=13ξi,lψl(d,t), where ξi,1 ∼ N (0, 62), ξi,2 ∼ N (0, 2.52), and ξi,3 ∼ N(0, 1.52).

The eigenfunctions were chosen as follows:

ψ1(d,t)=1530sin(πd1/5)cos(πt/18),ψ2(d,t)=1530cos(πd2/5)cos(πt/18),ψ3(d,t)=12255(0.9−d3/5)cos(πt).

Figure 2 (a)-(c) show the three eigenfunctions at baseline on the d2 × d1, d2 × d1, and d3 × d2 planes, respectively. We also used the real data in Section 4.1 to cluster all voxels into five mutually exclusive regions. Then, for the k-th subregion, we simulated realizations of the zero-mean Gaussian process εi,k(d)(d, t) according to model (6). For the choice of the covariance function, we used a nonseparable space-time covariance function proposed by Gneiting [2002].

We applied the three-stage estimation procedure described in Section 2.2 to the simulated data. First, we estimated the fixed main effect function μ(d, xi(t)) using penalized smoothing spline implemented in the R package vows [Reiss et al., 2014]. Then we used a local linear regression to estimate ηi(d, t) based on the residuals yi(d, t)−μ̂(d,xi(t)). Following the method described in Section 2.2, we estimated the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions associated with the covariance function Ση((d, t), (d′, t′)). Figure 1 (a) shows the relative eigenvalues, where the relative eigenvalues are defined as the ratios of the eigenvalues over their sum. It is shown that the first three eigenvalues account for more than 90% of the total variation and the others quickly vanish to zero. We present some selected slices of the estimated eigenfunctions corresponding to the largest three eigenvalues along with the true eigenfunctions in Figure 2. It shows that the estimates are close to the true eigenfunctions, and η̂i(d,t) can capture major variation in the true eigenfunctions. The parameters of the covariance model in Gneiting [2002] were estimated by following Stage (III) in Section 2.2.

To evaluate the prediction accuracy of STGP, we split the simulated data set into a training set of 50 subjects and a test set of 30 subjects. Then we followed the prediction procedure in Section 2.3 to predict the image at the last time point for each of the 30 subjects in the test set, based on the first two images and the fitted model from the training set. We compared the predictive performance of STGP with those of the semiparametric model, which assumed the mean structure and uncorrelated errors, and the semiparametric model+FPCA. Table 1 shows the overall rtMSPE (14) for each model. As can be seen in Table 1, STGP outperforms the other two methods.

3.2 Study II: random effects model approach

By mimicking the real imaging data in Section 4.2, we simulated data at all 900 pixels of a 30 × 30 phantom image for n = 24 subjects at different measurement times per subject. At a given pixel d = (d1, d2)T, the data were generated from a spatio-temporal Gaussian process model according to

(16) yi,k(d)(d,tij)=μ(d,xi(tij))+ηi(d,tij)+εi,k(d)(d,tij),i=1,…,24;j=1,…,mi.

We used the real data in Section 4.2 to specify xi(t) = (xi,1(t), xi,2(t))T and the fixed main effect function μ(d, xi(t)), where the components of xi(t) represent gender and age, respectively. We set ηi(d,t)=∑l=13ξi,lψl(d,t), where ξi,l were independently generated according to ξi,1 ∼ N(0, 122), ξi,2 ∼ N(0, 72), and ξi,3 ∼ N(0, 42). The eigenfunctions were chosen as follows:

ψ1(d,t)=245sin(π(d1+d2)/15)cos(πt/18),ψ2(d,t)=245cos(π(d1+d2)/15)cos(πt/18),ψ3(d,t)=1303cos(πt/12).

Figure 3 (a)-(c) show the three eigenfunctions at baseline. We arbitrarily clustered all voxels into five mutually exclusive regions and simulated realizations of the zero-mean Gaussian process εi,k(d)(d,t) according to model (6). For the choice of the covariance function, we used a spatio-temporal autoregressive model [Derado et al., 2010], which extends the simultaneous autoregressive model in Hyun et al. [2014] to the spatio-temporal process context.

Similarly to the simulation in Section 3.1, we applied almost the same estimation procedure in Section 2.2 to the simulated data except a minor difference. Specifically, since the simulated data are sparse with unequal number of repeated measurements and different measurement times per subject, we used the random effects model approach in Stage (II) of Section 2.2 to estimate ηi(d, t). Then, η̂i(d, t) was used to obtain the estimates of eigenvalue-eigenfunction pairs associated with the covariance function Ση((d, t), (d′, t′)). The relative eigenvalues are shown in Figure 1 (b). Figure 3 shows the estimated eigenfunctions corresponding to the largest three eigenvalues along with the true eigenfunctions. Inspecting Figure 3 reveals that η̂i(d, t) can faithfully recover the true eigenfunctions.

To examine the predictive performance of STGP, we randomly split the simulated data set into a training set of 16 subjects and a test set of 8 subjects. Then, we predicted the image at the last time point for each of the 8 subjects in the test set. The prediction results are summarized in Table 2, which shows that STGP performs well even when the longitudinal data are sparse with unequal number of repeated measurements and different measurement times per subject.

4 Real data analysis

4.1 ADNI PET data

We applied our proposed method to PET scans obtained at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months obtained from 159 subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Among them, there are 50 Normal Controls (NC), 58 Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI) and 51 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) subjects. There are 97 males, whose mean baseline age is 77 years with standard deviation 6 years, and 62 females, whose mean baseline age is 75.5 years with standard deviation 6.7 years. FDG-PET images acquired 30-60 minutes post-injection were processed by using a standard image processing pipeline. A detailed description of PET protocols and acquisition can be found at www.adni-info.org. Such pipeline consists of average, spatial alignment, interpolation to a standard voxel size, intensity normalization, and smoothing to a common resolution of 8-mm full width at half maximum. The dimension of the processed PET images is 79×95×69.

We applied the prediction procedure in Section 2.3 to the PET scans. We randomly selected 80 subjects for a training set and used their data to train the prediction model. We included gender, diagnostic status (HC, MCI, AD), and age as covariates of interest. We first fitted the spatio-temporal Gaussian process model to the training data to estimate the fixed main effect μ(d, xi(t)), eigenvalue-eigenfunction pairs, and the model parameters in (6). Figure 4 presents the estimated μ̂(d, xi(t)) as a function of age corresponding to six combinations of diagnostic status and gender in a randomly selected voxel. For subjects in each of the six combinations, PET measure linearly decreases as age increases. Moreover, we observe that PET measures have two interesting patterns with HC&gt;MCI&gt;AD and Male&gt;Female.

The voxels were partitioned into 128 mutually exclusive brain regions by our clustering method. For smoothing of the mean function, we used penalized smoothing spline with smoothing parameters estimated by REML. In Figure 5 (a), we present the relative eigenvalues associated with the covariance function Ση((d, t), (d′, t′)), which decrease slowly to zero. We also show some selected slices of the estimated eigenfunctions corresponding to the largest four eigenvalues in Figure 6. We specified (6) using the nonseparable Gneiting's covariance model as in the simulated example and estimated the model parameters by optimizing (11).

The fitted model was then used to predict the PET scans at 12 months for each of the 79 subjects in the test set, based on the images at baseline and 6 months. Figure 7 shows the individual PET images predicted at 12 months (bottom panel) along with the corresponding observed images (upper panel) for three selected subjects consisting of an NC, an MCI, and an AD subject. We find that there is a strong agreement between the observed and predicted images.

We evaluated the prediction accuracy of our proposed model by calculating the rtMSPE(d) (13) and compared the results for the proposed model with those for the semiparametric model and the semiparametric model+FPCA. Figure 8 shows the rtMSPE(d) maps for the three models. Inspecting Figure 8 reveals that STGP provided substantially better prediction performance than the other models. We also calculated the overall rtMSPE for each model and compared the results in Table 3. The overall rtMSPE was reduced by 49% using the proposed model compared with the semiparametric model, while it was reduced by 36% compared with the semiparametric model+FPCA. We find that STGP can substantially increase the prediction accuracy compared with the other two models.

4.2 Lateral ventricle surface data

We considered a longitudinal lateral ventricle surface data set obtained from a study of early brain development [Bompard et al., 2014]. See Bompard et al. [2014] for detailed information on imaging acquisition and analysis. The surface data set includes measurements for 24 healthy full-term infants (12 males and 12 females) at months 0 (2 weeks), 3, 6, 9, 12 approximately, with different infants having different visiting times and some infants missing a visit. Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all participants, and the experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

All subjects were scanned on a 3T MR scanner (Siemens Medical System, Erlangen, Germany) housed in the Biomedical Research Imaging Center. The T2-weighted images used in this study were acquired using a turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence: TR = 7380 ms, TE = 119 ms, Flip Angle = 150u, and resolution = 1.256 × 1.256 × 1.95mm3. A total of 70 slices were acquired to cover the entire brain. None of the subjects were sedated for MRI; all scans were performed with subjects during sleep. Subjects were fed before scanning, then swaddled, allowed to fall asleep, fitted with ear protection and their heads secured.

We applied a pre-processing pipeline to all T2-weighted images in order to segment lateral ventricles (LVs). Such pipeline includes removal of non-brain tissues such as the skull and dura using Brain Surface Extractor (BSE)[Shattuck and Leahy, 2001], bias correction using the non-parametric non-uniform intensity normalization (N3) method [Sled et al., 1998], and resampling to a resolution of 1 × 1 × 1mm3. Subsequently, we applied a longitudinal neonatal brain image segmentation algorithm [Shi et al., 2010] and then outlined the LV structures based on the segmented CSF maps. Finally, two observers performed manual correction of the lateral ventricle segmentation using the ITK-SNAP software [Yushkevich et al., 2006].

We applied the SPHARM-PDM [Styner et al., 2004] shape representation to establish surface correspondence and aligned the surface location vectors across all subjects. The sampled SPHARM-PDM is a smooth, accurate, fine-scale shape representation. The left lateral ventricle surface of each infant is represented by 1002 location vectors with each location vector consisting of the spatial x, y, and z coordinates of the corresponding vertex on the SPHARM-PDM surface.

We applied the prediction procedure in Section 2.3 to the spatial x, y, and z coordinates on the SPHARM-PDMs of the left lateral ventricle. Our analysis included the SPHARM-PDM representation of left lateral ventricle surfaces as responses and gender and age (in months) as covariates. We randomly selected 16 infants for a training set and fitted STGP to the training set. We estimated μ(d, xi(t)) by using penalized smoothing spline. Figure 9 presents observed individual trajectories of the surface location vectors and their corresponding estimated curves μ̂(d, xi(t)) as functions of age across gender on a randomly selected vertex. Overall, most of these estimated curves μ̂(d, xi(t)) increase initially and slow down around 10 months.

Since different subjects have different measurement times and unequal number of repeated measurements, we estimated eigenvalue-eigenfunction pairs by using the random effects model approach described in Section 2.2. The relative eigenvalues are shown in Figure 5 (b). To characterize the local correlation, we partitioned the voxels on the SPHARM-PDM surface into 5 mutually exclusive regions by using our clustering method based on a Gaussian mixture model and specified the covariance function (6) using a spatio-temporal autoregressive model as illustrated in Section 3.2. The unknown parameters in (6) were estimated by REML.

We used the fitted model to predict the x, y, and z coordinates at the last time point for each of the 8 infants in the test set, based on their spatial coordinates at earlier time points. We compare the individual predicted spatial coordinates with the observed coordinates for three randomly selected subjects in Figure 10. To evaluate the predictive performance, we calculated the rtMSPE(d) for the x, y, and z coordinates, respectively. The results are shown in Figure 11 for the proposed model along with those for the semiparametric model and the semiparametric model+FPCA. Figure 11 shows that STGP improves upon the other two models. We also calculated the overall rtMSPE for each model and present the results in Table 4. The overall rtMSPE was reduced by 19 to 32% using STGP compared with the semiparametric model, while it was also reduced by 9 to 11% compared with the semiparametric model+FPCA. With the limited number of subjects, the improvements decrease compared with the results in Section 4.1, but nevertheless STGP outperformed the other two models.

5 Discussion

We have proposed a spatio-temporal Gaussian process framework for modeling neuroimaging data from longitudinal studies. We have developed a three-stage estimation procedure and a predictive method based on STGP. We have applied the proposed model to two real data analyses including longitudinal positron emission tomography data and longitudinal lateral ventricle surface data to show that our approach can substantially improve predictive performance compared with some existing methods.

Our approach provides a computationally efficient framework for approximating the unstructured variance-covariance matrix of ultra-high dimensional data by explicitly modeling the long-to-medium-to-short-range spatio-temporal dependence. The computational cost for the estimation of the mean function and the FPCA model is relatively low while the optimization of the REML function takes most of the computing time. For the ADNI PET data in Section 4.1, it took about 4 hours to optimize the REML function for the largest brain region. The computing time for the optimization over the entire domain is significantly reduced when it is implemented in a parallel manner.

An important issue with our partition covariance model is that one needs to choose the number of partitioned brain regions. In our examples, the partition was created in a way that the number of voxels in each subregion is not too large in order to reduce the computational cost. More research on the selection of this tuning parameter is needed. It is also interesting to extend our FPCA model to incorporate covariates. Our proposed model incorporates the effect of the covariates through the mean function, but the influence of the predictor can also be incorporated through the random components of a functional principal components expansion [Chiou et al., 2004]. It would be interesting to investigate the predictive abilities of various models with a covariate effect either on the mean function or on the residual process.

Another important issue is to check the key assumptions of the proposed spatio-temporal Gaussian process. Specifically, we may develop various diagnostic measures (e.g., residuals, local influence measure, residual process and test statistics) to systematically test the mean structure in (1) and examine potential outliers and influential points. Subsequently, we will examine the assumption of FPCA by examining whether FPCA is an efficient method for capturing major variation in longitudinal functional data. Finally, we can use local spectral frequency plots to investigate the short-range correlation structure of neuroimaging data.
