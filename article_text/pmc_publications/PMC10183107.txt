Arteriolosclerosis is common in older brains and related to cognitive and motor impairment. We compared the severity of arteriolosclerosis and its associations with cerebrovascular disease risk factors (CVD-RFs) in multiple locations in the brain and spinal cord. Participants (n=390) were recruited in the context of a longitudinal community-based clinical-pathological study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project. CVD-RFs were assessed annually for an average of 8.7 (SD=4.3) years before death. The annual assessments included systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, diabetes mellitus (DM), low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, body mass index, and smoking. Postmortem pathological assessments included assessment of arteriolosclerosis severity using the same rating scale in three brain locations (basal ganglia, frontal, and parietal white matter regions) and 4 spinal cord levels (cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral levels). A single measure was used to summarize the severity of spinal arteriolosclerosis assessments at the 4 levels due to their high correlations. Average age at death was 91.5 (SD=6.2) years, and 73% were women. Half showed moderate to severe arteriolosclerosis in frontal white matter and spinal cord followed by parietal white matter (38%) and basal ganglia (27%). The severity of arteriolosclerosis in all three brain locations showed mild to moderate correlations. By contrast, spinal arteriolosclerosis was associated with brain arteriolosclerosis only in frontal white matter. Higher DBP was associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis in all three brain locations. DM was associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis only in frontal white matter. Controlling for DBP, higher SBP was inversely associated with arteriolosclerosis in parietal white matter. Blood cholesterol and triglyceride, high body mass index, or smoking were not related to the severity of arteriolosclerosis in any brain region. None of the CVD-RFs were associated with the severity of spinal arteriolosclerosis. These data indicate that severity of arteriolosclerosis and its associations with CVD-RFs may vary in different CNS locations.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Brain arteriolosclerosis is one of several pathologies affecting small vessels that are common in aging brains. These small vessel pathologies are associated with adverse health outcomes including stroke and are an underestimated contributor to late-life cognitive and motor decline in older adults without known cerebrovascular diseases[8, 22, 42, 44, 51].

The recognition of the importance of small vessel disease like brain arteriolosclerosis in aging brains is due in part to the routine availability of brain imaging showing that multifocal small vessel disease imaging biomarkers are common in many older adults within and outside the brain. Yet, brain imaging cannot untangle the varied microvascular pathologies underlying multifocal small vessel disease in aging brains. This highlights the need for microscopic tissue studies that characterize to what extent the severity of arteriolosclerosis in older adults is similar or heterogeneous in different central nervous system (CNS) tissues.

Currently, there is no specific treatment to prevent the progression of arteriolosclerosis that can occur in varied locations within and outside the brain. Yet, irrespective of its varied locations, current treatment recommendations for arteriolosclerosis focus on reducing the same set of cerebrovascular disease risk factors (CVD-RFs) including hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypercholesterolemia. Studies that have examined association of CVD-RFs with the severity of brain arteriolosclerosis have not been reported consistent findings[8, 22]. We are unaware of studies that have examined whether the associations of CVD-RFs with arteriolosclerosis vary within and outside the brain.

To address both of these knowledge gaps, possible heterogeneity of arteriolosclerosis and its associations with CVD-RFs across CNS regions, we used clinical and postmortem data from 390 older decedents who participated in the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP)[5]. First, we examined the correlations of the severity of arteriolosclerosis in 3 brain and 4 spinal cord locations and then examined the associations of the severity of arteriolosclerosis in each site with CVD-RFs.

METHODS

Participants

Participants were older adults recruited in MAP, which began enrollment in 1997 and recruits older adults without known dementia across metropolitan Chicago. Participants are from retirement centers, subsidized housings, or private homes. They consent for annual clinical evaluation and brain and spinal cord donation at the time of death. Additional study details are provided elsewhere[5]. MAP was approved by an Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. All participants signed an informed consent and Anatomic Gift Act.

Of 2198 participants enrolled from 1997 through 2021, 1154 died. Autopsy was performed on 948 participants (autopsy rate=82%). Initially, only basal ganglia arteriolosclerosis was assessed and data were available from 907 autopsies. Assessment of frontal and parietal white matter regions and spinal cord arteriolosclerosis began in 2012, and data were available for 608, 606, and 419 participants respectively. The analytic sample for the current study included 390 participants with complete clinical and pathological assessments as shown in Figure e-1.

CVD-RFs

Blood pressure.

During the annual clinical evaluations, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (SBP) blood pressures were measured by trained personnel using an automated sphygmomanometer twice in sitting position and once in standing position, and an average was calculated as described previously[2]. Because effects of SBP and DBP on arteriolosclerosis are accumulating over time, we used in the current analyses means of annual SBP and DBP recordings, which were measured on average 8.7 (SD=4.3) times for each participant. This approach was also used in our previous publication[33].

Annual clinical assessments also included inspection of medication containers by research assistants for prescriptions and over the counter medications. Medications were recorded and coded subsequently using Medi-Span Drug Data Base System[30]. Using the codes corresponding to different classes of antihypertensive medications, a dichotomous variable was developed indicating use of any of the antihypertensive medications once or more during years of follow-up. Moreover, we used self-report history of hypertension for descriptive purposes[37].

Diabetes mellitus (DM).

DM was present if reported by a participant or if diabetic medications including insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents were used by a participant, as described previously[34].

Blood lipids.

Annually, blood draw was performed by trained phlebotomists and fasting status of participants was recorded. Blood lipid panel was measured by Quest Diagnostics. Total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were directly measured using spectrophotometry and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated[27]. We used averages of annual non-fasting levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG to summarize the cumulative effects of blood lipids.

Body mass index (BMI).

Annual measured weight and height were used to calculate BMI as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared[10]. The average annual BMI measurements were used in the current analyses.

Smoking.

Information on smoking habit was obtained at study baseline. Participants were asked if they smoked at baseline or ever in life regularly. The smoking habit was summarized as a dichotomous variable indicating ever regular smoking.

Postmortem pathological assessments

The average postmortem interval was 9.4 (SD=7.9) hours. Details of the structured autopsy procedures, performed by trained staff blinded to clinical data, are provided in prior publications [6, 11, 12, 32] and are summarized in the current eMethods. In brief, after brain removal one hemisphere was frozen for future multi-omics studies and the other hemisphere was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solutions. Following fixation, the hemisphere was cut into 1-cm thick slabs and tissue blocks were obtained from predetermined locations for pathological assessments. After brain removal, the entire spinal cord was removed using the standard posterior approach, and tissue blocks were obtained from predetermined spinal cord levels.

Brain and spinal arteriolosclerosis.

Arteriolosclerosis was defined as fibrohyalinotic thickening of penetrating small arterioles with subsequent narrowing of vessels’ lumen (Figure 1). The severity rating of arteriolosclerosis was based on viewing 6 μm H&amp;E stained slides from 3 brain locations and 4 spinal cord levels using the same scale. The scale ranged from a score of 0–7; 0 indicated no arteriolosclerosis; 2 indicated mild arteriolosclerosis and was scored when the arterial wall was minimally thickened; 4 indicated moderate arteriolosclerosis and was scored when the arteriolar wall thickness was up to twice the normal thickness; 6 indicated severe arteriolosclerosis and was scored when the arteriolar wall thickness was more than twice the normal thickness; and 7 was used when complete occlusion was seen due to a thickened arterial wall. For these analyses we grouped the severity of arteriolosclerosis into a previously published validated 4-level ordinal scale (none, mild, moderate, severe)[32, 37]. We also used a dichotomous scale (none-mild vs moderate-to-severe) for descriptive analyses. A framework of complementary methods was in place to decrease interrater variability including blinding pathologists to clinical data, training protocols, joint neuropathology conferences for discussion of microvascular pathological assessments, and ongoing testing of inter-rater agreement in test cases that represented different levels of severity of arteriolosclerosis. The last weighted Kappa statistics for interrater agreement in arteriolosclerosis assessment was 0.79[24], indicating excellent agreement.

Brain arteriolosclerosis was assessed in three locations (Figure 2): 1) basal ganglia; arteriolosclerosis was assessed in a tissue block obtained at the level of the anterior commissure that included caudate, putamen, internal capsule, and adjacent globus pallidus; 2) frontal white matter, tissue taken from the anterior white matter deep to the middle frontal cortex; 3) parietal white matter, tissue taken from white matter deep to the posterior parietal cortex.

Spinal arteriolosclerosis was assessed within white matter of spinal cord obtained at each of the 4 levels (Figure 3-a): cervical (C5/6), thoracic (T7), lumbar (L4/5), and sacral (S4/5) spinal levels. The levels were confirmed microscopically from H&amp;E sections of each spinal cord level by examining anterior and posterior columns. At each of the 4 spinal levels, the severity of arteriolosclerosis was assessed separately in the anterior and posterior columns (Figure 3-b) yielding 8 separate ratings of the severity of spinal arteriolosclerosis for each participant.

Moderate to high correlations existed between the 8 spinal arteriolosclerosis ratings, with Spearman coefficients between 0.34 – 0.87 (Table e-1). Therefore, we examined the eight arteriolosclerosis assessments in an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) (eMethods). Only 1 factor had Eigen value greater than 1 and explained 72.6% of the variance of the arteriolosclerosis assessments at spinal cord. The factor loadings of the 8 arteriolosclerosis ratings on this factor were between 0.71 – 0.96 (Supplementary Table e-2). Therefore, we constructed a composite variable of spinal cord arteriolosclerosis by averaging the 8 spinal cord arteriolosclerosis ratings, as done previously[11].

Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

A modified Bielschowsky silver stain was used for visualization of diffuse plaques, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles in sections prepared from 5 brain locations. Using these data, a board-certified neuropathologist, blinded to clinical data, determined severity of taupathy based on Braak stages and adjudicated pathological diagnosis of AD based on established criteria[21].

Immunohistochemistry was also used for detection of tau tangles and amyloid-beta (Aβ) depositions. An antibody specific for phosphorylated tau, AT8, was used for detection of tau tangles deposition in 20 μm sections prepared from tissue blocks of 8 brain locations. The brain locations were in the mesial temporal (entorhinal cortex or hippocampus) and neocortex (anterior cingulate cortex, superior frontal cortex, mid frontal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, angular gyrus/supramarginal cortex, and calcarine cortex). In each brain location, tau tangles density was determined using computer-assisted stereological mapping by an experienced rater. Regional tau tangles densities were summarized as mesial temporal, neocortical, and brain tau tangles densities[24]. Brain sections immunohistochemically stained for Aβ were used for determining Aβ load based on Thal staging[47].

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).

CAA was assessed using immunohistochemically stained sections of 4 brain locations. Antibodies specific for Aβ were used for visualizing meningeal and parenchymal vessels where vessels’ Aβ depositions was scored using a 0–4 scale, described in eMethods. Regional CAA scores were summarized to indicate brain CAA level using a 4-level (none, mild, moderate, severe) ordinal scale and a dichotomous (none-mild vs. moderate-severe) scale for descriptive purposes.

White matter hyperintensity (WMH)

In a subgroup of participants, fixed brain hemispheres were imaged on 3-Tesla MRI scanners before autopsy procedures, as previously described[37]. We used this approach to obtain both arteriolosclerosis (pathological assessment) and WMH (imaging assessment) at the same time. The disadvantage of this approach was that the brain hemisphere was imaged while immersed in formaldehyde solution, which made it scientifically inappropriate to use publicly available software for segmenting and quantifying WMH burden. Therefore, we used a modified version of the Fazekas scale to characterize whole brain WMH burden. Specifically, none and mild levels were combined into one level (none/mild) due to uncertainty in distinguishing none from mild level in postmortem imaging. The maximum of the deep and periventricular scores was used as the final whole brain WMH score. The WMH severity scores were none/mild, moderate, and severe, which were scored by a trained rater with excellent intra-rater agreement[37].

Other clinical covariates

Age at the last visit and death were calculated using date of birth (obtained at baseline), dates of the last visit and death. Sex and years of education were obtained at baseline through self-reports.

Statistical analysis

We used Spearman correlation coefficient to examine the correlations between the severity of arteriolosclerosis assessments at different locations and used χ2 to compare arteriolosclerosis across locations. To assess the association of CVD-RFs with the severity of arteriolosclerosis, we used mixed effects model with cumulative logit as the link function. In this model, multiple assessments of arteriolosclerosis from 4 regions (3 brain locations and spinal cord) per person were used as outcome. As fixed effects, CVD-RFs, region of arteriolosclerosis assessment, and interaction of CVD-RFs with region of arteriolosclerosis were included as well as age at death and sex. As random effects, person-specific levels of severity of arteriolosclerosis (intercept) were included. The random covariance structure made it possible to include in the model correlations that existed between arteriolosclerosis assessments in each participant[41]. Using this model provided us the opportunity to examine associations of a CVD-RF with the 4 arteriolosclerosis assessments in 1 rather than 4 models reducing number of comparisons. The analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and P-value less than 0.05 was the threshold to reject a null hypothesis.

RESULTS

Table 1 summarizes characteristics of the study participants. Mean of age at death was 91.5 (SD=6.2, Range: 65.9–108.3) years and 283 (73%) were women. Hypertension was the most common CVD-RF present in more than two thirds of the participants. Two thirds of the participants showed postmortem evidence of a pathological diagnosis of AD. Aβ in brain was absent in 13% of participants, while tau tangles were absent in 1% (n=4) of participants.

Brain and spinal arteriolosclerosis

Overall, the severity of arteriolosclerosis in the brain and spinal cord was not uniform (Table 1). Moderate to severe arteriolosclerosis was present in 51% of participants in frontal white matter, 38% in parietal white matter, and 27% in basal ganglia (χ2=44.8, DF=2, p&lt;0.001). Of 260 participants with moderate to severe arteriolosclerosis in at least one brain location only 132 (51%) had moderate to severe arteriolosclerosis in spinal cord, and only 23 (6%) participants had moderate to severe arteriolosclerosis in all 4 brain and spinal cord regions (Figure 4).

The correlations of the severity of arteriolosclerosis in the 4 regions (3 brain locations and spinal cord) varied from null to moderate (Table 2).[40] For example, the severity of spinal arteriolosclerosis was unrelated to basal ganglia arteriolosclerosis. The strongest correlation was observed between frontal white matter and parietal white matter arteriolosclerosis, which was 0.49. These null to moderate[40] correlations (0.01 to 0.49) suggest that arteriolosclerosis in different CNS locations may have different risk factors and underlying mechanisms.

CVD-RFs and brain and spinal cord arteriolosclerosis

Core model.

First, we examined associations of age and sex with arteriolosclerosis and whether region of arteriolosclerosis assessment modified the associations. The interaction terms between region of arteriolosclerosis and age (F=0.21, p=0.893) or sex (F=0.41, p=0.743) were not significant indicating that the association of age and sex with arteriolosclerosis did not vary across regions. Older age but not sex was associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis in all regions, (Table e-3). These findings provided support to include terms for age at death, sex, region of arteriolosclerosis assessment in the core models, but not interaction terms for age and sex with region of arteriolosclerosis assessment. In subsequent models, we examined associations of each CVD-RF with CNS arteriolosclerosis in separate models.

Blood pressure.

In a mixed effects model, we examined the association of SBP with the arteriolosclerosis severity including terms for the interaction between SBP and region of arteriolosclerosis (Table 3-Model 1). In this model, the interaction term between SBP and region of arteriolosclerosis was significant (p=0.011) indicating that the association of SBP with the severity of arteriolosclerosis differed across regions. A higher level of SBP was associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis only in basal ganglia and not in any of the other regions examined.

Next, we examined the association of DBP with the severity of arteriolosclerosis. The interaction term between DBP and region of arteriolosclerosis was significant (p=0.032) indicating that the association of DBP with arteriolosclerosis differed across regions. A higher level of DBP was associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis in basal ganglia, frontal white matter, and parietal white matter regions, but not with the severity of arteriolosclerosis in the spinal cord (Table 3-Model 2).

As SBP and DBP were correlated (Spearman r = 0.56, p&lt;0.001), we examined association of SBP and DBP with arteriolosclerosis in one model to test if BP variables were independently associated with the arteriolosclerosis severity (Table 3-Model 3). As results, the association of DBP with arteriolosclerosis did not change. However, SBP was not associated with arteriolosclerosis in basal ganglia anymore and was inversely associated with arteriolosclerosis in parietal white matter indicating less severe arteriolosclerosis at higher SBP levels. These findings suggest that it is mainly DBP that is driving the association of hypertension with more severe arteriolosclerosis.

We also examined whether the association of SBP and DBP with arteriolosclerosis changed after controlling for the use of antihypertensive medications. Controlling for antihypertensive medications did not change the associations of SBP and DBP with arteriolosclerosis (Table e-4).

DM.

We replaced blood pressure variables with DM in the mixed models to examine the association of DM with the severity of arteriolosclerosis. The interaction term between DM and region of arteriolosclerosis was significant (p=0.013) indicating that the association of DM with arteriolosclerosis varied across different regions. The presence of DM was associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis in frontal white matter (OR=2.39, 95%CI: 1.39 – 4.11, p=0.002) but not in any of the other regions (Table 3-Model 4). The association of DM with arteriolosclerosis in frontal white matter did not change after controlling for the use of insulin and oral antidiabetic medications (Table e-5).

Blood lipids.

We replaced DM with serum measures of LDL-C and HDL-C and TG. Neither of the lipid measures were associated with arteriolosclerosis at any of the examined regions (Table 3-Model 5).

BMI.

In a mixed effects model, we examined the association of BMI with the severity of arteriolosclerosis by including terms for the interaction between BMI and the different CNS regions. While association of BMI with arteriolosclerosis varied across regions (P=0.030), BMI was not significantly associated with severity of arteriolosclerosis in any of the regions. (Table 3-Model 6).

A U-shaped association has been reported between BMI and some late-life phenotypes such as cognitive impairment[10, 25]. Therefore, we constructed a categorical BMI variable to test nonlinear association of BMI with the severity of arteriolosclerosis. We used tertiles of BMI (t1=23.9; t2=27.4) for constructing a 3-level variable, with the middle category as the reference BMI level. Then, in a mixed effects model we examined the association of BMI with the arteriolosclerosis severity including 2 terms for the low and high BMI categories and their interaction with regions of arteriolosclerosis. In this analysis (Table e-6), only low BMI was associated with a higher odd of more severe arteriolosclerosis in basal ganglia (OR=1.78, 95%CI: 1.06 – 2.97, p=0.029), which was similar to the direction of the association using a continuous measure of BMI (Table 3-Model 6).

Smoking.

We employed the same modeling described above to examine whether a history of smoking was associated with the severity of arteriolosclerosis in different regions. History of smoking was not associated with the severity of arteriolosclerosis in any of the 4 regions (Table 3-Model 7).

Sensitivity analyses

We separately applied Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR)[4] on the 4 P-values of the associations of each CVD-RF with arteriolosclerosis in the 4 CNS regions to reduce inflation of Type-I error due to multiple testing. The FDR correction did not change the main findings of the study (Table e-7).

We standardized the CVD-RFs to compare their associations with the severity of arteriolosclerosis in all 4 CNS regions in a single model. The results from this single model were similar to the separate models described above (Figure 5 - Table e-8).

In a prior study, we found that neocortical tau tangles were associated with arteriolosclerosis in parietal white matter[24]. In 3 separate mixed effects models, we examined associations of total brain, mesial temporal, and neocortical tau tangles with arteriolosclerosis in the 4 CNS regions. Only neocortical tau tangles had a borderline association with arteriolosclerosis in parietal white matter (Table e-9). Then, we examined associations of CVD-RFs with arteriolosclerosis controlled for neocortical tau tangles and its interaction with region of arteriolosclerosis assessment. The analysis indicated that controlling for neocortical tau tangles did not change our findings (Table e-10).

WMH in association with arteriolosclerosis and CVD-RFs

In 35% (n=137) of participants, brain hemispheres were examined with MRI ex vivo before autopsy procedures. Severe (n=63) and moderate (n=53) levels of WMH were more common than none/mild level (n=21). We examined associations of CNS arteriolosclerosis with WMH. In an ordinal logistic regression with WMH severity levels as the outcome and controlled for age at death and sex, more severe arteriolosclerosis in basal ganglia was associated with more severe WMH (OR=2.18, 95%CI: 1.37–3.47, p=0.001), but no association was found between arteriolosclerosis in frontal white matter (OR=1.21, 95%CI: 0.84–1.73, p=0.308), parietal white matter (OR=0.95, 95%CI: 0.65–1.40, p=0.808), or spinal cord (OR=1.38, 95%CI: 0.92–2.08, p=0.116) with WMH. Next, we examined associations of all CVD-RFs with WMH in a single ordinal logistic regression. Only DBP had a borderline association with WMH (OR=1.05, 95%CI: 0.99–1.12, p=0.093) (Table e-11). These findings underscore the importance of developing better brain imaging markers for microvascular pathologies like arteriolosclerosis[54].

CVD-RFs and CAA

CAA is another pathological cause of small vessel disease in brain. As a comparison, we examined associations of CVD-RFs with CAA. Moderate to severe CAA was present in 137 (35%) participants and was more common in participants with AD pathological diagnosis [44% (115/261) vs. 17% (22/129), χ2=27.6, DF=1, p&lt;0.001]. In an ordinal logistic regression controlled for age at death and sex, none of CVD-RFs were associated with CAA (Table e-12), a finding in line with our previous studies that did not find Framingham general cardiovascular risk score associated with CAA[36] or AD pathology indices[33].

DISCUSSION

This study analyzed a unique dataset of about 400 older decedents with antemortem CVD-RFs and postmortem assessments of arteriolosclerosis in 3 brain locations and 4 spinal cord levels. We found that the severity of arteriolosclerosis in different CNS regions varied and that CVD-RFs were not related to the severity of arteriolosclerosis in the spinal cord and had heterogenous associations with the severity of arteriolosclerosis across brain locations. Further studies will be needed to advance our understanding of the biology of arteriolosclerosis in different locations and to determine if there are location-specific risk factors for arteriolosclerosis. These studies can advance potential targeted interventions in different locations leading to precision medicine treatments that can reduce arteriolosclerosis in aging adults.

Framing the Current Findings

Prior work by our group examined arteriolosclerosis in 1 or 2 CNS locations and did not study arteriolosclerosis heterogeneity or its associations with CVD-RFs. For example, we found that arteriolosclerosis in spinal cord was independently associated with motor impairment in older adults when controlling for arteriolosclerosis in a single brain location (basal ganglia)[11]. However, this prior study did not examine the extent to which the severity of arteriolosclerosis and its association with CVD-RFs varied in multiple locations in brain and spinal cord due to its smaller sample size and focus on one brain location.

Arteriolosclerosis Varies in different CNS locations

The current study extends our prior work in several important ways to determine if the severity of arteriolosclerosis in different CNS locations varies. By examining a larger group of older adults and comparing arteriolosclerosis in 3 brain locations and 4 spinal cord levels, we found that severity of arteriolosclerosis varies in different CNS locations. In the spinal cord, arteriolosclerosis in different levels of the cord were moderately to highly correlated supporting the use of a single summary measure for the severity of spinal arteriolosclerosis in an individual. However, spinal arteriolosclerosis showed either no correlations or weak correlations with the severity of brain arteriolosclerosis. Moreover, within different examined brain locations, only the severity of arteriolosclerosis in frontal and parietal white matter showed moderate correlations while the basal ganglia arteriolosclerosis was only modestly correlated with frontal and parietal white matter arteriolosclerosis. In fact, the presence of more severe arteriolosclerosis was not uniformly distributed across multiple locations in the brain and spinal cord and did not show a hierarchical distribution from a single location, e.g., basal ganglia, expanding to other locations[46].

Risk Factors and Arteriolosclerosis

The current study also provides novel findings that may have potential clinical consequences about the relationship of CVD-RFs with arteriolosclerosis in different CNS locations. No significant association was seen between CVD-RFs and spinal arteriolosclerosis. High blood pressure was the only CVD-RF associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis in all 3 brain locations. These findings underscore the importance of public health efforts targeting reduction of hypertension to reduce brain small vessel disease that is associated with cognitive and motor impairment. However, in controlling blood pressure as a potential treatment for small vessel disease in the brain, it may be important to focus on treatment of DBP rather than SBP. In fact, our point estimates (Table 2) indicate that a higher stage of high blood pressure[53], corresponding to a 10-mmHg higher DBP, was associated with 40% to 60% higher odds of a more severe arteriolosclerosis level in the brain, highlighting the effect of DBP on brain arteriolosclerosis. However, future pathological studies will be needed to replicate our findings and to determine if the arteriolosclerosis is reversible by controlling blood pressure in older adults.

In separate models, higher levels of both DBP and SBP were associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis in brain. In contrast, SBP was not related to more severe arteriolosclerosis when controlling for DBP in a single model. This finding may suggest a dominant role for DBP compared with SBP in the association of blood pressure with arteriolosclerosis. One potential reason for the dominant role for higher levels of DBP in the association with arteriolosclerosis is that more than half of cerebral perfusion occurs during diastole[43]. This suggestion needs to be tested in future studies.

The results of the current study are similar to those reported in a recent mendelian randomization study that found genetic susceptibility to SBP and DBP to be associated with imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease when examined in separate models[45]. However, in a multivariate mendelian randomization analysis including proxies for both DBP and SBP, genetic susceptibility to DBP showed a dominant association with small vessel disease[45].

DM was associated with arteriolosclerosis in only one brain location (frontal white matter). We did not find any association between arteriolosclerosis and high cholesterol or TG. This finding is consistent with our recent study in which we found that statins were associated with a lower burden of intracranial atherosclerosis, but not basal ganglia arteriolosclerosis[35]. If these findings duplicated in further studies, these results highlight the need for further work to identify vascular risk factors that show stronger and location-specific associations with arteriolosclerosis and other microvascular pathologies in the CNS.

Imaging

Important knowledge gaps about the distribution, biology, and risk factors of arteriolosclerosis and other microvascular pathologies derive in part from the fact that current brain imaging markers of small vessel disease including indices of white matter tissue integrity, WMH, and lacunar infarcts have not been validated across different populations and settings. Several barriers impede the validation studies that are needed. It is difficult to ensure that antemortem brain imaging is obtained close to death, so the interval between brain imaging and death can vary from months to years. Moreover, it is also rare to have longitudinal cohorts of aging adults that obtain a) antemortem brain imaging, b) postmortem indices of multiple microvascular disease pathologies, and c) postmortem brain imaging that are crucial for validation of antemortem and postmortem imaging markers of small vessel disease.

Few studies have considered a range of both postmortem neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease pathologies together when trying to validate antemortem brain imaging markers of small vessel disease. For example, in a prior postmortem brain imaging study from our group, we found that more severe WMH was related to more Aβ plaques, macroscopic and microscopic infarcts, and more severe arteriolosclerosis in basal ganglia[1]. Similarly, postmortem studies have shown that some lacunar infarcts are related to atherosclerotic plaques in perforating arterioles or in the arteriole’s ostium in the parent artery, not related to arteriolosclerosis of the feeding arteriole[50]. These findings highlight that brain imaging measures of small vessel disease may be sensitive indicators of brain tissue damage from diverse causes and may not be specific for arteriolosclerosis or other microvascular disease pathologies. In the current study, more severe WMH was associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis in basal ganglia, but not in frontal or parietal white matter. These findings highlight the crucial importance of postmortem microscopic tissue studies in multiple locations for validation of the specificity of antemortem imaging biomarkers for the range of microvascular pathologies included under the rubric of small vessel disease[54].

Enlarged perivascular space (PVS) has been suggested as a brain imaging marker for small vessel disease[49]. In fact, a recently published study[13] found that while enlarged PVS in different brain regions had differential associations with risk factors, elevated DBP was consistently associated with enlarged PVS across all examined brain locations, similar to the findings in the current study. Hypertension may disrupt the blood brain barrier leading to the leakage of proteins that accumulate in the walls of small vessels and into the perivascular spaces. These leaked proteins may not only contribute to the development of arteriolosclerosis (see the mechanisms of arteriolosclerosis section below), but may also impair interstitial fluid (ISF) drainage contributing to dilated PVS[18, 48]. While some have reported associations between varied causes of small vessel disease and enlarged PVS[3, 52], we did find an association between basal ganglia arteriolosclerosis and enlarged PVS in the cohort analyzed in the current study[23]. Since enlarged PVS is likely multifactorial, larger and more diverse studies are required to investigate the specificity of enlarged PVS as a brain imaging marker for arteriolosclerosis. Moreover, because PVS and ISF drainage system may be also involved in drainage of waste products in the spinal cord[26], future studies should examine whether the heterogeneity of the severity of arteriolosclerosis in brain and spinal cord can be explained in part by differences in ISF drainage systems.

Mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of arteriolosclerosis

The diverse mechanisms that may underlie regional differences in the severity of arteriolosclerosis remain to be identified in further studies. The heterogeneity of arteriolosclerosis in different locations may be caused by differential vulnerability of CNS tissues to the development of arteriolosclerosis or by differences in the microenvironments of varied CNS locations. Blood pressure, as the most significant risk factor for brain arteriolosclerosis, is not distributed uniformly across brain regions[7]. In arterioles with the same diameter, blood pressure is higher when the arteriole is in basal ganglia than when is in deep cerebral hemispheres[7, 19], which can explain higher correlation between frontal white matter and parietal white matter arteriolosclerosis than their association with basal ganglia arteriolosclerosis. Endothelial failure including abnormalities of the blood-brain barrier may play an important role in the development of arteriolosclerosis[20, 51]. Cerebral autoregulation is responsible to protect the brain from dramatic changes in blood pressure and provide a relatively constant cerebral perfusion independent of peripheral blood pressure. At high SBP, brain’s small arteries constrict and prevent high blood pressure from affecting downstream smaller arterioles and capillaries. We hypothesize that longstanding vasoconstriction due to untreated hypertension results in downstream hypoperfusion and hypoxia in small arterioles. The hypoxia leads to impaired endothelial function and increased blood brain barrier permeability that causes accumulation of fluid and waste product in the arteriolar wall, causing arteriolar wall thickness and arteriolosclerosis. Moreover, a thickened less elastic arteriole with impaired endothelium can lead to a vicious cycle with increased hypoxia as a stiffened arteriole wall does not dilate and impaired endothelium does not release vasodilating signals including nitric oxide. This hypothesis may explain why arteriolosclerosis is more common in frontal and parietal white matter as blood pressure and perfusion in these locations are lower than in BG. Genetic studies have suggested other mechanisms underlying cerebral small vessel diseases including alterations in the structure and function of extracellular matrix, myelination, and membrane transport[9].

The hypothesis of hypoxia induced endothelial failure can also explain inverse associations between SBP and arteriolosclerosis in parietal white matter observed in this study. In posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome[14], vasogenic edema is more commonly observed in the parieto-occipital region, which is likely caused by less-developed cerebral autoregulation in the posterior circulation that leads to downstream transmission of high SBP and vasogenic edema. Similarly, we hypothesize that parietal white matter cerebral autoregulation is not well-developed and, hence, higher SBP is associated with more perfusion, less hypoxia, and less arteriolosclerosis in this location. Further studies will be needed to test this hypothesis.

Mechanisms that underlie arteriolosclerosis in the spinal cord may be different from that underlying brain arteriolosclerosis. Considering a possible role for impaired blood-brain barrier in causing brain arteriolosclerosis, impaired blood-spinal cord barrier, which includes pericytes and endothelial cells, may underlie spinal arteriolosclerosis. In fact, blood-spinal barrier is different from blood-brain barrier. Compared with brain, pericytes are less frequent in the spinal cord[56]. Moreover, spinal cord endothelial cells express reduced amounts of tight junctions’ proteins such as occludin and ZO1[17]. These differences may increase permeability of blood-spinal cord barrier compared to the blood brain barrier[55] and may make spinal cord vessels more vulnerable to arteriolosclerosis due to accumulation of toxic factors in the vessel walls. Another possible mechanism underlying spinal arteriolosclerosis is hypotension and hypoxia with downstream endothelial failure and arteriolosclerosis. Hypotension is a mechanism underlying spinal cord infarction[39]. Chronic spinal hypoxia as the mechanism of spinal cord arteriolosclerosis can explain the observed correlation between spinal cord and frontal white matter arteriolosclerosis and may also explain more frequent arteriolosclerosis in the posterior column[11] since its arterial supply has a smaller caliber [15] than the anterior column of the spinal cord. Other possible mechanisms include inflammation initiated by migration of immune cells and activated microglia[16] or by gut microbiome[31], and vascular smooth muscle degeneration [28]. Given the importance of spinal cord structures for movement, future studies will be needed to explore mechanisms underlying spinal cord arteriolosclerosis.

Study strengths and limitations

This study has several strengths. The data came from a well-characterized longitudinal study with a high autopsy rate. Arteriolosclerosis was assessed using the same validated semi-quantitative scale employed in several predetermined CNS locations in both the brain and spinal cord regions rarely examined in prior studies. Multiple CVD-RFs were assessed longitudinally over an average 9 years that helped us develop variables more representative of cumulative effects of these risk factors. However, several limitations should be noted. The study participants were volunteers mostly highly-educated Whites of European descent, requiring replication of the study findings in more diverse populations. Severity of arteriolosclerosis was determined using semiquantitative assessments on traditional stains. It will be important in future studies to use quantitative and molecularly specific vascular metrics. Additional CNS tissues including brainstem and cerebellum should also be examined for arteriolosclerosis. The study did not include longitudinal assessments of arteriolosclerosis in each participant limiting our inference about temporal order of CVD-RFs and arteriolosclerosis. The development of in-vivo longitudinal biomarkers of arteriosclerosis[29] during life will help in inference about temporal order of occurrence of CVD-RFs and small vessel disease and in translation of findings from decedents to living older adults. We did not have more granular metrics of CVD-RFs including pack-years of smoking or when an individual quit smoking, which may underlie lack of association between smoking history and arteriolosclerosis in our study[38].
