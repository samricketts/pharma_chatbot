Aims:

The current study utilizes the adeno-associated viral gene transfer system in the CAMKIIα-tTA mouse model to overexpress human wild type TDP-43 (wtTDP-43) and α-synuclein (α-Syn) proteins. The co-existence of these proteins is evident in the pathology of neurodegenerative disorders such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Parkinson disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

Methods:

The novel bicistronic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) serotype 9 drives wtTDP-43 and α-Syn expression in the hippocampus via “TetO” CMV promoter. Behavior, electrophysiology, and biochemical and histological assays were used to validate neuropathology.

Results:

We report that overexpression of wtTDP-43 but not α-Syn contributes to hippocampal CA2–specific pyramidal neuronal loss and overall hippocampal atrophy. Further, we report a reduction of hippocampal long-term potentiation and decline in learning and memory performance of wtTDP-43 expressing mice. Elevated wtTDP-43 levels induced selective degeneration of Purkinje cell protein 4 (PCP-4) positive neurons while both wtTDP-43 and α-Syn expression reduced subsets of the glutamate receptor expression in the hippocampus.

Conclusions:

Overall, our findings suggest the significant vulnerability of hippocampal neurons toward elevated wtTDP-43 levels possibly via PCP-4 and GluR-dependent calcium signaling pathways. Further, we report that wtTDP-43 expression induced selective CA2 subfield degeneration, contributing to the deterioration of the hippocampal-dependent cognitive phenotype.

Introduction

Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is an mRNA regulatory protein implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and FTLD spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases (Arai et al., 2006; Davidson et al., 2007; Kabashi et al., 2008; Mackenzie et al., 2007; Neumann et al., 2007). Although the implications are as of yet unclear, TDP-43 positive inclusions are also present in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Chang et al., 2016; Josephs et al., 2014; Uryu et al., 2008) and α-synucleinopathies; Parkinsonism dementia (Geser et al., 2008; Hasegawa et al., 2007), multi-system atrophy (MSA), and hippocampal sclerosis (Aoki et al., 2015; Higashi et al., 2007). Interestingly, regions in the limbic system, such as the amygdala and hippocampus, commonly vulnerable to synucleinopathy and tauopathy demonstrated extensive TDP-43 pathology in AD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients (Higashi et al., 2007). Additionally, the co-localization of TDP-43 and α-Syn in glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) were demonstrated in 2 out of 5 cases with MSA (Koga and Dickson, 2018), suggesting plausible interactions between both proteins. However, despite the established vulnerability of motor neurons to TDP-43 pathology (Neumann et al., 2007; Walker et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2015), less is known regarding its effect on hippocampal neuronal activity and memory formation in spite of memory loss and social dysfunction present in patients with dementia (Beeldman et al., 2016; Neary et al., 2000). Indeed, the TDP-43 pathology was first noted in the hippocampus of patients with ALS and FTLD-TDP-43, and hippocampal sclerosis cases (Nag et al., 2015; Neumann et al., 2007). Importantly, TDP-43 pathology was recently introduced as a primary pathology of a subset of aged patients with or without hippocampal sclerosis, denoted as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) (Nelson et al., 2019).

In this study, we investigated the overexpression of human α-Syn and wtTDP-43 on hippocampal plasticity and activity utilizing the CAMKIIα-tTA mouse model. We report the feasibility of a novel rAAV gene delivery system to overexpress the α-Syn and wtTDP-43 in CAMKIIα-tTA mice. This system can dually and regionally drive TDP-43 or α-Syn expression together with green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression under the tetracycline response element (TRE) promoter using a novel bicistronic recombinant adeno-associated virus construct. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated delivery of relevant proteins into neurons via rAAV–serotype 9 (rAAV-9) in novel animal models of pathology (Carty et al., 2013; Hunt et al., 2015; Nash et al., 2013; Selenica et al., 2016). Here, we report that overexpression of wtTDP-43 contributes to CA2–specific pyramidal neuronal loss and hippocampal atrophy. We identified, for the first time, selective susceptibility of CA2-specific Purkinje Cell Protein 4 (PCP-4) expressing neurons, reduced hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), as well as declined hippocampal associative learning and memory performance in wtTDP-43 expressing mice. Moreover, we demonstrated the effect of α-Syn and wtTDP-43 overexpression on the downregulation of different glutamate receptors subsets (GluR1–4) but not NMDA. Taken together, our data suggest a role of TDP-43 in impairment of hippocampal plasticity, possibly through the dysregulation in the glutamatergic and PCP-4 regulated Ca2+ homeostasis. These pathways grant further investigations as a potential target for neurodegenerative diseases with TDP-43 proteinopathy.

Materials and Methods

Animals

129S6.Cg-Tg (CamkIIα-tTa)1Mmay/JlwsJ (stock no. 016198) mouse line expressing the tetracycline-controlled transactivator protein (tTA) under the control of the forebrain-specific calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAMKIIα) was purchased from Jackson Laboratories, USA. The bicistronic AAV vector construct was used to regulate GFP expression under the chicken β-actin (CBA) promoter, while wtTDP-43 or α-Syn expression was regulated by the TRE and cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Upon viral injection, the presence of CAMKIIα/tTA in mice regulated viral TDP-43/ α-Syn gene expression, while GFP expression was controlled by CBA promoter in the same neuron (Figure 1A).

Virus Preparation

GFP cDNA was cloned downstream of the minimal CBA promoter followed by an SV40 poly A and Tet-O with minimal CMV promoter (pMin CMV, Figure 1A). Tet-O promoter was kindly provided by Ron Mandel (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, US). The TDP-43 and α-Syn were cloned into rAAV9 vectors under the control of pMin CMV Delta promoters. rAAV9 vectors were generated and purified as previously described (Carty et al., 2010). AAV particles were expressed as vector genomes/ml (vg/ml) and quantitated using a modified version of the dot blot protocol (Nash et al., 2008), using a non-radioactive biotinylated probe for GFP generated by PCR. The bound biotinylated probe was detected with IRDye 800CW (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) and quantitated on the Li-Cor Odyssey (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).

Injection procedure

AAV-GFP, AAV-Tet-O-α-Syn, and AAV-Tet-O-wtTDP-43 were injected using convection-enhanced delivery (CED) intracranial injections into the hippocampus of CAMKIIα-tTA mice 10 to12 months of age. Mice were weighed and bilaterally injected in the CA1 with 2μL of each virus (8.3×1012, n=6) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. The injection coordinates of CA1 from the bregma were as follows: anteroposterior −4.0 mm, lateral +/−3.5mm, dorsoventral −3.0 mm using the Stoelting Digital Lab Standard stereotaxic apparatus. All mice underwent behavior assessment and tissue was collected for electrophysiology and biochemical analysis as described in Figure 1A top panel.

Behavior testing

Behavioral analysis was carried out as previously described (Alamed et al., 2006; Brownlow et al., 2014; Selenica et al., 2014). Mice (n=6/group) were handled by the same experimenter to monitor body weight throughout the experiment and habituate mice with the experimenter.

Two-Day Radial Arm Water Maze (RAWM).

In this task, mice learned to use extra-maze spatial cues to locate the escape platform (Alamed et al., 2006). On day one, mice were given 15 trials, where every 3 trials were averaged into one block (5 blocks total) alternating between a visible platform (above the water) and a hidden platform (below the water). The next day they were given 15 additional trials (5 blocks) with all trials using a hidden platform. The goal arm location for sequential mice was different to avoid odor cues. Incorrect arm entries or failure to select an arm in 15 sec were counted as errors.

Radial Arm Water Maze Reversal.

This test was performed under similar conditions on the third day and directly after the RAWM performance. The goal arm was positioned 180° from the original location. This task tested the ability of the mice to extinguish a learned memory to create a novel one. All 15 trials were performed with a hidden platform. For both tests, the average and the total number of errors for each trial were calculated to assess learning and working memory. Finally, on the fourth day, all animals were tested in the open pool task with a visible platform to ensure all mice could see and climb on the platform. The visible platform was elevated above the water surface and had an attached flag. Latency to find and ascend the platform was recorded (60 seconds maximum).

Electrophysiology recordings

Following behavioral testing, a cohort of mice (n=2/group, 14 slices/ hippocampus), was euthanized and the hippocampi dissected for LTP recording as described in Trotter et al. (Trotter et al., 2013). The brain was rapidly dissected and placed in ice-cold, oxygenated, cutting solution containing: 110 mM sucrose, 60 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 28 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM glucose, 0.6 mM ascorbate, 7 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM CaCl2. Hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared on a vibratome and allowed to equilibrate in a 50% cutting saline and 50% artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) solution containing: 125 NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM glucose, 1 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM CaCl2. Slices were maintained with a constant 95% O2/5% CO2 perfusion for 10 min before being transferred to the brain slice recording chamber supported by nylon mesh or maintained in a holding container. Slices were recovered for a minimum of 1 h before recording. The recording chamber was held at 30° ± 0.5 °C with an ACSF flow rate of 1 ml/min. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from the stratum radiatum in hippocampal area CA1 via glass microelectrodes filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (resistance 1–4 MΩ). Responses were generated by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals arising from the CA3 region. Stimulating electrodes consisting of formvar-coated nichrome wire delivered biphasic stimulus pulses (1–15 V, 100 μs duration, 0.05 Hz). The delivery of stimulation, controlled by pClamp 9.0 software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA), was via the Digidata 1322A interface (Molecular Devices) and a stimulus isolator (model 2200; A-M Systems, Sequim, WA). Signals were amplified using a differential amplifier (model 1800; A-M Systems), filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. For all experiments, baseline stimulus intensity was set at the level that elicited ~50% of the maximum fEPSP response as determined from the input-output curve. The input-output relationship was determined by stimulating slices from 0 to 15 mV at 0.5 mV increments. LTP was induced by a theta-burst stimulation (TBS) protocol, which consists of two trains of four pulse bursts at 100 Hz separated by 200 ms, repeated six times with an intertrain interval of 10 s. For analysis, the last 10 min of the recording were averaged and compared.

Tissue collection

Two-months post intracranial injections, the mice were weighed, overdosed with pentobarbital (200 mg/kg), and perfused with 25 ml of 0.9% normal saline solution. Following saline perfusion, the brains were removed and hemisected down the sagittal midline. One hemisphere was dissected and frozen with dry ice for biochemical studies. The second hemisphere was immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours and cryoprotected in successive incubations of 10%, 20%, and 30% solutions of sucrose for 24 hours in each solution. Subsequently, the fixed hemispheres were frozen on a cold stage and sectioned in the horizontal plane at 25 μm thickness using a sliding microtome. Tissue was stored in Dulbecco’s PBS with 10 mM sodium azide solution at 4°C.

Immunohistochemical procedures and analysis

Eight sections per mouse (n=6/group), 200 μm apart, were chosen for analysis using the immunohistochemical procedural methods described previously (Gordon et al., 2002). For each marker, floating sections from all animals were placed in multi-sample staining trays, and endogenous peroxidase was blocked (10% methanol, 10% H2O2 in PBS for 30 minutes). Tissue samples were permeabilized (with 0.2% lysine, 1% Triton X-100 in PBS solution) and incubated overnight in primary antibodies (also see supplementary table 2); anti-total TDP-43 (ProteinGroup, Inc, Rosemont, IL, USA); anti-PCP-4 and anti-NeuN antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (also see Supplementary Table 2). Sections were rinsed in PBS and then incubated in the corresponding biotinylated secondary antibody. Sections were then rinsed three times and incubated with the Vectastain® Elite® ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for enzyme conjugation. Finally, sections were developed using 0.05% diaminobenzidine, 0.5% Ni2+ and 0.03% H2O2 and then mounted onto slides, dehydrated, and coverslipped. Prior work with non-transgenic mice confirmed the specificity of the anti-TDP43 antibodies in CAMKIIα-tTA mice.

Stained sections were imaged using a Zeiss Mirax150 digital scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, GmbH Clinical, 07740 Jena, Germany). For quantification, the hippocampus was analyzed by using hue, saturation, and intensity for each image field. Thresholds for object segmentation were established with images of high and low levels of staining to identify positive staining over the intensity levels in the study. These limits were held constant for the analysis of every section in each study according to Gordon and colleagues (Gordon et al., 2002). The width of the CA2 hippocampal subfield was measured in micrometers, perpendicular to the edge of the layer. The edge of the layer was defined as the furthest visible cells continuous with the layer (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, GmbH Clinical, 07740 Jena, Germany).

Confocal Imaging and Analysis

For immunofluorescence, eight sections per mouse (n=6/group) at 200 μm apart, were stained as indicated above. Antibodies against total TDP-43 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and α-synuclein (BD Bioscience), phosphorylated S409/410 TDP-43 (ProteinGroup, Inc, Rosemont, IL, USA), phosphorylated serine (S)129 α-synuclein (Abcam) and anti-GFP (Abcam) were used. Sections were rinsed in PBS and then incubated in the corresponding secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor™488 and Alexa Fluor™ 594 and purchased from Invitrogen( Thermo Fischer Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Images presented in Figures 2 and 3 were obtained with an LSM 880 Carl Zeiss confocal microscope using immersion oil and the 40X and 63X lens objective. Images for each fluorophore were obtained by sequential scanning using two independent channels and corresponded to the average of eight frames. Images were merged and recovered using the ZEN microscope software. Co-localization analyses were carried out using Image J, and thresholding was kept constant across all pictures.

Western blot assay

Briefly, the dissected hippocampus was weighed and resuspended in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 140 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Tissue was homogenized with a motorized pestle followed by a brief (10 seconds) sonication pulse. Aliquots were collected at this point for biochemical analysis and referred to as brain homogenate. Pierce BCA protein assay (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to determine protein concentrations. For Western blot analysis, 20 μg of protein lysate was denatured in 5x sample buffer (100mMTris pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.1% Bromophenol blue, 20% glycerol, 200mM β mercaptoethanol) and run on a 4–20% Tris-Glycine gel at 120V for 2 hours. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (at 100V for 1 hour) and then incubated on blotting-grade blocker in 0.7% TritonX-100 PBS (TBST, pH 7.4, + 0.7% Tween) for 30 minutes. The membrane was rinsed in TBST and incubated with a primary antibody overnight. After three rinses, the membrane was incubated with HRP conjugated host-specific secondary antibody for 2 hours (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA). Following washing with TBST, the membrane was treated with ECL and protein expression was detected. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-human TDP-43 and anti-PCP-4 antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-total (human + mouse) TDP-43 (Proteintech Group Inc, Rosemont, IL, USA), anti-human α-synuclein (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and total α-synuclein (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Additionally, antibodies against glutamate receptors 1 and 3 were purchased from Cell Signaling (GluR1, GluR3, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). Glutamate receptor 2 and NMDA receptor(s) (NR1, NR2A, and NR2B) antibodies were purchased from Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA. The glutamate receptor 4 antibody was purchased from LSBio, Seatle, WA. Protein expression levels were normalized to either actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or GAPDH (Proteintech Group Inc, Rosemont, IL, USA) (Supplementary Table 2).

Stereology

Neurons were labeled with NeuN and cresyl violet and counted in the CA2 subfield of the hippocampus by outlining distinct landmarks in the brain using 4x magnification. This was done using a computerized stereological system, connected to a Leica DM4000B microscope with a prior motorized stage, which systematically designated areas on the subfield of interest using a 100x oil immersion lens. Neurons were only counted when randomly located within the three-dimensional dissectors or touching the inclusion lines. The stereological system also allowed the calculation of CA2 volume by measuring the average thickness of the tissue analyzed per mouse. The top and bottom 2 μm of tissues were excluded.

To measure hippocampal volume, evenly spaced hippocampi sections throughout the whole hippocampus of each mouse were outlined using NearCYTE software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, GmbH Clinical, 07740 Jena, Germany). The area of the hippocampus in each section was summed for each mouse and multiplied by the section thickness measured using the stereological system to determine the CA1-CA3 volume in the hippocampus. The tissue thickness was determined to be 12.78 ± 0.058 μm for all sections analyzed.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Fischer’s LSD post hoc means comparison test using Stat View software version 5.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC, US). Values are represented as the standard error of the mean (SEM) compared to control unless stated otherwise. P values were considered statistically significant as followed: *p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt; 0.01 and *** &lt; 0.001.

Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA). The average percent positive area values measured by immunohistochemistry were normalized to the GFP controls. Protein levels measured by Western blot were normalized to levels of either actin or GAPDH expression.

Results

wtTDP-43 expression reduces CAMKIIα-tTA mouse hippocampal LTP and associated learning and memory performance.

To test whether the elevated levels of α-Syn and wtTDP-43 in the CAMKIIα-tTA mouse hippocampus could cause a decline in hippocampal plasticity and activity, we designed a unique AAV9-TetO virus that, upon injection into CAMKIIα-tTA mice, allowed expression of α-Syn or wtTDP-43 in mouse. Viral expression in mice was allowed for 6 weeks followed by behavior testing for 2 weeks (Figure 1A). For behavior analysis, mice were tested for spatial navigation memory using the RAWM task as we previously described (Alamed et al., 2006; Selenica et al., 2014). GFP-expressing mice demonstrated normal learning and memory ability, measured as the average of errors, and achieved the criterion associated with optimal learning (&lt; 2 errors per trial) by the end of the second day of training (Figure 1B). Interestingly, CAMKIIα-tTA mice overexpressing α-Syn or wtTDP-43 showed no decline in learning the paradigm and similarly reached the criterion of ≤ 2 errors by the end of the second day (Figure 1B). However, the average of errors analysis made by each mouse during reversal RAWM demonstrated significant learning impairment of wtTDP-43 mice compared to GFP and α-Syn expressing mice (Figure 1C, **p&lt; 0.01). Considering the decline in learning and memory of the wtTDP-43 expressing mice, we performed electrophysiology analysis of LTP in a subset of experimental mice. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from stratum radiatum in CA1 pyramidal neurons and responses generated by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals of the CA3 region. Tetanic stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals resulted in robust LTP in slices from the GFP and α-Syn expressing mice correlating with the learning/memory test experiments. However, the hippocampi from wtTDP-43 expressing mice recorded impaired LTP maintenance for 60 min after the LTP induction (Figure 1D), as shown in the last 10 min analysis (Figure 1E, **p&lt; 0.01). These data indicate that elevated levels of wtTDP-43, but not α-Syn, significantly impair hippocampal plasticity and activity. To verify the hippocampal viral transduction, we performed immunohistochemistry assay using an antibody against GFP protein. We demonstrated overall hippocampal GFP expression with no significant difference between animals injected with AAV-GFP, α-Syn or wtTDP-43 constructs (Figure 1F, G).

Overexpression of wtTDP-43 induces hippocampal volume loss and CA2 neurotoxicity.

To investigate the effect of α-Syn and wtTDP-43 protein overexpression on hippocampal toxicity, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue stained with neuronal nuclei marker, NeuN, following cresyl violet staining (Figure 2A, B, C). Hippocampal volume, a measure of neurodegeneration in related disorders, was analyzed using stereological techniques previously reported (Selenica et al., 2014). We found overexpression of wtTDP-43, but not α-Syn, caused a significant reduction of hippocampal volume in injected animals (Figure 2D, *p&lt; 0.05). This was followed by selective degeneration of the neuronal layer in the CA2 subfield of wtTDP-43 injected mice. The stereological analysis demonstrated that volume and neuronal count of the CA2 subfield in wtTDP-43 animals were significantly decreased compared to GFP and α-Syn injected animals (Figure 2E, F, *p&lt; 0.05 and **p&lt; 0.01, respectively). As overexpression of α-Syn did not elicit measurable neuronal loss, we performed stereological analysis in the hippocampal subfields (CA1, CA2, CA3, and DG) of only wtTDP-43 and GFP injected mice. We found significant reduction in the volume of CA1 (injection site) and CA2 neuronal subfields following wtTDP-43 overexpression (Supplemental Table 1, *p&lt; 0.05 vs. **p&lt; 0.001). Together, these findings suggest a crucial role of wtTDP-43 in hippocampal degeneration and yet a specific vulnerability of CA2 neurons toward TDP-43 toxicity.

α-Syn and wtTDP-43 toxicity in the hippocampus of CAMKIIα-tTA mice.

Next, to further investigate the impact of each expressed protein on the neuronal loss observed in CA2 region we performed fluorescence labeling in GFP-transduced CA2 neurons (Figure 3A–C, and merged 3D). As expected, the co-localization of GFP with α-Syn was observed throughout the hippocampus, and especially in CA2 neuronal layer of α-Syn expressing mice (Figure 3E–G and merged 3H). Similarly, the expression of GFP and wtTDP-43 was also observed by confocal microscopy in the CA2 subfield of the injected CamKIIα-tTA mice (Figure 3I–K and merged 3L). When we analyzed the efficacy of rAAV transduction as the percent GFP/DAPI positive cells in the hippocampus, co-localization was in the range of 60% in α-Syn vs.70% in TDP-43 mice (Figure 3M). In control mice, we found 90% GFP transduction efficacy, which was comparable with previous reports (St Martin et al., 2007). Next, we quantified the AF594/DAPI fluorescence intensity and found DAPI positive neurons expressed 38% α-Syn vs. 44% wtTDP-43 (Figure 3N). Interestingly, wtTDP-43 expressing CA2 neurons displayed morphological changes compared to GFP and α-Syn expressing neurons (Figure 3I–L vs. 3A–D and 3E–H), supporting wtTDP-43-induced neurotoxicity (Figure 2) (Xu et al., 2010).

Phosphorylation of α-synuclein and TDP-43 in the hippocampus of CAMKIIα-tTA mice

Phosphorylation is a post-translational modification linked with the pathological profile of both proteinopathies (Masliah et al., 2000), (Liachko et al., 2010; Neumann et al., 2009). Therefore, we performed fluorescence confocal microscopy of tissue stained against phosphorylated S129 (α-Syn) or S409/410 (TDP-43) epitopes in GFP, α-Syn and wtTDP-43 injected mice (Figure 4). We found that GFP transduced neurons (Figure 4E, I, high magnification inserts, arrows) exhibited positivity for pS129 and pS409/410 in the cytoplasm of α-Syn and wtTDP-43 injected mice (Figure 4F, H, and J, L, arrow). Few wtTDP-43 positive neurons exhibited inclusion-like structures in the cytoplasm (Figure 4J, L merged insert, star). The phosphorylated proteins were co-localized with GFP expressing neurons in the hippocampus as measured by the Mander’s overlap coefficient (M2) between red and green pixel intensities in α-Syn and wtTDP-43 injected mice. As expected, the Mander’s overlap coefficient in the GFP injected mice was not significant (Figure 4M, GFP= 0.066 ± 0.0058, α-Syn=0.305 ± 0.0329 and wtTDP-43=0.116 ± 0078). These findings suggest that phosphorylation of both proteins was present in the transduced hippocampal neurons.

α-Syn and wtTDP-43 overexpression modulate the expression of glutamate receptors.

The disruption of synaptic plasticity evident in the TDP-43 overexpressing mice led us to biochemically investigate the effects of α-Syn and wtTDP-43 protein expression on postsynaptic membrane receptors α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPA receptor) glutamate receptor subunits 1,2,3 and 4 (GluR1, GluR2, GluR3 and GluR4, Figure 5A) and N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A and NR2B). Both AMPA and NMDA receptors subunits are found in abundance in the hippocampus and CA2 subfield (Zheng et al., 2013). We demonstrated a significant reduction of GluR1 and GluR2 levels upon the overexpression of both proteins compared to GFP control mice (Figure 5B, *p&lt; 0.05, **p&lt; 0.01 and ***p&lt; 0.001). We also showed wtTDP-43 overexpression prompted a significant reduction of GluR3 expression compared to GFP injected mice (Figure 5B, *p&lt; 0.05). Unlike the vast downregulation of AMPA receptors, we found no changes in the expression level of GluR4 or any of the NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A, NR2B) in mice. Further, despite fold increase in AAV-α-Syn and wtTDP-43 expression levels, we observed no change in total expression (exogenous + endogenous, Figure 5B, bottom panel). Combined with the LTP and behavior data, these biochemical findings strengthen a plausible role of wtTDP-43 toxicity via impairment of the glutamatergic activity.

Overexpression of wtTDP-43 but not α-Syn induces selective degeneration of PCP-4 positive neurons in CA2.

Neurotoxicity and the overall reduction in hippocampal volume of the CA2 subfield in wtTDP-43 mice led us to hypothesize that CA2 neurons show specific vulnerability toward TDP-43 toxicity. Evidence suggests PCP-4- expressing neurons are selective CA2 neuronal markers (San Antonio et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2001). PCP-4 is a calmodulin/Ca2+ signaling protein (San Antonio et al., 2014) implicated in the regulation of locomotor learning and synaptic plasticity of cerebellar Purkinje neurons (Wei et al., 2011). Indeed, when tissue from mice injected with GFP, α-Syn, and wtTDP-43 was stained with a specific PCP-4 antibody, we observed positive immunoreactivity in CA2, but not CA1 or CA3 subfields (Figure 6A, C, E). To note, we also obtained PCP-4 positive immunoreactivity in granule neurons of DG and subiculum. We demonstrated that wtTDP-43 dramatically diminished PCP-4 expression in the CA2 region in these mice (Figure 6E, F). Interestingly, α-Syn and GFP expressing mice, displayed neither toxicity nor changes in PCP-4 expression levels in the CA2 subfield (compare Figure 6F to 6B and 6D) suggesting a selective loss of PCP-4 positive neurons upon wtTDP-43 expression (Figure 6H, **p&lt; 0.01). Biochemical analysis utilizing the PCP-4 specific antibody further confirmed a significant reduction in PCP-4 expression following wtTDP-43 overexpression compared to α-Syn or GFP treated mice (Figure 6G, I, ***p&lt; 0.001). Notably, neither α-Syn nor GFP expression affected the biochemical levels of PCP-4 protein in the hippocampus.

3. Discussion

In the current study, we present evidence that overexpression of human wtTDP-43 by AAV9 gene-targeted approach results in hippocampal toxicity and degeneration, impaired synaptic plasticity and behavior performance. Our results are the first to demonstrate a potential mechanism of TDP-43 pathology through the reduction of PCP-4 levels leading to modified calcium homeostasis. Additionally, the wtTDP-43 induced reduction in the GluR1, GluR2 and GluR3 levels in the hippocampus suggest that modifications in the glutamate receptor levels interrupted hippocampal function and synaptic plasticity in this model. Interestingly, hippocampal glutamate receptor dysfunction can interfere with the resistance of CA2 neurons to generate LTP (Merritt et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2016). We also report that overexpression of α-synuclein, a protein implicated in Parkinsonism related dementia (Baba et al., 1998; Spillantini et al., 1997), induced phosphorylation at S129 epitope localized in the cytoplasm of the CA2 hippocampal neurons. Similarly, we identified the expression of α-Syn in 38% of hippocampal neurons, which led to a significant reduction of GluR1 and GluR2 levels in this model. In contrast, one study reported increased GluR1 expression corresponded to subsequent Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and impaired LTP in rat hippocampal slices treated with α-Syn oligomers (Diógenes et al., 2012). Another study further expanded on the notion that upregulation in AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission and intracellular calcium dyshomeostasis in cortical culture neurons treated with α-Syn oligomers (Hüls et al., 2011). Here, we report significant downregulations of GluR1 and GluR2 in mice overexpressing human α -Syn without impairment in LTP induction in expressing mice. It is possible that the difference in the experimental models used (primary cultures vs. animal model), as well as α-Syn protein species, could be responsible for some of the discrepancies. For example, we did not observe α-Syn oligomers or higher molecular weight proteins in our western blot analysis (data not shown).

The present work is based on the AAV-9 “Tet-Off” vector-based system utilizing the transgenic expression of tetracycline-controlled transactivator protein (tTA) under the CamkIIα promoter in mice. Following the cerebral administration of AAV-9 vector, mouse tTA binding to the tetracycline transactivator responsive promoter element (TRE) allows expression of human wild-type α-Syn or TDP-43 proteins. Following this gene delivery approach, we recapitulated features of TDP-43 toxicity in CAMKIIα-tTA mouse hippocampus. We also demonstrated the presence of pS409/410 wtTDP-43 in CA2 neurons as well as few cytoplasmic inclusion-like structures of transfected neurons, reminiscent of the pathology found in human ALS or FTLD-TDP-43 brain (Inukai et al., 2008; Mackenzie et al., 2007; Neumann et al., 2007). Indeed, the dual phosphorylation of TDP-43 at S409/410 epitopes can drive neurotoxicity in several disease models (Liachko et al., 2010; Liachko et al., 2014). Further, and in agreement with our findings, the toxicity of human wtTDP-43 protein was previously demonstrated in models of TDP-43 proteinopathies including yeast (Johnson et al., 2008), human cancer (Zhu et al., 2015), mouse (Wils et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2010), and rat models (Tatom et al., 2009). However, human studies describe a link between TDP-43 proteinopathy and impairment in hippocampal function, where hippocampal shrinkage and neuronal loss are sensitive markers of aging in the healthy population and neurodegeneration (Abdulla et al., 2014; Amador-Ortiz et al., 2007; Dickson et al., 2007; Frisoni et al., 2010; Hokkanen et al., 2018). Only a few rodent models have demonstrated the role of TDP-43 protein in the modulation of synaptic plasticity and spatial working memory (Gulino et al., 2015; Pintus et al., 2018; Tsai et al., 2010). Considering the clinical presentation of TDP-43 pathology, we aimed to investigate the direct impact of wtTDP-43 overexpression on hippocampal plasticity and function. We provide evidence that expression of wtTDP-43 is sufficient to directly cause neuronal loss in CA1-CA2 subfields, the overall reduction in hippocampal volume and selective degeneration of the PCP-4 positive neurons in the CA2 neuronal layer. PCP-4, a selective marker for CA2 (San Antonio et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2001), is a calmodulin-binding protein (Cam) implicated in regulating association and dissociation of Ca2+ to Cam (Chin and Means, 2000; Putkey et al., 2008). This process is crucial to many signaling cascades and an important mediator of learning and memory (Bekinschtein et al., 2007; Katche et al., 2013; Torralva et al., 2007). It is suggested that CA2 neurons make strong unitary connections with CA1 neurons and regulate long-term synaptic plasticity (Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010; Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014). Lesions in the CA2 region or the PCP-4 knock out mouse model exhibit impaired locomotor learning, social memory, and markedly altered synaptic plasticity (Carstens et al., 2016; Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010; Wei et al., 2011). In agreement, we found reduced LTP and learning deficits in mice with elevated levels of wtTDP-43, followed by diminished PCP-4 expression in CA2 in injected CamKIIα-tTA . The impact of TDP-43 on hippocampal neuronal dysfunction is consistent with a recent report regarding human wtTDP-43 effects on hippocampal activity utilizing a similar AAV-gene delivery tool and transgenic animal model (Tsai et al., 2010). The authors demonstrated that TDP-43 overexpression in the forebrain of CAMKII-tTa mice elicits impaired learning/memory, reduction in plasticity cascade proteins, and hippocampal atrophy in an FTLD mouse model.

We further aimed to investigate other forms of proteinopathy by introducing the overexpression of human wild-type α-Syn protein (Alafuzoff et al., 2008; Alafuzoff et al., 2009; Parkkinen et al., 2008). This protein plays a crucial role in synaptic maintenance and dopamine metabolism and is found in inclusions associated with PD (Baba et al., 1998; Spillantini et al., 1997). Viral vector-mediated α-Syn overexpression models in rats display 20 to 80% dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra (SN), depending on the study and the serotype used (Decressac et al., 2012; Georgievska et al., 2002; Kirik et al., 2002). These models exhibit other hallmarks of PD such as α-Syn-positive inclusions and the presence of a phosphorylated form of α-Syn at serine 129 (S129) in SN, similar to human brain pathology (Anderson et al., 2006). Indeed, α-Syn overexpression studies demonstrate protein aggregation and progressive neurodegeneration (Masliah et al., 2000; Oliveras-Salva et al., 2013; Rockenstein et al., 2002). Intriguingly, other studies using similar rAAV-α-Syn gene therapy approaches report no or very limited dopaminergic neuron loss, and lack of α-Syn-positive inclusions 2–6 months after viral injections in mice (St Martin et al., 2007; Ulusoy and Di Monte, 2013). Consistent with the aforementioned studies, we report that hippocampal overexpression of α-Syn for 2 months in CamKIIα-tTA mice did not yield hippocampal degeneration at any of the measured parameters. However, we demonstrated regional phosphorylation and significant downregulation of GluR1 and GluR2 expression, but not PCP-4 or NMDA receptor levels. We were also unable to identify any toxicity associated with the overexpression of α-Syn, which could simply testify for the inconsistency of rAAV-α-Syn strategies employed and differences in animal models between our study and models discussed.

Overall, our data suggest that overexpression of wtTDP-43 significantly reduces CA2 selective PCP-4 expression and is sufficient to induce neurodegeneration, an effect absent in the α-Syn overexpressing animal cohort. Because metabotropic glutamate receptors are crucial mediators of calcium-mediated cellular homeostasis and glutamate receptor dysfunction interferes with Ca2+ dependent neuronal plasticity (Lau and Tymianski, 2010; Niswender et al., 2010), we propose that TDP-43 toxicity is likely dependent on the AMPA and the downstream PCP-4 regulated Ca2+ homeostasis rather than solely AMPA receptor signaling. It remains to be elucidated the exact mechanism by which these pathways and specifically PCP-4 regulates TDP-43 pathology, and how this target molecule affects the synaptic transmission, neuronal activity, and behavior performance in TDP-43 proteinopathy disorders. Further investigation of such a pathway may provide novel therapeutic targets for TDP-43 proteinopathies.
