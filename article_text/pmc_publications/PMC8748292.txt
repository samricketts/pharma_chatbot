Introduction:

Discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) has increased in recent years. Yet, it is unclear whether this trend extends to patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementia (ADRD), a population with high prevalence of undertreated pain.

Methods:

Medicare data from 2011 to 2018 were analyzed to compare trends in use and discontinuation of LTOT (at least 3 months) between 162,099 patients with and 952,475 patients without ADRD who had chronic noncancer pain. Outcome measures were annual proportions of: (1) patients who received LTOT and (2) LTOT users who subsequently discontinued opioids for 30, 60, or ≥90 days during 12-month follow-up. All analyses were performed in 2021.

Results:

Use of LTOT decreased from 2011 to 2017 in both the ADRD and non-ADRD groups. In LTOT users, discontinuation of opioids for 30, 60, and ≥90 days increased by 8% (95% CI=1.04, 1.12, p&lt;0.001), 13% (95% CI=1.06, 1.20, p&lt;0.001), and 18% (95% CI=1.10, 1.28, p&lt;0.001), respectively, between 2011 and 2017 among patients with ADRD, whereas the proportion was largely declining or unchanged among patients without ADRD. Differences in LTOT discontinuation by ADRD status widened over time (p&lt;0.01 for interaction).

Conclusion:

Discontinuation of LTOT was consistently higher in patients with ADRD than those with non-ADRD, with the gap between the 2 groups widening over time. Reasons for these differences and the risk–benefit of increased LTOT discontinuation among patients with ADRD warrant further investigation.


pmcINTRODUCTION

Chronic pain is common in Alzheimer disease and related dementia (ADRD) and is a risk factor for neuropsychiatric symptoms and further cognitive and functional decline.1 Owing to the lack of effective non-pharmacological interventions and presence of chronic comorbidities that contraindicate use of non-opioid analgesics, as high as 90% of people with ADRD and chronic pain use prescription opioids.2 Among opioid users with ADRD, half used long-term opioid therapy (LTOT; i.e., ≥3 months) for chronic pain management.3 However, recent U.S. guidelines aimed at curbing the opioid epidemic recommend discontinuation of LTOT when risks outweigh benefits.4,5 These recommendations have caused concerns about potential harms (e.g., uncontrolled pain and suicide) associated with stopping opioids among LTOT users.6,7 Opioid misuse and abuse are rare in ADRD,3 and discontinuing LTOT may worsen the longstanding issue of undertreated pain in this population.8 Although the LTOT discontinuation rate is increasing in Medicare populations,9,10 it is unclear to what extent LTOT use has changed for patients with ADRD and whether LTOT discontinuation differs between those with and without ADRD.

METHODS

Study Sample

This multiyear cross-sectional study analyzed a 5% Medicare sample from 2011 and 2018 to compare trends in use and discontinuation of LTOT among adults with versus without ADRD. Patients with ADRD were identified using a developed diagnostic algorithm for ADRD.11 The eligible sample included adults aged ≥50 years, the age at which prevalence of ADRD increases, who had a chronic pain diagnosis,3 had no diagnosis or procedures indicating cancer, hospice, or palliative care services,3 and survived with continuous enrollment in Medicare Parts A, B, and D for &gt;1 calendar year.

Measures

Outcome measures were use and discontinuation of LTOT. In each calendar year between 2011 and 2017, LTOT users were defined as having ≥1 opioid treatment episode lasting ≥90 days,12 with an allowable gap of &lt;30 days to account for delays in prescription fills. To ensure a consistent measure of LTOT use over time, only opioid prescriptions dispensed in a given year were used to define LTOT in that year. Opioids of interest were prescribed oral and transdermal formulations, excluding buprenorphine–naloxone combinations, which are indicated primarily for opioid use disorder or overdose treatment. Among LTOT users, an index date was designated as the 90th day of the first LTOT episode for each user in a given year to align the start date of ascertainment of opioid discontinuation, and the end date was 12 months after the index date. For each given year, the proportion of LTOT users who subsequently discontinued without opioid use for at least 30, 60, and 90 consecutive days, determined based on prescription fill date and days’ supply, during a 12-month follow-up was calculated. To ensure complete data capture of dispensed medications during the follow-up period, patients were required to survive with continuous Medicare enrollment. To avoid misclassification of opioid discontinuation in the follow-up, patients were further required to have no Medicare-covered inpatient or skilled nursing facility stay that was &gt;30 but &lt;100 consecutive days, during which dispending information is unavailable because of capitation-based reimbursement.3 A patient could contribute to more than a single 12-month period of observation if they met the eligibility criteria.

Statistical Analysis

A Modified Poisson regression model was used to assess: (1) time trends in the proportions of patients who received LTOT and proportions of LTOT users who discontinued opioids in the ADRD and non-ADRD group and (2) whether differences in proportions of LTOT discontinuation by ADRD status changed over time, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, and non–pain related comorbidities. Analyses were performed in 2021 using SAS, version 9.4. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05, with 2-tailed p-values. This study was approved by the University of Florida IRB.

RESULTS

The study included data from 162,099 eligible patients with ADRD and 952,475 patients without ADRD from 2011 through 2017. Overall, 15.2% of patients with ADRD and 14.6% of patients without ADRD received LTOT during the 7-year study period. The annual proportion of LTOT use decreased from 2011 to 2017 in both the ADRD (adjusted prevalence rate ratio [APRR]=0.90, 95% CI=0.87, 0.93, p&lt;0.001) and non-ADRD group (APRR=0.88, 95% CI=0.87, 0.89, p&lt;0.001) (Table 1), findings that are consistent with literature.13

Between 2011 and 2017, the proportion of LTOT users with ADRD who subsequently discontinued without opioid use for at least 30, 60, and 90 days during a 12-month follow-up after the index date increased by 8% (95% CI=1.04, 1.12), 13% (95% CI=1.06, 1.20), and 18% (95% CI=1.10, 1.28), respectively. Among users without ADRD, however, the proportion was declining or unchanged, with a slight increase (APRR=1.05, 95% CI=1.02, 1.08, p&lt;0.001) in discontinuation of opioids for ≥90 days. (Table 1)

Differences in LTOT discontinuation by ADRD status have widened over time (p&lt;0.001 for interaction for all 3 discontinuation measures), with the highest difference observed in 2016 (Figure 1A–C). By 2016, the APRR for opioid discontinuation of 30, 60, and ≥90 days was 1.04 (95% CI=1.01, 1.07), 1.11 (95% CI=1.06, 1.16), 1.19 (95% CI=1.13, 1.25) times, respectively, higher in LTOT users with ADRD than those without ADRD.

DISCUSSION

This study found that discontinuation of LTOT was consistently higher in patients with ADRD than those without ADRD from 2011 to 2017. The differences between the 2 groups widened over time, with the highest difference observed in 2016, the year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance to limit opioid prescribing, including LTOT, for chronic noncancer pain. The findings suggest that LTOT users with ADRD may have been affected more than their non-ADRD counterparts by recent national efforts to reduce LTOT prescribing.

Reasons for more LTOT users with ADRD undergoing opioid discontinuation are unclear. Patients with (versus without) ADRD may have more concern about opioid-related harms. Of the harms most relevant to ADRD is cognitive impairment, but evidence on the association between opioid use and cognitive function remains insufficient.14 Pain-related comorbid conditions such as falls/factures, more prevalent in the ADRD versus non-ADRD group,3 are listed by the U.S. federal government to warrant opioid discontinuation.5 Contrastingly, previously described concerns about undertreated pain associated with LTOT discontinuation warrant further investigation for patients with ADRD.15 Cognitive impairment strongly influences clinical decision for pain management.16 Recent literature suggests more than half of primary care doctors were uncertain about the safety of using opioids to treat pain in patients with ADRD.17 Thus, further research is needed to evaluate the clinical risk–benefit of increasing LTOT discontinuation among patients with ADRD.

Limitations

Medicare data lack information on potential clinical reasons (e.g., side effects of opioids and pain severity) and aberrant opioid-taking behaviors (e.g., illicit opioid use) that may add context to LTOT discontinuation. Information is unavailable about whether discontinuation was initiated by patients and their caregivers and the clinical appropriateness of LTOT discontinuation. Medicare prescription data do not capture self-paid prescriptions or opioids covered by non-Medicare programs. The results can be only generalized to patients who survived for ≥1 year.

CONCLUSIONS

An increasing proportion of LTOT users with ADRD underwent discontinuation of opioids as compared with their non-ADRD counterparts. Studies that investigate the impact of continuing versus discontinuing LTOT are warranted to inform optimal use and safe opioid prescribing practices in patients with ADRD.

Figure 1. Opioid discontinuation between long-term opioid therapy users with and without ADRD from 2011 to 2017

Notes: Figures 1A, 1B, and 1C show discontinuation of opioids for at least 30, 60, and 90 consecutive days, respectively, during a 12-month follow-up after the index date from 2011 to 2017. In each figure, the estimate in each calendar year represents the prevalence rate ratio (PRR) of opioid discontinuation between LTOT users with versus without ADRD (reference group). The gray line indicates a PRR=1.00, meaning the prevalence of opioid discontinuation does not differ between patients with and without ADRD. Error bars indicate 95% CI. The change in PRR over time was tested by including an interaction term of ADRD status (yes versus no) and continuous year variable, along with variables of ADRD status, year, age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, and non-pain-related comorbidities. The p for interaction was &lt;0.001 for Figures 1A and 1B and was 0.003 for Figure 1C.

b Estimates were adjusted for age in years (50–64, 65–74, 75–84, ≥85), sex, race/ethnicity (White, Black, Other), region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), and number of 9 Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW) comorbidities that are common among Medicare beneficiaries and not associated with pain (i.e., acquired hypothyroidism, acute myocardial infarction, anemia, asthma, atrial fibrillation, cataract, glaucoma, ischemic heart disease, stroke/transient ischemic attack), in a Modified Poisson regression model.

c The proportion was calculated with the number of patients who received LTOT in a given year (denominator) and the number of LTOT users who subsequently discontinued without opioid use at least 30, 60, or 90 days during the 12-month follow-up period after the index date (i.e., 90th day of the first LTOT episode in a given year) (numerator). A case who received LTOT in 2013 with a 12-month follow-up (from October 31, 2013, to October 31, 2014) contributed to the denominator in 2013, and the patients’ discontinuation of LTOT, if any, measured during the follow-up period contributed to the numerator in 2013.
