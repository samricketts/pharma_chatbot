Background

Emerging evidence indicates that healthy dietary patterns are associated with higher cognitive status; however, few clinical trials have explored this association in diverse middle-aged adults before the onset of cognitive decline. We use novel ambulatory methods to assess cognition in natural settings in tandem with diet recording.

Aims

We investigate whether the Multicultural Healthy Diet Study to Reduce Cognitive Decline &amp; Alzheimer’s Disease Risk, a pilot randomized controlled trial of an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern compared to usual diet, can mitigate cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s Disease risk in a diverse population of 40-65 year old adults in Bronx, New York.

Methods

Primary cognitive outcomes assessed at nine months are collected in an ecological momentary assessment “measurement burst” design, over the course of participants’ daily lives. These ultrabrief, ambulatory cognitive assessments examine processing speed, visuospatial working memory, short-term associative memory binding, long-term associative memory, and working memory capacity. Key secondary outcomes relate to comparing dietary intake between study arms with respect to cognitive outcomes. We assess diet with food records using the National Cancer Institute’s Automated Self-Administered 24-h record and serum biomarkers. We further investigate the association of self-reported diet and dietary biomarkers with inflammatory-based biomarkers.

Conclusion

This randomized controlled trial of diet and cognition for the first time combines novel measures of ambulatory cognitive assessment with web-based assessment of dietary intake recording. This new approach enabled the study to continue in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic in remote format.

pmc1. Introduction

Direct care costs for individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) in the US are estimated to be over $355 billion in 2021 and will reach $1.1 trillion (in today’s dollars) by 2050. Today, 6.2 million Americans 65 years and older live with ADRD. It is estimated that by 2050 the number of new and existing ADRD cases will grow to 12.7 million1 with Blacks and Hispanics particularly at risk.2, 3 Risk factor modification early in life before onset of dementia symptoms may be a viable strategy for prevention of cognitive decline.4, 5 Diet is one modifiable factor. Here we describe the Multicultural Healthy Diet (MHD) study which tests whether an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern adapted to a diverse Bronx population in mid-life has the potential to reduce cognitive decline and ADRD risk.

There is some evidence that an anti-inflammatory diet pattern, a diet high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and fish, can confer benefits to cognitive health and improved mood. 6–10 However limitations of the data such as reliance on observational studies and unique populations, such as White adults, preclude definitive conclusions regarding causality and generalizability.11 Studies involving non-White adults, such as US Hispanic/Latino adults, also link a high quality diet with higher cognitive status12–14, but the evidence is by no means consistent.15, 16 To overcome these limitations, we designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT)-MHD tailored to the diverse middle-aged Bronx population consisting of African-Americans (both southern US/Caribbeans), US Hispanic/Latinos (primarily Puerto Ricans/Dominicans) and Others (Whites/Asians). We also incorporated biomarker measurements and used ambulatory measurements to mirror natural settings.

We apply ambulatory measurements because traditional methods take place in physical and social environments that are fundamentally dissimilar to the environments in which people perform cognitive tasks in their daily lives (e.g. in memory/ neurology/neuropsychology clinics, research laboratories). Natural variation in performance at the time of a single test can increase measurement error and diminish sensitivity for detecting cognitive change.17 To overcome these barriers, we conduct week-long ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measurement bursts (using smartphones) in participants’ natural environments. Using a prototype of the Mobile Monitoring of Cognitive Change (“M2C2”) smart phone application, under development as part of the forthcoming NIH Mobile Toolbox18 we deliver ultra-brief, ambulatory cognitive assessments of processing speed, visuospatial working memory, short-term associative memory binding, long-term associative memory, and working memory capacity. These assessments are delivered 5 times per day, for 7 days, during each of 4 measurement bursts (baseline, 9 months, 18 months, and 27 months follow-up). By repeatedly assessing cognition across a variety of situations and contexts, ambulatory assessment can reduce temporal sampling error (reduce the likelihood of catching a participant on a ‘bad day’), increase reliability (through repeated assessments), and maximize sensitivity to change through aggregation of performance across many episodes (increase precision of wave-over-wave point estimates of change in longitudinal designs).17 Ambulatory approaches to cognitive assessment have been used successfully in older adult samples, for healthy adults and individuals with neurologic disorders.19, 20 In the MHD trial we perform cognitive assessments in both conventional in-clinic, single-shot, computerized formats as well the ambulatory measurement burst format for comparison of these two methodologies. We also include in-clinic cognitive measurements from the NIH Toolbox to contrast with the ultra-brief ambulatory assessments which are a prototype of the M2C2.21 NIH Toolbox measures were administered in-clinic as an adjunct to the ambulatory measures on n=147 participants from November 2018 until the onset of the pandemic on March 12, 2020. Please see appendix A in on-line supplementary section for details.

Here we describe a novel study that is first to assess diet and cognition in real time using EMA and diet recording for a RCT of diet and age-related cognitive decline in a racially diverse middle-aged population in the Bronx. Moreover, this RCT is conducted in the context of the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic and integrates remote approaches overnight in seeking to adapt recruitment, assessment and intervention components in response to this historic pandemic.

2. Methods

2.1. Overview of design and study objectives

This phase II pilot RCT is designed to investigate whether consuming a healthy diet that is based on the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and tailored to a multicultural cohort hereafter known as the Multicultural Healthy Diet (MHD) can be adapted for a multicultural middle aged (40-65 years old) middle income cohort in Bronx, New York and whether this diet improves cognition compared to consuming a usual diet. This study is being conducted in a middle-aged population because early indicators of cognitive aging may manifest long before old age and because lifestyle factors, such as diet, may have their largest impact during this period.

The study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial in which participants are randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either the MHD intervention or usual diet. Participants in the MHD arm are exposed to a diet intervention over an 18-month period (four in-person visits in small groups before the pandemic with the interventionist over a 2-month intensive phase &amp; monthly telephone coaching starting in month 3 of the intervention till month 18). The study continues for an additional 9 months to assess sustainability and ends at month 27 (see Figure 1A). The comparison arm participants are provided with general health recommendations with the same interventionist and same modality as the diet intervention, to equalize the level of attention between comparison and intervention arms. Subject assessment covers a 27-month period and participants randomized to intervention were asked to follow the dietary pattern over the 27-month period (see Tables 1 and 2). Outcomes are assessed through a combination of conventional in-clinic and ambulatory methods.

Ambulatory assessments are conducted over the course of participant’s daily lives following each site visit using a combination of study-provided smart phones (ambulatory cognitive assessment in an EMA measurement burst design) and tablets/computers (daily diary of dietary records). Measurement bursts involve administration of 6 M2C2 surveys per day on study-provided smart phones. M2C2 surveys involve a combination of self-report and performance-based measures. Performance-based cognitive assessments, which are used to measure primary and secondary outcomes, are administered during 5 of the 6 assessments per day (all surveys administered prior to a ‘Bedtime’ survey; see Ambulatory Assessment Protocol). Daily diary of dietary records involved completion of National Cancer Institute’s Automated Self-Administered 24h (ASA24) food records.

We also assess inflammatory markers C-reactive protein &amp; IL-6 and oxidative stress biomarker F2-isoprostane as possible mechanisms of action. We hypothesize that participants randomized to the MHD have more stable and possibly improved cognitive function relative to baseline, whereas comparison participants will have measurable decline. By assessing the DII and Empirical DII scores of participants along with process measures such as group and telephone session completion rates, we will examine how well the MHD was adapted by this population. Detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria are listed in on-line supplement- Appendix A. Briefly, eligible participants included those without a history of a serious health condition, no previous history of traumatic brain injury or a neurologic condition or disease producing cognitive dysfunction, and those who were not currently taking memory enhancing drugs or participating in a weight loss program.

2.1.1 Adaptations to the Pandemic

Before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, in-clinic measures were obtained during site visits that occurred at Run-in Visit (training for 2-day Run-in period), Baseline Visit (training for 7-day measurement burst), 9-, 18-, and 27-month follow-up visits (training for second, third and fourth measurement bursts). Beginning with the pandemic eligibility assessments such as the reading test (Wide Range Achievement Test- WRAT)22 and screening for mild cognitive impairment via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment- MoCA23 were conducted online via Zoom. Other cognitive assessments continued via ambulatory phones except for the NIH Toolbox which was discontinued because it was designed to be done in-clinic and could not be done properly remotely. Beginning with the Covid-19 pandemic on March 12, 2020 all group intervention and comparison sessions are conducted on Zoom. We resumed biospecimen collection and anthropometry in-person starting July 16, 2020 after a four month hiatus due to the pandemic when in-person visits were suspended.

2.2 Study Outcomes

Primary Outcome:

The primary outcome is a global composite cognition score derived as the average of the three z-scores for each of the individuals tasks, i.e. the participant’s performance on each of the three M2C2 ambulatory cognitive assessments (Grid Memory, Symbol Search, and Color Shapes tasks) at 9 months post baseline. These assessments are validated measures of visuospatial memory, processing speed and short-term associative memory binding, respectively.24

Secondary Outcomes

Several secondary outcomes relate to whether the MHD can be adapted for a diverse middle-aged cohort in the Bronx. We will evaluate the change from baseline for serum biomarkers indicative of a MHD diet pattern at 9 months, specifically total folate &amp; vitamers, tocopherols, carotenoids, vitamin B12 and fatty acid profile; and self-reported intake of food groups such as fruits and green leafy vegetables. In addition, secondary outcomes consist of performance on the individual ambulatory cognitive assessments (Grid Memory task, Symbol Search task, Color Shapes task) contributing to the primary outcome to determine whether observed intervention effects are attributable to specific cognitive domains.

Exploratory Outcomes

The exploratory outcomes relate to short- and long-term associations between dietary patterns self-reported stress and affect collected during the M2C2 surveys, and all five of the ambulatory cognitive tasks, including two exploratory tasks related to long-term associative memory and working memory capacity (Shopping List and Rotation Span tasks). Short-term (momentary, day-to-day) and long-term (across 27 months of follow-up) associations between the intervention and the ambulatory assessments will be examined.

2.3 Study Arms

All participants in each of the two arms received both group/video conference and telephone intervention over an 18 month period.

MHD Anti-inflammatory Diet Intervention &amp; Comparison Arms

This diet intervention is a small group intervention with tailored phone calls after the core sessions. Participants undergo an 18 month intervention (four semi-monthly small group sessions for 2 months followed by monthly phone calls for 16 months). The intervention is delivered using a motivational interviewing approach.

The same health coach delivers the intervention and comparison sessions. This approach models the Care Management Organization of our health system, Montefiore Medical Center.25 Comparison participants received the information in same modality as the intervention namely four in-person and bi-weekly for first two months, then monthly by phone till month 18. The comparison sessions focus on self-care/management matters as: maintaining dental hygiene, vaccinations, choosing shoes that fit, considerations for long-term care insurance, having a health care proxy, dealing with aches and pains of aging, eye health, etc. Intervention fidelity is assessed by periodic observations by the principal investigator, a member of the Motivational Network of Trainers and feedback is provided to the health coach.

2.4 Assessment Protocol

2.4.1 Schedule of Participant Contacts and Ambulatory Assessments

Participant contacts are scheduled before Run-in, Baseline, 9-, 18-, and 27-month follow-up measurement waves (see Figure 1A). During the Run-in Visit, participants become acquainted with all ambulatory assessment procedures including the ASA food record (see Dietary Assessment) and the smart phone-based ambulatory cognitive assessment protocol (see Ambulatory Cognitive Assessments). In addition, eligibility screening using the WRAT22 and MoCA23 are conducted.

Beginning with the pandemic as mentioned earlier the WRAT was performed via Zoom and a telephone version of MoCA was administered.23 During Baseline and all Follow-up Visits, participants are asked to complete cognitive assessments, socio-demographic, health behavior, and medical history questionnaires, and are provided ‘refreshers’ on use of the ambulatory assessment instruments. During the Baseline Visit, blood draws are also scheduled for biomarker analysis. Bloods are also assessed for biomarker analysis 9 months later at which time the primary outcome is assessed.

Ambulatory assessment bursts follow each site visit. Following the Run-in Visit, participants complete a 2-day ambulatory assessment run-in (conducted over the course of participants’ daily lives) which provides an opportunity to identify any challenges with completing the intensive ambulatory assessment protocol. The ambulatory assessment protocol includes collection of ultra-brief self-report surveys and performance-based, ambulatory cognitive assessments administered on study-provided smart phones in an EMA measurement burst design. In addition, dietary records are collected via computer/tablet, in a daily diary design, via 24-h records using the ASA24 instrument. As part of the Baseline contacts 9-, 18-, and 27-month Follow-up contacts, participants complete 7-day ambulatory assessment waves. Enrollment into the trial is contingent upon completion of ≥80% of baseline measurement burst assessments and at least 2 days of compliant (at least 500 Kcal) ASA 24h food records during the run-in assessment.

2.4.2 Ambulatory Assessment Protocol

The ambulatory assessment protocol includes two components: 1) ecological momentary assessments conducted in a measurement burst design via smart phone (ultra-brief self-report surveys and performance-based, ambulatory cognitive assessments), and 2) daily diary of dietary intake via 24-hour record using ASA24. Our ambulatory assessment protocol follows established and validated procedures that we used in previous work to administer brief assessments in a measurement burst design, train participants in the use of study-provided smartphones, and minimize participant burden to ensure good compliance with the measurement design.24, 26

Cognitive Assessment Measurement Burst Design24, 27, 28

Six surveys are administered each day via the M2C2 smart phone application: a “Wake-up” survey, 4 notified or ‘Beeped’ surveys, and a “Bedtime” survey. Participants complete Wake-up surveys upon waking up in the morning. Beeped surveys are signaled by the study-provided smart phones at pseudorandom intervals (~every 3 h) throughout each day. Bedtime surveys are self-initiated and completed immediately prior to going to bed (see Figure 2B).

Self-report Surveys:

Wake-up surveys consist of a brief assessment of the previous night’s sleep (when they went to bed, when they woke up, sleep disruptions and sleep quality), questions about expectations for the day (how busy, stressful, enjoyable they anticipate the day will be), self-ratings of cognition (whether thinking is currently slow, foggy, sharp, or able to concentrate), a momentary food record, a record of any physical activity occurring before the wake-up survey (duration and intensity), and a reminder to note what they are eating by entering foods into ASA24 over a 24 h period as they consume them or all at once starting at midnight. Beeped surveys consist of self-ratings of affective states (worried, happy, fatigued, sad, stressed), self-ratings of cognition (as above), ratings of time pressure and distraction since the last survey, momentary food records (foods eaten since the last beep), and a record of any physical activity. Bedtime surveys include self-ratings of affective states, cognition, time pressure/distraction, food, and physical activity logs. At the end of the bedtime surveys, participants are asked to make self-ratings of their day overall (satisfaction with foods eaten and perceived behavioral control over dietary choices). See Figure 2C for example of self-report item.

Ambulatory Cognitive Assessments:

Ambulatory cognitive assessments are administered at the end of all Wake-up and Beeped surveys (totaling 5 administrations of each assessment per day). We implemented three previously validated ambulatory cognitive assessments to assess domains of processing speed, visuospatial working memory, and short-term associative memory “binding”, as well as two new “exploratory” ambulatory assessments to assess domains of long-term associative memory and working memory capacity. We selected the following three ambulatory assessments as the primary endpoint of MHD due to the sensitivity of their respective cognitive domains to dietary habits, normative cognitive aging, and presence of preclinical AD.16, 29–32 Specifically, we administer an assessment of visuospatial working memory (Grid Memory task) because recent work has shown that spatial pattern separation is sensitive to memory impairment in very early and preclinical AD.33, 34 We modeled the processing speed (Symbol Search) task after the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, which a meta-analysis has shown to be one of the earliest indicators of cognitive decline in preclinical dementia.35 Finally, the measure of short-term associative memory binding (Color Shapes task), was designed after the work of Parra and colleagues (2011) where it was shown to be a highly sensitive index of memory impairment in very early AD.36–39 The primary endpoint of MHD is a composite cognition score derived from performance on these three tasks.

Two additional ambulatory cognitive assessments are included in the EMA protocol as exploratory outcomes. The exploratory Shopping List task is an associative memory task (&gt;30s between study and test) modeled after the Paired Associates Learning task 40 and has also been shown to be sensitive to early cognitive deficits in preclinical AD.41 Finally, we include an exploratory assessment of working memory capacity in the Rotation Span task (RSpan). The RSpan task is a complex span task of working memory, recently validated for remote EMA administration with M2C2.42 See Figure 1 for a depiction of ambulatory cognitive assessment procedures. For complete procedural details for all ambulatory cognitive assessments see Appendix B.

Daily Diary of Dietary Intake:

Dietary records are collected during each ambulatory assessment burst using the National Cancer Institute Automated Self-Administered 24 h dietary records (ASA24) for daily intake. The ASA24 is a web-based 24-h dietary recording instrument43–50 available in English/Spanish that has been used in studies with multicultural populations.46, 50

2.5 Statistical considerations

2.5.1 Sample size consideration

Our initial design was to randomize 326 participants, with an expected 15% attrition at 9-months (Visit 2), and 5% per year thereafter to yield a total of 250 participants at 27 months after baseline (Visit 4). This would yield sufficient power for both the primary endpoint at 9 months, and final time point at 27 months. With 125 participants per arm at Visit 4 and a within-person correlation of 0.50, we would have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.35 SD, representing an absolute between-group difference of 0.16 in the within-person change in cognition score. Assuming a within-person correlation of 0.85, we would have had 80% power to detect an absolute between-group difference of 0.19 SD in the change in scores. In a previous study (ESCAPE), the correlation of mean performance (averaged across all assessments) from one burst to the next was ~0.90.24 The 9-month timepoint was chosen as primary, as it was the time that potentially would have the greatest difference by arm due to the largest adherence.

Given the challenges with recruitment, due to the somewhat high participant burden of the protocol and challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, we revised the sample size to an expected n=277 to be randomized. As of 10/11/22, we have randomized n=290 participants which is now the final sample size. For our primary endpoint at 9 months, assuming 10% attrition (n=250), we will still have 80% power based on our original assumptions. Using pessimistic assumptions of 20% attrition at each 9-month visit, the power should be 54% based on n=142 at last follow up at 27 months or Burst 4 to detect these effect sizes.

Key secondary outcomes include between-arm comparisons of MHD related dietary intakes. Based on preliminary data from the Study of Latinos: Nutrition &amp; Physical Activity Assessment Study, baseline mean (SD) for biomarker folate, alpha-tocopherol, and B12 are approximately 46 (17) nmol/L, 0.91 (0.28) mg/dL and 598 (330) pg/mL respectively.51 An effect size of 0.35 would be detectable with 80% power with 125 subjects per arm, a between-arm difference in change of at least 5.95 nmol//L, 0.10 mg/dL, and 116 pg/mL in these respective markers at 9 months assuming a within person correlation of at least 0.5.

2.5.2 Randomization

Stratified permuted block randomization with variable block sizes is used to randomize participants to one of the two study arms in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified on sex, age (&lt;53, 53-65), and education level (no more than high school or equivalent, more than high school). The study statistician generated the randomization lists, one for each strata, which was uploaded into the study database. A randomization software module was created for the data management system that is only accessible to unblinded staff (e.g. health coach) so that blinded study staff remained blinded to study arm. Randomization occurred once the participant passed screening, signed the informed consent, and successfully completed the run-in procedures.

2.5.3 Statistical methods for analysis

The primary outcome will be calculated as a global composite measure of three ambulatory cognitive tasks: Symbol Search, Grid Memory, and Color Shapes assessed at the 9-month visit, calculated as the average of the three z-scores for each of these individual tasks. Individual z scores were based on individual task scores for the burst, standardized using the mean and standard deviation at the baseline burst.

The primary analysis will be from an ANCOVA regression model of the global composite score at 9 months regressed on the baseline composite score and treatment arm. The t-test for the treatment arm regression coefficient in this model will assess the difference between treatment arms in the change from 9 months. Further supportive analyses will additionally adjust for other patient level characteristics, including age, gender, race and ethnicity. Secondary outcomes will include the adjusted analysis of the treatment effect on the change from baseline for each of the three individual task domains. Other secondary outcomes include between arm comparisons of MHD-related dietary intake based on self-report and biomarker measures of intake at 9 months post baseline. In addition, our secondary outcomes will consist of examining dietary effects on each of the three tasks (Symbol Search, Grid Memory, Color Shapes) to determine whether observed intervention effects are attributable to specific cognitive domains.

For the endpoints involving ambulatory cognitive measures, at least 50 % of the expected 35 sessions must be completed for inclusion in analyses. Analyses will be conducted as intent-to-treat analyses. Missing data will be handled using multiple imputation. Sensitivity analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be conducted by varying the imputation model specification.

2.6 Study monitoring

A Data Safety Monitoring Board was created consisting of external investigators (including a safety officer) and a representative from the National Institute on Aging. The Data Safety Monitoring Board meets every six months to review study progress.

3. Impact of Covid-19 pandemic

The Covid-19 pandemic impacted this RCT midway into the study with recruitment of new participants ceasing for four months after which recruitment resumed at a much slower pace. On March 12, 2020 the study moved to a fully remote approach with data management occurring in a cloud-based platform. Follow-up continued using a door-to-door courier system (FedEx) to transport ambulatory phones and other study materials (informed consent form, the questionnaire packet) between Einstein and the participants. Nearly all study measurements were able to be assessed remotely using study phones and Zoom including baseline surveys, cognitive measures including primary endpoint and diet assessments. Additionally intervention and comparison classes moved to Zoom video-conferencing system.

4. Discussion

This RCT of diet and cognition for the first time combines novel measures of ambulatory cognitive assessment with web-based assessment of dietary intake recording. This ambulatory approach assesses both cognition and diet in real-time over burst periods of seven days every nine months collecting 140 assessments (35 measurements at each of four bursts) of cognition and 28 days (seven food records at each of four bursts) of diet records in real time per person. The sheer volume of real-time diet and cognition data provide a rich data base to characterize the trajectory of diet and cognition in mid- to later life. For example, ratings of sleep, self-reported cognition, affective states, and participation in other health-promoting behaviors (e.g. physical activity) obtained throughout each day of the ambulatory assessment protocol will provide additional information that may help better contextualize cognitive outcomes. These data will be supportive of exploratory analyses focused on intervention adherence (e.g. do ratings of poorer sleep quality or higher stress reduce adherence to the dietary prescription?) and cognitive change (e.g. do more physically active participants in the treatment group achieve even better outcomes?).

The ambulatory cognitive measures are also compared to in-clinic measures and standardized measures such as the NIH Toolbox enabling comparisons with assessments that are commonly used in clinic settings. The ability to provide these assessments for both diet and cognition remotely was especially important in light of the Covid-19 pandemic as it allowed the study to continue follow-up seamlessly. Participants using prototypes of M2C2 have embraced this technology with median adherence rate for ambulatory assessment protocol of 90%.52 Additionally based on our Data Safety Monitoring reports, well over 90% adhere to our food recording protocol. Another novel feature of this study is collecting both dietary self-report and related biomarker with focus on diet components that have been associated with cognition such as serum folate, plasma fatty acids, carotenoids and tocopherols.

5. Conclusion

Here we describe a novel RCT of diet and cognition conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic using ambulatory methods of cognitive assessment and diet recording in a sample of 40-65 yr old adults in a multicultural setting in Bronx, New York. This study is unique in that it draws on cutting edge ambulatory methods that were especially helpful during a pandemic and allowed the study to continue with minimal disruption. Collection of ambulatory data along with biomarkers provide a rich data source from which to assess whether an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern adopted in mid-life can benefit cognitive status in mid-life.
