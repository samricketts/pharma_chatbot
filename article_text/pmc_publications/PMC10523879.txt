INTRODUCTION:

Home health (HH) may be an important source of care for those with early-stage/undiagnosed Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), but little is known regarding prevalence or predictors of incident ADRD diagnosis following HH.

METHODS:

Using 2010–2012 linked Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF) and HH assessment data for 40,596 Medicare HH patients, we model incident ADRD diagnosis within one year of HH via multivariable logistic regression.

RESULTS:

Among HH patients without diagnosed ADRD, 10% received an incident diagnosis within one year. In adjusted models, patients were three times more likely to receive an incident ADRD diagnosis if they had HH clinician-reported impaired overall cognition (compared to patients without reported impairment) and twice as likely if they were community-referred (compared to hospital-referred patients).

DISCUSSION:

There is a pressing need to develop tailored HH clinical pathways and protect access to community-referred HH to support community-living older adults with early-stage/undiagnosed ADRD.

pmc1. BACKGROUND:

Most (70%) of the 5.4 million older Americans with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) live in the community.1 Aging in place reflects the preferences of most older adults, but may pose challenges for those with ADRD given their significant care needs2 and existing structural and financial barriers to accessing home-based care.3,4 The Medicare home health (HH) benefit provides skilled nursing, therapy, and aide services delivered in the patient’s home, with no co-pay for fee-for-service beneficiaries. HH is a critical source of care for community-living persons with ADRD: of the 3.3 million older adults who access HH each year,5 an estimated 31% have diagnosed ADRD.6 However, these figures may underestimate the true prevalence of ADRD among HH patients. A range of clinical and structural factors make it difficult to obtain a timely ADRD diagnosis,7–9 including subtle symptom presentation in early disease stages and lack of systematic evaluation.

Recent evidence indicates that HH providers may be serving a subpopulation with ADRD who are not yet formally diagnosed but are nonetheless experiencing and exhibiting symptoms of meaningful cognitive decline. Zhu et al. (2015) determined that HH utilization begins to significantly increase two years before an incident ADRD diagnosis.10 Topaz et al. (2020) reported that 37% of HH patients without diagnosed ADRD had reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms consistent with ADRD recorded in their free-text electronic health record notes.11 Ryvicker et al. (2022) found that 18% of HH patients without an ADRD diagnosis recorded in their HH start of care assessment received a diagnosis within 4 years.12

Patients can be referred to HH in two ways: following an inpatient hospitalization (post-acute HH) or directly from a community physician (community-entry HH). Physicians may refer a patient to community-entry HH to stabilize an emerging medical condition or address a temporary need for skilled care while avoiding institutionalization or hospitalization. Services are authorized and reimbursed in 60-day episodes1 and the average HH patient receives two successive episodes.13 Compared to post-acute patients, community-entry HH patients are twice as likely to display symptoms of major cognitive impairment during the HH episode14 and may be especially likely to have early-stage/undiagnosed ADRD.

Understanding the prevalence of early-stage/undiagnosed ADRD among HH patients, and how to identify these individuals using the standardized HH assessment instrument, is necessary foundational information to support development of targeted clinical and supportive interventions. This exploratory, retrospective study uses linked HH patient assessment and administrative Medicare data to (1) calculate the percentage of HH patients admitted without a formal ADRD diagnosis who receive an incident diagnosis within one year, (2) identify HH assessment data elements associated with incident ADRD diagnosis, and (3) determine whether likelihood of incident diagnosis varies by HH referral source (post-acute vs community-entry). Findings contribute important new insights regarding the role of HH care in the continuum of supports for those at early stages of cognitive decline and/or with undiagnosed dementia and are relevant to ongoing efforts to better meet the needs of those with ADRD through community- and home-based care.

2. METHODS:

2.1 Data Sources

Data are drawn from linked Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF) chronic conditions segment and Outcomes and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) version C data. MBSF includes enrollment data and aggregated claims data for Medicare beneficiaries, with indicators of the presence of chronic conditions for individual beneficiaries, updated annually.15 OASIS is a standardized patient assessment instrument; Medicare-certified HH providers are required to complete and submit OASIS for all patients at start of care and regular intervals during the HH episode. OASIS includes rich data on patient sociodemographic characteristics, cognitive and clinical status, care needs, and physical function.

2.2 Analytic Sample

The analytic sample for this study includes 40,596 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who received skilled HH from a large, urban HH care provider with a start of care between July 1, 2010 and December 31, 2012. We excluded individuals who were younger than 65, did not have complete Medicare parts A and B coverage, or died within one year of HH start of care. In regression models we further limit the sample to those who did not have an ADRD diagnosis in claims prior to HH start of care (n=27,642).

2.3 Measures

ADRD Diagnosis

We determined ADRD diagnosis via MBSF chronic conditions segment indicator, which identifies ADRD diagnosis based on the presence of any Medicare claims with one of 23 ICD-9 codes related to Alzheimer’s Disease, related disorders, or senile dementia, over a 3-year lookback period.15,16 From MBSF, we also drew the date of the first occurrence of this diagnosis in claims. Among HH patients who had no ADRD diagnosis recorded in claims prior to HH start of care and who lived for at least one year following HH start of care, we created a binary indicator denoting incident ADRD diagnosis appearing in claims within one year of the date of HH start of care. Whereas the current chronic conditions segment indicator algorithm relies on ICD-10 codes, these were not implemented until 2015— greater information regarding the shift from ICD-9 to ICD-10 and its impact on chronic condition algorithms is available from Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse reports.16,17

Independent Variables: Referral Source and Cognition

We measured HH referral source via OASIS reports of whether a patient was discharged from an inpatient facility within 14 days of HH admission. We considered patients with no inpatient or institutional post-acute care stay within 14 days of admission to be community-entry, and all others to be post-acute.

We analyzed all seven cognition indicators reported in the OASIS: memory deficit, impaired decision-making, decline in mental, behavioral, or emotional status, impaired overall cognition, difficulty expressing language, difficulty understanding verbal content, and confusion. Memory deficit, impaired decision-making, and decline in mental, behavioral, or emotional status are based on binary clinician reports of whether each was demonstrated (memory deficit and impaired decision-making must be demonstrated at least once per week to be reported). Impaired overall cognition is based on clinician rating of the patient’s current overall cognitive functioning on a scale of 0 (“alert/oriented…comprehends and recalls task directions independently”) to 4 (“totally dependent”). Difficulty expressing language is measured via clinician rating of patient’s verbal expression from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (nonresponsive or unable to speak). Difficulty understanding verbal content is measured via clinician rating of patient’s understanding of verbal content from 0 (clear comprehension) to 3 (rarely/never understands). Confusion is determined by clinician reports of how often the patient was confused in the past 14 days, from 0 (never) to 4 (constantly). Following an approach used in previous research,18,19 we operationalized all scaled items so that those rated 1 or above were determined to have impairment (“0” is the modal rating value for all items). (See Supplementary Material Table A1 for full text of all OASIS items described here.)

Covariates

Using MBSF, we identified those who died within one year of HH start of care and dual enrollment in Medicaid. From the OASIS we drew measures of sociodemographic characteristics, clinical status, and need for caregiving support. Sociodemographic characteristics included age (≥ 80 years), sex, and race/ethnicity (White, Black, Latinx, and Asian/other). Clinical status measures included risk for hospitalization, impaired vision, impaired hearing, treatment for a urinary tract infection (UTI) within past 14 days, urinary incontinence, and bowel incontinence. Risk for hospitalization is based on clinician reports of present risk factors for hospitalization and ranges from 0 (no risks reported) to 6 (all possible risks reported). Need for caregiving support measures included frequency of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) assistance from non-agency caregivers and clinician-reported need for non-agency caregiver assistance with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), ADLs, medication management, or safety and supervision. (See Supplementary Material Table A2 for additional detail on construction of covariates from OASIS.)

2.4 Statistical Analyses

We first described the frequency and proportion of HH patients with and without ADRD diagnosis at HH start of care. We next presented the frequency and proportion of those without an ADRD diagnosis who received an incident ADRD diagnosis within one year of HH start of care. We then described characteristics of subjects without ADRD diagnosis at HH start of care, both overall and stratified by receipt of incident ADRD diagnosis within one year. We used chi-squared and Wald tests to test for significant differences between groups.

We next sought to identify which OASIS cognition indicator was most closely associated with receiving an incident ADRD diagnosis within one year and to determine how this relationship might vary by referral source. We used unadjusted logistic regression to model the odds of receiving an incident ADRD diagnosis as a function of each cognition indicator while stratifying by referral source. We then calculated the unadjusted marginal probability of receiving an incident ADRD diagnosis for each possible combination of cognition indicator and referral source.

To avoid collinearity between multiple measures of cognition, we chose a single cognition indicator based on the results of the unadjusted logistic models (considering strength of association and Aikake Information Criteria (AIC) score). We then used multivariable logistic regression to model the odds of incident ADRD diagnosis as a function of the interaction of this cognition item and referral source while adjusting for patient sociodemographic characteristics, clinical status, and need for caregiving support. We again calculated the adjusted marginal probability of receiving an incident ADRD diagnosis for each value of the interaction term, while holding all covariates at their means. All analyses were performed using Stata 14 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX).

3. RESULTS:

3.1. Prevalence of Incident ADRD Diagnosis

Among 40,596 HH patients experiencing an index HH episode, 27,637 (68.1%) had no ADRD diagnosis at start of care (Figure 1). Of those with no previous ADRD diagnosis, 2,701 (9.8%) received an incident ADRD diagnosis within one year of HH start of care. Stratifying by referral source, a greater proportion of community-entry patients received an incident diagnosis within one year compared to post-acute patients (16.1% vs 7.9%).

Of 27,637 HH patients with no ADRD diagnosis at HH start of care, nearly one in four (23.0%) were referred from the community (Table 1). Half (49.8%) were 80 years or older, 65.1% were female, and 25.7% were dually enrolled in Medicaid. The sample was 70.3% White, 13.2% non-Latinx Black, 10.0% Latinx, and 6.5% Asian or other race. Most (75.9%) received daily ADL assistance from caregivers during the HH episode. Those who received an incident ADRD diagnosis within one year were more likely to be community-entry (38.0% vs 21.4%; p&lt;0.001), 80 years or older (69.5% vs 47.7%; p&lt;0.001), and dual enrollment in Medicaid (33.3% vs 24.9%; p&lt;0.001), compared to those who did not. They were also more likely to have cognition issues reported on the OASIS―including impaired overall cognition (13.5% vs 2.1%; p&lt;0.001), memory deficit (8.6% vs 1.9%; p&lt;0.001), and confusion within 14 days (55.5% vs 31.5%; p&lt;0.001). A greater proportion of those who received an incident ADRD diagnosis were noted as experiencing urinary incontinence (45.3% vs 30.1%; p&lt;0.001) and bowel incontinence (9.7% vs 3.9%; p&lt;0.001) and requiring family caregiver assistance with ADLS (73.6% vs 69.4%; p&lt;0.001), medication management (61.4% vs 46.0%; p&lt;0.001), and supervision/safety (48.0% vs 28.5%; p&lt;0.011). (See Supplementary Material Table A3 for descriptive characteristics stratified by referral source.)

3.2. Predictors of Incident ADRD Diagnosis

As determined by both strength of association (largest odds ratio; all odds ratios were statistically significant) and model fit (lowest AIC score), the OASIS cognition indicator most closely associated with incident ADRD diagnosis was impaired overall cognition (Figure 2; See Supplementary Material table A4 for confidence intervals and AIC information). Among community-entry patients, those with impaired overall cognition were seven times more likely to receive an incident diagnosis compared to those without impaired overall cognition (OR: 7.61; 95% CI: 5.78–10.01; p&lt;0.001). Among post-acute patients, those with impaired overall cognition were six times more likely to receive an incident diagnosis compared to those without impaired overall cognition (OR: 6.47; 95% CI: 5.22–8.03; p&lt;0.001). Unadjusted marginal probability of receiving an incident ADRD diagnosis within one year for community-entry patients was 50.0% (95% CI: 43.5%−56.4%) for those with impaired overall cognition and 11.6% (10.7%−12.5%) for those without impaired overall cognition; among post-acute patients the probability was 43.9% (95% CI: 37.6%−50.2%) for those with impaired overall cognition and 5.9% (95% CI: 5.5%−6.2%) for those without impaired overall cognition.

In an adjusted model, compared to post-acute patients without impaired overall cognition, odds of receiving an incident ADRD diagnosis within one year were three times higher among post-acute patients with impaired overall cognition (aOR: 3.30; 95% CI: 2.57–4.24), two times higher among community-entry patients without impaired overall cognition (aOR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.65–2.11), and eight times higher among community-entry patients with impaired overall cognition (aOR: 8.11; 95% CI: 6.00–10.98) (Table 2). Holding all covariates at their means, the adjusted marginal probability of receiving an incident diagnosis ranged from 5.6% (95% CI: 5.2%−6.0%) among post-acute patients without impaired overall cognition to 32.4% (95% CI: 25.9%−38.9%) among community-entry patients with impaired overall cognition. (See Supplementary Material table A5 for models interacting referral source with other OASIS cognition indicators.)

Older adults were also more likely to receive an incident ADRD diagnosis within one year if they were 80 years or older (aOR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.86–2.35) or dually enrolled in Medicaid (aOR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.29–1.68). Significant clinical factors included higher clinician-assessed risk for hospitalization (aOR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.03–1.14), impaired hearing (aOR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.02–1.33), urinary incontinence (aOR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.02–1.30), and bowel incontinence (aOR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.22–1.90). Those receiving daily ADL assistance (compared to less than weekly or no assistance) had greater odds of receiving an incident diagnosis (aOR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.06–1.70), as did those receiving family caregiver assistance with medication management (aOR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.13–1.45) or safety and supervision (aOR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.22–1.56).

4. DISCUSSION:

Among HH patients with no ADRD diagnosis at start of care, 10% received an incident ADRD diagnosis within one year of HH. Community-referred patients with reported impaired overall cognition in their standardized patient assessment had a 50% probability of incident ADRD diagnosis within one year. Patients with reported impaired overall cognition were significantly more likely to receive an incident ADRD diagnosis within one year compared to those without impaired overall cognition (six times more likely among post-acute patients and seven times more likely among community-entry patients). Adjusting for a range of sociodemographic characteristics, clinical status measures, and caregiving support needs, community-entry patients with reported impaired overall cognition were eight times more likely to receive an incident ADRD diagnosis, compared to post-acute patients with no report of impaired overall cognition. Findings indicate that HH is an important source of care for older adults with early-stage/undiagnosed ADRD, suggesting opportunities to leverage the HH episode to connect at-risk older adults with appropriate clinical evaluation and/or services, and demonstrate a need for targeted clinical interventions and policies to ensure HH meets the unique needs of this vulnerable sub-population.

Providing relevant supports and home- and community-based care during the early stages of ADRD has been highlighted as a key inflection point to positively impact short- and long-term outcomes and well-being for persons with ADRD and their families.20–22 The present study indicates that HH providers often encounter individuals at this juncture, and systematically gather data in the standardized patient assessment that can help identify these individuals and guide future interventions to connect them with appropriate clinical evaluation and/or services. HH providers are uniquely well-positioned to connect these older adults and their caregivers with supportive resources given their access to the older adult’s home environment, longitudinal interactions with older adults and their caregivers across a HH episode, and significant knowledge of community-based care organizations. These resources could include information and training for caregivers, advance care planning and financial planning materials, linkages to community-based personal aide and adult day centers, and even referrals to home-based dementia care programs as these proliferate.21–24

Within the HH episode itself, existing patient assessment items―most notably, clinician-reported impaired overall cognition―can facilitate resource targeting by identifying those most likely to have early-stage/undiagnosed ADRD. Learning health systems and HH providers could and should harness data analytics platforms to identify patients whose start of care assessment indicates heightened risk for incident ADRD diagnosis and tailor care plans accordingly, regardless of the presence of a formal ADRD diagnosis. These tailored clinical workflows could include a greater number of visits, longer length of stay, and increased continuity of care, all previously linked to improved outcomes for those with ADRD.25–27 Additionally, workflows could incorporate enhanced training and support for family caregivers, who are integral to implementing the HH care plan for those with cognitive impairment,28,29 and social work consultations to identify and address non-clinical needs. Social work services are included in the Medicare HH benefit but historically underutilized30; social work consultations may be highly beneficial to patients with ADRD and their families in supporting care planning and identifying available community-based services.31

Payment innovations could facilitate these targeted clinical pathways; for example, a reimbursement option akin to CPT code 99483 (which reimburses physicians for dementia care planning32) could support an additional visit by a HH social worker and/or nurse to specifically assess the ongoing care needs of the individual and their caregiver(s) and offer referrals to community-based supports to meet these needs beyond the HH episode. Current HH reimbursement structures incentivize HH agencies to limit the number of visits provided; as a result, HH staff report difficulty addressing underlying social needs due to agency policies limiting visit frequency and duration.33 Study findings echo previous research in demonstrating that community-referred HH patients are more likely to have cognitive impairment and/or be at risk for incident ADRD diagnosis.14,34 This highlights the need for revisions to the current Medicare HH payment system, which reimburses post-acute episodes at a higher level than community-entry episodes, to create reimbursement parity between referral sources for those with cognitive impairment, thus supporting continued access and quality of care.18,19,35

4.1 Strengths and Limitations

Study strengths include a large, racially and ethnically diverse sample, access to rich information on health and cognitive status through the OASIS, and a longitudinal view of ADRD diagnosis and HH care using linked OASIS and MBSF data. However, there are several important limitations; chief among these is our use of 2010–2012 data. We rely on these years given our access to this data through a pre-existing DUA. In the intervening years from 2012 to present, factors including greater awareness of dementia and enhanced reimbursement for screening may have increased the likelihood of a document ADRD diagnosis.34 Prior work by Davis et al (2022) suggests that ADRD prevalence among those in the last two years of life increased from 2004 to 2017.36 Therefore, our results may underestimate rates of incident ADRD diagnosis; however, we note that the prevalence of those admitted to HH with diagnosed ADRD in our sample (32%) is nearly identical to the most recent national estimate among HH patients (31%).6 We relied on the chronic conditions data segment algorithm for ADRD, in which a single claim for one of 23 ICD-9 codes indicates dementia16; previous work comparing this approach to a gold-standard clinical evaluation found strong sensitivity and specificity,37 but requiring multiple incidents of an ADRD claim may be more robust to potential Type-I error. OASIS updates planned for 2023 will preserve the seven cognitive impairment measures examined in our analyses but add a Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS). Once data is available following implementation, it will be necessary to determine how BIMS score compares to pre-existing cognitive items in terms of discriminatory and predictive power related to incident ADRD diagnosis. Additionally, models do not include indicators of other chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease) which could potentially impact incident ADRD diagnosis. Finally, the sample is limited to a single HH agency; although the sample is large and diverse, future analyses would benefit from drawing on a national data, particularly given prior literature which found differences in time to diagnosis by race/ethnicity not captured in our sample.38

4.2 Conclusion

A meaningful proportion of Medicare HH patients, especially those referred from the community, are admitted without diagnosed ADRD but receive an incident ADRD diagnosis within one year. Cognition indicators included in the standardized HH patient assessment are significantly associated with incident ADRD diagnosis, especially reports of impaired overall cognition. There may be value in developing and delivering targeted HH clinical pathways for individuals experiencing early-stage/undiagnosed ADRD, as identified by existing assessment items. Additionally, there is a pressing need to protect access to community-entry HH as a valuable source of support for those in the early stages of their ADRD disease trajectory.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT:

Systematic Review:

Authors reviewed the existing literature via searches of PubMed and conference presentations/abstracts. Literature is scarce on this topic; however, several recent studies comment on cognitive impairment and/or ADRD diagnosis among home health patients and these have been appropriately cited.

Interpretation:

Our findings provide the first evidence that home health, particularly community-entry home health, serves a significant proportion of individuals with early-stage and/or undiagnosed ADRD. We also identified existing home health assessment items linked to receiving an incident ADRD diagnosis within one year. Results suggest the value of developing targeted clinical interventions for these individuals, using assessment items to direct resources to those who would benefit most.

Future Directions

This article highlights the need for investigation of the specific and unique needs of those with early-stage ADRD during home health, and for development of clinical workflows tailored to these needs to improve outcomes during the home health episode and beyond.

Declarations of Interest: None.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: Authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

CONSENT STATEMENT: Informed consent was not necessary as the present research does not meet requirements for human subjects research.

1 Beginning in January 2020, services are now authorized for 60 days but payments are determined in 30 day periods; this change occurred after the study timeframe.
