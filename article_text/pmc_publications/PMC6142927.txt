Importance:

The strongest genetic risk factor for AD, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, has a stronger association among females compared to males. Yet, limited work has evaluated the association between APOE alleles and markers of AD neuropathology in a sex-specific manner.

Objective:

Evaluate sex differences in the association between APOE and markers of AD neuropathology measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during life or in brain tissue at autopsy.

Design, Setting, Participants:

This meta-analysis selected data from 10 longitudinal cohort studies of normal aging and AD. Cohorts had variable recruitment criteria and follow-up intervals, and included population based and clinic based samples. Inclusion in our analysis required APOE genotype data and either CSF data (n=1798, 48% female, 13% AD, 94% Caucasian, 70±9 years) or autopsy data (n=5,109, 56% female, 97% Caucasian, 84±9 years) available for analysis.

Main Outcome and Measures:

Biomarker analyses included levels of Aβ−42, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) measured in CSF. Autopsy analyses included CERAD staging for neuritic plaques and Braak staging for neurofibrillary tangles.

Results:

After correcting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni procedure, we observed a statistically significant interaction between APOE-ε4 and sex on CSF t-tau (β=0.41 [95% CI: 0.27, 0.55], p&lt;0.001) and p-tau (β=0.24 [0.09, 0.38], p=0.001), whereby APOE showed a stronger association among females compared to males. Post hoc analyses suggested this sex difference was present in amyloid positive individuals (β=0.41 [0.20, 0.62], p&lt;0.001), but not among amyloid negative individuals (β=0.06 [−0.18, 0.31], p=0.62). We did not observe sex differences in the association between APOE and Aβ−42, neuritic plaque burden, or neurofibrillary tangle burden.

Conclusions and Relevance:

We provide robust evidence of a stronger association between APOE-ε4 and CSF tau levels among females compared to males across multiple independent datasets. Interestingly, APOE-ε4 is not differentially associated with autopsy measures of neurofibrillary tangles. Together, the sex difference in the association between APOE and CSF measures of tau, and the lack of a sex difference in the association with neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy, suggests that APOE may modulate risk for neurodegeneration in a sex-specific manner, particularly in the presence of amyloidosis.

Introduction

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD),1 explaining approximately 13% of the phenotypic variance.2 The ε4 allele increases risk for AD in a dose-dependent manner, and the strength of the association varies by age and sex.3 The effect of APOE-ε4 is strongest prior to age 70, declines after age 85, and is more robust among females compared to males,3 especially females between 55–70 years of age.4 Although this sex difference has been well established after a recent comprehensive meta-analysis,4 very little is known about the underlying mechanism. APOE has been implicated in a variety of neuropathological cascades relevant to AD, including alterations in cerebral glucose metabolism,5,6 cerebrovascular disease,7 amyloidosis,8,9 neurodegeneration,10 and tau tangle pathology.11 The present manuscript will focus on amyloid and tau as potential contributors to sex differences in the clinical effects of APOE.

In the case of amyloid pathology, APOE-ε4 has a strong association with amyloidosis,8,9 even among non-demented older adults,12 likely through its role in amyloid clearance.13 Research leveraging in vivo biomarkers of amyloid has indicated that the association between APOE-ε4 and amyloidosis is consistent across sexes,8,14–16 yet other work has found evidence of age-dependent sex differences in the effects of APOE-ε4 on amyloidosis.17,18 In the case of tau pathology, APOE-ε4 is associated with higher levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau,19 and more neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy,11 although these associations are relegated to individuals with high levels of amyloid pathology.16 The evidence of a sex difference in the association between APOE and tau pathology is also mixed, with some biomarker15,19 and autopsy18 work suggesting females show a more robust association between APOE-ε4 and tau, while other work has reported no sex difference.14,20,21

Collectively, the amyloid and tau findings to date provide mounting, although inconclusive, evidence of a sex difference in the association between APOE and both of the primary neuropathological hallmarks of AD. The objective of the present project was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the sex-specific associations between APOE and AD neuropathology in older adulthood. The pooled data resources for this project provide the opportunity to evaluate sex differences across the spectrum of normal aging and AD, including a broad range of age and cognitive status. The first set of analyses focused on four in vivo datasets that include CSF biomarkers of AD neuropathology. The second set focused on 6 autopsy datasets of AD leveraging direct measures of AD neuropathology. Together, these analyses provide a thorough and needed investigation into sex-specific effects of APOE on AD neuropathology.

Materials and Methods

Data were acquired from well characterized studies of AD (Tables 1 and 2). The biomarker database included four cohort studies. The Vanderbilt Memory &amp; Aging Project (VMAP), launched in 2012, recruited participants age 60 and older from the community who were MRI eligible and free of dementia and clinical stroke.22 The Wisconsin Registry of Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP) began in 2001 recruiting participants 40–65 years of age. 72% have a parent with either probable AD dementia ascertained through medical history review or autopsy-confirmed AD.23 The Biomarkers of Cognitive Decline Among Normal Individuals (BIOCARD) study began in 1995. Enrollees were middle age at baseline and cognitively intact; 75% of participants had a first degree relative with AD. The study stopped in 2005 and was re-established in 2009, with annual assessments.24 The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) launched in 2003 and includes over 1,500 adults aged 55 to 90 years with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD (www.adni-info.org).

The autopsy database was derived from data published by Beecham et al. evaluating genetic markers of AD neuropathology, which includes cohort descriptions.25 The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGEN), National Institute on Aging (NIA) Late–Onset Alzheimer’s Disease Family Study (LOAD), and Mayo Clinic (Mayo) were analyzed directly from the published data.25 The dataset was updated using more recent data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP), the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, and the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset. Briefly, ROS began in 1994 and involves older Catholic nuns, priests, and brothers recruited from across the US. Rush MAP began in 1997 and involves older lay persons recruited from retirement communities, subsidized housing facilities, and social service agencies in the Chicago metropolitan area. Persons in both studies enrolled without dementia and agreed to annual clinical evaluations and organ donation at death.26,27 ACT began in 1994 and recruited a random sample of non-demented older adults from the Seattle metropolitan area. A subset of participants in ACT (25–30%) also agreed to brain donation.28 NACC maintains a database of participant information collected from 34 past and present NIA-funded Alzheimer Disease Centers. In 2005, NACC implemented a standard protocol (i.e., Uniform Dataset, UDS), including clinical, medical, neurological, and cognitive data. We only included autopsy participants who were at least 60 years of age at death. The collection of VMAP data and secondary analyses of all data were approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center IRB.

APOE Genotyping

As previously reported,29 APOE haplotypes (ε2, ε3, ε4) were determined using SNPs rs7412 and rs429358 in ACT, BIOCARD, Mayo, NACC, NIA-LOAD, VMAP, and WRAP. Pyrosequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and high-throughput sequencing of APOE codons 112 and 158 were performed in ADNI, ROS/MAP, and TGEN datasets to derive APOE haplotypes.

Quantification of Biomarker Outcomes

CSF biomarkers have been measured in ADNI, BIOCARD, WRAP, and VMAP previously. ADNI30 and BIOCARD31 were analyzed by the same lab using the same procedure. Similarly, WRAP32 and VMAP22 were analyzed by the same lab using the same procedure. Given known batch effects, we analyzed variables as continuous square-root transformed outcomes within each dataset individually and used a meta-analysis based on standardized coefficients to summarize results across datasets.

Quantification of Neuropathology Outcomes

Within the autopsy datasets, we used a measure of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT; Braak staging)33 and a measure of neuritic plaques (CERAD neuritic plaque score)34 in each dataset. Both measures were analyzed as binary outcomes and as ordinal outcomes. The binary neuritic plaque positive score was defined based on CERAD, whereby scores of “none” or “sparse” neuritic plaques were considered “neuritic plaque negative”, and scores of “moderate” or “frequent” neuritic plaques were considered “neuritic plaque positive”. The binary NFT positive score was defined based on Braak staging, whereby stages none, I, or II were considered “NFT negative” and stages III, IV, V, or VI were considered “NFT positive”.

Statistical Analyses

Statistical analyses were completed using RStudio (Version 1.0.136; https://www.rstudio.com/). For the neuropathology analyses, two primary models were run. The first was a binary logistic regression with tangle positivity or neuritic plaque positivity set as the outcome. The second model was a proportional odds ordinal logistic regression setting either Braak stage or CERAD neuritic plaque score as the ordinal outcome. Predictors in the model included age at death, sex, APOE, and a sex x APOE interaction. APOE-ε2 and APOE-ε4 were evaluated in separate models, and the main effect models were assessed excluding the sex x APOE interaction term. We used a dominant model for ε2 and an additive model for ε4. Follow-up analyses were run stratified by sex. All models were run within each dataset individually.

For the biomarker analyses, the same prediction models and covariates were assessed using linear regression with baseline CSF Aβ−42, CSF total tau (t-tau), or CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) set as the continuous outcome. Age at CSF acquisition was used as the age covariate term. Follow-up models were run stratified by sex. All models were run within each dataset individually.

Meta-analyses within the CSF and autopsy cohorts were completed separately using the metafor package in R, including estimation of fixed effects and heterogeneity across datasets. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using the Bonferroni procedure accounting for main effects and interactions on three biomarker outcomes (CSF Aβ−42, t-tau, and p-tau) and four autopsy outcomes (ordinal and binary outcomes of CERAD and Braak staging) resulting in 35 independent tests (corrected-α=0.0014).

Post-hoc analyses evaluated sex x APOE-ε4 interactions on CSF t-tau and p-tau among amyloid positive and amyloid negative individuals. Additional post-hoc analyses restricted the sample to cognitively normal individuals, stratified by age group, covaried for education level, restricted autopsy results to longitudinal cohort studies, removed ADNI from the CSF analyses, and restricted to APOE-ε4 homozygotes.

Results

Participant characteristics are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The biomarker dataset included individuals who were, on average, younger, with a higher percentage of males than the autopsy datasets.

Sex Differences and Main Effects of APOE

Main effect results are presented in Table 3. Females showed higher levels of CSF t-tau, CERAD neuritic plaque score, and Braak tau tangle stage. Similarly, APOE-ε4 was associated with higher levels of biomarker levels and pathology and ε2 was associated with lower biomarker levels and pathology for all metrics.

Sex x APOE Interactions – CSF Biomarker Results

Interaction results are presented in Table 3. A sex x APOE-ε4 interaction was observed on both t-tau (Figure 1) and p-tau whereby the association between APOE-ε4 and tau levels was stronger in females than in males (see Figure 2).

Sex x APOE Interactions – Autopsy Results

Autopsy interaction results are also presented in Table 3. There were no significant interactions between sex and APOE on neuropathology.

Post Hoc Analyses

In post-hoc analyses stratified by amyloid status, the sex x APOE-ε4 interaction was present among amyloid positive individuals (β=0.41 [95% CI: 0.20, 0.62], p&lt;0.001, Supplemental Table 1) but not amyloid negative individuals (β=0.06 [−0.18, 0.31], p=0.62, Supplemental Table 2). Additional post-hoc analyses stratified by age, restricting the sample to cognitively normal individuals, adjusting for education, restricted to longitudinal cohort studies, removing the ADNI dataset, and restricted to APOE-ε4 homozygotes are presented in Supplemental Tables 3–9.

Discussion

The present findings provide the most robust evidence to date of sex differences in the association between APOE-ε4 and CSF tau levels, whereby the effect of APOE is stronger among females compared to males. The observed sex difference was driven by amyloid positive individuals, suggesting APOE may confer sex-specific risk for downstream neurodegeneration in the presence of enhanced amyloidosis. In contrast to CSF tau levels, we did not observe sex differences in the association between APOE and any biomarkers of amyloidosis or autopsy measures of neurofibrillary tangles.

The present analyses provide strong evidence of an enhanced association between APOE-ε4 and CSF tau levels among females compared to males, particularly among amyloid positive females. Previous work in ADNI has reported similar sex differences in CSF tau,14,20 although results have been somewhat mixed depending on the sample included21 and had never been replicated in an independent cohort. For the first time, we were able to replicate the sex difference of APOE effects on CSF tau in three additional datasets that differ substantially in baseline age and diagnostic status. We also provide evidence of a comparable sex difference in the association between APOE-ε4 and CSF phosphorylated tau for the first time. Several mechanisms could underlie this sex difference in tau, and the hormonal changes that take place during and following menopause represent one strong candidate pathway. For example, there is evidence that changes in estrogen levels among females could drive a more severe downstream response to amyloidosis;35–37 an effect that could be enhanced among ε4 carriers given evidence that estradiol treatment drives APOE release from microglia.38 A second possibility is that late-life changes in estrogen levels among females have a direct effect on tau. For example, estradiol appears to protect against tau hyperphosphorylation, particularly among female rats,39 and estrogen receptor α co-localizes with neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy40. Interestingly, the α receptor also appears to be responsible for the estrogen-mediated upregulation of APOE expression,41 suggesting a third possible mechanism in which estrogen and APOE act synergistically in post-menopausal women. Thoughtful, modern experimental approaches are needed to better understand the potential contribution of gonadal hormone differences between men and women in driving the observed APOE sex differences.42

In contrast to the CSF biomarker results, we did not observe a sex difference in the association between APOE and neurofibrillary tangle load at autopsy. There are a few potential explanations for this counterintuitive observation. Notably, there is growing evidence that CSF tau is a better marker of the intensity of neurodegeneration than the stage of neurofibrillary tangle deposition,43 suggesting the autopsy and biomarker metrics may represent two distinct processes. Therefore, one possibility is that sex-specific effects of APOE contribute to differences in neurodegeneration that are not directly mediated by changes in neurofibrillary tangle burden. Other markers of neurodegeneration, including hippocampal volume44,45 and cerebral hypometabolism,21 show sex-specific effects of APOE-ε4 that may underlie the observed differences in CSF tau levels. A second possibility is that the age difference between the autopsy cohorts and biomarker cohorts in the present analysis contribute to the observed discrepancy between CSF and autopsy measures of tau. Recent and historic evidence indicates that both the detrimental effect of APOE-ε4 and the sex difference in APOE-ε4 effect diminishes among the oldest old,3,4 suggesting that subtle age differences could have a large influence on results. In support of such a possibility, we do observe the strongest effects on CSF tau in the younger individuals when stratifying the CSF sample into younger-old and older-old adults (Supplemental Tables 3–4). However, even among the younger-old adults we do not observe a sex-specific effect of APOE on autopsy metrics, suggesting this age difference does not fully account for the discrepancy.

In all analyses, we observed a strong association between APOE and amyloidosis that was consistent across males and females. APOE appears to drive risk for clinical AD through an amyloid clearance pathway,13 so it is not surprising that both here and previously46 APOE shows a stronger association with amyloid deposition than tau. Notably, we did not observe differences in the APOE association when comparing younger-old to older-old individuals (see Supplementary Tables 3 and 4), although age differences have been reported.47 The larger sample (and enhanced power) in the present analysis likely explains the discrepant findings, as the previous study observed patterns consistent with our findings but failed to observe a statistically significance association in the younger group. Importantly, our primary and post-hoc analyses support the notion that APOE shows a consistent association with amyloidosis across sex and age and is unlikely to drive observed sex differences in the association between APOE and clinical AD.48

This manuscript has multiple strengths, including the large sample size, the integration of both CSF biomarker data and autopsy data, and the extensive sensitivity analyses, including explorations into diagnostic status, age, amyloid status, and educational attainment. However, the study is not without weaknesses. One important limitation is the potential influence of sex differences in survival to older adulthood, which could contribute to a robust survivor effect among males compared to females. As others have previously highlighted, selective survival of men with substantially lower cardiovascular risk profiles may contribute to sex differences in AD risk in older adulthood.49 It is also notable that the sex-specific effect of APOE-ε4 on microbleeds is actually in the inverse direction,50 with males showing a stronger association than females, suggesting that sex-specific effects of APOE-ε4 may have differential effects on AD and non-AD pathologies, even in the face of potential survivor bias. Future work is needed to develop and integrate modern statistical approaches to estimate and account for the effect of survival bias, particularly in analyses of sex-specific molecular drivers of AD and non-AD neuropathologies. The cross-sectional nature of the biomarker and autopsy data also limits our ability to make causal inferences, particularly with respect to the sequential ordering of neuropathologies or CSF biomarker deposition. Finally, the cohorts were relatively homogeneous across race and ethnicity, with some cohorts being exclusively Caucasian. Thus, findings may not be generalizable to other racial and ethnic groups that may be at greater risk of AD. Results will need to be extended to cohorts with greater diversity.

Conclusions

The present results provide strong evidence of sex differences in the association between APOE and CSF tau levels that do not appear to reflect differences in neurofibrillary tangle deposition. Future work should evaluate the genetic drivers of plaques, tangles, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment in a sex-specific manner to identify novel pathways of risk.

2 Neuritic plaque positivity was defined as CERAD neuritic plaque stage of “moderate” or “frequent”.

Key Points

Question:

Does the association between apolipoprotein E (APOE) and Alzheimer disease neuropathology differ by sex?

Findings:

Females showed a stronger association between APOE and cerebrospinal fluid tau levels when compared to males, particularly among amyloid positive individuals. There was no sex difference in the association between APOE and amyloidosis, or between APOE and autopsy measures of neurofibrillary tangles.

Meaning:

The sex difference in the association between APOE and cerebrospinal fluid measures of tau, and the lack of a sex difference in the association with neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy, suggests that APOE may modulate risk for neurodegeneration in a sex-specific manner, particularly in the presence of amyloidosis.
