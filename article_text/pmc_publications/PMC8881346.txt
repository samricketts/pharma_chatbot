Subtle changes in objective spatial navigation ability have been observed in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer disease (AD) cross-sectionally and have been found to predict clinical progression. However, longitudinal change in self-reported spatial navigation ability in preclinical AD has yet to be examined. The current study examined whether AD biomarkers suggestive of preclinical AD at baseline spatial navigation assessment and APOE genotype predicted decline in self-reported spatial navigation ability and whether APOE genotype moderated the association of AD biomarkers with change in self-reported spatial navigation. Clinically normal (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale®=0) adults aged 56–90 completed the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale (SBSOD) annually for an average of 2.73 years. Biomarker data was collected within +/− 2 years of baseline (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42, p-tau181, p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio, Positron Emission Tomography imaging with Florbetapir or Pittsburgh Compound-B, and hippocampal volume). APOE genotyping was obtained for all participants. SBSOD demonstrated a nonsignificant trend toward a decline over time (p=.082). AD biomarkers did not predict change in self-reported spatial navigation (all ps&gt;.163). APOE genotype did not moderate the relationship between AD biomarkers and self-reported spatial navigation in planned analyses (all ps&gt;.222). Results suggest that self-reported spatial navigation ability, as estimated with the SBSOD, may be limited as a measure of subtle cognitive change in the preclinical stage of AD.

pmcIntroduction

In 2019 an estimated 5.8 million people in the United States had symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD) and the number is expected to rise to 12.7 million by 20501. Neuropathological change associated with AD can begin a decade or more before the onset of clinically significant cognitive impairment2. As such, there has been an emphasis on research examining the preclinical stage of AD, the point at which a person is clinically normal but exhibits AD-related pathological change. Preclinical AD is marked by increased amyloid and tau deposition in the brain and by neurodegeneration of medial temporal structures, including the hippocampus2. The conceptualization of preclinical AD also comprises individuals who carry at least one apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, as APOE ε4 carriers have an increased risk of developing symptomatic AD3,4. Cognitive assessment represents a critical complementary approach to identifying and tracking changes during the preclinical phase of AD.

Spatial navigation deficits have been reported in upwards of 39–54% of people diagnosed with symptomatic AD, suggesting that this is a common cognitive symptom of the disease5. Spatial navigation represents a complex cognitive process that is essential for everyday functioning and refers to the ability to locate specific goal locations within an environment (for review, see6). Recent research has demonstrated that individuals with preclinical AD, as defined by amyloid burden or presence of an APOE ε4 allele, have worse performance on spatial navigation tasks and report greater spatial navigation difficulties on questionnaires compared with older adult controls7,8,9. Additionally, spatial navigation performance at baseline was found to predict clinical progression in clinically normal older adults10.

Although spatial navigation tasks have shown potential utility as screening measures in identifying individuals at greater risk of preclinical AD and progression to symptomatic AD, it would also be of benefit to have a measure that could track subtle cognitive progression along the AD continuum. However, there has been limited longitudinal work examining change in spatial navigation ability over time. Results have been mixed with one study not observing a significant decline in objective navigation ability after an eight-year follow-up and another reporting an association between older age and decline in objective navigation ability over two years11,12. Self-report measures of spatial navigation have yet to be examined longitudinally. Questionnaires assessing spatial navigation ability may be of particular clinical utility because they are time efficient (5–10 minutes) and may have limited practice effects8.

The broad goal of this study was to assess whether self-reported spatial navigation may be useful in monitoring clinical progression of AD pathological processes in early stages of the disease. More specifically, we examined the association of varying levels of AD biomarkers with longitudinal change in self-reported spatial navigation ability in clinically normal individuals. The selected biomarkers of CSF Aβ42, p-tau181, and the p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio, PET amyloid, and hippocampal volume reflect varying aspects of AD pathology and phases of the preclinical stage2. Additionally, these markers have some demonstrated association with subjective cognitive decline, self-reported spatial navigation or objective spatial navigation cross-sectionally7,8,13–15. We hypothesized that AD biomarkers and presence of the APOE ε4 allele would predict decline in self-reported spatial navigation ability over time. Additionally, we hypothesized that APOE genotype would moderate the relationship between AD biomarkers and self-reported spatial navigation, wherein the presence of an APOE ε4 allele in conjunction with greater biomarker burden would be associated with steeper decline in self-reported spatial navigation ability.

Methods

Participants.

Participants (aged 56–90) were enrolled in a longitudinal study on driving and preclinical AD at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (N=242; see Table 1 for sample characteristics). All participants were clinically normal (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale=0; 16) at baseline, had APOE genotyping, and biomarker data within +/−2 years of the baseline spatial navigation assessment. Individuals were excluded if they were diagnosed with major medical conditions (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, stroke, seizure disorder, or head injury). Participants consented to participation in accordance with Washington University Human Research Protection Office guidelines.

Cerebrospinal fluid.

CSF collection has been previously described17. All CSF samples were analyzed using chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay using a fully automated platform (LUMIPULSE G1200, Fujirebio, Malvern, PA) according to manufacturer’s specifications. Continuous measures of Aβ42, p-tau181, and the p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio were analyzed.

PET Amyloid.

PET amyloid was acquired using either [11C] Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB) or [18F]-Florbetapir (AV45) tracers with methods previously described18,19. Standardized uptake ratios (SUVR) were derived with the cerebellum as the reference and corrected for partial volume effects20. Mean cortical SUVR (MCSUVR) was based on FreeSurfer-derived estimates of precuneus, prefrontal cortex, gyrus rectus, and lateral temporal regions19–21. MCSUVR was converted to centiloid values and combined across radiotracers22. Primary analyses considered MCSUVR as a continuous measure.

MRI.

MRI scans were acquired using Siemens 3T with methods published previously10. Imaging process and hippocampus delineation were completed with FreeSurfer image analysis suite v5.321. FreeSurfer implements an automated probabilistic labeling procedure where individual voxels are assigned a neuroanatomical label based on data from a manually labeled training set. Volumes were summed across hemispheres and estimated intracranial volume was used to adjust volumes for body size differences using an analysis of covariance approach.

APOE genotyping.

Methods for APOE genotyping have been previously described23. Participants were categorized as ε4+ (44, 34, 24) or ε4− (33, 23, 22).

Self-reported navigation.

The Santa Barbara Sense of Direction (SBSOD) scale is a 15-item self-report questionnaire rated on a seven-point Likert scale that assesses spatial navigation ability24. All responses were averaged to create a total score, with lower score indicating lower self-reported spatial navigation ability. SBSOD has been found to be a reliable and valid measure of spatial navigation ability24.

Cognitive Composite.

A cognitive composite was calculated based on psychometric measures of episodic memory (free recall from the Selective Reminding Task; 25), visuomotor speed (Trail Making Test A; 26), executive functioning (Trail Making Test B; Armitage, 1945), and visuospatial ability (Block Design from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale; 27,28). Both the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III were used to collect Block Design scores. In order to account for multiple versions of a test, raw scores from each subsample were standardized separately and then combined across datasets. Standardized scores from the four domains were averaged to create a cognitive composite. Follow-up cognitive data was standardized to the baseline assessment.

Data analyses.

Outliers.

Univariate outliers were defined as values &gt;3 standard deviations from the group mean at baseline. Unless otherwise specified, results were unchanged when outliers were omitted from analyses.

Covariates.

Age, sex, education, and health composite were controlled for in all analyses. The health composite (0–4) was derived from the sum of past or present heart problems, hypertension, diabetes, and depression. These health factors were selected due to their prevalence in aging populations and due to their associations with cognitive functioning29.

Statistical analyses.

Linear mixed effects models were used to examine longitudinal change in SBSOD score. These models were conducted using the nlme package in R version 3.5.130,31. Time (years in study) and intercept were random effects. In the initial model, Time was the only predictor of interest in order to examine longitudinal change in the SBSOD score. Next, a set of models were conducted to examine each AD biomarker individually and included the biomarker (i.e., CSF Aβ42, CSF p-tau181, CSF p-tau181/Aβ42, PET MCSUVR and hippocampal volume) and the AD biomarker x Time interaction. In order to examine the role of APOE genotype, a model was examined with the APOE genotype x Time interaction included. Finally, to assess whether APOE genotype moderated effects of the AD biomarkers, a series of models with the AD biomarker, APOE genotype, AD biomarker x Time, APOE genotype x Time, APOE genotype x AD biomarker, AD biomarker x time x APOE genotype interactions as predictors were examined.

Results

Planned Analyses

SBSOD demonstrated a nonsignificant trend toward a decline over time (p=.082). AD biomarkers did not significantly predict SBSOD change over time (CSF Aβ42: p=.163; CSF p-tau181: p=.491; CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio: p=.174; PET MCSUVR1: p=.171; Hippocampal volume: p=.699). APOE genotype did not predict change in SBSOD over time (p=.333) and did not moderate the effect of AD biomarkers on SBSOD change over time (CSF Aβ42: p=.695; CSF p-tau181: p=.671; CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio: p=.222; PET MCSUVR1: p=.710; Hippocampal volume: p=.279). Notably, the results replicated a significant cross-sectional association of CSF Aβ42 and SBSOD (p=.002) observed by Allison and colleagues13. See Table 2 for full results.

Post-hoc Analyses

A series of post-hoc analyses were conducted to explore to consider possible factors contributing to the null findings. The rationale for each analysis is described in the relevant sections below.

Sex differences.

Sex differences have been observed in some aspects of objective spatial navigation ability with the degree of male advantage varying based on features such as the type of task (e.g., 32; see 33 for a review). Moreover, females tend to report worse spatial navigation ability on questionnaires (e.g., 32,34). Additionally, there have been sex differences observed in APOE ε4 carriers, wherein the ε4 allele has been associated with greater risk of cognitive decline and symptomatic AD in female carriers but not male carriers (see 35 for a review). However, in the current study, sex did not predict change in SBSOD over time (p=.395). In addition, sex did not significantly moderate the relationship between APOE genotype and SBSOD change (p=.572). However, a main effect of sex was observed (p&lt;.001) such that men reported greater spatial navigation ability.

SBSOD subfactors.

Previous factor-analytic work suggests that the SBSOD is composed of three subfactors: orientation, engagement with maps and engagement with directions36. Thus, we assessed for longitudinal change in these factors and examined whether AD biomarkers influenced longitudinal trajectories with a focus on models in which there was some evidence of an effect in the primary analyses (i.e., p&lt;.300).

None of the subfactors significantly changed over time (orientation: p=.130; engagement with maps: p=.240; engagement with directions: p=.115). The AD biomarkers were not associated with change in orientation (CSF Aβ42: p=.182; CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio: p=.414; PET MCSUVR: p=.295; Hippocampus: p=.894) or engagement with directions (CSF Aβ42: p=.734; CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio: p=.258; PET MCSUVR: p=.493; Hippocampus: p=.875). With all data included, AD biomarkers were not associated with change in engagement with maps (CSF Aβ42: p=.782; CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio: p=.318; PET MCSUVR: p=.407; Hippocampus: p=.682). However, CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio significantly predicted decline in engagement with maps when six outliers were excluded (p=.034). See Table 3 for full results.

There was a non-significant trend for APOE genotype to moderate the effect of hippocampal volume on the orientation subfactors (p=.065; Figure 1). This reflected a trend for smaller hippocampal volume to be related to greater decline in orientation over time for the APOE ε4+ group (t=1.803, p=.073), but not for APOE ε4- individuals (t=−.907, p=.365). There was a non-significant trend for APOE genotype to moderate the effect of CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio on the orientation subfactor (p=.068), but this trend was not observed with six outliers removed (p=.264). APOE genotype did not moderate the effect of biomarkers on the engagement with maps (CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio: p=.818; Hippocampal volume: p=.682) and engagement with directions (CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio: p=.287; Hippocampal volume: p=.455) subfactors. See Table 3 for full results.

SBSOD allocentric processing.

Two different strategies have been associated with successful navigation: allocentric and egocentric processing6. These strategies use different information gathered from the environment to reach a goal location. Allocentric processing, often referred to as cognitive mapping, involves the creation of a flexible internal representation of an environment based on the relative locations of landmarks within the environment. By contrast, egocentric processing, often referred to as route learning, involves creating a fixed, action-based representation of an environment that is dependent on the navigator’s perspective. Measures of allocentric processing have demonstrated greater sensitivity to concurrent preclinical AD and to longitudinal clinical progression compared to measures of egocentric process7,10. The SBSOD includes two items directly referencing allocentric processing (item 5: I tend to think of my environment in terms of cardinal directions (N, S, E, W) and item 15: I don’t have a very good “mental map” of my environment). These items were averaged to create a measure of allocentric processing. Due to the observed predictive ability of CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio in detecting decline in the engagement with maps subfactor and the trend observed in the hippocampal volume and orientation subfactor models, we focused examination of whether these two biomarkers predicted decline in allocentric processing.

Allocentric processing did not decline over time (p=.111). CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio did not significantly predict decline in allocentric processing (p=.652). There was a significant APOE genotype x CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio x Time interaction (p=.003); however, this reflected that greater biomarker burden tended to be associated with increase in allocentric processing over time in the APOE ε4+ group (t=2.280, p=.024) and decline in allocentric processing in the ε4- group (t=1.917, p=.056) and was not observed with six outliers removed (p=.544).

Cognitive composite models.

Additional analyses were conducted to examine whether general cognitive ability was more sensitive to subtle changes than SBSOD over the same time period. The cognitive composite significantly declined over time (p&lt;.001). Hippocampal volume (p=.024) and PET MCSUVR (p=.049) significantly predicted cognitive composite over time. The CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio predicted decline in cognitive composite, but only showed a trend when six outliers were removed (with outliers: p&lt;.001; without outliers: p=.099). CSF p-tau181 demonstrated a trend toward predicting decline in cognitive composite, but this was not significant when five outliers were removed (with outliers: p=.051; without outliers: p=.234). There was a non-significant trend for CSF Aβ42 to predict cognitive decline (p=.074).

APOE genotype also did not predict change in the cognitive composite over time (p=.987) and did not moderate the effect of AD biomarkers (CSF Aβ42: p=.234; CSF p-tau181: p=.674; CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio: p=.662; PET MCSUVR: p=.913; Hippocampus: p=.696). See Table 4 for full results.

Notably, the cognitive composite and SBSOD demonstrated weak correlations across time points (baseline r(206)=.136, p=.051; follow-up 1 r(155)=.175, p=.029; follow-up 2 r(133)=.175, p=.043; follow-up 3 r(103)=.117, p=.234; follow-up 4 r(73)=.360, p=.002; follow-up 5 r(34)=.271, p=.110).

Discussion

The current study hypothesized that self-reported spatial navigation may be particularly sensitive to change in the preclinical phase of AD based on observations that objectively measured spatial navigation is associated with preclinical AD and clinical progression7–10,37. In the planned analyses, none of the AD biomarkers predicted decline in self-reported spatial navigation. These results suggest that self-reported spatial navigation ability may be limited as a measure of subtle cognitive change in the preclinical stage of AD. However, another possibility is that the SBSOD is limited as a measure of subtle decline in this domain.

There has been limited examination of longitudinal change in self-reported cognitive functioning. Three studies have reported longitudinal increases in subjective cognitive concerns14,38,39. Indeed, Amariglio and colleagues14 observed that elevated PET amyloid predicted increased subjective cognitive complaints. Notably, each of the existing studies had measures that directly asked about cognitive problems or change, with one focused on memory39 and the other two assessing a broader range of cognitive and functional domains14,38. In contrast, the SBSOD targets current ability, not perceived change over time. The current results did reveal cross-sectional associations between CSF Aβ42 and self-reported spatial navigation skills (see Table 2). Thus, a questionnaire assessing perceived change in spatial navigation skills, such as the one developed by Allison and colleagues14, may be better suited to track subtle change over time.

Another consideration is that specific component processes of spatial navigation may be more sensitive to longitudinal change. We explored two possibilities in post-hoc analyses. First, as noted in the results section, there is evidence that the SBSOD can be broken down into orientation, engagement with maps and engagement with directions subfactors36. One finding was suggestive that smaller hippocampal volume was more predictive of decline in the orientation subfactor in APOE ε4+ individuals, but the effect was only a non-significant trend. Another finding was suggestive that greater biomarker burden assessed by the CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio was predictive of decline in the SBSOD engagement with maps subfactor, but only when outliers were removed from the model. Thus, overall, these post-hoc analyses did not reveal robust associations of the AD biomarkers with decline in these subfactors. Secondly, the SBSOD total score appears to be most strongly associated with egocentric updating relative to allocentric processes such as development and use of a cognitive map (e.g., 24,34). Importantly, objective measures of allocentric processing have shown greater sensitivity to preclinical AD and clinical progression than measures of egocentric processing7,10. In post-hoc analyses, APOE genotype moderated the relationship between the CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio and decline in a composite of the two SBSOD items related directly to allocentric processing. However, this reflected a trend for greater biomarker burden to be associated with increase in allocentric processing over time specifically in APOE e4+ individuals. This finding may be spurious given that it is based on only two items, was not robust to outlier removal and the number of analyses conducted. Nonetheless, considering the existing literature, a robust self-report measure geared more toward allocentric processing may be more sensitive for tracking preclinical AD-related decline.

Overall, APOE genotype status was not consistently predictive of change in self-reported spatial navigation, and this did not vary by sex. Findings regarding an influence of APOE genotype on progression of subjective cognitive complaints in clinically normal individuals specifically have actually been mixed14,38. Furthermore, there are some indications that the effects of APOE genotype on cognitive decline in clinically normal individuals without MCI may be fairly modest (e.g., 40). Thus, future investigations should examine whether APOE genotype is more predictive of decline in early symptomatic stages of AD.

One concern may be that the time frame of the repeated assessments (average of 2.73 years) was insufficient to detect longitudinal decline. Notably, a post-hoc examination of objective cognitive performance, including measures of episodic memory, executive functions and visuospatial ability, revealed a significant decline over time with baseline hippocampal volume and the CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio predicting the magnitude of decline. In contrast, there was only a non-significant trend for decline in self-reported spatial navigation. In addition, the cognitive composite and self-reported spatial navigation were weakly correlated cross-sectionally. In contrast, longitudinal change in subjective cognitive complaints was found to be more robustly associated with decline in objective cognitive performance in prior work over a 4–5 year time frame38,39. These observations again highlight potential limitations in self-reported spatial navigation for tracking subtle decline during the preclinical phase. However, future work is necessary to determine whether other self-report measures of the domain may show greater utility. Importantly, decline in objective spatial navigation performance has been observed over a 2-year period11.

The current study included several strengths including repeated measurement of a validated self-report measure of spatial navigation, incorporation of multiple AD biomarker measures, APOE genotyping, and longitudinal psychometric data on a moderately large participant sample. Within this context, results suggest that self-reported spatial navigation ability may be limited as a measure to track subtle cognitive change in preclinical AD, despite cross-sectional observations that self-reported spatial navigation is associated with preclinical AD. Nonetheless, the largely null findings of the current study do not negate the possibility that spatial navigation could be used to track longitudinal change in preclinical AD. Though the SBSOD is a commonly used measure of spatial navigation, it may not be an optimal measure for tracking subtle change over time. As previously discussed, the questionnaire focused on current skills rather than perceived change may have mitigated observing a more robust influence of AD biomarkers. Future work should incorporate use a self-report measure of perceived change in spatial navigation ability as well as examine longitudinal change in objectively measured spatial navigation ability, both with a focus on allocentric processing.

1 Considering the skewed distribution of PET MCSUVR, primary analyses were repeated with PET MCSUVR dichotomized based on an established cut-off to indicate amyloid positivity in secondary analyses (i.e., AV45 &gt;20.6 and PIB &gt;16.4; Su et al., 2019). Results were the same (Supplementary Table 1).
