Background

Symptoms of psychosis is one of the common clinical manifestations of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the pathophysiology behind psychosis is unknown.

Objective

The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, Lewy body pathology, and psychosis in AD.

Methods

The data was obtained from the National Alzheimer’s disease Coordinating Centre (NACC), using the Uniform Data Set and the Neuropathology Data Set. Subjects with frequent neuritic plaque on CERAD, and Braak Stage of V or VI, corresponding to high probability of AD based on the NIA-AA Regan criteria were included in the analysis.

Results

Subject with two copies of ε4 alleles were significantly more likely to develop psychosis, both delusions and/or hallucinations, during the course of their illness. This association was gender-specific, only reaching significance in females. Our findings further showed that presence of two copies of ε4 allele was positively associated with the formation of Lewy bodies. Only in females with Lewy bodies was the effect of two copies of ε4 allele significant, reaching an odd ratio of 4.5.

Conclusion

The APOE ε4 allele has a female-specific effect in inducing psychosis in AD through the formation of Lewy bodies.

INTRODUCTION

Psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations are one of the common and persistent clinical manifestations of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It has been estimated that nearly half of the patients with AD experience psychosis during the course of their illness (1). Psychosis has been associated with greater cognitive and functional impairments (2, 3), behavior disturbances such as agitation and aggression (4, 5), and worse overall health (6), diminishing the quality of life of the patients and their caregivers (7).

One of the strongest genetic determinants of AD is the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene (8). The APOE gene has three common polymorphic forms, ε2, ε3 and ε4; the ε4 allele is associated with the risk of developing AD. It has been estimated that approximately 40% of subjects with AD have the ε4 allele compared to 15% in healthy older subjects (9). This effect of APOE is codominant, with ε4 allele acting in a dose-related manner, increasing the likelihood of AD by 3 times in heterozygotes and 15 times in homozygotes (9). From a neuropathological perspective, ε4 allele acts by increasing AD pathology, including neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques (8, 10, 11). Recently, ε4 allele has also been found to be associated with the development of Lewy bodies (12), which are frequently found comorbid with AD pathology, occurring in approximately 50% of subjects with AD (13). Unlike the overt phenotype of Lewy body dementia (DLB) (14–16), the clinical manifestations of Lewy body pathology in AD are muted, just resulting in higher scores on Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor subscale [12].

The present study seeks to investigate the relationship between the APOE genotype and psychosis in subjects with neuropathologically confirmed diagnosis of AD, and the role of Lewy body pathology in this manifestation. Furthermore, given that gender-specific effects of ε4 allele in AD have been commonly reported, males and females are analyzed separately (17).

METHODS

Data Source

The database was obtained from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Centre (NACC). The NACC encompasses records from 34 past and present Alzheimer’s Disease Centres in the United States collected between September 2005 and December 2015.

The Uniform Data Set (UDS), which include demographic and clinical information and the Neuropathology (NP) Data Set, which include autopsy records were used for analysis. Demographics included age, sex, ethnicity, and education. The presence of psychotic symptoms was evaluated based on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire quick version, assessing delusions or hallucinations in the month prior to clinical visit.

Only subjects in the NP Data Set were assessed. The severity of AD pathology was assessed based on the density of neocortical neuritic plaques (CERAD) and the Braak Stage for neurofibrillary degeneration on the NP Data Set. Lewy body pathology as determined by alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry was categorized into either absence (if no Lewy body pathology) or presence (if Lewy body pathology was observed in the brainstem, limbic region or amygdala, neocortical, olfactory bulb, or regions unspecified). The severity of Lewy body pathology was assessed as low (if brainstem predominant), moderate (if limbic or amygdala predominant), and severe (if neocortical predominant), following the recommendations of the Third report of the DLB consortium (18). The presence of Lewy bodies in the olfactory bulb or regions unspecified were excluded from the severity analysis. The APOE genotypes were reported by individual centres where the autopsy was performed, and further confirmed by reports from the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetic Consortium (ADCG).

Subject Criteria

Subjects with other primary diagnosis of brain injury, CNS neoplasm, Down’s syndrome, and Huntington’s disease were excluded. Subjects with frequent neuritic plaque on CERAD, and Braak Stage of V or VI, corresponding to NIA-AA Reagan of high probability of AD were selected (19). A total of 575 subjects with discrepant CERAD and Braak Stage were excluded, thus ensuring that only subjects with severe AD were included in the analysis. With respect to the APOE genotype, subjects were categorized into corresponding number of APOE ε4 alleles: no ε4 alleles, 1 copy of ε4 allele, and 2 copies of ε4 allele. Subjects with delusions or hallucinations at any clinical visit during the course of their illness were considered psychotic. The severity of delusions and hallucinations were not analyzed due to small sample size. Subjects were categorized based on the NPI-Q scores as never psychotic (AD−P), or any history of psychosis (AD+P), and the latter further classified into two overlapping groups of delusions with and without hallucinations (AD+D), and hallucinations with or without delusions (AD+H).

Statistical Analyses

Subjects with psychosis (AD+P), and each of the sub-groups (AD+D and AD+H) were independently compared to subjects without psychosis (AD−P). For categorical data, the Pearson's chi-square test was employed. For continuous data with normal distribution, the independent t-test was used. For continuous data with non-normal distribution (if statistically significant using Kolmorgorov-Smirnov test), the Mann-Whitney test was employed. For ordinal data, the ordinal logistics regression analysis was performed. The statistical analysis performed in this study did not correct for multiple testing All the statistical analysis was done using statistical software SPSS Statistics 23.0. The statistical significance was established at p ≤ 0.05.

RESULTS

Subject Demographics

On the NACC database, 1509 subjects were identified as having high probability of AD based on the NIA-AA Reagan criteria on post-mortem neuropathological evaluation. Of these subjects, 1284 subjects had their APOE gene status evaluated, and 1236 of those had NPI-Q scores. In this cohort, 503 subjects had comorbid Lewy bodies, and 733 subjects did not; there were 625 AD−P and 611 AD+P, further classified into 475 AD+D, 331 AD+H; 195 subjects had both delusions and hallucinations and thus were included in both groups (Figure 1). Of the 558 females identified, 79 had two copies, 267 had one copy, 212 had no copies of ε4 allele. Of the 678 males identified, 114 had two copies, 337 had one copy, and 227 had no copies of ε4 allele. The demographic and clinical correlations of the NACC database pertaining to psychosis has already been investigated in a previous study by our group (20). With respect to APOE status, subjects with one (78.55±10.07, N=624) or two (77.27±8.34, N=202) copies of ε4 allele were significantly younger at death compared to subjects with no ε4 allele (79.67±11.93, N=463). There was no association between APOE status and the average time between last clinical visit and death. All analysis performed in this study were corrected for age.

Gender-Specific Effect of ε4 Allele on Psychosis

In the group of subjects with severe AD, the presence of two copies of ε4 allele was positively associated with AD+P (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.08–2.15, p = 0.010), including both AD+D (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.09–2.25, p = 0.010) and AD+H (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.03–2.31, p = 0.020). A minimal trend was observed in subjects with one copy of ε4 allele and AD+P (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.95–1.56), but did not reach significance (p = 0.110).

When the analysis was repeated stratified by gender, a gender-specific effect was observed. In females, carrying two copies of the ε4 allele was significantly associated with AD+P (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.17–3.41, p = 0.008), and both AD+D (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.06–3.26, p = 0.025) and AD+H (OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.07–3.69, p = 0.025). There was no significant association between one copy of the ε4 allele and psychosis. In males, a positive, but not significant trend between ε4 allele and psychosis was observed (Figure 2).

APOE ε4 Allele and Lewy Bodies

To investigate the role of ε4 allele and Lewy body pathology on psychosis, the relationship between ε4 allele and Lewy body pathology was analyzed first. A significant association was found between two copies of ε4 allele and Lewy bodies. The likelihood of having Lewy bodies increased from 36% in subjects with no ε4 allele to 50% in subjects with two copies of ε4 allele (p = 0.001). A positive trend was observed in subjects with one copy of ε4 allele, with 40% likelihood of having Lewy bodies, but did not reach significance. A double dose of the ε4 allele was also associated with the severity of Lewy bodies (p = 0.008) (Table 1).

The association between ε4 allele and Lewy bodies were also gender-specific. In females, two copies of ε4 allele was associated with the both the presence and severity of Lewy bodies. In males, a positive trend was observed, but did not reach significance. Specifically, two copies of ε4 allele in females resulted in a 51% likelihood of developing Lewy bodies compared to 32% in subjects with no ε4 alleles (p = 0.002). In subjects with one copy of ε4 allele, no gender specific differences were found (Table 1).

Gender-Specific Effect of ε4 Allele on Psychosis Is Mediated Through Lewy Bodies

Given that ε4 allele is associated with Lewy body pathology, we then investigated the role of ε4 allele on psychosis in subjects in the absence and presence of Lewy bodies. In subjects with comorbid Lewy bodies, a significant association was found between carriers of two copies of ε4 allele and AD+P (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.11–3.12, p = 0.018), including both AD+D (OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.10–3.33, p = 0.020) and AD+H (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.01–3.33, p = 0.046). A positive trend was observed in subjects with one copy and AD+P (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.92–2.04), but did not reach significance (p = 0.123). However, in subjects without Lewy bodies, there was minimal association between one or two copies of ε4 allele and AD+P.

The associations became more apparent when the analysis was separated by gender. In females, the likelihood of having two copies of ε4 allele in the presence of Lewy bodies was increased in AD+P (OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.83–11.10, p = 0.001), including both AD+D (OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.75–11.51, p = 0.001), and AD+H (OR = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.31–9.88, p = 0.011). There was no significant association between one copy of ε4 allele and psychosis. The same analyses in males also showed no associations. In females without Lewy bodies, having one or two copies of ε4 allele was not associated with psychosis, even showing negative trends. In males without Lewy bodies, having one or two copies of ε4 allele resulted in an increase in the likelihood of psychosis, but did not reach significance (Figure 2).

DISCUSSION

Our study on a large neuropathologically confirmed series of AD cases show that presence of two copies of APOE ε4 induces psychosis, both delusions and hallucinations. It should be noted that the criteria for delusions on the NPI-Q is mainly persecutory delusions. Therefore, the extent to which ε4 allele affects other types of delusions will need to be further investigated. Previous studies investigating the relationship between APOE ε4 and psychosis have produced mixed results. A comprehensive review by Panza and colleagues summarize the contradictory findings (21). Several studies have reported no association between ε4 allele and psychosis. Studies that have shown positive associations are inconsistent as to whether ε4 allele influences the onset of delusions or hallucinations (21). A study by Chang and colleagues show a strong association between ε4 allele and hallucinations (22). On the other hand, other studies reported a protective effect of ε4 allele on hallucinations (23, 24). With respect to delusions, a longitudinal study by Scarmeas and colleagues found that subjects with one copy of the ε4 allele were at 2.5-fold risk, and two ε4 alleles are at 5.6-fold risk of developing delusions (24). However, several crosssectional and longitudinal studies did not find any associations(23, 25, 26). A recent study by DeMichele-Sweet and colleagues using the NACC database did not find an association between ε4 allele and psychosis (27).

The inconsistencies in the past findings may be due to differences in sample size, criteria for psychosis, and statistical method. Importantly, these studies have based their results on clinical diagnosis of AD as opposed to neuropathologically confirmed diagnosis. A recent study by Fischer and colleagues showed the importance of differentiating the findings from clinical diagnosis and neuropathological diagnosis of AD, showing that findings from clinical diagnosis can drive false results (20). A study by Weiner and colleagues was the first to investigate the relationship between ε4 allele and psychosis in 61 neuropathologically confirmed cases of AD. They found a marginal association between ε4 allele with both delusions and hallucinations (28).

Gender-specific differences in both neuropathological and clinical manifestation of AD is a common finding (17). A study by Corder and colleagues on more than 5000 autopsy cases showed that ε4 allele imposes a greater risk of developing senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangles in females than in males (10). Clinically, a female-specific effect of ε4 allele has been manifested by faster rate of cognitive decline (29), and other neuropsychiatric symptoms including disinhibition and irritability (30). Several studies have also reported that females are at higher risk of developing psychosis (31, 32). On the other hand, a study by Fischer and colleagues using the NACC database did not find an association between gender and psychosis in neuropathologically confirmed AD (20). Our results indicate that although the males and females have similar likelihood of developing psychosis, the ε4 allele is a much more important determinant of this phenotype in females.

Given that ε4 allele is associated with higher AD load (8, 11), several studies have suggested the role of AD load as mediator of psychosis (33). However, a recent study by Fischer and colleagues found no correlation between AD pathology load and psychosis (20). Furthermore, Sweet and colleagues showed no correlation between psychosis and AD load, controlling for Lewy bodies (34). Recent studies have reported that ε4 allele is also related to increased Lewy body pathology (35, 36). In our study, this association was confirmed to be much more prominent and statistically significant in females. Studies examining the role of Lewy body pathology on psychosis have focused on subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies, where psychosis, particularly visual hallucinations, and to a lesser degree delusions are characteristic (37, 38). A study by Engelborghs and colleagues on 11 subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies showed a relationship between ε4 allele and delusions (39).

Our results indicate that the contribution of APOE ε4 to the development of psychosis in AD may be mediated by the formation of Lewy bodies. Furthermore, this association is specific to females. Our study shows that ε4 allele has recessive-like effect in inducing both delusions and hallucinations whereas a single copy of the ε4 allele has minimal effect on this phenotype. While the mechanism is clear cut, it affects a relatively limited subgroup of subjects with psychosis because of the relative rarity of APOE ε4 homozygosity, representing 17% of all subjects with psychosis. Females with two copies of ε4 allele and with Lewy bodies represent 5% of all subjects with psychosis, and the males represent 4% of the population. Therefore, it has a minor contribution to the development of psychosis observed in the AD population in general.

CONCLUSION

The APOE ε4 has recessive-like effect in inducing delusions and hallucinations, which is femalespecific. Furthermore, the mechanism through which this occurs may be through the formation of Lewy bodies.
