This study aimed to explore racial/ethnic differences in the attitudes toward Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and dementia caregiving among midlife women who were family caregivers of persons living with AD (MWPLAD) in the U.S. and examine the associations of the attitudes to their health outcomes. This was a cross-sectional online survey study among 172 MWPLAD. The instruments included: the Attitude toward AD and Related Dementias Scale, the Questions on Attitudes toward AD Caregiving, the Social Readjustment Rating Scale, the EQ-5D-5L and the Midlife Women’s Symptom Index. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. There were significant racial/ethnic differences in caregivers’ attitudes toward dementia caregiving, health-related quality of life, and total severity scores of symptoms (p &lt; .01). Controlling for covariates including race/ethnicity, caregivers’ positive attitudes toward dementia caregiving were significantly associated with their health outcomes (p ≤ .05). Interventions for MWPLAD need to consider racial/ethnical differences in their attitudes toward dementia caregiving.

pmcIntroduction

Persons living with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) spend most of the course of their illness in the community and receive most of their care from informal caregivers usually family caregivers.1 About two thirds of the family caregivers of persons living with AD are women,2,3 and most of them are in their midlife.4,5 Currently, about 11 million adults, mainly midlife women, annually provide about 16 billion hours of family care for people with AD and other dementias.6 The negative influences of caregiving on health outcomes of family caregivers are well documented.7–9 The chronic stress of their role places them at greater risk for morbidity and mortality of chronic diseases/conditions than non-caregiving peers.9–13 The adverse effects of caregiving on their psychological and physical well-being are extensive.7–9

Ongoing research reports that there exist cultural differences in attitudes related to dementia in racial/ethnic minority populations, which subsequently affect timely diagnosis, suboptimal care management, and proper family caregiving for persons living with AD among racial/ethnic minority populations.14–16 For instance, although Asian Americans include highly diverse sub-groups, all Asian Americans across the sub-groups share many common characteristics, one of which is “filial piety,” the belief prescribing that family members are in charge of caregiving roles for older adults.14–16 In addition, African American families closely work with their communities during dementia caregiving because their definition of family is much wider than that of other race/ethnic groups.17 Previous research suggests that African American family caregivers of persons living with dementia differently experience and perceive stress and burden compared with Whites.17,18 Thus it is recommended to consider these unique cultural differences in the attitudes in order to meet the specific needs of family caregivers from racial/ethnic minorities. However, virtually no national scope studies (that could make it possible to get an adequate number of racial/ethnic minority midlife women) comparing attitudes toward AD of multi-racial/ethnic groups of MWPLAD have been conducted. In an integrated literature review on 21 studies on dementia caregiving experience among two or more racial/ethnic, national, or cultural groups, Janevic and Connell35 reported that there were mixed findings on differences in attitudes, coping, and social support among different racial/ethnic groups and suggested that racial/ethnic minority groups might not have adequate support.

Due to cultural attitudes related to AD and family caregiving (e.g., stigma attached to dementia, filial piety, family values, respect for elderly, and fatalism), racial/ethnic minority MWPLAD tend not to share their experience, including their own symptoms, until they get severe/serious symptoms that cannot be tolerated anymore.16,19–21

Due to these cultural attitudes, these women suffer through the symptoms, although many could be easily managed with existing strategies, and/or the women ignore the symptoms that might need immediate medical attention.16,19–21 Subsequently, they have lower quality of life and fewer sources of information and support than White family caregivers.16,19–21

Despite these findings reported in the literature, little is still known about the impact of caregivers’ attitudes toward AD on caregivers’ health outcomes. Previous research supports the negative impact of caregiving burden, stress and coping, or resilience on caregivers’ health outcomes.22–24 In two studies,25,26 caregivers’ attitudes toward dementia and relevant care were significantly associated with caregiver strain, relationship closeness in the family, and satisfaction with social support in the community. In social psychology, attitudes have been regarded as a strong factor influencing behavioral changes that could improve health outcomes.27–34 However, very few studies have been conducted among racial/ethnic minority MWPLAD about the associations of caregivers’ attitudes toward dementia to their health outcomes.22–24

The purpose of this study was to explore racial/ethnic differences in the attitudes toward AD and dementia caregiving and health outcomes among MWPLAD in the U.S. and examine the associations between the attitudes and health outcomes. The specific aims of the study were to:

Aim 1. Explore racial/ethnic differences in attitudes toward AD and dementia caregiving among MWPLAD. Hypothesis 1: There are significant racial/ethnic differences in attitudes toward AD and dementia caregiving among MWPLAD.

Aim 2. Explore racial/ethnic differences in the women’s health outcomes. Hypothesis 2: There are significant racial/ethnic differences in health outcomes of MWPLAD (life event stress, quality of life, and symptoms [total numbers and total severity scores]).

Aim 3. Determine the associations of the women’s attitudes toward AD and dementia caregiving to their health outcomes while controlling selected covariates. Hypothesis 3: There are significant associations between the attitudes toward AD and dementia caregiving of MWPLAD and their health outcomes after controlling for selected covariates including race/ethnicity.

Material and methods

This was a cross-sectional online survey study among MWPLAD in the U.S. The IRB approval was obtained from the institution where the study was conducted.

Settings and Samples

Searches were conducted using Google, Yahoo!, and Bing to identify and verify online communities/groups for midlife women and for racial/ethnic minorities. Then, over 200 communities/groups on the verified list were asked to announce the study through their Web postings, listservs, and regular meetings. Included were midlife women aged 40 to 65 years who were family caregivers of persons living with AD; could read and write English; were currently residing in the U.S.; and had access to the Internet through computers or mobile devices. All the participants provided unpaid assistance (at least average 4 hours per day) for a person in an early to middle stage of AD (Clinical Dementia Rating of ≥ 1) and had no plan for institutionalization in the following six months. One-way ANOVA with an effect size of 0.25, α = 0.05, a power of 0.80, and four groups requires 180. A multiple linear regression analysis with an effect size of 0.15, α = 0.05, a power of 0.80 and 20 predictors requires 157. Thus, the sample size was adequate for the data analyses that were conducted in this study.

Instruments

Caregivers’ sociodemographic and health characteristics.

Caregivers’ sociodemographic characteristics were measured using self-reported questions on age, education, religion, marital status, employment, family income to pay for basics, and sub-ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was transformed to vetor variables, such as African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian compared to the referent group, Whites. Multiple questions on health characteristics included general health status, diagnosed diseases, medical treatments, access to health care, and menopausal status. Menopausal status was categorized into, pre-, peri-, and post-menopausal based on self-reports on menstrual status and regularity.36

Care recipients’ conditions and caregiving characteristicsc.

Care recipients’ conditions were measured using the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE)-short version,37,38 the Lawton IADL Scale,39 and the Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist.40 The IQCODE measured the cognitive status of care-recipients using a 16-item rating scale. Each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1= “much improved” to 5= “much worse”), and the average score was used for the analysis (Cronbach’s α = .92). The Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (24 items) measured the frequencies of memory-related problems, affective distress, and disruptive behaviors in persons living with dementia (0 = “never occurred” to 4 = “daily or more often”) and care-recipients’ symptoms (0 = “not at all bothering” to 4 = “extremely bothering”). Cronbach’s α of both subscales was 0.92.

Caregiving characteristics were assessed by asking about the number of AD care recipients, the presence of shared caregivers, the Ways of Coping Scale41 and the Caregiver Assessment of Behavioral Skill Scale-Self Report.42 The Ways of Coping Scale measured caregivers’ coping status using 66 items on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = “not used” to 3 = “used a great deal”; Cronbach’s α = .94). The Caregiver Assessment of Behavioral Skill Scale-Self Report included 17 items. Each item was measured on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = “seldom true” to 2 = “true most of the time”; Cronbach’s α = .82).

Attitudes toward AD and dementia caregiving.

First, ten items from the Attitude toward Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Scale (DAS)43 were used to measure the attitudes toward AD in three dimensions (affection, behaviour and cognition). The items included responses ranging from “strongly disagree (1)” to “strongly agree (7).” A higher score means more positive attitudes toward AD or more positive attitudes toward dementia caregiving. Cronbach’s α of the subscale on attitudes toward AD was 0.70, and that of the subscale on dementia caregiving was 0.81.

Life event stress.

The Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS)44 was used to measure the women’s life event stress. The SRRS included 41 items on life events (with different weighting depending on the severity of the stressor; 11 to 100). Cronbach’s α of the SRRS was 0.54 among unweighted items and 0.49 among weighted items in this study.

Health-related quality of life.

The EQ-5D-5L45–48 measured the women’s health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L was a generic health status measure by the EuroQol Group to assess the quality of daily life in five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/ depression) with five responses for each dimension on a 5-point Likert scale. The index values were calculated using the EQ-5D-5Lcrosswalk index value calculator, version 2, based on the preferences of the general population in the U.S. (range: 0–1). A higher score indicated better health-related quality of life (Cronbach’s α = 0.90).

Women’s Symptoms.

The Midlife Women’s Symptom Index (MSI)49 was used to measure the women’s symptom experience. MSI included 72 items. Each severity item was measured on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = “not at all” to 4 = “extremely”). The total numbers and severity scores of symptoms were included for the analysis. KR-20 of the MSI frequency subscales (measuring total numbers of symptoms) ranged from 0.66 to .96 while Cronbach’s α of the MSI severity subscales (measuring total severity scores of symptoms) ranged from 0.65 to 0.94.

Data collection process

A website conforming to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the SANS/FBI recommendations, and the Ubuntu Linux security updates was developed. The website included an informed consent sheet, an Internet survey questionnaire, and a social media site for discussion. When potential participants visited the project website, they were asked to review the “informed consent.” Participants consented when they clicked the “I agree to participate” button. When they clicked the button, they were queried to verify that they met the inclusion criteria. Those who did not meet the inclusion criteria were automatically forwarded to a “thank you, but you are not eligible” message page. Only those who met the inclusion criteria were linked to the Internet survey site. Participants were allowed to stop at any time and come back later to complete the questionnaires. The data from the questionnaire were automatically saved in the database. Serial ID numbers were randomly assigned to the data.

Data analysis

All the data were first analyzed using descriptive statistics. Then, to address Aims 1 and 2, the data were analyzed using the one-way ANOVA. For the ANOVA analyses, the Bonferroni tests were used to assist in interpreting any significant differences from the one-way ANOVA analyses. To address Aim 3, the data were analyzed using multiple linear regression analyses. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed to determine the relative contributions of the two attitude scores to the predictions of the health outcomes while controlling for selected co-variates including race/ethnicity. The assumptions of hierarchical linear regressions, including linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity, were met for the analyses. For each health outcome, covariates were selected when the variables were different across the four groups. Both naturally and surgically menopaused women were included, and the type of menopause was included as a potential confounder during the data analysis process. Tolerance statistics and the condition index were checked to detect possibly multicollinearity among independent variables in the regression equations. Education, religion, perceived health status, medication, cognitive status, instrumental activities for daily living, and shared caregiving responsibility were excluded from the model due to concerns on multicollinearity and missing data. Selected covariates were entered in the first block of the model (race/ethnicity) and the second block (age, employment, family income, access to health care, and menopausal status), followed by caregiving characteristics in the third block (caregivers’ reaction to memory and behavioral problems and behavioral skills). Two attitude variables (attitudes toward AD and attitudes toward dementia caregiving) were entered in the final block.

Results

Caregivers’ socio-demographic and health characteristics

A total of 172 MWPLAD were included (36 Whites, 41 African Americans, 40 Hispanics, and 50 Asians). Table 1 summarizes the sociodemographic and health characteristics of the participants. There were significant differences in some characteristics of caregivers by race/ethnicity. Asians tended to be older, unemployed, and with lower family income compared with other racial/ethnic groups (p &lt; .05). Hispanics tended to have a lower level of education compared with other racial/ethnic groups (p &lt; .05). Whites tended to report better perceived health compared with other racial/ethnic groups (p &lt; .05).

Racial/ethnic differences in care-recipients’ conditions, caregiving characteristics, and caregivers’ attitudes and health outcomes (Aims 1 and 2)

Table 2 shows racial/ethnic differences in care-recipients’ conditions, caregiving, and caregivers’ attitudes and health outcomes. There were significant racial/ethnic differences in some care-recipients’ conditions (p &lt;.01). Asian care-recipients tended to have higher cognitive decline compared with African Americans (p = .014) and less impairments in IADLs compared with other racial/ethnic groups (p &lt; .001). Although the numbers of memory/affective/behavioral problems were not significantly different among the four racial/ethnic groups, Asian caregivers perceived the symptoms of their care recipients as more bothering than White caregivers (p = .039). Moreover, Asian caregivers were less likely to share care-giving responsibility (p = .004) and had a lower level of behavioral skills (p = .009) compared with other racial/ethnic groups.

Although there were no significant racial/ethnic differences in caregivers’ attitudes toward AD, there were significant racial/ethnic differences in caregivers’ attitudes toward dementia caregiving (p &lt; .01). African American caregivers had more positive attitudes toward dementia caregiving than Hispanics and Asians (p = .001).

There were significant racial/ethnic differences in some caregivers’ health outcomes (p &lt; .01). Asian caregivers had the lowest health-related quality of life among the four racial/ethnic groups (p &lt; .001). Asian caregivers reported higher total severity scores of symptoms compared with Whites (p &lt; .001). There were no significant racial/ethnic differences in life event stress or the total numbers of symptoms.

Associations between caregivers’ attitudes and health outcomes (Aim 3)

Table 3 shows the results of hierarchical linear regression analyses after controlling for selected covariates including race/ethnicity. Caregivers’ positive attitudes toward dementia caregiving were significantly associated with most of the health outcomes (p &lt; .05). After controlling for all covariates including race/ethnicity, more positive attitudes toward dementia caregiving were significantly associated with lower life event stress (β = −.200, p = .013), higher health-related quality of life (β = .129, p = .020), and lower total numbers of symptoms (β = −.241, p = .003).

Discussions

The findings of this study supported racial/ethnic differences in some caregivers’ characteristics, care-recipients’ conditions, caregivers’ attitudes toward dementia caregiving, and caregivers’ health outcomes including their health-related quality of life and total severity scores of symptoms. Caregivers’ positive attitudes toward dementia caregiving were associated with their health outcomes including life event stress, health-related quality of life, and total numbers of symptoms.

Racial/ethnic differences in caregivers’ characteristics have been reported in the literature, but little is known about Asian caregivers’ characteristics. Most studies on caregivers tended to focus on White, African American, and Hispanic caregivers.50 However, 42 percent of Asian Americans reportedly provided care to older adults while only 22 percent of the U.S. population provided care to older adults.51 Despite fewer studies among Asian caregivers, these studies reported strong beliefs on filial responsibility and stigma attached to dementia among Asian caregivers.52 In the study reported in this paper, Asian caregivers were older, unemployed, and with lower family income compared with other racial/ethnic groups. This finding might be partially due to Asians’ strong cultural beliefs on filial responsibility.53 Asian midlife women caregivers would naturally sacrifice their careers (quit their jobs), and serve the care recipients without adequate support. Indeed, the findings of this study also supported that Asian caregivers tended not to share caregiving responsibility with others despite their lower level of caregivers’ behavioral skills compared with other racial/ethnic groups.

In this study, Asian care-recipients also tended to have worse cognitive status, but less functional impairments in conducting daily living activities compared with other racial/ethnic groups of care-recipients, which has rarely been reported in the literature.52,53 Again, in most existing studies, differences among Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics have been investigated, and inconsistent findings on the differences have been reported. In a study,54 Whites tended to have higher mortality rate from AD compared with other racial/ethnic groups despite their lower incidence and prevalence rates. In another study, among African Americans and Whites born in seven states (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee), African Americans’ age-adjusted and sex-adjusted risk of dementia mortality was higher than Whites.55 Also, studies reported racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of specific behaviors among care recipients among Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics.55 However, little has been reported about Asian care recipients’ conditions, and the few studies among Asian Americans tend to include small samples and be limited mainly to Chinese populations.52,53

The findings on racial/ethnic differences in caregivers’ attitudes toward dementia caregiving are somewhat consistent with the existing literature. African American and Hispanic caregivers reportedly had more positive attitudes toward caregiving compared with Whites.52 However, again, little is still known about Asian American caregivers’ attitudes toward dementia caregiving. In the few studies among Asian Americans, stigma attached to AD has frequently been reported,53 and the stigma subsequently made Asian American caregivers avoid social contacts.56 In a Taiwan study, about 50% of family caregivers reported feeling uncomfortable (22.2%), ashamed (2.6%), or unfriendly (22.5%),57 which would be similar among Asian Americans.

One of the prominent findings of this study was: Whites tended to report better perceived health compared with other racial/ethnic groups, which is inconsistent from those reported in the literature. The inconsistency might come from the nature of this study as an Internet survey; the participants of this study tended to be a selected group of caregivers who had Internet access. In a systematic meta-analysis, Liu et al.58 reported that African American caregivers reportedly had better psychological well-being than White caregivers, and Hispanics caregivers had worse physical well-being than White caregivers. In other studies, African American caregivers had a lower level of depression compared with White caregivers, yet Hispanic and Asian American caregivers had a higher level of depression.7,35

The findings of this study also indicated that there existed significant differences in health outcomes between Asian American caregivers and other racial/ethnic groups; Asian caregivers had lower health-related quality of life and more severe symptoms. This finding is somewhat consistent with the literature on health outcomes of caregivers;7,35 Asian caregivers had more depression compared with White caregivers.7,35 Yet, considering that midlife Asian women reportedly have less prevalent and less severe symptoms compared with other racial/ethnic groups in general,59–61 this finding needs a careful interpretation. This could mean that Asian midlife women caregivers might be more heavily overburdened compared with other racial/ethnic groups of midlife women caregivers. Indeed, as mentioned above, partially due to the stigma attached to dementia, Asian Americans prefer to provide family caregiving,62 and they are less likely to obtain support from the outside of their family.

The associations between caregivers’ attitudes and their health outcomes have rarely been studied though. In the few studies on the associations between caregivers’ attitudes and their health outcomes, it was confirmed that both positive and negative attitudes toward dementia caregiving influenced the caregivers’ well-being and satisfaction with life.63 Also, the associations of caregivers’ attitudes toward dementia caregiving to their health outcomes were found across eight European Countries.64 Thus, reducing negative attitudes toward dementia caregiving would be essential to improve caregivers’ health outcomes.

This study has several limitations because the data were collected through online communities/groups. As mentioned above, there might exist selection bias because all the participants should have the access to the Internet. Only self-reported data were collected, and there was no validation process of the self-reported data. Finally, due to a small sample size in individual race/ethnic groups, separate regression models for individual racial/ethnic groups could not be conducted to compare the relative predictive values of significant variables.

Conclusions

This study supported racial/ethnic differences in caregivers’ attitudes toward dementia caregiving and caregivers’ health outcomes including their health-related quality of life and total severity scores of symptoms. Caregivers’ positive attitudes toward dementia caregiving were significantly associated with their health outcomes including life event stress, health-related quality of life, and total numbers of symptoms. Based on these findings, this paper concludes with the following implications for future research and practice with racial/ethnic minority MWPLAD. First of all, further in-depth cultural studies are needed to develop future interventions for racial/ethnic minority MWPLAD, especially Asian American MWPLAD. Considering racial/ethnic differences in caregivers’ attitudes toward dementia caregiving, cultural findings would be essential for cultural tailoring in the development of interventions for racial/ethnic minority MWPLAD. Second, more studies on Asian American MWPLAD are warranted. As mentioned above, most studies among racial/ethnic minority family caregivers have been conducted among African American and Hispanic family caregivers, and little is known about Asian family caregivers. Considering the findings reported in this study, Asian MWPLAD would be heavily overburdened without adequate support, but rarely studied and underserved. Third, objective measurements of health outcomes need to be included in future research to confirm the findings reported in this paper. Finally, more interventions for racial/ethnic minority MWPLAD need to be developed and used to foster positive attitudes toward dementia caregiving in order to improve their health outcomes by enhancing their ability to care for PLAD.
