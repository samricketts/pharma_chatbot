To the Editor:

Serious hypoglycemia from the use of insulin secretagogues is one of the most common and clinically significant adverse drug events.1 A screening study by Han et al.2 identified signals of drugs that might be associated with serious hypoglycemia when used with insulin secretagogues, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) drugs were among those signals. That study used the self-controlled case-series design, which inherently controls for confounding by time-invariant patient factors, but did not control for time-varying confounders. We sought to confirm these signals in an independent database (Medicaid), using the self-controlled case-series design with adjustment for time-varying factors.

We used Medicaid claims data from five states (California, Florida, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania) from 1999-2012, supplemented with Medicare claims for dual-enrollees. The exposure of interest was use of an AD drug—donepezil, galantamine, memantine, or rivastigmine (precipitant drugs3)—during use of an insulin secretagogue—glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide, nateglinide, or repaglinide—or metformin (object drugs3). The outcome of interest was hospital presentation with serious hypoglycemia, ascertained by discharge diagnosis codes appearing in the principal position of inpatient claims or any position of emergency department claims (positive predictive value: 78%4-89%5) (eTable 1). We used the self-controlled case-series design and additionally controlled for time-varying factors: drugs that may cause hypo- or hyperglycemia; drugs that may interact with insulin secretagogues; and acute infection (eTable 2). Object drug-specific observation time was censored by the first occurrence of: end of supply of the object drug; Medicaid disenrollment; dataset end. We used conditional Poisson regression to calculate confounder-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for serious hypoglycemia during use of an object drug with vs. without an AD drug. Adults (age ≥18 years) continuously enrolled in Medicaid for at least 180 days free of a dispensing for an object drug before the first observed episode of that object drug who experienced at least one outcome event during the object drug observation time, were eligible. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Pennsylvania.

The number of persons experiencing the outcome, the number of outcome occurrences during observation time, person-days of observation time, and the median observation time per individual by object drug are reported in the Table. The median age at start of observation was 61.2-71.1 years, and the proportion of females ranged 62.6-66.6% (eTable 3). The Figure shows adjusted RRs (sensitivity analyses results were similar; eTables 4 and 5). AD drugs examined were not associated with an elevated risk of serious hypoglycemia when used with sulfonylureas. Galantamine and donepezil showed elevated RRs in users of metformin (RR=1.84; 95% CI, 1.03-3.29) and nateglinide (RR=3.19; 95% CI, 1.34-7.59), respectively. It is unclear whether these associations represent drug interactions, since neither drug pair was previously identified as a potential signal, and we included metformin as a negative control. Further, we know of no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic mechanisms to explain drug interactions of these agents. Nateglinide is metabolized primarily through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, with a minor portion through CYP3A4,6 while donepezil does not affect CYP2C9 and is unlikely to affect the metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates at therapeutic concentrations.7 Metformin is excreted renally,8 and we are aware of no mechanism by which an interaction with AD drugs could cause hypoglycemia in users of metformin. Also, chance findings are possible given the large number of associations examined.

Thus, our findings did not confirm previous signals of an increased rate in serious hypoglycemia with concomitant use of AD drugs and sulfonylureas.
