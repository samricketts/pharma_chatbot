Introduction:

We identified a “cognitive clock,” a novel indicator of brain health that provides person-specific estimates of cognitive age, and tested the hypothesis that cognitive age is a better predictor of brain health than chronological age in two independent datasets.

Methods:

The initial analyses were based on 1057 participants from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study who began without impairment and underwent cognitive assessments up to 24 years. A shape invariant model characterized the latent pattern of cognitive decline, conceptualized here as the “cognitive clock,” and yielded person-specific estimates of cognitive age. Survival analyses examined cognitive versus chronological age for predicting Alzheimer’s disease dementia, mild cognitive impairment and mortality, and regression analyses examined associations of cognitive versus chronological age with neuropathology and brain atrophy. Finally, we applied the cognitive clock to an independent validation sample of 2592 participants from the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a biracial population-based study, to confirm the predictive utility of cognitive age.

Results:

The “cognitive clock” showed that cognition remained stable until a cognitive age of about 80, then declined moderately until 90, then declined precipitously. In the initial dataset, cognitive age was a better predictor of dementia, mild cognitive impairment and mortality than chronological age, and was more strongly associated with neuropathology and brain atrophy. Application of the cognitive clock to the independent validation sample provided further support for the utility of cognitive age as a strong prognostic indicator of adverse outcomes.

Discussion:

Cognitive age is a robust prognostic indicator of adverse health outcomes and may serve as a useful biomarker in aging research.

pmc1 | INTRODUCTION

Chronological age is the leading risk factor for several adverse health outcomes including dementia, disability, and mortality.1–3 Morbidity increases dramatically with advancing age, and recognition of the link between chronological age and disease has led to a widespread view of aging as a time of progressive deterioration. Aging does not affect individuals uniformly, however, and accurate prediction of important health outcomes using chronological age remains a challenge. For example, chronological age is not (or only weakly) related to cognitive decline and dementia after accounting for common neuropathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology.4–7 Thus, it is not chronological age per se that drives adverse cognitive outcomes but rather deteriorating brain health due to pathologic factors.5,8 Many of the hallmarks of brain aging (e.g., neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies) cannot readily be quantified during life, however, limiting our ability to estimate brain health and make precise predictions regarding cognitive and other health outcomes. Novel indicators of brain health and methods to identify individuals at high risk of adverse outcomes are urgently needed to facilitate strategies to promote independence and well-being in old age.

Cognitive performance is a key output of brain function, and longitudinal cognitive data provide a unique window into brain health. It has been challenging to effectively leverage longitudinal cognitive data to estimate brain health, however, in part due to considerable heterogeneity in longitudinal cognitive trajectories. In this study, we used data from 1057 older persons who began without cognitive impairment and underwent annual cognitive assessments including the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) for up to 24 years before death to identify a “cognitive clock,” an indicator of brain health.9 Toward this end, we used an innovative statistical approach, the shape invariant model, to first characterize the latent profile of cognitive decline in old age (i.e., the typical pattern of cognitive change observed on the MMSE over many years), referred to here as the cognitive clock.9,10 Importantly, the shape invariant model reduces heterogeneity in longitudinal cognitive trajectories by aligning participants along the clock. Next, we used the clock to empirically derive a cognitive age for each individual at each evaluation and tested the hypothesis that cognitive age is a better predictor of AD dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mortality than chronological age. We also examined the associations of cognitive versus chronological age with neurobiologic indices including neuropathology and brain atrophy, and compared the associations of cognitive age versus an established biomarker, cortical DNA methylation age, with adverse outcomes.11 Finally, we applied the cognitive clock to an independent validation sample of 2592 participants from the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a biracial population-based study of AD dementia and related disorders, to confirm the utility of cognitive age for predicting incident dementia, MCI, and mortality.12

2 | METHODS

2.1 | Participants

The initial analyses were based on deceased older persons from two ongoing clinical–pathologic cohort studies, the Religious Orders Study (ROS), which began in 1994, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), which began in 1997; the design and operations of these studies (ROSMAP) are essentially identical. ROS participants are older Catholic clergy from across the United States, and MAP participants are community-based persons from greater Chicago.13 Participants enroll without known dementia and undergo annual clinical evaluations and brain autopsy. All participants signed an informed consent form and Uniform Anatomical Gift Act for organ donation and the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center approved each study.

There were three criteria for inclusion in these analyses: absence of cognitive impairment at baseline; a valid MMSE score at baseline and at least one follow-up evaluation; and deceased. At the time of these analyses (June 13, 2019), 3564 participants had completed the baseline evaluation. We excluded 213 persons with dementia and 884 persons with MCI at baseline. Of the remaining 2467 individuals, we excluded 56 who died before the first follow-up cognitive evaluation and 213 who were enrolled less than 1 year. This left 2198 individuals and follow-up cognitive data were available for 2188 (99.5%). Of those, 1058 died and we excluded one person who was &lt; 65 at baseline. Thus, there were a total of 1057 individuals in the initial analytic group.

After our initial series of analyses, we applied the cognitive clock to an independent validation sample, the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), a biracial population-based study of the epidemiology of AD dementia and related disorders among adults over the age of 65.12 CHAP started in 1993 and continued until 2012. In total, the CHAP study enrolled 10,801 participants residing on the south side of Chicago. Cognitive tests including the MMSE were administered every 3 years for up to six population assessments over the duration of the study. At each of these population assessments, a stratified random sample of participants was selected for a detailed clinical evaluation including diagnosis of prevalent and incident AD dementia starting in 1994. A total of 2864 participants completed at least one detailed clinical evaluation and were eligible for these analyses; of those, we excluded 272 who had only one MMSE measurement. Thus, there were a total of 2592 individuals in the validation dataset. The Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center approved the CHAP study and all participants provided signed written informed consent.

2.2 | Clinical evaluation

Annual clinical evaluations for ROSMAP include detailed neurologic examinations, cognitive assessments, and medical history interviews.13–15 Clinical diagnosis of AD dementia is made annually by an experienced clinician according to the criteria of the joint working group of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA).14 Diagnoses of MCI are rendered for individuals deemed to have cognitive impairment of insufficient severity for dementia.13,15

CHAP examiners blinded to population interview findings, cognitive testing, and stratum of individuals selected for the clinical evaluations performed uniform detailed assessments between 1994 and 2012.12 These detailed evaluations included a structured medical history, neurologic examinations, and a battery of neurocognitive tests. A board-certified neurologist, blinded to previous testing results, provided dementia diagnoses according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.14 Diagnoses of AD dementia required a history of cognitive decline and evidence of impairment in memory and one or more other cognitive domains. Diagnoses of MCI were rendered for individuals deemed to have cognitive impairment of insufficient severity for dementia.

2.3 | Cognitive function testing

The MMSE is administered annually in ROSMAP and at triennial evaluations in CHAP.9 Repeated MMSE scores served as the primary cognitive measure used in these analyses. However, more detailed cognitive assessments are used for clinical diagnoses of AD and MCI in both studies.11–15

2.4 | Post mortem MRI protocol

Brains were hemisected at autopsy and the hemisphere with more visible pathology was chosen for MRI and neuropathologic evaluation. Hemispheres were immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution at 4°C and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done about one month post mortem. The protocol included a multi-echo fast spin echo sequence with slice thickness of 1.5 mm and in-plane resolution of 0.625×0.625 mm2. The whole cerebral hemisphere and hippocampal formation were segmented using an automated procedure in which two masks (whole-hemisphere and hippocampus) were spatially warped to the space of each specimen’s image.17 In this approach, the volumes of warped masks (number of voxels included in each mask multiplied by the voxel volume) serve as the whole-hemisphere and hippocampal volumes, respectively. The automated results also were visually inspected for quality control.

2.5 | Neuropathologic assessment

Immediately after MRI, the same hemisphere was cut into 1-cm slabs for a uniform structured neuropathologic evaluation.4–7,13,17 A modified Bielschowsky silver stain protocol was used for a National Institute on Aging–Reagan pathologic diagnosis of AD. Non-AD neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., Lewy bodies, TDP, and hippocampal sclerosis) were rated as present or absent. Specifically, Lewy bodies in amygdala, substantia nigra, limbic, or neocortical regions were identified using antibodies to α-synuclein. TDP pathology was examined using antibodies to a phosphorylated monoclonal TAR5P-1D3 (pS409/410; 1:100, Ascenion). Hippocampal sclerosis, the presence of severe neuronal loss, and gliosis in CA1 and/or subiculum was examined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Cerebrovascular conditions including old macroscopic and microinfarcts, amyloid angiopathy, atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis were assessed and rated as present/absent.

2.6 | Cortical DNA methylation age

For supporting analyses comparing cognitive age to an established biomarker of aging, we used the cortical DNA methylation clock (i.e., “DNAmClock”) developed using an elastic net regression model following the methodology described by Horvath.20 Briefly, this approach identified a set of 347 DNA methylation sites that, in combination, optimally predict age in the human cortex. The sum of DNA methylation levels at these sites weighted by their regression coefficients provides the cortical age estimate.

2.7 | Statistical analysis

The initial analyses used data from ROSMAP participants, and the validation analyses used data from CHAP participants, as detailed below.12,13 First, we used a shape invariant model to develop the cognitive clock, that is, the latent pattern of cognitive change over time.10 In this approach, we assume that cognitive change over time follows a standard pattern that can be estimated by a common shape function that effectively minimizes heterogeneity observed in the longitudinal trajectories.

The shape invariant model is specified as follows. Denote by Cogij the observed longitudinal measure of cognition for subject i at visit j, where i = 1, …, n with n the total number of subjects and j = 1, …, mi with mi the number of visits for the ith subject. The Ageij is the chronological age for subject i. The shape invariant model for cognitive aging assumes that (1) Cogij=μ(ai+(Ageij−65)×exp(bi))+c0+eij,

where μ is the common shape function, c0 is a global shift parameter, and eij is the residual term accounting for the measurement error. Based on the shape invariant model, we define the cognitive age as (2) CogAgeij=ai+(Ageij−65)×exp(bi),

where ai is the person-specific cognitive age when chronological age = 65, and exp(bi) is the person-specific relative rate of cognitive aging versus chronological aging, where a value greater than 1 means that the cognitive age progressed faster than the chronological age, and a value smaller than 1 means slower. Of note, while chronological age was incorporated as necessary in the estimation of cognitive age, education and sex were not; thus, estimation of the cognitive age index does not depend on those factors.

According to the shape invariant model, participants with the same cognitive age should have the same cognition score except for measurement error. This is achieved by (1) shifting the observed cognition trajectories horizontally to the left (ai &lt; 0, if a person had a higher than average cognition score at age 65) or right (ai &gt; 0, if lower), and (2) compressing (exp(bi) &lt; 1, if a person is aging slower in cognition than chronological age) or stretching (exp(bi) &gt; 1, if faster) the trajectories to match the common shape function.

Late-life cognitive decline tends to be nonlinear; thus, the common shape function μ was modeled as a cubic B-spline between age 60 and 110, with four interior knots located at 70, 80, 90, and 100. We estimated μ by a nonparametric mixed effects model based on the longitudinal cognitive trajectories aligned on the chronological age. In this way, μ(t) stands for the mean cognition score at age t.18 Of note, μ(t) did not need to assume any parametric form (e.g., polynomial, sigmoidal, etc.); rather, it was estimated using a purely data-driven approach by maximizing the likelihood of the nonlinear mixed-effects model.

To examine whether cognitive age is a better indicator of AD dementia, MCI, and mortality than chronological age, we compared the Kaplan-Meier survival curves on the cognitive age scale and the chronological age scale, respectively. A steeper survival curve indicates better prediction. In addition, we estimated the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of cognitive and chronological age by treating the two ages as simple predictors of dementia, and separately MCI diagnosis and mortality, at each follow-up year from study entry up to 24 years. The higher the values of the AUC, the better the predictive power of the corresponding age scale. We further examined the association of cognitive age at death with the pathological AD diagnosis using logistic regression and compared its predictive power to chronological age at death using AUC.

Next, we investigated the relation of cognitive age and chronological age at death with brain volumes first using bivariate correlations. Then, linear regression models examined the association of cognitive age with brain volumes before and after adjusting for chronological age, and compared their predictive performances using variance explained.

We conducted several additional analyses to ensure the robustness of findings. First, because learning can occur in the early years of repeated cognitive testing, we refit the shape invariant model by excluding the first two cognitive assessments to determine whether learning influenced the clock. Second, we re-estimated the cognitive clock using a global cognitive measure derived from a much more detailed battery of 17 cognitive tests for comparison with the clock based on the MMSE (Section 2 in supporting information).13,16 Third, we used an alternative modeling approach, time-varying Cox models, to test the hypothesis that cognitive age is a better predictor of incident adverse outcomes than chronological age after further adjusting for sex and education (Section 4 in supporting information). Fourth, because other biomarkers of aging (i.e., cortical DNA methylation age) have been proposed and validated, we compared the associations of cognitive age and DNA methylation age to the outcomes of interest here.11

Finally, to confirm the utility of the cognitive age index as a prognostic indicator of adverse outcomes, we applied the clock developed in ROSMAP to an independent validation dataset, CHAP.12 After estimating cognitive ages for each CHAP participant at each evaluation, we repeated the Kaplan-Meier and AUC analyses described above to examine associations with incident AD dementia, MCI, and mortality.

All preprocessing and statistical analyses were performed using R program version 3.6.0.19 The nonparametric mixed effects model and the shape invariant model were fitted by the R package nlme. We used Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion scores to determine the optimal fitting of the shape invariant model. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated by the survival package, and the time-dependent AUC were calculated by the timeROC package.

3 | RESULTS

3.1 | Participant characteristics

Participants (n = 1057) in the initial analyses had a mean age at baseline of 79.1 years (standard deviation [SD] = 6.7), a mean of 16.3 years of education (SD = 3.8), and 732 (69.3%) were female. The mean baseline MMSE score was 28.4 (SD = 1.63), and the mean length of follow up was 8.8 years (SD = 5.2, range = 0.7 to 23.6). They died at a mean age of 89.1 (SD = 6.7) and the mean MMSE proximate to death was 23.5 (SD = 1.6). At death, 443 participants remained free of cognitive impairment, 232 had MCI, and 316 had AD dementia.

3.2 | Cognitive trajectories before and after alignment to the cognitive clock

First, we examined the longitudinal cognitive (MMSE) data according to participants’ chronological age when the assessments were performed. Figure 1A (left panel, colored lines) shows the person-specific trajectories of change in cognition; as expected, we observed both linear and nonlinear patterns in individual trajectories and there was substantial heterogeneity around the mean trajectory of decline (solid black line). The mean squared error between the individual trajectories and the mean trajectory was 20.53.

Next, we used the shape invariant model to align the longitudinal cognitive data according to a common trajectory defined on the latent cognitive age scale. Figure 1B shows the cognitive trajectories on the cognitive age scale; notably the majority of individual trajectories aligned closely around the common trajectory and the mean squared error reduced about 8-fold to 2.61, suggesting that this trajectory captured the typical pattern of cognitive decline well. Further, the common trajectory, conceptualized as the “cognitive clock,” shows that cognition remains relatively flat until a cognitive age of about 80 years, then declines moderately until about 90, then declines precipitously.

In sensitivity analyses, because prior work has shown that cognitive function can improve in the early years of repeated cognitive testing as a result of learning, we repeated the analysis just described in a subgroup of 935 individuals with a minimum of four annual cognitive data points and excluded the first two data points for each individual. Overall, the fitted results were extremely similar to the original analysis (Section 1 in supporting information). Further, estimates of cognitive age did not significantly differ with or without the first two cognitive data points for the majority of individuals (correlation between the two cognitive ages = 0.99, P &lt; .0001), suggesting that learning did not affect the clock identified here. In addition, because the choice of cognitive test used for the estimation of the clock could have influenced the result, we compared the cognitive clock based on the MMSE to one generated using a much more robust measure of global cognitive function based on 17 tests (Section 2 in supporting information). The clocks were extremely similar, supporting the robustness of the modeling approach applied herein for elucidating the common trajectory of cognitive decline.

3.3 | Profiles of aging: cognitive versus chronological age

The shape invariant model offers a one-to-one estimation of the cognitive age given a specific chronological age. The correlation between cognitive age and chronological age at baseline was 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52–0.60, P &lt; .001), and at death was 0.43 (95% CI = 0.38–0.48, P &lt; .001. Figure 2 shows the spaghetti plots of the estimated cognitive age versus the chronological age over time. There is significant variation in person-specific aging processes, with cognitive age progressing faster than chronological age for some and chronological age progressing faster than cognitive age for others.

Next, we compared participants to older versus younger cognitive ages relative to their chronological age at death in terms of demographic variables, AD dementia diagnosis, time to death, and pathological indices (Table 1). On average, participants whose cognitive age was older than their chronological age at death were substantially more likely to develop AD dementia and did so more rapidly, died earlier, and had lower cognitive scores at baseline and proximate to death. Further, those whose cognitive age exceeded their chronological age at death had a greater burden of AD pathology, Lewy bodies, and macroscopic infarcts, but fewer microinfarcts.

3.4 | Cognitive versus chronological age and clinical diagnosis

Because we hypothesized that the cognitive clock is an indicator of brain health, we next examined cognitive trajectories on the cognitive and chronological age scales, respectively, for three groups of participants (Figure 3): (1) those who died without cognitive impairment, (2) those who died with MCI, and (3) those who died with AD dementia. As shown in the top panel, when modeled on the cognitive age scale (Figure 3A), the trajectories of participants with no cognitive impairment (NCI) tended to remain in the left half of the cognitive aging trajectory, where cognition shows little decline; by contrast, there was greater spread along the common trajectory among those with MCI and dementia, with many falling into the segment with significant decline. Further, as shown in the boxplot (bottom panel), cognitive age at death was clearly separated across the three diagnostic groups, with participants who died with AD dementia considerably older in terms of cognitive age compared to those with MCI or without cognitive impairment. By contrast, when modeled on the chronological age scale (Figure 3B), there was significant heterogeneity in individual trajectories for all three groups and the trajectories spread out farther along the common trajectory. Further, although participants who died with cognitive impairment on average tended to be chronologically older, the chronological age at death for the three groups overlapped considerably.

3.5 | Cognitive age versus chronological age for the prediction of AD dementia, MCI, and mortality

To test the hypothesis that cognitive age is a better predictor of adverse health outcomes than chronological age, we first compared cognitive versus chronological age as prognostic indicators for AD dementia diagnosis and mortality. Figure 4A shows the Kaplan-Meier estimates of the dementia-free survival curves for cognitive age and chronological age. The survival curve for cognitive age was much steeper than that of chronological age, suggesting that cognitive age is a much more accurate indicator of AD dementia. To verify this, we examined the time-dependent AUC of the two age scales for prediction of dementia diagnosis using years since baseline as the time index. As shown in Figure 4B, the AUC of the cognitive age was steadily around 0.95 and clearly outperformed the AUC of the chronological age. We also examined the predictive performance of both ages on (1) MCI (any type), (2) amnestic MCI, and (3) non-amnestic MCI (Section 3 in supporting information). In these analyses, cognitive age predicted the risk of MCI and its subcategories very well (AUC &gt; 0.8 when follow-up &gt; = 5 years), and again outperformed chronological age.

Figure 5A shows the survival curves of mortality for cognitive age and chronological age and Figure 5B shows the time-dependent AUC of the two age scales in the prediction of death. Again, cognitive age had a steeper survival curve, particularly between the ages of 75 and 95, and predicted death more accurately than chronological age throughout the follow-up time.

Further, to confirm the robustness of these findings, we used an alternative modeling approach, time-varying Cox models, to test the hypothesis that cognitive age is a better predictor of adverse outcomes than chronological age after controlling for sex and education (Section 4 in supporting information). In all cases, cognitive age was a better predictor of adverse outcomes and the associations of cognitive age with health outcomes were relatively independent of sex and education, factors known to impact cognitive function.

3.6 | Cognitive age versus chronological age as indicators of neuropathology

Next, we compared cognitive versus chronological age at death as indicator of pathological AD diagnosis using logistic regression analysis. In separate models, both cognitive age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.10–1.16, P &lt; .001) and chronological age (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.07–1.11, P &lt; .001) were significantly associated with pathologic AD diagnosis. However, the predictive performance of cognitive age (AUC = 0.72) was better than chronological age (AUC = 0.65). When considered simultaneously, both cognitive and chronological age were associated with pathologic AD but the adjusted OR of chronological age was more attenuated (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02–1.07, P &lt; .001) than the adjusted OR of cognitive age (OR = 1.y11, 95% CI = 1.08–1.14, P &lt; .001). The AUC of the multivariable model was 0.73; notably, adding cognitive age to the model after chronological age greatly improved the AUC by 0.08, while adding chronological age to the model after cognitive age only improved the AUC by 0.01. Thus, cognitive age was a stronger indicator of pathologic AD than chronological age.

3.7 | Cognitive age versus chronological age as indicators of brain atrophy

Finally, we compared cognitive versus chronological age as indicator of brain atrophy, namely hemisphere and hippocampal volumes derived from post mortem MRI, in a subsample of 367 individuals with available imaging data. In correlation analyses, cognitive age was slightly more strongly correlated with the indicators of brain atrophy than chronological age (Table 2). Figure 6A–D shows the scatter plots of cognitive and chronological age versus the two brain volumes. Further, in separate regression models, both cognitive and chronological age were significantly associated with the two brain volumes (Table 3). For hemisphere volume, cognitive age explained slightly more variance (R2 = 0.090) than chronological age (R2 = 0.082), but for hippocampal volume, cognitive age explained considerably more variance (R2 = 0.213) than chronological age (R2 = 0.141). Considered simultaneously, cognitive age and chronological age both were associated with both brain volumes; of note, however, cognitive age explained an additional 4.4% of the variance in hemisphere volume, and separately 12.1% variance in hippocampal volume, above and beyond chronological age.

3.8 | Cognitive age versus cortical DNA methylation age

Prior studies have proposed and validated other biomarkers of aging, with DNA methylation ages among the most established.11,20–23 Thus, to examine the utility of cognitive age versus cortical DNA methylation age, we compared the associations of the two indices to pathological AD and clinical AD dementia diagnosis in a subsample of 401 participants for whom cortical DNA methylation age was available, and brain atrophy in a subsample of 133 participants for whom both cortical DNA methylation age and brain imaging data were available.

In separate models for pathological AD diagnosis, both cognitive age (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.09–1.17, P &lt; .001) and DNA methylation age (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.07–1.15) were significantly associated with pathologic AD diagnosis (Section 5 in supporting information). The predictive performance of cognitive age (AUC = 0.71) was better than DNA methylation age (AUC = 0.65). Considered simultaneously, both cognitive age (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.08–1.14) and DNA methylation age (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02–1.07) remained significant, showing that cognitive age is an independent predictor of pathological AD diagnosis above and beyond DNA methylation age. For dementia diagnosis, only cognitive age remained significant when the two ages were considered together, however (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.54–1.93).

In separate models for brain atrophy, both cognitive age and DNA methylation age were significantly associated with hemisphere and hippocampus volumes. For hemisphere volume, cognitive age explained more variance (R2 = 0.071) than DNA methylation age (R2 = 0.062). For hippocampal volume, cognitive age explained slightly less variance (R2 = 0.161) than DNA methylation age (R2 = 0.166); notably, however, when included in the same model, cognitive age remained associated with both brain volumes, while DNA methylation age was associated with hippocampal volume but not hemisphere volume (coefficient = −1.86, 95% CI = −3.84 to 0.12, P = .066).

3.9 | Validation of cognitive age in an independent dataset: CHAP

Finally, to validate the utility of the cognitive age index, we examined its predictive utility for the primary clinical outcomes, AD dementia, MCI, and mortality in an independent dataset, CHAP, using both Kaplan-Meier curves and the time-dependent AUC as in the initial analyses. Participants (n = 2,592) in the validation analyses had a mean age at baseline of 73.7 years (SD = 6.4), a mean education of 12.6 years (SD = 3.6), and 1608 (62.0%) were female. The mean baseline MMSE was 26.1 (SD = 4.7), and the mean length of follow-up was 10.8 years (SD = 4.3), with an average of 3.5 MMSE measurements (SD = 1.2). During follow-up, 803 (31.0%) participants developed MCI, 491 (18.9%) developed AD dementia, and 1424 (54.9%) died, with a mean MMSE at death of 21.7 (SD = 8.0).

We applied the cognitive clock identified in ROSMAP to data from CHAP and derived an estimated cognitive age for each participant at each evaluation. Figures 7A,B, 8A,B, and 9A,B, respectively, show the results for AD dementia, MCI, and mortality. In these analyses, the Kaplan-Meier curve of cognitive age for AD dementia diagnosis was much steeper than that of chronological age, and the time-dependent AUC of cognitive age were all significantly higher (better) than those of chronological age. These findings offer strong independent sample validation that cognitive age is a better marker of AD dementia, MCI, and mortality than chronological age.

4 | DISCUSSION

This study used an innovative analytic approach to longitudinal cognitive data to identify a “cognitive clock,” a novel indicator of brain health that may serve as a useful biomarker in aging research. The cognitive clock represents the dominant profile of cognitive aging and yields person-specific estimates of cognitive age (i.e., an individual’s position along the clock). We demonstrate here that cognitive age outperforms chronological age as an indicator of several adverse outcomes. Specifically, we first showed that cognitive age was a better predictor of AD dementia, MCI, and mortality than chronological age and more strongly associated with neurobiologic indices of brain health including neuropathology and brain volumes using ROSMAP data. We then validated the utility of cognitive age for predicting adverse health outcomes in an independent dataset. These findings provide strong support for cognitive age as a biomarker of brain health that may facilitate identification of individuals at high risk of adverse health outcomes.

This study extends prior research in several important ways. First, it greatly advances our understanding of the profile of cognitive aging. There has been a longstanding interest in identifying the typical trajectory of late life decline; however, this profile was elusive. This was due to several factors, including a lack of sufficiently dense longitudinal cognitive data, challenges related to modeling heterogeneous trajectories, and debate about the optimal functional form to use in the context of cognitive aging.29 In this work, we leveraged data from large cohort studies with dense longitudinal cognitive data collected over more than two decades and used a flexible nonparametric common shape function to characterize the latent trajectory of cognitive decline. This model minimizes misspecification and offers a data-driven approach that retains person-specific heterogeneity in the form of the metric it yields, cognitive age. Thus, the model identifies the dominant profile of cognitive aging (i.e., the cognitive clock) and still allows person-specific variability around that profile. The cognitive clock identified here shows that cognition is relatively stable in old age until a cognitive age of about 80 years, then declines moderately until about 90, then precipitously until death. This profile challenges the view of aging as a time of gradually progressive cognitive deterioration and provides a more nuanced understanding of the profile of cognitive aging.

Second, this study directly addresses the challenge posed by the fact that age is the number one risk factor for dementia yet an imperfect prognostic indicator of cognitive impairment and other adverse health outcomes. Individual differences in longstanding (e.g., education) as well as aging-related factors that influence cognition (e.g., neuropathologic burden, resilience factors) limit the accuracy of predictions based on chronological age. Here, after first aligning individual cognitive trajectories to the cognitive clock,10 we were able to estimate each individual’s position on the clock at a given time point (i.e., their cognitive age) and use cognitive age to make inferences about brain health. We observed clear distinctions between participants without cognitive impairment, MCI, and AD dementia when cognitive trajectories were modeled using the cognitive age scale. By contrast, such distinctions were not evident when trajectories were modeled using chronological age. In addition, an older cognitive age compared to chronological age at death was associated with lower cognition, higher frequency of dementia diagnosis and a more rapid time to diagnosis, a more rapid time to death, and a greater burden of potent neuropathologies. Together, these findings strongly suggest that longitudinal cognitive data provide a powerful tool to estimate brain health and that the “cognitive clock” yields a valuable and novel biomarker (i.e., cognitive age).

Third, this study shows that cognitive age is a better predictor than chronological age of AD dementia and death and more strongly related to neurobiologic indices including neuropathology and brain volumes. There is great interest in biomarkers that can facilitate identification of individuals at high risk of adverse health outcomes. Indeed, the “DNA methylation clock” has gained attention as an age estimation method that uses DNA methylation levels to improve prediction of adverse health outcomes,20–23 and neuroimaging measures have similarly been used to estimate “brain age.”24–26 The “cognitive clock” is conceptually similar to such age estimators but is based on readily available and inexpensive behavioral data (i.e., MMSE scores) and provides an index of brain health as opposed to age. Here, we showed that cognitive age was a much better predictor than chronological age of AD dementia, MCI, and mortality. Cognitive age also was a stronger indicator of neuropathology, brain volumes, and dementia diagnosis than both chronological age and cortical DNA methylation age. Moreover, we were able to apply the cognitive clock in an independent validation sample from a biracial population-based study with similar success and highly consistent results; this speaks to the generalizability of cognitive age across diverse datasets and the robustness of the cognitive age index as a predictive marker. Together, these findings provide compelling evidence that cognitive age has unique predictive utility for adverse cognitive outcomes and is a robust indicator of brain health. With appropriate development and validation, the cognitive age metric identified here may be useful for prediction of adverse outcomes at the individual level and perhaps even when derived from a single assessment (i.e., a single MMSE score). Cognitive age therefore may have broad applicability both in clinical and research settings (e.g., clinical trials) and may facilitate early and accurate identification of individuals at increased risk of adverse outcomes.

Fourth, this study provides the foundation for future efforts to estimate brain health via behavioral data. That is, cognitive decline is a primary manifestation of brain aging, but other behaviors also are affected by accumulating neuropathology and deteriorating brain health. For example, alterations in complex behaviors such as decision making occur before cognitive impairment is detectable and are very early harbingers of adverse cognitive outcomes and accumulating neuropathology.27,28 The statistical approach used herein can be applied to other longitudinal behavioral data and phenotypes as appropriate. Additional work is needed to identify other novel applications.

This study has strengths and limitations. The availability of detailed cognitive data from participants who started without cognitive impairment and were followed for many years and with very high rates of follow-up provided a sound platform from which to elucidate the latent profile of late life cognitive decline, the “cognitive clock.” The modeling approach allowed us to disentangle heterogeneity in cognitive trajectories by aligning individuals along a common trajectory and this approach proved to be quite robust. Further, validation of our findings based on ROSMAP in an independent dataset, CHAP, supports the generalizability of cognitive age as a useful biomarker across diverse samples. A limitation is that there likely are multiple sources of variability in person-specific cognitive age (e.g., lifestyle factors) that were not examined here; investigation of such factors warrants a separate and systematic focus. Future studies are needed to further validate the utility of cognitive age as a biomarker of brain health and elucidate the determinants of individual differences in cognitive age.
