Insulin resistance (IR) has been related to reduced cerebral glucose metabolism in regions identified as hypometabolic in Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome. Insulin secretion (IS) has been less studied than IR despite findings that decreased IS is an early indicator of future type 2 diabetes and a potential predictor of Alzheimer’ clinical syndrome. We investigated whether higher IR and lower IS would be associated with greater age-related reductions in regional cerebral glucose metabolism and worse cognitive performance. Two-hour oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography were performed on 1-2 occasions on a sample of healthy middle-aged and older adults from the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). Neuropsychological tests were completed during ADRC Clinical Core visits. Pattern of findings suggested that lower (not higher) IS was related to higher regional cerebral glucose metabolism in middle aged but not older adults, and lower (not higher) IS was also related to better immediate recall. In the context of healthy insulin sensitivity, lower IS may be beneficial to brain health.

1. Introduction

Insulin resistance (IR), a condition where tissues are less sensitive to the action of insulin, increases the risk for type 2 diabetes (Martin et al., 1992) and Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome (Kuusisto et al., 1997; Luchsinger et al., 2004; Schrijvers et al., 2010). In cognitively healthy older adults without type 2 diabetes, IR has been related to worse cognitive performance in the domains of executive function (Laws et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2011), verbal fluency (Benedict et al., 2012), and episodic memory (Laws et al., 2017). Neural mechanisms underpinning these relationships are unclear (Pruzin et al., 2018).

In contrast to the more consistent relationship between IR and Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome, results from studies associating IR to biological markers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology (i.e., β-amyloid and tau) have been mixed (e.g., Ekblad et al., 2018; Laws et al., 2017; Matsuzaki et al., 2010, Thambisetty et al., 2013; Westwood et al., 2017). Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome is a diagnosis based primarily upon cognitive performance and not AD biomarkers (Jack et al., 2018); therefore, the association between IR and Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome might be explained by factors beyond AD pathology. Some studies suggest that IR may decrease neural activity and consequently cerebral glucose metabolism as indexed by [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). Two FDG PET studies of cognitively unimpaired older adults found that increased IR was related to decreased cerebral glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate, parietal, temporal and frontal cortices (Baker et al., 2011; Willette et al., 2015a), areas of hypometabolism that have been previously identified in dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Mosconi et al., 2009).

The development of type 2 diabetes is characterized by not only IR but also insufficient glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (IS) by pancreatic beta-cells. A reduction in the first-phase of IS following a glucose load may be one of the earliest indicators of future type 2 diabetes (Gerich, 2002; Pratley &amp; Weyer, 2001) and may also predict dementia (Rönnemaa et al., 2008, 2009). In middle-aged and older adult cohorts, a diminished early-phase insulin response to a glucose stimulus was related to an increased risk for Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome, even when controlling for risk factors for AD and vascular dementia (Rönnemaa et al., 2008, 2009). Despite the important relationship between IS and type 2 diabetes and possibly Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome, it has been less studied, relative to IR, as a predictor of cognitive performance and cerebral glucose metabolism (Laws et al., 2017). Although cerebral glucose metabolism has been shown to decrease gradually with age (Bentourkia et al., 2000; Kuhl et al., 1984), the extent to which that decline is dependent upon IR or IS is unclear.

We investigated whether age-associated decline in regional cerebral glucose metabolism would be moderated by IR and IS in a sample of healthy middle-aged and older adults from the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). We also examined if IR and IS would predict cognitive performance. A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was administered on 1 to 2 occasions, separated by 2 years, and insulin and glucose data from this test were used to derive indices of IR and IS. Neuropsychological tests, taken during participants’ annual ADRC visits, were used to assess cognitive function. A subsample of participants underwent [18F]FDG PET, on 1 to 2 occasions, separated by 2 years. We hypothesized that higher IR and lower IS at baseline would be associated with greater age-related decline in regional cerebral glucose metabolism. We also predicted that higher IR and lower IS would be related to worse cognitive performance.

2. Method

2.1. Participants

Participants were recruited from the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) Clinical Core, a cohort of diagnostically well-characterized middle-aged and older adults, to participate in the Predicting Alzheimer’s from Metabolic Markers and Sleep (PAMMS) study. Participants were enrolled into PAMMS if they were ≥ 40 years old and not pregnant, had no MRI or PET contraindications, and were in good mental and physical health, with no significant neurologic or cardiovascular disease or cognitive impairment. The University of Wisconsin–Madison Health Sciences Institutional Review Board approved the study, and all participants provided written informed consent. Sample size following enrollment was 115. Four participants self-reporting diabetes did not receive a 2-hour OGTT resulting in N=111 who underwent a clinical research visit where a 2-hour OGTT was performed. A subsample of n=75 participants underwent neuroimaging with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and [18F]florbetapir PET1, and 40 participants returned for follow-up FDG and 31 for florbetapir PET scans approximately 2 years later. Eighty-six participants also returned for a follow-up OGTT approximately 2 years after their first OGTT.

Because we aimed to examine the association of insulin measures to outcome variables prior to development of type 2 diabetes, participants who reported taking antidiabetic medication (n=1) were excluded from this analysis. Participants who did not self-report diabetes but had OGTT glucose values on two occasions that met diagnostic criteria for diabetes (fasting glucose &gt; 125 mg/dL or a 2-hour post load glucose &gt; 200 mg/dL; American Diabetes Association, 2010) were also excluded (n=2).

If data from the baseline visit were unavailable or unusable, data from the second visit were utilized; this occurred in seven cases, due to incomplete OGTT data (n=1), noncompliance with the OGTT protocol (n=2), and insulinogenic (IGI) index value ≤ 0 (n=4). Only one participant who was noncompliant with the OGTT protocol at visit 1 and did not have an OGTT at visit 2 was excluded. Because we planned to test participants who were cognitively healthy at baseline and free of neurologic abnormality, participants were excluded from this analysis if they had: 1) a global score on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale &gt; 0 or a diagnosis of MCI or dementia at visit 1 (n=3), or 2) a newly discovered neurologic anomaly (n=2: brain tumor [n=1] and meningioma [n=1]). We also excluded participants who had not been genotyped for APOE4 (n=2), an important risk factor for AD that was planned as a covariate in all analyses.

In total, 15 people were excluded resulting in a final sample of N=100 participants, with n=69 with baseline PET and n=38 with longitudinal PET (see Table 1 for a description of sample characteristics). Participants who had PET (n=69) were significantly older (M= 63.4 years, SD=4.9; t[98]= −5.47, p &lt; .001) than participants who did not have PET (n=31) (M= 57.3 years, SD= 5.7; n=31), but the two groups did not significantly differ in indices of IR or IS, sex, or APOE4 allele status (ps &gt; .10). Participants who had 1 PET scan did not significantly differ from participants who had 2 PET scans in indices of IR or IS, age, sex, or APOE4 status (ps &gt; .32).

2.2. Procedure

Participants fasted overnight for at least 12 hours before visiting the Clinical Research Unit at the University of Wisconsin (UW) Hospital for a 2-hour OGTT. Blood was collected during the OGTT to determine insulin and glucose levels at fasting and 30, 60, and 120 min after 75 g oral glucose administration. Laboratory testing for insulin and glucose was conducted at the UW Health Laboratories using a chemiluminscent immunoassay for insulin and hexokinase method for glucose. The majority (71.1%) of participants had FDG PET imaging within 1 month after the OGTT: 36.7% of these had imaging on the same day and 38.8% within 1 week. Three participants (4.3%) were imaged 3 days prior to OGTT and 24.6% were imaged between 1 and 4.4 months after OGTT.

Participants underwent neuropsychological (NP) tests during their ADRC visit. NP data collected at the ADRC visit which occurred the closest in time to the baseline and 2-year follow-up OGTT were used in this analysis. All participants in the final sample (n=100) had a baseline OGTT. For these participants, 91% of the NP data was collected within 1 year of the baseline OGTT, and the remainder (9%) was collected within 1 year and 8.3 months (age at NP minus age at OGTT = −1.69 to .84 years). After exclusions, 75 participants (out of the final sample of 100) had OGTT data from 2 visits. Six of these 75 had only 1 time-point of NP data for analysis; thus, data from the 1 OGTT that was closest in time to their only NP visit was analyzed for these participants. In total, 31 participants had 1 set of OGTT and NP data; 69 had 2 OGTTs and 2 NPs. For the majority (85.5%) with 2 OGTTs and 2 NPs, collection of the second NP occurred within 1 year of the visit 2 OGTT; the remainder (14.5%) was tested within 1 year and 6.2 months (age at second NP minus age at visit 2 OGTT = −1.52 to .66 years).

2.3. Measures

2.3.1. Insulin resistance

The updated homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR; Wallace et al., 2004) and Matsuda index (Matsuda &amp; DeFronzo, 1999) were used to assess IR. HOMA2-IR was used because it has been calibrated to be consistent with more recent insulin assays than the older HOMA method (i.e., HOMA1-IR). HOMA2-IR was calculated by entering fasting glucose and insulin into the HOMA calculator version 2.2.3 (University of Oxford, 2013: https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/). HOMA-IR provides an indication of IR in the fasting or basal state. The Matsuda index assesses whole-body (liver and muscle) insulin sensitivity (the reciprocal of IR) during the OGTT (Matsuda &amp; DeFronzo, 1999). It was calculated using insulin and glucose measured from the fasting and 30, 60 and 120 min blood samples collected during the OGTT. The Matsuda index is the reciprocal of the product of fasting insulin, fasting glucose, total area-under-the-glucose-curve (AUCglu), and total area-under-the-insulin-curve (AUCins) (1000/square root [fasting glucose x fasting insulin x total AUCglu x total AUCins]). Both HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index have shown moderate to strong correlations with clamp-derived whole-body insulin sensitivity measures in people with normal and impaired glucose tolerance (Abdul-Ghani et al., 2007; Matsuda &amp; DeFronzo, 1999; Wallace et al., 2004). Higher IR is indicated by higher HOMA2-IR and lower Matsuda index values.

2.3.2. Insulin secretion

Glucose-stimulated IS was assessed using the insulinogenic index (IGI), which is the ratio of insulin increase to glucose increase at 30 min following glucose load in the 2-hour OGTT (Insulin30 min – Insulinfasting/Glucose30min – Glucosefasting). IGI approximates the first phase of IS following a glucose stimulus and has been shown to correlate strongly with the corresponding index derived from an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) (Tura et al., 2006). IS during fasting and the OGTT was measured using the ratio of total AUCins to total AUCglu (AUCins/glu). Fasting, 30, 60 and 120 min glucose or insulin values from the OGTT were used to determine the AUC, which was calculated with respect to ground using the trapezoid formula (Pruessner et al., 2003). The AUCins/glu ratio measures basal IS and first and second phase insulin response following a glucose stimulus (Tura et al., 2006). It has been used as a measure of IS in several studies (Charbonnel et al., 2006; Retnakaran et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2016) and has been shown to correlate strongly with measures of the first and second phase of IS derived from a hyperglycemic clamp (Stumvoll et al., 2000). To provide a measure of pancreatic beta-cell function, we calculated an oral disposition index (DIo) by multiplying AUCins/glu with Matsuda index. The product of these 2 OGTT derived indices has been significantly and modestly related to the standard DI obtained from an IVGTT and has discriminated between normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes groups, revealing inadequate insulin secretion with progressive increases in IR (Retnakaran et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2016). We interpreted higher DIo values as indicative of healthier pancreatic beta cell function. The correlation coefficients between measures of insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, pancreatic beta-cell function, and age are presented in Table 2.

2.3.3. MRI acquisition and processing

Participants underwent T1- and T2-weighted MRI. Following registration of the T2 to the T1 image, tissue class segmentation was performed using multispectral segmentation (SPM12, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) with the T1 and coregistered T2 as inputs. Regions of interest for PET analysis were generated by applying the nonlinear deformation defined during tissue segmentation to warp Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) atlas ROIs from MNI152 space to the T1 space. ROIs in T1 space were restricted to voxels with gray matter probabilities above 0.30. The cerebellum reference region ROI used for PET quantification was generated by smoothing the binary cerebellar gray matter ROI by a 6 mm isotropic Gaussian kernel (to simulate PET resolution) and keeping voxels with intensities greater than 0.70 (Betthauser et al., 2020). Specific details regarding imaging protocols have been previously described (Betthauser et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2014).

2.3.4. FDG PET imaging of cerebral glucose metabolism

Acquisition: Cerebral glucose metabolism was assessed using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging acquired on a Siemens EXACT HR+ tomograph in 3D mode at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Waisman Center Brain Imaging Laboratory. Participants were first screened to ensure glucose &lt; 180 mg/dL and then underwent a 6-minute transmission scan for attenuation correction, and a 30-minute dynamic emission scan beginning 30 minutes after bolus injection of a nominal 185 MBq of [18F]FDG (6 x 5-minute frames). PET data were reconstructed using filtered back-projection with corrections applied for random events, scatter, segmented attenuation, dead time, scanner normalization and radioactive decay (128 x 128 x 63 matrix, 2.57 x 2.57 x 2.43 mm voxels). Processing and quantification: PET images were processed using an in-house processing script developed in MATLAB (The Mathworks, Natick, MA). Reconstructed PET time-series were smoothed with an isotropic 6 mm Gaussian kernel, interframe realigned (SPM12) and summed from 30-60 minutes post-injection. Parametric standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) images were generated for each FDG scan by linearly registering the summed PET image to the T1 MRI and intensity normalizing the image using cerebellar gray matter as a reference region. SUVR analysis was used because full dynamic imaging and arterial data were not available to determine FDG uptake rates. The cerebellum was selected for a reference based on previous studies that have demonstrated that relative to other brain regions the cerebellum is less affected by changes in basal insulin (Bingham et al. 2002) and is less affected in normal aging (Bentourkia et al., 2000) and in Alzheimer’s disease (for review, see Mosconi, 2013). Regional mean FDG SUVR was extracted from bi-lateral ROIs including the frontal cortex2, lateral temporal cortex (i.e., middle and superior temporal gyri), supramarginal and angular gyri, precuneus, posterior cingulate and hippocampus (see Figure 1). These regions were selected for analyses based on previous observations of reduced FDG uptake in people with AD dementia (Langbaum et al., 2009; Mosconi et al., 2009).

2.3.5. Cognition

Participants in the Wisconsin ADRC Clinical Core undergo annual or bi-annual neuropsychological assessment as per the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set (UDS) collection. Tests employed as dependent variables in this study included the Trail Making Test Part B (executive functioning) (Reitan, 1955), animal and vegetable fluency (verbal semantic fluency) (Benton, 1976), which are all included in the UDS, as well as scores from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT; Lezak et al., 2004) reflecting aspects of episodic memory: immediate (total score), short (5 min) and delayed (30 min) recall.

2.4. Statistical analysis

We used random intercept only linear mixed effects models to test whether baseline IR and baseline IS would moderate the relationship between age and regional cerebral FDG uptake. Following log10-transformation and z-score standardization of the five IR and IS indices, each was tested independently from other IR and IS measures. Age at baseline and visit 2 were centered using the mean of baseline age. The Age X IR (or IS) interaction was tested as a predictor of each of the seven scaled regional FDG uptake outcomes (35 models total). APOE4 allele status (carrier vs. non-carrier) and sex were included as covariates. If the Age X IR (or IS) interaction was not significant, we removed the interaction term from the model and tested the IR or IS predictor as a main effect.

Since 69 out of 100 participants in the final sample had 2 sets of NP and OGTT data, random intercept only linear mixed effects models were also employed to test the relationship of IR and IS to cognitive performance. IR and IS indices were log10-transformed and z-score standardized. Each index was tested as a predictor, independent of the other IR or IS measures, to each cognitive dependent variable. This resulted in 6 models per index and 30 models total. We controlled for age, sex, education, APOE4 allele status, systolic blood pressure, and practice effects. All measures, except for practice effects, were grand-mean centered. We assessed practice effects as the number of times that a participant had completed the cognitive task of interest as part of their participation in the ADRC Clinical Core.

Statistics were computed using SAS Enterprise Guide (v. 5.1). A p value &lt; .05 (uncorrected) was interpreted as being statistically significant. To identify influential data, we used Cook’s distance, which combines information from the residual and leverage.

3. Results

3.1. Regional cerebral glucose metabolism

Preliminary analyses of SUVR data indicated the presence of 2 influential data points3. We present results with and without these outliers.

3.1.1. Insulin secretion

At the mean level of baseline IS and when controlling for sex and APOE4, older age was significantly associated with lower FDG SUVR in all ROIs tested. Relationships between age and FDG SUVR were qualified by significant Age X IGI (6 models) and Age X AUCins/glu (2 models) interactions (see Table 3 and Supplementary Table). Age X IGI was a significant predictor of FDG SUVR in all regions except the hippocampus. For outcomes where the interaction term was not significant, neither IGI nor AUCins/glu was a significant predictor once the interaction term was removed; however, there was a trend for a relationship between lower IGI and increased FDG SUVR in the hippocampus (β = −.01, p = .08). Following removal of the 2 outliers, the direction of relationships between the interaction term and FDG SUVR was the same but the Age X AUCins/glu interactions were no longer significant (ps = .41 - .50) and the Age X IGI interactions were also not significant (ps = .06 - .26) (see Table 3 and Supplementary Table 2). Because the Age X IGI interaction was significant in 6 models prior to outlier removal and had a p-value ≤ .10 in 4 models after outlier removal, we obtained simple slopes of age from models with significant interactions and graphed all Age X IGI relationships (see Figures 2 and 3). Simple slopes for age from significant Age X IGI interactions indicated a significant decrease in FDG SUVR across age in participants with lower log10(IGI) (−1 SD) (simple slopes = −.01 to −.008 ps ≤ .002), but no significant difference across age in participants with higher log10(IGI) (+1 SD) (simple slopes = −.001 to .0004, ps ≥ .71). The pattern of decline depicted in the graphs, however, was unexpected. Cerebral glucose metabolism appeared higher in middle-aged (i.e., &lt; 63.5 years) but not older (i.e., &gt; 63.5 years) adults with lower IGI. Further, there appeared to be no IGI differences in FDG SUVR in older adults. To examine whether the relationship of IS to FDG SUVR was different depending upon age group, we split our sample at mean baseline age (M = 63.5 years) and performed linear mixed effects models without the interaction term. We tested whether IGI predicted FDG SUVR in all regions except the hippocampus. Models including the 2 outliers indicated that lower IGI in middle-aged but not older adults was significantly related to higher FDG SUVR in all 6 of the ROIs tested (see Table 4). The same pattern was seen following outlier removal; however, lower IGI was not significantly related to FDG SUVR in 2 out of the 6 ROIs (i.e., posterior cingulate and precuneus, see Table 4). There were no significant associations between IGI and regional FDG SUVR in the older adult group.

3.1.2. Oral disposition index

DIo did not moderate the relationship between age and FDG SUVR. But at average baseline age and when controlling for APOE4 and sex, lower DIo was significantly associated with higher FDG SUVR in the supramarginal gyrus, frontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and hippocampus. These relationships remained in the same direction and were significant (except for the frontal cortex) when DIo was tested without the Age X DIo interaction term (see Table 5). Following removal of the 2 outliers, the relationship between DIo (without the Age X DIo interaction term) and FDG SUVR in the 4 regions was in the same direction (see Table 5). Lower DIo was significantly related to higher FDG SUVR in the precuneus and hippocampus but not the supramarginal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex (ps = .10).

3.1.3. Insulin resistance

At the mean level of baseline IR and when controlling for sex and APOE4, older age was significantly associated with lower FDG SUVR in all ROIs tested. Relationships between age and FDG SUVR were qualified by significant Age X HOMA2-IR (5 models) and Age X Matsuda index (1 model) interactions (see Supplementary Table 1). For outcomes where the interaction term was not significant, neither HOMA2-IR nor Matsuda index was a significant predictor once the interaction term was removed. Following removal of the 2 outliers, the direction of relationships between the interaction term and FDG SUVR was largely the same but the Age X HOMA2-IR interactions did not remain significant (ps = .20 - .36) and the Age X Matsuda interaction was also not significant (p = .29) (see Supplementary Table 2).

3.1.4. APOE4 carrier status

Congruent with past research (Jagust et al., 2012; Small et al., 1995), APOE4 carriers (i.e., those with at least 1 APOE4 allele) had lower FDG SUVR. Significant or trend (p &lt; .10) relationships between APOE4 carrier status and FDG SUVR were found in the supramarginal gyrus, precuneus, and frontal cortex when IR and IS measures (i.e., IGI and AUCins/glu) were tested as predictors and moderators of age, with sex controlled.

3.2. Cognition

In linear mixed effects models with age, education, sex, APOE4, systolic blood pressure, and practice effects controlled, lower IGI was significantly related to better RAVLT total recall score (see Table 6). There was a trend for a relationship between lower IGI and better long delayed recall (see Table 6). None of the remaining IR or IS measures were significantly related to RAVLT performance. There were no significant relationships between any OGTT-derived index and Trails B or semantic fluency (animal or vegetable). Evaluation of regression diagnostics revealed that the oldest old adult (86.6 years at baseline) influenced results across all regression models. Removing this participant did not change the direction or significance of the relationship between IS or IR and cognition. Because there was a time lag between OGTT and cognitive outcomes, we tested the stability of log10-transformed OGTT indices by determining intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) using data from the 69 participants who had 2 NP and 2 OGTTs collected (average interval between OGTT = 2.2 years). The ICC for each OGTT index was statistically significant and indicated moderate stability between time 1 and 2 values. The ICC (95% confidence interval) for each measure was as follows: a) IGI, .67 (.51-.78), b) AUCins/glu, .78 (.67-.86), c) DIo, .79 (,68-.86), d) HOMA2-IR, .63 (.46-.75), and e) Matsuda index, .73 (.60-.82).

4. Discussion

Because decreased IS is a harbinger of future type 2 diabetes (Gerich, 2002; Pratley &amp; Weyer, 2001) and has been found to be a predictor of Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome (Rönnemaa et al., 2008, 2009), we hypothesized that lower IS would be associated with greater age associated decline in regional cerebral glucose metabolism assessed with FDG PET. Although lower glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was related to greater decline in cerebral glucose metabolism, the pattern of findings was not expected. Lower IGI was related to higher regional cerebral glucose metabolism in middle-aged adults but was not associated with cerebral glucose metabolism in older adults.

The interpretation of the clinical significance of lower glucose-stimulated IS can be complex because insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells is dependent upon insulin sensitivity. Lower IS may be normal in the context of excellent insulin sensitivity, but in the setting of decreased insulin sensitivity (or increased IR), lower IS indicates pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction (Kahn, 2003). When insulin sensitivity declines, such as found in obesity, healthy beta-cells respond by producing more insulin, a compensatory increase which helps to control glucose levels (Kahn et al., 1993; Polonsky et al., 1988).

Lower IGI in our sample was related to lower IR or healthy insulin sensitivity. The potentially beneficial relationship of lower IGI to cerebral glucose metabolism that we found in middle adulthood might have been due to the concurrent existence of healthy insulin sensitivity. IR is thought to have a negative influence upon neural health through a variety of mechanisms, such as cerebrovascular disease, inflammation, and dyslipidemia (Craft, 2009). Experimental studies in animals suggest that systemic IR may be linked to brain IR and synaptic dysfunction (Arnold et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015). However, we did not find a significant main effect of IR upon cerebral glucose metabolism, and the moderating influence of IR on the negative relationship between age and cerebral glucose metabolism was not significant or at trend level following removal of influential data from 2 participants. Thus, healthy insulin sensitivity per se did not have a direct influence upon results.

Lower glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in middle adulthood was related to increased glucose metabolism in all regions except the hippocampus. A similar pattern was found upon removal of 2 outliers. Lower IS in the context of healthy insulin sensitivity may be beneficial to brain health. A compensatory increase in insulin due to developing IR in the liver, muscle and adipose tissue can have adverse consequences upon other tissues that continue to maintain normal insulin sensitivity (Reaven, 2005). Some evidence suggests that elevated peripheral insulin may inhibit the transport of insulin across the blood brain barrier (BBB) (Begg et al., 2013, Kaiyala et al., 2000, Schwartz et al., 1990; Tschritter et al., 2006), consequently decreasing brain insulin levels (Heni et al., 2014). Insulin is essential to neural structure and function and has many roles in neurons, including the development and maintenance of excitatory synapses (Chiu et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2011) and inhibition of apoptosis (Kim &amp; Han, 2005).

Lower IGI was not related to cerebral glucose metabolism in older adults. Aging-related biological processes unrelated to IS may become more salient to neural health in older adulthood. Alternatively, insulin may have different effects upon the brain depending upon age and AD status. Burns et al. (2012) found that higher insulin was related to cognitive decline in older non-demented adults and less cognitive decline and brain atrophy in early AD. Our sample was primarily free of amyloid detectable by florbetapir PET (see Table 1); therefore, our results were likely not influenced by Alzheimer’s pathologic change. Whether insulin has differential effects upon cerebral glucose metabolism depending upon age in the adult lifespan, as suggested by our findings, deserves further investigation.

While relationships found between IS and cerebral glucose metabolism suggest that IS in the context of healthy insulin sensitivity may support brain health during middle adulthood, results could also be interpreted to suggest that lower IGI in middle adulthood is a potential marker for future decline in cerebral glucose metabolism. Simple slopes for age in participants with lower IGI were negative, while those for participants with higher IGI were not significant, indicating stability across age. Reduced IS in non-diabetic adults may through some currently unknown mechanism result in a transient compensatory increase in cerebral glucose metabolism that is followed by subsequent decline. Hypermetabolism has been found prior to the development of dementia in Down’s syndrome (Haier et al., 2003), in cognitively healthy adults who were amyloid positive (Johnson et al., 2014; Oh et al., 2016) and in adults with mild cognitive impairment who also had increased insulin resistance (Willette et al., 2015b).

That lower IS in nondiabetic adults may be beneficial to neural health was supported by our finding of a significant relationship between lower IGI and better performance on a test of episodic memory, specifically RAVLT total recall score. We also found a trend for a relationship between lower IGI and higher RAVLT long delayed recall. Insulin signaling in the hippocampus is important for spatial learning and memory in rodents (Soto et al., 2019), and prior studies suggest that higher fasting insulin is associated with lower functional connectivity between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (Kenna et al., 2013) in middle-aged women at risk for AD. While lower IGI was not related to hippocampal glucose metabolism in our study, lower IGI was related to higher glucose metabolism in the frontal cortices of the middle-aged adults.

Lower DIo was associated with higher regional cerebral glucose uptake in the supramarginal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and hippocampus. Following removal of the 2 influential participants, the direction of relationships was the same and lower DIo was significantly related to higher glucose metabolism in the precuneus and hippocampus. While it may seem counterintuitive for lower DIo to be related to higher cerebral glucose metabolism since DIo is a measure of pancreatic beta-cell function, lower DIo in our sample was related to lower IGI. Thus, to some extent, lower DIo reflected lower glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which could be beneficial for brain health in the context of healthy insulin sensitivity.

While the direction of the relationship of HOMA2-IR to cerebral glucose metabolism and cognition was negative, IR was not a significant main effect of either outcome, standing in contrast to previous research (Baker et al., 2011; Willette et al., 2015a). Following removal of 2 participants with influential data, measures of insulin sensitivity were no longer significant moderators of the relationship between age and cerebral glucose metabolism. Differences in outcomes could have been due to sample differences. Previous studies included a small proportion of participants with type 2 diabetes. The majority of our participants (73%) had a HOMA2-IR (≤ 1.0) at baseline suggestive of normal insulin sensitivity, and the HOMA2-IR at time 2 was not significantly worse. The relationship between IR and cerebral glucose metabolism is likely complex and may be defined by a non-linear relationship. A recent study found a positive association between fasting insulin (a measure of IR) and cerebral glucose metabolism in hippocampal and parietal regions of non-diabetic older adults with normal fasting insulin levels (Byun et al., 2019). Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether positive relationships between IR and cerebral glucose metabolism transition to negative associations as IR worsens over time.

Whether peripheral and brain IR are linked deserves further consideration in light of research suggesting that the two are interrelated (Hirvonen et al., 2011; Kothari et al., 2017; Kullmann et al., 2020) and yet distinctly different conditions (Talbot et al., 2012). The brain is less dependent upon insulin for glucose uptake than muscle, liver and adipose tissue (Bingham et al., 2002). Brain IR isolated in the post-mortem tissue of AD dementia patients was present in cases without type 2 diabetes and was not found to affect glucose uptake in the same manner as peripheral IR (Talbot et al., 2012). Although brain IR may exist in the absence of diabetes and manifest differently than peripheral IR, central insulin signaling may still be influenced by peripheral IR during prediabetes when insulin levels remain high to compensate for elevated glucose. Hyperinsulinemia may dysregulate central insulin signaling by reducing the transport of insulin across the BBB (Begg et al., 2013, Kaiyala et al., 2000, Schwartz et al., 1990; Tschritter et al., 2006) and indirectly increasing neuroinflammation and amyloid-β oligomers (Craft, 2005). Our finding that higher IS was related to lower cerebral glucose metabolism in middle-aged but not older adults suggests that IS may play a role in brain health. Lifestyle or therapeutic interventions that improve insulin sensitivity should be designed to determine whether lower IS in the context of healthy insulin sensitivity is beneficial to brain health. Such an intervention to reduce dementia risk and preserve cognitive function may be especially important in middle adulthood, as indicated by our results and other research (Mangialasche et al., 2012).

Our study has several strengths and limitations. Because FDG PET data were collected after the baseline OGTT, we were able to test the prospective relationship of IR and IS to cerebral glucose metabolism. Further, up to 2 time points of FDG PET data were analyzed, adding a longitudinal component to our analyses. When testing the relationship of IR and IS to cognition, analyses included up to 2 time points of IR, IS, and cognitive test results, allowing a more comprehensive assessment than achievable with only 1 time point of data. Although there was a time lag between OGTT and cognitive outcomes, OGTT indices were moderately stable across 2 time points for those 69 participants who had 2 OGTTs and NP data. To ensure that acute glucose increases did not interfere with FDG uptake, glucose levels were screened prior to PET.

Due to the correlational nature of our study, we cannot make causative claims about the relationships found. Because we had 69 participants who had FDG PET, we did not have sufficient power to investigate if Age X IGI interactions predicting regional cerebral glucose metabolism would be different depending upon other factors, such as sex or APOE4 carrier status. We did not determine if participants were on a ketogenic diet or assess ketone levels which are potentially related to fasting insulin and FDG SUVR (Courchesne-Loyer et al., 2017). Additionally, our results were influenced by 2 participants. The pattern of findings remained largely the same after their removal from the sample; however, the Age X IR and Age X IS interactions were no longer significant.

We recognize that FDG SUVRs are critically influenced by reference region selected and were careful to choose a gray matter area where glucose uptake is less influenced by the level of basal insulin and the effects of aging than other gray matter regions in the brain. The extent to which cerebellar gray matter is influenced by carbohydrate stimulated hyperinsulinemia and its metabolic consequences is unknown. Full dynamic scanning and blood sampling of FDG tracer would provide more information about cerebral metabolic rate and should be considered for future studies investigating the relationship between IS and cerebral glucose metabolism. That increased age and APOE4 carriers predicted reduced cerebral FDG SUVR, as found in previous research, supports the validity of our regional FDG SUVR results.

Measures of IS and IR were derived from glucose and insulin collected during an OGTT and not an IVGTT or clamp technique. Despite this limitation, OGTT derived indices of IR and IS show moderate to strong correlations with similar measures determined from gold standard methods (Abdul-Ghani et al., 2007; Matsuda &amp; DeFronzo, 1999; Tura et al., 2006; Wallace et al., 2004). We employed DIo, a surrogate measure of pancreatic beta-cell function. While this measure has been validated in young and middle-aged adults (Retnakaran et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2016), it also requires validation in an older adult sample with varying degrees of beta-cell function.

We present preliminary evidence that lower IS in healthy adults is related to increased cerebral glucose metabolism in middle adulthood and higher memory scores in a middle-aged and older adult cohort. These findings are novel and deserve replication in a larger sample with higher levels of IR.

n = 100 (n = 69 contributed data from 2 visits). Continuous independent variables were mean-centered, except for Log10(IGI) and Log10(HOMAIR) which were z-transformed. The variable “Practice” equaled the number of times a participant had taken the cognitive test. Ranges for each RAVLT test: total recall = 28–75, short-delayed recall = 3–15, and long-delayed recall = 2–15.

Highlights

Two-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), FDG PET, and cognition were assessed.

Indices of insulin secretion (IS) and resistance (IR) were derived from the OGTT.

Lower IS predicted higher cerebral glucose metabolism in middle-aged adults.

IS was not related to cerebral glucose metabolism in older adults.

Lower IS was related to better immediate recall.

1 PET using [18F]florbetapir, an FDA approved tracer for β-amyloid plaques, was performed in anticipation of examining the relationship of IR and IS to amyloid-β positivity. Because our sample was enriched with participants who were APOE4 carriers, and based on prior studies (Johnson et al., 2014), we expected approximately 20-40% of the sample would be amyloid-β positive. However, only 3 participants (4.3%) were amyloid-β positive; thus, we were unable to proceed with planned analyses due to sample size constraints.

2 Left and right hemisphere areas included in the frontal cortex ROI: precentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus (dorsolateral), superior frontal gyrus (orbital), middle frontal, middle frontal gyrus (orbital), inferior frontal gyrus (opercular), inferior frontal gyrus (triangular), inferior frontal gyrus (orbital), rolandic operculum, supplementary motor area, olfactory cortex, superior frontal gyrus (medial), superior frontal gyrus (medial orbital), and gyrus rectus

3 Evaluation of regression diagnostics revealed that data from two participants influenced results. One participant was a middle-aged adult female (54.6 years at baseline PET) with lower log10(IGI) (−2.1 SD at baseline OGTT), lower log10(HOMA2-IR) (−2.3 SD at baseline OGTT) and higher FDG SUVR across all ROIs (+1.9 SD to + 3.2 SD). The other was an older adult female (65.0 years at baseline PET) who also had lower log10(IGI) (−0.7 SD at baseline OGTT), lower log10(HOMA2-IR) (−0.3 SD at baseline OGTT) and higher FDG SUVR across all ROIs (+ 3.0 SD to + 4.9 SD). We used Cook’s distance, which combines information from the residual and leverage, to identify influential data. We suspected influence if Cook’s distance was ≥ 4/(n – k – 1), where n = the number of observations and k = the number of predictors + 1 (Fox, 1997). The two participants under question had an elevated Cook’s distance in 13-14 of the 14 models with significant interaction effects.
