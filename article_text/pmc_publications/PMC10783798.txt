There is greater interest in amyloid biomarker for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with the recent FDA approval of amyloid targeted therapy. The goal of this study was to assess the clinical utility of amyloid PET in clinically ambiguous cases of cognitive impairment by examining outcomes of patients enrolled in the Imaging Dementia-Evidence of Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS) study at two academic institutions. Of the 112 patients in the study, 66.1% (n=74) of patients had a positive amyloid PET scan and 33.96% (n=38) had a negative amyloid PET scan. Lower cognitive test scores were predictive of positive amyloid PET scan (p=0.001). Eighty-two percent (92/112) of the patients were seen for follow up. Of the 30 patients with negative amyloid PET scan results, 90% had a diagnosis of non-AD etiology after receiving the negative results, suggesting a negative amyloid scan can be used to rule out AD diagnosis.

pmcBACKGROUND

There are currently over 6.5 million people ages 65 and older living in the United States with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and that number is expected to reach 12.7 million by 2050.1 One of the pathological hallmarks of AD is amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulations in the brain along with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuronal loss.2 Recently, there has been accelerated development of therapeutics specifically targeting amyloid with two approved by the FDA.3, 4

Despite the recent advances made in the biomarker development for AD, current practice still relies heavily on clinical evaluation for AD diagnosis. A biomarker tool such as an amyloid Positron-Emission Tomography (PET) can assist in providing a more definitive diagnosis of AD. In addition, amyloid-PET will most likely play an even greater role with the recent approval of the amyloid targeting treatments.

In 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) allowed conditional coverage of amyloid PET under Coverage with Evidence Development (CED). Under the National Coverage Decision, Medicare would provide coverage for one amyloid PET scan per patient enrolled in an approved clinical study.5 The Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS) Study was initiated with the goal to assess the impact of amyloid PET on patient outcomes including change in patient management as well as impact on hospital admissions and emergency room visits.6 The goal of our study was to understand the change in diagnosis among patients who were enrolled in the IDEAS study and to examine the factors that were associated with a positive amyloid scan at two academic medical centers.

METHODS

Study Sites

Participants in this study population were referred by consented dementia providers from the Johns Hopkins Memory and Alzheimer’s Treatment Center (JHMATC) and Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS) Memory Consultation Clinic between July 2016 and December 2017. Full study population criteria have been previously described by Rabinovici, et al..6

Study Design

The study was conducted in two phases.

Phase 1:

Referring dementia specialists completed a pre-PET form which included medical history and current diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Amyloid PET scans were completed, and the results of the scan were then discussed with the patient by a dementia specialist. Patients returned to see their referring provider for a mandatory 90-day follow-up visit (75-105 days window) to further discuss results and review potential changes in the course of treatment based on imaging results. The referring physician then completed a post-PET form, which included information on changes in diagnosis and course of treatment.

Phase 2:

Referring providers completed a pre-PET form identical to Phase 1. At the point of completion of the amyloid PET scan, Phase 2 was considered complete. Results were discussed with patients outside of study protocol.

Parent study was managed by the American College of Radiology (ACR) under a central institutional review board (IRB).6 Further IRB approval was obtained at both participating sites in this analysis.

RESULTS

A total of 112 patients participated in the IDEAS study at JHMATC (n=51) and at EVMS (n=61) between July 2016 and December 2017. Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the patients who enrolled from both study sites. The mean age was 74.5 (SD 6.03) and 52.7% (n=59) were male. The amyloid scan was positive in 66.1% (n=74) and negative in 33.9% (n=38) of the patients.

Diagnosis and Diagnostic Changes

Of the 112 who enrolled in the study, pre-PET diagnosis included 12.5% (n=14) AD-clinically typical, 30.4% (n=34) AD-clinically atypical, 20.5% (n=23) AD-mixed, 5.4% (n=6) FTD, and 31.3% (n=35) were diagnosed with “other” form of cognitive decline. Of the 112 study patients, 82% (n=92) had a follow-up visit with their provider and received information about changes in diagnosis or course of treatment (Phase 1).

Of the 92 patients in Phase 1, 67.4% (n=62) had a positive amyloid PET scan and 32.6% (n=30) had a negative amyloid PET scan. Overall, 35.9% (n=33) of patients had a change in diagnosis after the amyloid PET scan in Phase 1. Of the 20 patients in Phase 2 of the study, 60% (n=12) had a positive PET scan result and 40% (n=8) had a negative PET scan result.

Post scan diagnoses were reported as AD-clinically typical 9.8% (n=9) with 88.9% (n=8) positive PET scan, AD-clinically atypical 41.3% (n=38) with 94.7% (n=36) positive PET scan, AD-mixed 15.2% (n=14) with 100% positive amyloid PET scan, FTD 3.2% (n=3) with 33% (n=1) positive PET scan, and other 30.4% (n=28) with 10.7% (n=3) positive PET scan. (Figure 1.B) Of the 33 patients with a change in diagnosis in Phase 1, 69.7% (n=23) had a positive amyloid PET scan and 30.3% (n=10) had a negative amyloid PET scan (Figure 1.C)

A multivariable binary logistic regression was estimated to predict positive or negative scan results with the following variables: age, education level, initial scan diagnosis, MMSE score, and sex. Results indicated an overall significant model (χ2(5) = 15.575, p = 0 .008) and explained 18% of the variance in scan results (Nagelkerke’s R2 of 0.178). Furthermore, we found MMSE score (p= 0.003) and pre-PET scan diagnosis (p=0.005) as significant predictors in the model.

DISCUSSION:

In our study of two Memory Clinics at academic centers that participated in the multi-site, IDEAS study, we found that of the patients that completed both pre- and post-PET forms of the study, two thirds had a positive amyloid PET scan, and one third had a negative amyloid PET scan. Of the patients with a positive amyloid PET scan, approximately one third had a change in diagnosis, but only one tenth of the patients with a negative amyloid PET scan had a change in diagnosis. Of the 30 patients with negative amyloid PET scan results, 90% had a diagnosis of non-AD pathology after receiving the negative results. This suggests a negative result was useful for ruling out AD as a potential diagnosis for patients with ambiguous etiologies of dementia.6 These results are similar to the results in the parent study as well as past studies assessing the utility of amyloid PET imaging in a clinical setting, showing negative predictive value of a negative scan result.7, 8 Examination of scan results by pre- and post-PET diagnosis also shows that one of the more important utility of amyloid-PET scan in our clinics to be confirming the underlying AD pathology in individuals who appeared to have atypical presentations of AD. We also examined factors that may be predictive of a positive PET scan. Our results suggest that age, lower MoCA scores, and pre-PET scan diagnosis were all predictive of a positive amyloid-PET scan result. This is similar to Grundman, et al, who noted older subjects and patients with lower MMSE scores, were more likely to have a positive amyloid PET scan.7

Prior to the large-scale IDEAS study, several studies examined the feasibility and utility of amyloid-PET imaging in research and clinical settings. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of amyloid PET imaging in the Memory Clinic9 highlighted the utility of using amyloid PET scans for diagnostic and disease management purposes. Specifically, the analysis showed that the overall impacts of amyloid PET scans in a clinical setting were a change of diagnosis and change in course of treatment.9 Carswell, et al. retrospectively reviewed 100 charts belonging to patients who had undergone amyloid PET imaging.8 They found that 49% were positive for amyloid, 42% of patients had a change in course of treatment, and 30% of patients had a change in diagnosis based on positive amyloid PET scan results. There was a statistically significant increase in non-AD diagnosis for patients with negative amyloid PET scan.8 Grundman, et al, assessed 229 patients who underwent amyloid PET imaging.7 This study found that 49% had a positive amyloid PET scan result. Changes in diagnosis occurred in 54% of patients. While only 54% of patients had a change in diagnosis, a greater proportion of patients with a change in course of treatment, approximately 87%.7 A randomized, controlled study looking at the impact of amyloid PET on diagnosis and patient management, demonstrated knowledge of amyloid status, both positive and negative, was positively correlated with change in management, specifically, with the addition of AD medication.10

The major limitation of the current study was that the study population was disproportionately Caucasian, which is not representative of the population as a whole. To address this, our clinics are participating in the national New IDEAS study, specifically recruiting minority populations to further examine the utility of amyloid PET scans in a clinical setting to assist with ambiguous etiologies of dementia and early onset cognitive impairment. Another limitation is that we do not have information on what other changes were made in patient management beyond diagnostic changes.

The strengths include the uniformity of the study criteria and procedures (e.g. inclusion and exclusion criteria, methods, and data collection were identical). Both populations of study participants were seen at a Memory Clinic and outcome measures were identical, allowing for appropriate combination and analysis of data for all study participants. Although disease modifying medications were not available at the time of the IDEAS, with the advent of anti-amyloid medications, the use of amyloid-PET scan will most likely evolve to be used in order to determine eligibility for the medications.
