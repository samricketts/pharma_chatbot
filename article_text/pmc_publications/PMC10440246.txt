INTRODUCTION:

CVD is a recognised risk factor for dementia. Here we determined the extent to which an incident CVD event modifies the trajectory of cognitive function and risk of dementia.

METHODS:

19,114 adults (65+) without CVD or dementia were followed prospectively over 9 years. Incident CVD (fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalisation for heart failure) and dementia (DSM-IV criteria) were adjudicated by experts.

RESULTS:

922 participants had incident CVD and 44 developed dementia post-CVD (4.9% vs. 4.4% for participants without CVD). Following a CVD event there was a short-term drop in processing speed (−1.97, 95%CI:−2.57 to −1.41), but there was no significant association with longer-term processing speed. In contrast, faster declines in trajectories of global function (−0.56, 95%CI:−0.76 to −0.36), episodic memory (−0.10, 95%CI:−0.16 to −0.04) and verbal fluency (−0.19, 95%CI:−0.30 to −0.01) were observed.

DISCUSSION:

Findings highlight the importance of monitoring cognition after a CVD event.

pmc1. Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia are two co-existing age-related chronic conditions that contribute to disease burden in older adults.1 People with CVD contribute to increase in cost burden of dementia.2 Evidence suggests dementia in advanced age develops after a lifelong sequence of events, beginning with exposure to vascular risk factors in youth, followed by heart diseases.3 A recent retrospective cohort study of predominantly younger adults, found CVD diagnosis increased the risk of dementia by 17%.4 However, despite previous reports that incident CVD accelerates cognitive decline, a large recent study of older adults (mean 73 years) found no increased risk of cognitive impairment among participants with CVD compared with no CVD.5

Furthermore, the majority of past studies have examined individual CVD events. There is good evidence that stroke, which causes direct end organ damage, is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia,6–9 however, fewer studies have investigated the association with other CVDs. A 2018 review of cognitive decline after non-stroke CVDs (.e.g. myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF)) identified the need for more methodologically rigorous longitudinal studies on this topic.10 Additionally, this review suggested large cohort studies with comprehensive assessment of cognitive and cardiovascular health at baseline were essential and highlighted that studies should exclude pre-existing cognitive impairment to determine the magnitude of decline secondary to each disease state.10 Two reviews exploring association between HF and dementia found significant associations,11, 12 but a recent review that includes two additional large-scale studies did not find a statistically significant association.13 However, this review considered the outcomes, dementia, cognitive impairment and cognitive function separately and found HF was associated with reduced performance in cognitive tests. The association also varied for the different cognitive domains, emphasising the importance of studying cognitive outcomes separately.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the association between a CVD event and the incidence of dementia and cognitive trajectories after an event, in a large prospective cohort of initially healthy older individuals, who were free of CVD or major cognitive impairment at baseline. Secondary aims included investigating the associations between two non-stroke CVDs, MI and HF, and the incidence of dementia and change in cognitive function over time.

2. Methods

2.1 Study Population

Participants were from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study, full details reported previously.14 Briefly, this was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the effect of low dose aspirin on disability-free survival in healthy older adults. CVD events and dementia were among prespecified endpoints, but the main trial results reported no significant effect of aspirin on either outcome.15, 16 Trial participants were community-dwelling adults from Australia and United States (US) aged 70 years and older (65 for African-American and Hispanic communities in the US). Eligibility criteria included having no prior CVD or dementia, and a global cognition score of &gt;77/100 on the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam (3MS).17 Participants were recruited between March 2010 and December 2014, and followed prospectively until June 2017. The ASPREE eXTension (ASPREE-XT) study, an ongoing follow-up observational study, was established in 2018 and continues to follow these participants annually.

The ASPREE study has multiple institutional review board approvals in the US and Australia. All the participants provided written informed consent before enrolment.

2.2 Cardiovascular Disease Events

Details of the CVD adjudication process have been published previously.18 Briefly, CVD was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal MI, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF). Health information from hospitals/medical centres, treating physicians, death certificates, medical records, and hospital information obtained from family members were collected. Committees, whose members were blinded to the treatment group assignments, used the information collected to adjudicate CVD events.18 MI was defined based on the joint guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology19 and HHF was defined as any unplanned stay, overnight or longer, in a hospital or a similar facility, for which the principal reason for admission was HF.18 All the HHF cases were the first incident hospitalisation for HF.

2.3 Dementia

Full details describing the adjudication of dementia have been reported previously.20 Briefly, participants with a suspected dementia were referred for further cognitive and functional testing. Participants triggered for an assessment if they had a 3MS score ≤77, a drop of more than 10.15 points from the predicted 5-year score based on their own baseline 3MS score, a report of memory concerns or other cognitive problems to a specialist or as noted on the participant’s medical records, a clinician diagnosis of dementia, or prescription of cholinesterase inhibitors(in Australia, where such prescription is necessary). Additional assessment consisting of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – cognitive subscale,21 Color trails,22 Lurian overlapping figures,23 and the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Scale24 were then performed at least six weeks after the initial trigger to reduce the possibility of delirium. This information was then reviewed together with detailed medical history, the results of clinical exams and bloods, where available, by a specialist committee composed of geriatricians and neurologists from Australia and the United States with expertise in dementia and who were blinded to treatment allocation. Dementia was adjudicated according to DSM IV criteria.25

2.4 Cognitive Assessments

Cognitive assessments were administered regularly by trained staff over a maximum of 9 years. The cognitive battery included 3MS, a measure of global cognition, the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) delayed recall task for episodic memory, the single letter (F) Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) for executive function and verbal fluency, and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) to measure psychomotor speed.

2.5 Covariates

Potential confounding factors considered were those known to be related to CVD and cognition and were measured at baseline. Demographic factors considered were age, sex, years of education (&lt;12 years or ≥ 12 years), country/ethno-racial group (Australian white, American white, black/African-American, or Hispanic/Latino/Other). Health-related behaviours considered were baseline smoking status (never, former, or current) and baseline alcohol consumption status (never, former, or current). Clinical factors considered were hypertension (yes or no, based on whether the average of three blood pressure measurements was systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg and/or whether the participants were being treated for high blood pressure), diabetes mellitus (yes or no, based on self-report or fasting glucose ≥126mg/dL [≥7 mmol/L] or on treatment for diabetes), obesity (BMI ≥ 30Kg/m2), dyslipidaemia (yes or no, based on the use of cholesterol-lowering medications or low-density lipoprotein, LDL &gt; 160 mg/dL [&gt;4.1mmol/L] or serum cholesterol ≥212 mg/dL [≥5.5 mmol/L] for Australians or ≥ 240 mg/dL [≥6.2 mmol/L] for U.S. participants), chronic kidney disease (eGFR &lt;60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 [GFR categories G3a to G5] or urinary albumin:creatinine ratio ≥3 mg/mmol with eGFR≥60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), and depressive symptoms (measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale [CESD] 10).

2.6 Statistical Analyses

The statistical analysis was performed in STATA (version 17.0, Stata Corp, College Station, TX)26. Descriptive characteristics were presented according to CVD event. Incidence rates for dementia following a CVD event was compared with those without CVD event. Since death is a competing risk factor, we compared incidence rates after excluding participants who died during the trial.

Linear mixed models were used to measure cognitive change over time, separately for the four cognitive tests (3MS, HVLT-R, SDMT, COWAT). Significance level was set at p&lt;0.05 and the tests were 2-sided. Due to the small number of participants with cognitive assessments at year 2 (Supplementary figure SF1), the scores from this timepoint was not included in the analysis. Association between the potential confounding factors and cognition was first tested using univariate models, and variables that were not significant were excluded (hypertension, obesity, dyslipidaemia, and chronic kidney disease) from the final model. The main independent variables were (1) the overall follow-up time variable, expressed in years from the date of recruitment; (2) a time-varying binary variable, which changed from 0 to 1 after a CVD event; and (3) another time variable representing the time after a CVD event, expressed in years from the date of CVD event. The effect size associated with the overall follow-up time variable represents the annual change in cognition scores for all participants over the follow-up period; the effect size of the time-varying variable represents the acute decline in cognition after a CVD event,8 which was defined as the change in cognition in the time immediately after a CVD event and was estimated based on the first cognitive assessment administered after a CVD event as well as other cognition scores before and after a CVD event;8 lastly, the effect size for the time after CVD variable represents the annual change in cognition scores after a CVD event. The models included both random intercepts and slopes to account for participant specific individual differences. The unstructured correlation matrix was specified and the model was fit using maximum likelihood method. Sensitivity analysis were conducted by: (1) excluding participants who died during the trial; (2) excluding participants who had stroke; (3) excluding participants who were adjudicated with dementia; (4) included treatment groups as a covariate.

3. Results

The study sample included 19,114 participants between 65 to 98 years (median[IQR] - 74[71.6, 77.7]; Table 1). The median[IQR] follow-up for our study was 6.4[5.3, 7.8] years. There were 922 participants with incident CVD in ASPREE (Supplementary figure SF1 and Supplementary table ST1). Baseline characteristics of participants by incident CVD status are presented in Table 1. Individuals with a CVD event were older than those without (median 76.3 versus 73.9 years) and there were a higher proportion of males (55.1% versus 43.0%). There were 355 participants with MI and 171 were HHF (Supplementary Table ST2 and ST3 respectively) in ASPREE. The total cognitive assessments available at each year are shown in Supplementary Figure SF1. The median[IQR] time from incident CVD to the first cognitive assessment was 0.79[0.41, 1.26] years and the median[IQR] follow-up time after the CVD event was 2.46[1.13, 3.93] years. Supplementary table ST4 shows the mean (SD) for the total number of cognitive assessments per person and supplementary table ST5 includes the mean (SD) for the total number of pre- and post-CVD cognitive assessments per person.

3.1 Dementia after CVD

A total of 872 (4.6%) participants were adjudicated with dementia. Of those, 26 were adjudicated with dementia prior to a CVD event and were excluded. After a CVD event, 44 (4.9%) participants were adjudicated with dementia compared to 802 (4.4%) cases among those without CVD (absolute difference, 0.5% [95%CI, −0.8% to 2.1%; p=0.48]).27 For MI, 14 (4.0%) participants were adjudicated with dementia after the event and 11 (6.5%) after HHF. The total number dementia cases among surviving participants (n=18,062) was 783 (4.3%), 41 (6.1%) dementia cases after a CVD event compared to 731 (4.2%) among those without CVD (absolute difference, 1.9% [95%CI, 0.3% to 4.0%; p=0.02]).27 Further, 14 (5.1%) were adjudicated with dementia after MI (n = 277), and 9 (7.1%) after HHF (n = 127). Given these small numbers, no formal statistical analysis was performed for dementia risk after a CVD event.

3.2 Change in Global Cognition after CVD

The mean(SD) global cognition score at baseline was 93.4(4.6) (Table 1) which dropped by 0.25[95%CI: −0.27, −0.24; p&lt;0.001] (Table 2) annually over the follow-up period. An incident CVD event was associated with an increase in global cognition (acute change: 0.38 [−0.03, 0.80; p=0.072]) which was not significant. The 3MS score of participants who survived the CVD event declined annually by 0.56 [−0.76, −0.36; p&lt;0.001] after the CVD event (Figure 1 and Table 2).

3.3 Change in Delayed Recall for Episodic Memory after CVD

At baseline, the mean(SD) score for delayed recall for episodic memory was 7.7(2.8) (Table 1) which decreased slightly annually by 0.04 [−0.04, −0.03; p&lt;0.001] (Table 2) over the follow-up period. After a CVD event the acute drop in delayed recall was not significant (acute change: −0.14 [−0.32, to 0.05, p=0.148]) (Table 2). However, the HVLT-R (Del) scores for those who survived the CVD event significantly declined in the years following CVD event (annual change: −0.10 [−0.16 to −0.04, p=0.002]) (Figure 1 and Table 2).

3.4 Change in Processing Speed after CVD

The mean(SD) processing speed score at baseline was 36.7(10.1) (Table 1) which reduced annually by 0.61 [−0.63, −0.59; p&lt;0.001] (Table 2). An incident CVD event was associated with an acute drop in psychomotor speed (acute change: −1.97 [−2.53, −1.41; p&lt;0.001]) was observed after a CVD event, however there was no evidence of accelerated decline thereafter (annual change: −0.16 [−0.36, 0.04; p=0.110]) (Figure 1 and Table 2).

3.5 Change in Verbal Fluency after CVD

Baseline mean(SD) verbal fluency score was 12.1(4.6) (Table 1) and this score had an annual increase of 0.14 [0.13 to 0.15, p&lt;0.001] (Table 2). A CVD event was not significantly associated with an acute drop in verbal fluency (acute change: −0.14 [−0.46, 0.18; p=0.381]) but did exhibit accelerated decline subsequently (annual change: −0.19 [−0.30, −0.09; p&lt;0.001]) (Figure 1 and Table 2).

3.6 Change in cognitive function after MI or HHF

For MI (n=355), the results were largely consistent with all CVD, however, the effect sizes were smaller for processing speed (acute change: −1.13 [−1.97, −0.29; p=0.009]). Decline in delayed recall (annual change: −0.06 [−0.33, 0.21; p=0.246]) and verbal fluency (annual change: −0.08 [−0.24, 0.08; p=0.311]) after MI did not reach statistical significance (Table 3). For HHF (n=171), results were very similar to overall CVD results though the effect sizes were higher. Especially noticed in change in processing speed after HHF (acute change: −2.85 [−4.07, −1.63; p&lt;0.001]) and decline in delayed recall (annual change: −0.18 [−0.36, −0.01; p=0.039]) and verbal fluency (annual change: −0.36 [−0.63, −0.09; p=0.009]) (Table 4).

3.7 Sensitivity Analyses

For the sensitivity analyses (1) after excluding 1052 participants who died, results (Supplementary table ST6, ST7 and ST8) were largely similar to the main study results however, there was significant acute increase in global cognition after an event; (2) for CVD other than stroke (excluding 404 participants with stroke) results (Supplementary table ST9) were consistent with the primary findings though the increase in acute global cognition after CVD became significant; (3) after excluding participants who were adjudicated with dementia (n=872), results for CVD (Supplementary table ST10), MI (Supplementary table ST11) and HHF (Supplementary table ST12) remained largely consistent with the main results but here again acute increase in global cognition was significant (4) lastly when the trial randomisation (treatment) groups were added as a potential confounding factor, this was not significant nor did it change the results from the linear mixed models.

4. Discussion

In this large prospective cohort of individuals predominantly 70 years and above, without a prior CVD event or major cognitive impairments at baseline, the difference in incidence rates of dementia after a CVD event and those without a CVD event was not significant; however, after excluding participants who had died during the trial, dementia incidence rates were higher after incident CVD than in those without CVD. Additionally, there were significant changes in cognitive trajectories after a CVD event, but this varied depending on the cognitive domain. There was an acute drop in psychomotor speed after the CVD event, and a decline in global cognition, delayed recall and verbal fluency in the years following the CVD event. After MI, there was an acute drop in psychomotor speed and a decline in global cognition in the years following MI. Results for HHF were very similar to the overall CVD results, with acute drop in psychomotor speed after HHF, and a decline in global cognition, delayed recall and verbal fluency in the years following HHF. These results remained robust even after controlling for various risk factors.

The findings from our study appeared relatively consistent with prior studies on this topic, and add to the field showing that CVD events beyond stroke influence cognitive aging trajectories in older adults. For example, incident CVD has been shown to be associated with cognitive decline,28 though it was in middle-aged individuals, it aligns with our results. Another study included individuals aged 45 years or older and found significant acute declines in new learning and verbal memory after incident stroke, and accelerated decline in global cognition and executive function over time.8 Another study of 7,888 participants aged 50 years or over found longer-term declines global cognition, verbal memory, and temporal orientation scores after a diagnosis of coronary heart disease, which is consistent with our findings.29 In this study, however, they found no associations with short-term cognition, but they didn’t assess processing speed, which was found to be significant in our study.

Exploring multiple cognitive domains such as global cognition, delayed recall, processing speed and verbal fluency helps in further understanding the impact of CVD events on cognition. Interestingly, while we showed that CVD was followed by the strongest acute drop in processing speed, over time there was a faster decline in global cognition, episodic memory and verbal fluency. Impairment in episodic memory is common in the early stages of dementia and impairment in verbal fluency is also associated with most brain disorders such as dementia or traumatic brain injury. It is not entirely clear from our study as to why there was an acute change in processing speed and a more gradual decline in global cognition, delayed recall and verbal fluency. A possible hypothesis is that processing speed is potentially linked to higher-order cognitive process.30, 31 Further research is required to understand this difference in short- and long-term impact of CVD event on the different cognitive domains which will inform individualised cognitive training plans that target specific cognitive domains that are affected by a CVD event. Additionally, the association of the three exposures (all CVD, MI, HHF) were very similar for each of the cognitive domains, although for composite CVD and HHF the effect sizes were higher for the acute change in processing speed immediately after the event, and the post-event decline in delayed recall and verbal fluency were significant.

This study highlights the need for both short- and long-term monitoring of cognition in people after incident CVD. However, there is no consensus on the best tools that can be used for cognitive assessment in clinical practice. While studies have shown that both Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) are valid screening tools for cognitive impairment following stroke32 and HF,33 another study suggested that MoCA might not be sensitive enough to detect subtle cognitive changes in its early stages and recommend that cognition in individuals at different stages of the CVD continuum should be assessed through a complete neuropsychological evaluation using cognitive assessments that target memory and executive functions, and verbal fluency.34 Good cognitive performance supports adherence to medication, self-care and the ability to retain disease-related knowledge,35 which could also help prevent recurrence of another incident CVD. Further emphasising the importance to prevent CVD events, in order to maintain cognitive function and independence in older adults.

A major strength of this study was the prospective follow-up of a large cohort of individuals without any CVD events or major cognitive impairment at baseline, with regular cognitive assessment by trained staff. These ensure high quality data and instils confidence that the events and assessments have been recorded accurately. All CVD events and dementia were adjudicated by expert committees of clinicians and the exact timing of these events was recorded. With the availability of the CVD diagnosis date, we were able to use a time-varying covariate which allowed us to control for the immortal time bias.36 Moreover, the ASPREE study systematically collected data on a wide range of risk factors for both CVD and cognition, which allowed us to adjust for multiple covariates.

One limitation of this study was the short follow-up [median of 6.4 years] in a healthy population. As a consequence, there were few dementia cases following CVD which restricted our ability to perform further analysis. A longer follow-up might have provided a better estimate of the potential long-term impact on cognitive trajectories. Being healthy, the findings may not be broadly applicable to all individuals. A second limitation is that we did not correct for multiple comparison and the results should be interpreted with caution as there is a potential for false positive associations. Thirdly, although CVD adjudication was done robustly, there were no details about the event. Given that CVDs, like HF, are chronic conditions, severity of CVD, treatment, etc. might impact on cognition. Lastly, we considered four cognitive domains, but other domains, for example working memory, were not included, and our test of verbal fluency (COWAT-F) examines only one sub-domain which is prone to learning effects.

In conclusion, after a CVD event, the incidence of dementia is higher than among participants without a CVD event. Additionally, incident CVD event, MI and HHF were associated with an acute drop in processing speed and a greater decline in global cognition. CVD and HHF were also associated with longer-term decline delayed recall and verbal fluency over time. The main clinical implications of this study is the need for both short- and long-term monitoring of cognition among people who have had a CVD. Further research is required to understand the mechanisms for cognitive change following any CVD event.

Figure 1. Predicted mean change in cognitive function over time

Notes:

Predicted values are from mixed linear regression results with participant-specific random intercept and slope adjusting for age, sex, country and ethnicity, education, smoking, alcohol, diabetes, depressive symptoms, baseline cognition score and including time (years) and a time-varying CVD variable (all participants were event-free at baseline), and a time variable representing the time (years) after a CVD event. The CVD event is centred at year 0 so the time points preceding 0 (−3, −2, −1) show the change in cognition for all participants and prior to a CVD event; for those who had a CVD event, time 0 reflects the acute change in cognition as soon as the event occurs and the timepoints after 0 (1, 2, 3) show the change in cognition after a CVD event.

Research in Context

1. Systematic review:

A systematic review was conducted according to PROSPERO guidelines, to identify studies which examined the association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cognitive decline. The vast majority of studies collected information on CVD retrospectively, and did not include cognitive assessments prior to the event. The trajectory of cognitive function across multiple domains, after a CVD event, has seldom been examined.

2. Interpretation:

Our results showed that incident CVD is associated with both short- and longer-term decline in cognitive trajectories, the extent of which varies across cognitive domains.

3. Future Directions:

Further research is needed to identify subgroups of individuals most at risk of cognitive decline following a CVD event, and to determine if biomarkers could be effective in predicting risk. This information would allow the development of personalized cognitive training plans as part of the clinical management post CVD event.
