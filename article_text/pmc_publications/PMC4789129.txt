We aimed to determine whether 18F-florbetapir amyloid PET imaging shows a clinically concordant, left hemisphere dominant, pattern of deposition in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Elevated cortical amyloid (Aβ+) was found in 19/32 PPA patients. Hemispheric laterality of amyloid burden was compared between Aβ+ PPA and an Aβ+ amnestic dementia group (n=22). The parietal region showed significantly greater left lateralized amyloid uptake in the PPA group than the amnestic group (p &lt; 0.007), consistent with the left lateralized pattern of neurodegeneration in PPA. These results suggest the cortical distribution of amyloid may have a greater clinical concordance than previously reported.


INTRODUCTION

Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical dementia syndrome characterized by selective vulnerability of the language network, with salient deficits in domains of word finding, word usage, and word comprehension1. In the early stages, PPA is associated with a clinically concordant, typically left-lateralized, pattern of cortical atrophy2,3.

The most common neuropathology reported for PPA is frontotemporal lobar degeneration (~60%) followed by Alzheimer's disease (AD; ~40%)4. PPA patients with postmortem AD generally show a leftward predominance of cortical neuropathology, an asymmetry that is more prominent for neurofibrillary tangles than beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques5. This distribution of pathology is different from that of patients with typical amnestic dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) who show symmetric plaque and tangle pathology. However, previous amyloid imaging with 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) has yielded conflicting conclusions concerning asymmetry of binding in PPA6,7, 8. The present study examined whether amyloid positivity identified using florbetapir F18 (18F-AV-45), which was obtained at relatively early disease stages, would reveal a left hemisphere dominant pattern of deposition that is more consistent with the clinical picture of PPA.

METHODS

Participants

Thirty-two individuals with a root diagnosis of PPA1,3 (ages, 58–82 years; symptom duration, 4.6 ± 2.2 years) were screened for amyloid positivity using florbetapir F18 (18F-AV-45) positron emission tomography (PET). PPA patients were further characterized as logopenic (PPA-L), agrammatic (PPA-G), or semantic (PPA-S) based on quantitative neuropsychological data and clinical judgment using previously reported guidelines9. Patients who did not meet the current subtyping criteria were labeled “unclassified” (PPA-U)3, 10. All participants were right-handed.

PPA participants were recruited from the PPA Research Program at the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. Written informed consent was obtained from all PPA participants in the study. The Northwestern University Institutional Review Board approved the study.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; http://adni.loni.usc.edu), a longitudinal multisite neuroimaging study supported by the National Institutes of Health, was utilized to identify an amnestic dementia comparison group. The group included twenty-two individuals with a clinical diagnosis of DAT or mild cognitive impairment (MCI)11 who had an elevated amyloid (Aβ+) PET scan and demographics and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)12 score similar to the PPA cohort.

Amyloid PET imaging acquisition and analysis

PET imaging for the PPA group was performed on a Siemens Biograph 40 TruePoint/TrueV PET-CT system located at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, IL. Participants were administered a bolus intravenous injection of 370 MBq (10 +/− 1.0 mCi) florbetapir-F18. A CT scan was acquired for attenuation correction within 10 minutes before the beginning of PET imaging. Exactly 50 minutes post-injection, dynamic 3D imaging was continuously acquired for 20 minutes. The first 10 minutes of PET acquisition was reconstructed into 2×5 minute frames.

The ADNI participants completed an identical florbetapir PET imaging protocol at hospital and university sites nationwide. The 22 ADNI amnestic group subjects used in this study were scanned on Siemens, Phillips, and GE PET scanners.

Because of the inherent differences in PET scanners, smoothness of florbetapir signal was carefully estimated and matched for each amnestic and PPA subject. Smoothness was estimated with the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs; http://stnava.github.io/ANTs)13 and Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI; http://afni.nimh.nih.gov)14 software. Specifically, the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas15 left and right hemisphere masks were reverse normalized with ANTs from a 18F-AV-45 PET template16 to native subject space. The AAL binarized volume, in native space, was used to mask the motion corrected 2×5 minute mean PET volume with AFNI's 3dFWHMx, which estimated smoothness using a combination of first and second neighbor differences. A Gaussian kernel with varying levels of global smoothness (between 2-4mm FWHM) was applied to each amnestic subject's PET volume to achieve the same spatial smoothness of the Aβ+ PPA group. This method is ideal because it minimizes the amount of smoothing compared to typical ADNI processing, which blurs to a uniform 8mm FWHM.

For comparisons with other florbetapir studies, pre-processing methods and a priori regions from a previous report of DAT patients with pathologically confirmed AD were used17. Briefly, SPM 8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk) was used to spatial normalize each subject's florbetapir scan to a common stereotaxic space16. An average cortical cerebral-to-cerebellar standard uptake value ratio (mean cortical SUVR) was calculated using a single SUVR mask consisting of six a priori bilateral volumes of interest (VOIs) in the frontal, temporal, parietal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus regions17, 18. Elevated amyloid (Aβ+) was defined as mean cortical SUVR ≥ 1.10. This threshold has been validated by florbetapir imaging of participants with confirmed AD histopathology17.

The laterality analysis compared scans from 19 Aβ+ PPA participants to that of 22 Aβ+ amnestic participants. For this analysis, the mean SUVR mask described above was segmented by region and by hemisphere, resulting in six regional SUVR pairs. Laterality scores were calculated (see formula below) for each VOI pair to determine asymmetry among the Aβ+ subjects. A positive laterality score indicates left hemisphere (LH) greater than right hemisphere (RH) amyloid burden. Laterality Score=LHVOISUVR−RHVOISUVRLHVOISUVR+RHVOISUVR

Statistical analysis

Differences in demographics and neuropsychological performance among groups (Aβ+ PPA, Aβ- PPA, and Aβ+ amnestic) were assessed with independent two-sample t-tests or χ2 using PASW 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Laterality of amyloid burden was compared between Aβ+ PPA and Aβ+ amnestic groups for each of the six VOI using independent samples t-tests and a Bonferroni criterion of p &lt; 0.007. Within-group differences of the laterality score were assessed with a one-sample t-test.

RESULTS

Nineteen PPA participants (7 PPA-L, 8 PPA-G, and 4 PPA-U) and 22 amnestic participants (7 DAT and 15 MCI) showed elevated florbetapir burden (mean cortical SUVR ≥ 1.10) and were included in the laterality analysis (Fig 1). There was no difference in dementia severity, as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) between the Aβ+ PPA group and Aβ+ amnestic group. However, the Aβ+ PPA group scored significantly lower than the amnestic group on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE; p &lt; 0.05). This is not surprising since the MMSE is highly dependent on language ability and can overestimate dementia severity in PPA patients19. There were no significant differences in demographics or neuropsychological performance between the 19 Aβ+ and 13 Aβ− PPA patients (Table 1). Demographic and neuropsychological test scores by PPA subtype for the 19 Aβ+ participants are provided in Table 2.

Laterality scores for the 19 Aβ+ PPA and 22 amnestic participants across all six individual VOI regions (anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, precuneus, frontal, temporal, parietal) and the laterality of the mean cortical SUVR are provided in Figure 2a. Laterality scores from the parietal region of the Aβ+ PPA participants showed a significantly greater left-lateralized uptake compared to the Aβ+ amnestic group (p &lt; 0.007). The laterality score of the parietal region was significantly asymmetric (different from zero) in the Aβ+ PPA group (p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, the Aβ+ amnestic group showed no significant asymmetry of the parietal region (p = 0.827). There were no significant differences in the parietal laterality score between PPA-L (mean laterality score = 0.152 ± 0.122) and PPAG (mean laterality score = 0.153 ± 0.118; p = 0.639). Furthermore, parietal laterality scores were not correlated with age (Pearson's r = −0.056; p = 0.821). An Aβ+ PPA participant with clear asymmetric parietal uptake and an Aβ+ DAT participant with symmetric burden are provided for demonstrative purposes in Figure 2b.

DISCUSSION

This study applied the standard florbetapir methods17 for quantification to a well-characterized cohort of 32 PPA participants. In keeping with autopsy series, approximately half of PPA patients (59%) showed elevated β-amyloid binding. The differential percentage of participants with elevated amyloid in the PPA-L (78%) and PPA-S (0%) groups is consistent with prior amyloid PET imaging studies6,7. The number of PPA-G participants with elevated amyloid was higher than in previous reports. However, the fact that both PPA-L and PPA-G phenotypes showed elevated amyloid is consistent with clinicopathologic reports showing there is no one-to-one correspondence between clinical phenotypes and underlying pathology4. One of the PPA-L subjects with elevated amyloid in this study has come to autopsy and showed congruent AD pathology.

For PPA participants with elevated amyloid, greater left-lateralized Aβ asymmetry was detected in the parietal region compared to Aβ+ amnestic subjects. This left-lateralized parietal florbetapir signal is consistent with the clinical phenotype and the left-lateralized pattern of atrophy in early-stage PPA.

The few quantitative reports of in vivo amyloid PET imaging in PPA have exclusively used PiB and shown conflicting results. A single PPA case was compared to 10 DAT participants using a whole brain approach and found left-lateralized frontotemporal PiB retention8. However, two group comparison studies between PPA and DAT using PiB showed no significant differences in the hemispheric distribution of amyloid6,7. While both 11C-PiB and 18F-florbetapir identify amyloid with high reliability21,17, 20, slight differences in nonspecific white matter signal or differential binding profiles between the two amyloid radiotracers may influence quantitative metrics21.

It will be important to determine how atrophy, partial volume effects, disease stage, and PET tracers influence the detection of amyloid deposition in the cerebral cortex so that we can more accurately explain the relationship between amyloid PET measures and the pathophysiologic AD process. The asymmetry of pathology in PPA offers a unique setting for addressing this question since the right hemisphere acts as a control for the left, thus eliminating the complications inherent in inter-subject comparisons.
