The formation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques is a classical hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that is associated with the promotion of neuroinflammation and subsequent neurotoxicity. Given the limited therapeutic options for targeting and clearing Aβ plaques in AD, there is an urgent need to develop effective approaches to reduce plaque accumulation. The objective of this study was to validate mild magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) hyperthermia technology as a strategy to clear Aβ deposits and determine the impact on microglia functionality. Our results demonstrated that the heating of MNPs localized to Aβ aggregates upon exposure to high frequency alternating magnetic field (AMF) was sufficient to disrupt Aβ plaques, resulting in its fragmentation. Importantly, this could facilitate the phagocytic clearance of Aβ as well as attenuate pro-inflammatory responses by human microglial cells. Our results support the feasibility of mild MNP/AMF hyperthermia as a new strategy for reducing beta-amyloid burdens in Alzheimer’s disease.

Background

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive dysfunction and memory impairment.[1] Many lines of genetic and biochemical evidence suggest a central role of the amyloid pathway in the pathogenesis of AD where abnormal accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) into extracellular toxic plaques is responsible for the neurodegeneration and resulting dementia in AD.[2] Microglia are primary innate immune effector cells in the brain that play critical roles in the phagocytic clearance of Aβ.[3–5] Although tightly regulated activation and polarization of microglia is neuroprotective by limiting the growth and expansion of Aβ plaques,[6] microglia display a neurodegenerative phenotype that is associated with impaired Aβ clearance and chronic inflammatory response as AD-like pathology progresses.

Aβ plaque formation involves a cascade of events beginning with the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the proteolytic enzymes β-secretase and γ-secretase.[7,8] The cleavage by γ-secretase releases Aβ peptide into the extracellular space where they aggregate into oligomers, β-sheet–structured fibrils, followed by aggregation into large Aβ plaques.[7] In view of this, various anti-Aβ approaches have been directed towards interfering with the process of Aβ formation and aggregation, which include inhibitors of both β-secretase and γ-secretase, or antibodies directed to Aβ. [9] These drugs showed promising results in animal models of AD and have been at the forefront of clinical AD therapeutic development.[10,11] However, they have had limited success in mid- to late-stage clinical development and could not reach primary clinical end points.[12] This may be associated with the characteristic of the drugs designed to target specific isoforms of Aβ (e.g. monomeric, oligomeric, protofibrillar, or fibrillary) or different termini (e.g., N-terminus, C-terminus or mid domain). Although these approaches were shown to be effective in preventing the growth of plaques, they may have limitation once Aβ forms a larger aggregate.[13] Currently, there is no proven treatment for the disease and thus there is an urgent need to develop a therapeutic strategy to prevent or disrupt Aβ plaques for the treatment of AD.

The objective of this study was to apply and validate magnetic nanoparticles (MNP)/alternating magnetic field (AMF) hyperthermia as a strategy to clear Aβ deposits by promoting their disaggregation via non-invasive manner. Since its first application in an animal model of lymphatic metastases, numerous cellular and pre-clinical studies of MNP/AMF hyperthermia have been conducted, particularly for the purpose of treating cancer diseases.[14,15] Additionally, our group demonstrated the feasibility of MNP/AMF hyperthermia in eradicating bacterial biofilms by either thermally inactivating bacterial cells[16] or sensitizing their susceptibility to antibiotics.[17] A recent study demonstrated the feasibility of MNP/AMF hyperthermia in breaking up self-assembled aggregates of Aβ.[18] In this study, we determined the range of thermal dose that could be induced by the application of MNP/AMF hyperthermia to disaggregate Aβ plaques and further examined whether this could be cooperative with the functional activities of microglia towards the phagocytic clearance of Aβ plaques.

Methods

Preparation and size characterization of Aβ plaques

Aβ plaques were prepared as reported previously.[19] Briefly, Aβ1–42 film was prepared by dissolving Aβ1–42 peptide (1 mg, Bachem, #4014447) in 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoropropan-2-ol ((CF3)2CHOH) (1.5 mL) and evaporating the HFIP overnight at room temperature in a fume hood. The Aβ1–42 film (20 μM in 10 μL acetonitrile) was then dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer (270 μL) with CH3CN/Na2CO3 (300 μM)/NaOH (250 mM) (48.3:48.3:3.4, v/v/v, 30 μL). Different sizes of Aβ fibrillary plaques were prepared by reconstituting the Aβ1–42 film (20 μM in 10 μL acetonitrile) in 10 mM phosphate buffer (270 μL) with CH3CN/Na2CO3 (300 μM)/NaOH (250 mM) (48.3:48.3:3.4, v/v/v, 30 μL) and incubating them at 30°C for various time points up to 16 h. The size of the prepared Aβ was characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis on the Nanobrook Zeta Particle Analyzer. Particle size was interpreted from the read-out from the DLS machine automatically generated reports. The data was analyzed and charted with Python using seaborn[20] and matplotlib libraries.[21]

Culture of human microglial cells

Immortalized adult human microglia (C20 cell line, obtained from the Karn laboratory at Case Western Reserve University)[22] were cultured in DMEM:F12 (50:50) media with 1X N2 supplement, 100 μg/mL Normocin, 10% FBS, 1X of Pen/Strep, and freshly added 1μM dexamethasone to each culture.

Application of MNP/AMF hyperthermia and temperature measurement

Superparamagnetic dextran coated Fe3O4 nanoparticle (NanoMAG-D-SPIO 20nm, MicroMod GmBH) was used as a MNP for hyperthermia for this study. The prepared samples of Aβ aggregates (1 μM) and C20 microglia were treated with MNPs at varying concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 5 mg/mL) for 1 h. The samples were then positioned to the coil chamber of the AMF generator (MSI Automation) and applied with AMF at a field frequency of 375 kHz and field strength of 68 kA/m (measured using the 2D-HR magnetic field probe, MSI Automation) for 15 min. A fiber optic temperature probe (Neoptix) was placed in the solution and recorded the real-time temperature in the solution during the AMF exposure. Chilled water was circulated through the inner surface of the coils during the application of AMF.

Calculation of cumulative equivalent minutes at 43°C (CEM43)

The CEM43 was calculated using the CEM43 calculation Equation (1):[23] (1) ∑i=1N[RCEM](43−Ti)ti=∫0τ[RCEM](43−T)Δt

where Δt denotes the length of exposure, T is the average temperature during time interval t (min), and R is a constant equal to 0.25 for T&lt;43°C and 0.5 for T&gt;43°C. The average temperature (T) was determined by a plot of ΔT vs time measured during the application of MNP/AMF hyperthermia.

The quantification of the phagocytic clearance of Aβ by microglia.

The phagocytic clearance of Aβ was quantified by measuring the decay of thioflavin-T (ThT) signal in C20 microglia over time using a flow cytometric analysis. Aβ aggregates (1μM) were incubated with MNPs (1 mg/mL) for 1 h. The samples were applied with AMF at the same condition as above and subsequently stained with 1 mM thioflavin-T (ThT). ThT-Aβ with or without MNP/AMF treatment were added to the wells of C20 microglial cells (5.0 × 106 cells per well) and incubated for 2 h. At selected time points (2, 24, 48, or 72 h), cells were collected into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes following D-PBS washing and trypsinization. Samples were then subsequently resuspended 3x in D-PBS and run on a FACS ARIA II flow cytometer (BD Bioscience). Data was analyzed using FlowJo software (Becton Dickinson).

Assay for the phagocytic capacity of microglia

C20 microglia were seeded at 2.5 × 105 and treated with 1.0 mg/mL MNP for 1 h. The samples were then applied with AMF for 15 min at the same frequency and strength used above. Either MNP/AMF-treated or untreated microglia were incubated with fluorescent microspheres (1 μm FluoSpheres™) for 2 h. The samples were then washed 3x with D-PBS, fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min, and mounted onto a slide with VECTASHIELD Mounting Media with DAPI. Images were acquired using an Olympus IX81 inverted fluorescent microscope. Images were analyzed using Fiji ImageJ image analysis software with the provided particle analysis plugin.

Cell viability of human microglial cells.

The effect of MNP or MNP/AMF treatment on the viability of microglial was quantified using a LIVE/DEAD™ Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Invitrogen). Briefly, C20 microglia were seeded on a 96-well strip plate and treated with MNPs (1 mg/mL) for 1 h. The cells were then placed into the coil chamber of AMF and applied with AMF for 15 min at the same condition as above. At selected time points (24, 48, and 72 h), cells were treated with 2 μM calcein and 4 μM ethidium homodimer for 30 min. The viability of the cells was assessed by quantifying the calcein fluorescence for live cells and ethidium homodimer for dead cells using a microplate reader (SpectraMax® microplate reader). The results were normalized to the values of the untreated control group.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) for imaging Aβ fibrillary plaques

The TEM grid samples were stained with 1% Uranyl Acetate or 2% Uranyl Formate activated with 1M NaOH. The TEM grid was glow discharged by brief exposure to plasma prior to Aβ deposition. Post Aβ deposition, the sample was negatively stained using 1% uranyl acetate solution and then washed twice using milliQ water. Samples were imaged on a Quanta450 FEG SEM/EBL microscope then analyzed using Fiji ImageJ image analysis software.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphological analysis of microglia

C20 microglia samples were seeded (2.5×105 cells per well) onto an untreated sterile cover glass (18mm × 18mm). Samples were then washed twice with D-PBS gently and 2.5% glutaraldehyde was added and allowed to evaporate overnight. Following evaporation, 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) was added to the cells for an hour and then dehydrated in a series of ethanol washes. Samples were then mounted onto a sample holder and then gold sputtered for 3 min at 10 amps. Scanning Electron microscopy images were collected on a Quanta450 FEG SEM/EBL microscope. Images were acquired and analyzed using Fiji imageJ image analysis software.

qPCR assay

C20 microglial cells were seeded at 2.5×105 cells/well overnight and treated with either Aβ (1 mM), MNP (1 mg/mL), or MNP/AMF (at the same condition as above). Total RNA was isolated from the microglia a RNA extraction kit (OMEGA BIO-TEK). Samples were run on a thermocycler (Realplex2 -Master cycler, Eppendorf). Results were normalized with respect to the level of housekeeping gene GAPDH and expressed as a fold-change in mRNA. Human primer sequences of the genes analyzed were listed in Supplemental Materials (Table S1).

Statistical Analysis

Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). The ROUT method was performed for morphological data to determine outliers. Two-tailed unpaired t-tests and 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc analysis across multiple comparisons were used to determine statistical significance between groups. For all analyses, p-values of less than 0.05 (p&lt;0.05) was considered to be statistically significant. Data is presented as means +/− standard deviation (SD).

Results

Effects of the size of Aβ plaques on the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in human microglial cells.

It has been shown that varying forms of Aβ aggregates could exert varying degrees of neurotoxicity.[24,25] Microglia are major effector cells that mediate neuroinflammation and as such an aberrant activation of microglia has been associated with sustained and high burden of Aβ that could contribute to neurotoxicity by triggering pro-inflammatory cascades.[4] Thus, we first sought to examine whether Aβ at varying stages of aggregation could influence the capacity of human microglia (C20 cell line) to trigger a pro-inflammatory response. For this, different sizes of Aβ that might occur during the growth of Aβ plaques in AD pathology were prepared by preparing monomeric Aβ1–42 and incubating the Aβ1–42 for various time points in buffer. This protocol resulted in the generation of Aβ aggregates with varying sizes, ranging from 200 nm to 8 μm, which were characterized by DLS analysis (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). The fibrillization of Aβμ aggregates were confirmed by STEM (Fig. 1B). We subsequently examined the reactivity of C20 microglia towards Aβ aggregates with varying sizes by quantifying the expression of AD-associated proinflammatory genes. For this, cells were divided into three groups and incubated with smaller size of Aβ plaque (~200 nm, prepared at 0.5 h incubation of Aβ1–42 monomers), larger size of Aβ plaques (~6 μm), prepared at 16 h incubation of Aβ1–42 monomers, or culture media (untreated control) overnight. Our preliminary study for 1μM of Aβ was determined to be the threshold that did not elicit toxicity to C20 microglia (Fig. S2). Thus, Aβ aggregate samples prepared at 1 μM concentration were used for our subsequent experiments. The exposure of Aβ plaques to the microglia significantly increased the expression of pro-inflammatory genes including COX2, CXCL10, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 compared to untreated control, and the extent of their expression was further increased with increasing size of Aβ plaque (Fig. 1C). Taken together, our results suggest that the exposure of Aβ plaque skews microglia towards pro-inflammatory phenotype via Aβ size-dependent manner.

Determination of CEM43 thermal dose in response to mild MNP/AMF hyperthermia.

By observing the pro-inflammatory effects of larger Aβ plaques on microglia, we next sought to determine the feasibility of MNP/AMF hyperthermia as a means to non-invasively disintegrate the larger Aβ plaques within a safe thermal dose that could be applied to a brain tissue. To this end, we first characterized the capacity of our AMF system to generate heat dissipation from MNPs for varying concentrations at fixed frequency and strength of AMF. Various concentrations of MNPs (0.5 – 5 mg/mL) in equal volumes of solution were applied with AMF (at the field strength of 68 kA/m at frequency of 375 kHz) for 15 min. The extent of ΔT during the application of MNP/AMF was positively correlated with an increasing concentration of MNPs in the fluid. The application of AMF at 0.5 mg/mL MNP resulted in ΔT of 3.6°C and ΔT further increased with increasing MNP concentration for the given exposure time of 15 min, achieving ΔT of 4.9°C and 6.6°C at 1 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL-MNPs, respectively (Fig. 2A).

We next correlated the range of ΔT induced by the application of MNP/AMF with thermal dose using the parameter of CEM43, an accepted metric for thermal dose assessment for human tissues.[23,26] The estimated values of CEM43 were ranged from 0.1 min CEM43 for 0.5 mg/mL-MNP to 5.4 min CEM43 for 5 mg/mL MNP for the given exposure time of AMF for 15 min (Fig. 2B). The threshold of the safe thermal dose for brain tissue was reported to be around 10 min of CEM43.[23] Thus, our results indicate that the thermal doses induced by the application of MNP/AMF for all the considered conditions of MNP concentrations are deemed to be within the safe threshold of CEM43 for brain tissue.

The MNP/AMF-induced thermal dose was sufficient to disaggregate Aβ plaques into smaller fragments.

By characterizing the hyperthermia capability of our MNP/AMF system, we next sought to determine the range of CEM43 thermal dose that could be sufficient to disaggregate larger Aβ plaques into smaller fragments. A large size of Aβ aggregates (4.15 ± 2.56 μm) were prepared and treated with varying concentrations of MNPs (1, 3, and 5 mg/mL) for 1 h, followed by the exposure of AMF for 15 min (Fig. 3A). The application of MNP/AMF resulted in the fragmentation of Aβ aggregates even at a lower thermal dose (CEM43=0.55 min), as confirmed by STEM images (Fig. 3B). Our DLS analysis revealed that the fragmentation of Aβ was dependent on the intensity of thermal dose applied, with higher dose inducing smaller fragments (Fig. 3C). The size of the fragmented Aβ at 0.55 min of CEM43 demonstrated particle distributions ranging between 30 to 600 nm (150 ± 141nm, n=309). The fragmented Aβ induced at 5.4 min of CEM43 had a smaller scattered distribution ranging between 7 to 400 nm (100 ± 130 nm, n=138). The samples treated with AMF only had no effect on the size of Aβ. Violin plots of Aβ size distribution demonstrated that the higher the thermal dose induced by MNP/AMF, the smaller the Aβ particle size and greater the intensity (Fig. S3A). The kernel density estimation (KSE) further demonstrated that the probability of smaller fragments was increased with MNP/AMF-induced thermal dose (Fig. S3B).

We next sought to determine whether the fragmentation of Aβ following the exposure of MNP/AMF was due to an increase of ambient temperature in the solution or localized heating of MNPs bound to Aβ. For this, ambient temperature of the solution containing Aβ aggregates were elevated uniformly by 7°C for 15 min (from 37°C to 43°C) using an oven incubator and the size of Aβ was determined by DLS analysis. Our result showed that the direct application of heat shock in the absence of MNP/AMF had no effect on the size of Aβ (Fig. S4) whereas the application of MNP/AMF, resulting in same ΔT (7°C) as the direct heat shock induced by oven incubator, could result in the fragmentation of Aβ (Fig. 3C). Taken together, our results suggest that the localized heating induced by MNPs bound to or associated with the Aβ, not by the increase of ambient temperature, was responsible for the disruption of larger Aβ into smaller fragments following the exposure of MNP/AMF.

Microglia exhibited an enhanced phagocytic clearance activity towards the Aβ fragmented by MNP/AMF, contributing to attenuated expression of proinflammatory genes.

Impaired microglial responses to Aβ plaques in the brain have been associated with increased neuroinflammation and AD risk.[27–30] By observing the size dependency of Aβ aggregates in triggering pro-inflammatory gene expression in C20 microglia (Fig. 1C), we next assessed the reactivity of microglial cells towards the Aβ fragmented by the application of MNP/AMF at a thermal dose of CEM43= 0.55 min. For this, microglial cells were incubated with either control or fragmented Aβ labeled with ThT and microglia-mediated phagocytic clearance towards the Aβ was assessed by quantifying the decay of ThT fluorescence observed over the duration of 72 h (Fig. 4A). The ThT signal from microglial cells treated with fragmented Aβ induced by MNP/AMF was decreased concomitantly over 72 h, while the ThT fluorescence from the cells phagocytosing Aβ without MNP/AMF treatment remained high (Fig. 4B and 4C).

The change in C20 microglia phenotype towards reduced Aβ-clearing capability was associated with pro-inflammatory activation of microglia as AD-like pathology progresses.[31–35] Thus, we next sought to determine whether the improved phagocytic clearance activity of microglial cells towards the Aβ fragmented by MNP/AMF would lead to an attenuated inflammatory response. The expression of pro-inflammatory genes including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were increased in C20 microglia following the treatment of large Aβ aggregates compared to an untreated control. However, the responses were significantly attenuated when cells were exposed to Aβ fragmented by the application of MNP/AMF (Fig. 4D). Collectively, our results support that the application of MNP/AMF to Aβ plaques can be cooperative with the functional activities of microglial cells towards the clearance of Aβ plaques and attenuation of microglia-mediated inflammation.

Effects of mild MNP/AMF hyperthermia on the viability and morphology on microglia.

By observing the efficacy of mild MNP/AMF hyperthermia in disrupting larger Aβ plaques into smaller fragments, we next sought to determine whether the MNP/AMF-induced thermal dose applied to C20 microglial cells directly would alter their functional activities. For this, human microglial cells were exposed to MNP/AMF hyperthermia at the same thermal dose used for Aβ disruption (CEM43=0.55 min) and the viability, expression of proinflammatory genes, and morphological changes of the cells were assessed (Fig. 5A). The microglia treated with MNPs alone (1 mg/mL) exhibited a modest toxicity, with cell viability of 83.4% and 79.0% after 24 h and 72 h, respectively (Fig. 5B). This was associated with a modest increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6), compared to untreated control group (Fig. S5). However, the induction of heat shock by MNP/AMF did not further alter cell viability nor pro-inflammatory genes expression, compared to the cells treated with MNP only.

Since the morphological changes of microglia is indicative of microglial activation ranging from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory phenotypes,[36,37] we examined whether the application of MNP/AMF hyperthermia would alter the morphology of microglia. C20 microglial cells were exposed to MNP/AMF hyperthermia for 0.55 min CEM43 and the morphological changes of the cells were examined by SEM image analysis. Various parameters such as the length of major projection, number of minor projections, length of somata (cell body) perimeter, and surface morphology were compared across treatment groups (Fig. 5C and Fig. S6). The untreated control cell showed a relatively small somata displaying a smooth glossy surface with the presence of small pores or cavities and long filopodia-like major projections (with an average length of ~40.1 μm) (Fig. 5D–F), comparable to a surveilling microglia phenotype.[38] The treatment of MNPs only did not alter the surface morphology of C20 microglia, however, the cells displayed an increased somata perimeter with shortened projections compared to the untreated control group (p&lt;0.05), indicating an activated microglia phenotype. The treatment of Aβ alone resulted in a distinct morphological alteration displaying a ruffled surface morphology with an increase in somata size and decrease in the length of major projections. Interestingly, microglia exposed to MNP/AMF displayed a significant increase in the length of major projections and number of minor projections (p&lt;0.001) and decrease in somata size (p&lt;0.05), compared to MNP only group. Collectively, our results suggest that the application of MNP/AMF-induced mild heat shock to the microglia could trigger a signaling cascade that could alter the morphology of microglial cells.

Effects of mild MNP/AMF hyperthermia on the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and phagocytic activity on microglia.

Studies have shown that the induction of mild heat shock (&lt;43°C) by hyperthermia could trigger the generation of a class of chaperones such as HSPs, contributing to thermotolerance or inhibition of apoptosis by protecting cells against injury.[39,40] Since HSPs have been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of phagocytosis and chaperon-mediated autophagy of Aβ, we sought to determine whether the application of mild MNP/AMF hyperthermia (CEM43 thermal dose of 0.55 min) would alter the expression of HSPs and phagocytic activity in microglial cells (Fig. 6A). For this, C20 microglia were applied with MNP/AMF at the CEM43 thermal dose of 0.55 min and the mRNA expression of common HSPs (HSP60, HSP70, HSP90α, HSP90β, HSPA6, HSPA8, and HSPD1) were screened. The expression of all the HSPs screened in this study were significantly upregulated after exposure of MNP/AMF, particularly for HSP60 (~9-fold) (Fig. 6B). Lastly, by observing the increased expression of HSPs in microglial cells in the presence of mild MNP/AMF, we sought to determine whether this would be associated with the alteration of phagocytic activity in microglia. The phagocytic activity of microglia, quantified by the uptake of fluorescent microsphere (1 μm in size), was significantly enhanced for C20 microglia treated with mild MNP/AMF (p&lt;0.005), compared to the untreated control group (Fig. 6C and 6D). Collectively, our results suggest that the application of MNP/AMF-induced mild heat shock to the microglia could trigger a signaling cascade, associated with the increased expression of HSPs and phagocytic activity in microglia.

Discussion

The major finding of this study is that the application of MNP/AMF hyperthermia within a safe thermal dose threshold for brain tissue is feasible to direct Aβ fibril destruction via non-invasive manner. This was supported by our findings that AMF-mediated heating of MNPs localized to Aβ plaques was sufficient to disintegrate them into smaller fragments, which could facilitate the activities of human microglial cells towards the clearance of Aβ plaques as well as the attenuation of pro-inflammatory responses. Our study supports the feasibility of MNP/AMF hyperthermia as a new strategy for reducing Aβ burdens in AD.

It has been shown that Aβ-mediated microglial activation is dependent on the degree of Aβ fibril formation.[28,30] In the brains of both AD patients and mouse disease models, microglia functionality are found closely associated with the amyloid plaques and expression of proteins (e.g. TREM2) that promote microglial phagocytosis and inflammation.[41,42] Upon prolonged exposure of microglia to Aβ fibrils, microglia cannot efficiently degrade Aβ and are continuously being stimulated by the persistent accumulation of Aβ, resulting in secretion of proinflammatory cytokines that leads to neurotoxicity.[29,43] In contrast, successful degradation of Aβ fibrils by microglial cells was shown to contribute to preventing Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity and Aβ plaque formation.[44] Our results showed that the disruption of Aβ aggregates into the smaller Aβ fragments by the treatment of MNP/AMF were cleared by microglial cells in a greater manner than larger fibrillary plaques. Importantly, the facilitated phagocytic clearance of Aβ following the application of MNP/AMF hyperthermia was associated with attenuated expression of pro-inflammatory genes in microglial cells. These results support that the MNP/AMF hyperthermia to target and disrupt large Aβ plaques could be a useful strategy to facilitate the microglia-dependent clearance of Aβ deposits.

Despite the potency of MNP/AMF in therapeutic purposes, its clinical translation has been limited due to potential off-target effects on surrounding host tissue. In view of this, we assessed the effect of the direct application of MNP/AMF on the functional activities of C20 microglial cells. Microglia are dynamic cells that respond to various stimuli in their microenvironment, which can exhibit distinct phenotypes that are associated with various morphological changes.[45] Our results implicate that MNP/AMF-mediated heat shock applied to the cells might trigger intracellular signaling events associated with the alteration of cell morphology. In line with this, we observed that the application of mild MNP/AMF resulted in the increased expression of HSPs in microglia and this was associated with an increased phagocytic activity of the cells, although it remains to be further elucidated whether the altered HSPs expression was responsible for the enhanced phagocytosis. It has been shown that various factors such as HSPs or other chaperones may promote the functionality of reactive microglia.[46] For example, the activation of HSP60/HSP70 was shown to inhibit the formation of Aβ aggregate and enhanced phagocytosis and lysosomal degradation of Aβ via chaperon-mediated autophagy.[46–48]. Further, HSPA8 is well understood for its critical role in chaperone mediated autophagy,[49] demonstrating that the upregulation of HSP by MNP/AMF may confer a beneficial role in the removal of Aβ. However, another study showed that HSP60 could contribute to microglia-mediated inflammation by amplifying IL-1β-induced inflammation in microglia.[50] It remains to be further elucidated whether the MNP/AMF-induced HSPs in microglia are detrimental or functionally important in microglia-mediated Aβ clearance.

Numerous studies for the application of MNP/AMF to a brain tissue have been conducted for the purpose of treating glioblastoma (GBM) including clinical trials in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy.[15,51,52] The therapy resulted in an increase of intratumor temperature to 40–65°C, which was associated with an increase in survival rate of patients without serious complications. It is noteworthy that the CEM43 thermal doses induced by the application of MNP/AMF in this study were ranged between 0.11 and 5.5 min and most of our characterizations were performed at the condition of CEM43 of 0.55 min. The level of CEM43 is well within the reported thermal threshold for brain tissue (~10 min CEM43)[23] and blood brain barrier (~2 min CEM43).[26] This was also supported by our cell viability assays demonstrating that the exposure of MNP/AMF under the same condition used for Aβ disruption did not exhibit a toxicity against C20 microglial cells. Our results show that the extent of temperature rise required to disrupt Aβ would be much less than the one observed for the clinical trials for GBM, supporting the feasibility of applying a mild MNP/AMF hyperthermia treatment for AD patients.

In summary, our findings demonstrate that mild MNP/AMF hyperthermia, at the thermal dose deemed to be safe to brain tissue, was sufficient to disrupt Aβ plaques, whose phagocytic clearance was facilitated by microglia. Future studies should be directed towards better understanding the potential impact of MNP/AMF on the functional activity of cells of nervous tissue in the brain in vivo for the successful translation of this technology into clinics.
