Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia in seniors. Current efforts to understand the etiopathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disorder have brought forth questions about systemic factors in the development of AD. Ghrelin is a brain–gut peptide that is activated by ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) and signals via its receptor, growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). With increasing recognition of the neurotropic effects of ghrelin, the role of ghrelin system deregulation in the development of AD has been accentuated in recent years. In this review, we summarized recent research progress regarding the mechanisms of ghrelin signaling dysregulation and its contribution to AD brain pathology. In addition, we also discussed the therapeutic potential of strategies targeting ghrelin signaling for the treatment of this neurological disease.


pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia primarily attacking individuals over the age of 65 [1]. Despite a strong association of some genetic risk factors with familial AD [2,3], the etiopathogenesis of sporadic AD is not fully understood. Although senile plaques formed by amyloid beta (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles due to Tau hyperphosphorylation constitute defining pathologies of AD brains [4–6], there is a growing consensus that the etiopathogenesis of AD is a perplexing mix of protein aggregates, the aging process, environmental and genetic factors, as well as systemic derangement [7–9]. In this context, the intertwined relationship between Aβ, Tau, and other co-factors has become a pivotal scientific issue.

Ghrelin, which is sometimes referred to in literature as “acyl-ghrelin,” is an octanoylated peptide hormone primarily produced by the gastrointestinal tract [10]. Ever since the identification of ghrelin as an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) [11], the pleiotropic biological functions of ghrelin have been intensively investigated [10,12–14]. Although previous studies have predominantly linked ghrelin to the modulation of food intake and energy homeostasis [15], emerging evidence indicates that ghrelin is also a pivotal neurotropic peptide in the regulation of higher brain functions including cognition and eating behavior [12,14,16–20]. In recent years, clinical and basic research has identified ghrelin signaling deregulation in AD-related conditions and highlighted the therapeutic potential of strategies targeting ghrelin signaling for the treatment of AD [21–37]. Although the ghrelin system in AD has been intensively reviewed and discussed [22,24,31,38–41], this topic is muddled by mixed results regarding the mechanisms of ghrelin signaling deregulation in AD and the therapeutic effects of ghrelin and/or ghrelin mimetics on AD-related brain pathology and symptoms [21–36,42]. In this review, we will summarize recent research progress and focus on the role of ghrelin signaling disruption in AD pathogenesis.

Molecular mechanisms of disrupted ghrelin signaling in AD

Ghrelin and ghrelin receptor in AD

The ghrelin system is composed of ghrelin and its receptor, GHSR [10]. In contrary to the high enthusiasm for the therapeutic potential of ghrelin or ghrelin mimetic supplementation to mitigate AD brain pathology [21,23,25,39,42], the changes of ghrelin in AD patients are so far relatively understudied. Several previous clinical studies showed no difference in plasma total ghrelin between AD patients and the nondemented controls [28,29,43]. Of note, circulating total ghrelin is a mixture of ghrelin and unacylated ghrelin, which is also known as des-acyl ghrelin, that does not bind GHSR and has poorly characterized biological function [44]. It is, therefore, of great interest to determine the levels of bioactive ghrelin in AD patients. Surprisingly, a previous clinical study showed increased plasma ghrelin in an AD cohort [30]. Moreover, plasma ghrelin is elevated and negatively associated with cognitive deficits in patients with prodromal AD [29]. These clinical observations of plasma ghrelin in patients in different stages of AD implicate that increased circulating ghrelin is a phenotypic change accompanying AD, which, to some extent, contradicts the neuroprotective function of ghrelin [12,14,16–20]. This paradoxical change of ghrelin in AD is seemingly addressed by a study showing decreased mRNA levels of ghrelin in the temporal lobes of AD patients [37], implicating lowered local ghrelin provision in AD brains. However, whether ghrelin is produced in the central nervous system (CNS) remains a critical issue with no clear answer. Although several groups have reported the existence of ghrelin and/or pre-proghrelin mRNA in rodent and human brains [11,45–51], other comprehensive studies showed no ghrelin expression in the CNS [52,53]. Regardless of the debate over ghrelin production in the brain, it is currently accepted that the major source of ghrelin in the brain, especially in deep brain regions, is the ghrelin-producing cells in the GI tract [54]. In this context, increased circulating ghrelin in AD patients has raised a critical question about the functional status of ghrelin receptors in AD brains.

Consistent with decreased expression of GHSR mRNA levels in the temporal lobe of AD patients [37], Yoshino found a reduction in GHSR mRNA in peripheral leukocytes from a Japanese cohort of AD patients [30]. Although gene expression does not always correlate with protein levels, these findings imply a reduction in GHSR expression in AD patients. However, in our study, we examined the protein levels of GHSR in the hippocampal area and determined increased GHSR expression in AD hippocampi [21]. Furthermore, we have identified a physical interaction of Aβ with hippocampal GHSR, which inhibits ghrelin signaling [21,26]. Our findings of augmented GHSR expression and Aβ-induced GHSR inactivation support the functional deficit of GHSR, which may contribute to ghrelin signaling disruption in AD-sensitive brain regions. Of note, GHSR1b mRNA levels is increased in AD brains [37]. GHSR1b is a splicing variant of GHSR that does not bind ghrelin [55–57]. Although the precise biological functions of GHSR1b are unclear, it is proposed that GHSR1b inhibits GHSR function by inducing GHSR retention in the endoplasmic reticulum [58]. To this end, GHSR1b may serve as another contributing factor to dampened GHSR activity in AD-relevant pathological settings. But the protein levels of GHSR1b and the interaction of GHSR1b with GHSR in AD brains are still unknown so far.

Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 in AD

Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) is a recently identified endogenous GHSR antagonist/inverse agonist that counteracts ghrelin-mediated effects [59–62]. An interaction between LEAP2 and ghrelin has been linked to the regulation of body mass, feeding, and blood glucose in physiology and pathology [60,63–66]. Although the status of circulating LEAP2 in AD patients is not currently available, we cannot refute the possibility that patients with AD may undergo LEAP2 elevation and/or LEAP2/ghrelin imbalance. This is because increased LEAP2 is associated with obesity [60], and metabolic syndromes including obesity have been repeatedly identified to increase AD risk [67–71]. Given the inhibitory effect of LEAP2 on ghrelin-dependent GHSR activity [59–62], elevated LEAP2 has the potential to block GHSR activation, resulting in ghrelin resistance in AD brains. This question will be addressed by future examination of LEAP2 in AD patients.

Molecular mechanisms of ghrelin activation in AD

Observations of unchanged circulating total ghrelin suggest unaltered ghrelin production in AD patients [28,29,43], but increased circulating ghrelin in AD patients [29,30] has raised a question about the mechanisms of ghrelin elevation in AD-related conditions. Ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT, gene name: MBOAT4), a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) protein family is predominantly co-expressed with ghrelin by ghrelin-producing cells in the GI tract [47] and is so far the only identified enzyme that catalyzes ghrelin acetylation [52,72]. GOAT expression in the GI tract of AD patients remains elusive, but a previous study has demonstrated increased MBOAT4 mRNA levels in peripheral leukocytes of AD patients [30]. However, except for its transcriptional change, levels of functional GOAT in peripheral leukocytes from AD patients have not yet been examined. Moreover, it remains unclear whether leukocytic GOAT has the capacity to mediate significant ghrelin activation. Therefore, further effort is required to determine the contribution of leukocytic GOAT to ghrelin activation in AD. Intriguingly, a recent study from Gomez-Gomez and colleagues reported the presence of “free” plasma GOAT and its role in the maintenance of the activity of circulating ghrelin and the development of prostate cancer [73]. Although the finding of “free” circulating GOAT inspires a further exploration of its contribution to ghrelin activation in AD, this study suffers from lack of information about the source of “free” GOAT and validation of the specificity of the GOAT-detecting method. To this end, a comprehensive investigation of circulating GOAT is needed before application of plasma GOATassays to AD research. Moreover, a previous study found decreased MBOAT4 mRNA in AD brains [37], but GOAT expression and its physiological function in the brain needs further validation. Furthermore, increased GOAT expression in the brain does not explain the changes in peripheral ghrelin in AD patients.

It should be noted that the capability of GOAT to modify ghrelin by acylation is enhanced by the presence of coenzyme A (CoA)-activated fatty acids [72,74–77]. The two previous studies on plasma ghrelin in AD patients showed no correlation of ghrelin with the metabolic status of the patients [29,30], but the fatty acid levels in the tested subjects and their association with ghrelin were not comprehensively investigated. Fatty acid dysmetabolism has been repeatedly associated with AD risk and brain pathology [78–82]. We therefore cannot refute a potential impact of lipid dysmetabolism on GOAT activity in patients with AD, especially those who demonstrate metabolic syndrome, which is common in AD patients [83–86]. So far, there is no consensus on fatty acid changes in AD and a recent meta-analysis indicates decreased total fatty acids in AD patients [80]. Notably, increasing evidence suggests that medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are potent in promoting ghrelin activation by GOAT [52,53,87,88]. To this end, a correlation analysis of MCFAs, GOAT activity, and circulating ghrelin in AD patients will help to address this question.

Ghrelin mimetics as therapeutic agents for AD treatment

By virtue of ghrelin’s neurotropic properties in promoting neurogenesis and synaptic activity [14,16,20,21,89–92], much effort has been put into testing the therapeutic potential of ghrelin mimetics for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders including AD [21,22,24,26,27,35,93,94]. Massive Aβ deposition constitutes a pathological characteristic of AD brains that underlies neuronal stress [1]. It is therefore not surprising that the effects of ghrelin mimetics on brain amyloidosis have garnered the most attention. However, preclinical studies on rodent models demonstrating AD-like brain amyloidosis have shown inconsistency regarding the Aβ-lowering capacity of ghrelin mimetics. A previous study reported that administration of a GHSR agonist, LY444711 decreases hippocampal Aβ burden inTg APPSwDI mice at 6 months old [95]. The Aβ-reducing effect of LY444711 is proposed to be a result from the activation of yet-uncharacterized “hunger signaling” [95]. Furthermore, Moon and colleagues found that another ghrelin mimetic, MK-0677, lowers the density of Aβ plaques in the neocortex of young 5xFAD mice [35]. However, a later study from Moon’s group reported no effect of MK-0677 on brain Aβ deposition in the same mouse model of AD-like brain amyloidosis [96], which agrees with our data collected from young 5xFAD mice under the treatment of MK-0677 [21,26]. Such discrepancy in the Aβ-lowering effect of ghrelin mimetics may arise from the difference in mouse models, duration, and dose of different drugs as well as method of Aβ detection. However, the impact of ghrelin system activation on brain Aβ is further convoluted by an observation that [D-Lys (3)] GHRP-6, a GHSR antagonist, reduces hippocampal Aβ levels alongside decreased plasma cholesterol and glucose in obese rats [33]. These findings serve as a demonstration of the potential multifaceted impacts of ghrelin signaling in the regulation of Aβ metabolism and calls for further comprehensive investigation.

Tau hyperphosphorylation is another pathological feature of AD [1]. However, the impact of ghrelin signaling activation or deactivation on tauopathy is poorly understood. A previous study in an in vitro setting suggests an inhibitory effect of ghrelin against Tau hyperphosphorylation in high glucose-challenged cultured hippocampal neurons [36]. It is proposed that such an effect of ghrelin on Tau phosphorylation is probably through its suppression of glucose uptake and the subsequent inhibition of the AKT/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) signaling [36]. Indeed, ghrelin’s impact on AKT/GSK-3β signaling has been determined in multiple types of tissues and cells such as neurons [97,98] and pulmonary endothelial cells [99]. However, the ghrelin-mediated inhibition of AKT/GSK-3β signaling demonstrates an unexpected deleterious effect on the activity of neurons in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region, resulting in compromised memory acquisition [97]. This finding thus promotes an appraisal of the potential side effect of ghrelin and ghrelin mimetics on neuronal activity when they are used to mitigate tauopathy in AD.

Although there is no conclusive evidence to support the therapeutic effects of ghrelin and its mimetics on brain amyloidosis, previous studies have reached a consensus on their capacity in alleviating neuroinflammation and promoting neurogenesis in mouse models of AD [21,26,35,96]. These observations agree with the role of ghrelin in neurogenesis and neuroinflammation [91,100–103]. However, these ghrelin mimetic-induced beneficial effects do not ameliorate cognitive decline in 5xFAD mice [26]. Of note, elicited neuroinflammation and impaired neurogenesis are emerging key players in AD pathogenesis [104–107]. The limited effects of improved neurogenesis and suppressed neuroinflammation due to ghrelin signaling activation on cognitive function of 5xFAD mice [26] seem to remind us of the deleterious impact of Aβ-impaired neuronal ghrelin signaling, which may override the protective effects of ghrelin on neuroinflammation and neurogenesis in AD-related conditions.

Regardless of these mixed results from the preclinical observations, it is of importance to understand the therapeutic potential of ghrelin signaling activation in a clinical setting. In a large-scale clinical trial on AD patients, MK-0677 was tested with the hope of mitigating AD symptoms by reducing brain amyloidosis via the activation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling [42]. However, the patients under the treatment of MK-0677 for a duration of 12 months failed to show any improvement in their cognitive function [42]. The failure of this clinical trial has heavily battered the therapeutic potential of ghrelin signaling-targeting strategies for the treatment of AD and further raised a question about the importance of ghrelin signaling deregulation to the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disorder.

Resurrection of the role of the ghrelin system in AD pathogenesis and future perspectives

Owing to the progress in ghrelin system research, GHSR has been identified to interact with other types of GPCRs to exert its function in regulating neuronal activity. Smith’s group reported heterodimerization of GHSR and dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) in hippocampal neurons and the effect of GHSR/DRD1 heteromers on hippocampal neuronal activity [20]. Inspired by this finding, a later attempt to promote GHSR/DRD1 heterodimerization demonstrated a protective effect of a mixture of GHSR and DRD1 agonists on hippocampal synaptic activity, resulting in improved spatial learning and memory in 5xFAD mice [21]. Importantly, the simultaneous activation of GHSR and DRD1 alleviates the inhibitory effect of Aβ on GHSR’s response to ghrelin, thus restoring hippocampal ghrelin signaling in 5xFAD mice [21]. This finding serves as a critical piece of evidence supporting a role of ghrelin system deregulation via GHSR dysfunction in the development of hippocampal pathology and cognitive impairment in AD. In addition, the protective effects of the mixture of GHSR and DRD1 agonists highlight the importance of GHSR/DRD1 interaction to neuronal activity and cognition in physiology and pathology and further endorse the examination of GHSR interaction with other types of GPCR family members in AD-relevant pathological settings.

In fact, other than DRD1, several GPCRs have thus far been determined to interact with GHSR in the CNS. The interaction between GHSR and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) in hypothalamic neurons is proposed to be critical for the regulation of food intake [108]. The inhibition of GHSR by its antagonist, LEAP2, compromises the regulatory effect of GHSR on DRD2, leading to DRD2 dysfunction [62], further supporting the importance of ghrelin signaling to dopamine receptor functions in the brain. DRD2 is a Gi-coupled GPCR that is abundantly expressed in multiple brain areas including AD-sensitive brain regions such as the hippocampus [109–111]. The DRD2 polymorphism that causes decreased DRD2 expression and function has been linked with increased AD risk [112,113]. Given suppressed GHSR activation in AD-related conditions [21], it is possible that the regulation of GHSR on DRD2 activity is also impaired in AD brains, resulting in synaptic dysregulation. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that GHSR forms a heterocomplex with serotonin receptor 2C (5-HT2CR, gene name: HTR2C) to modulate appetite [114]. 5-HT2CR is abundantly distributed in brain regions that are critical for cognition [115,116]. The Cys23Ser polymorphism of 5-HT2CR has been associated with some psychiatric symptoms and appetite disturbances in AD patients [117]. The activity of -HT2CR also promotes the secretion of amyloid precursor protein (APP), from which Aβ is cleaved [118]. In consistency with the Aβ-lowering effect of serotonin in mice and humans [119], decreased serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and increased Aβ deposition in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes are associated with depressive symptoms [120]. Therefore, the potentially impaired GHSR/5-HT2CR interaction due to GHSR inactivation may constitute a contributing factor to brain pathology and clinical symptoms in AD patients. Additionally, GHSR is reported to bind melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R) [121], oxytocin receptor (OXTR) [122], cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) [123], and orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) [124] and deregulation of melanocortin [125], oxytocin [126], cannabinoid [127], and orexin [128,129] signaling may potentially contribute to AD pathogenesis. In view of the interaction of GHSR with multiple GPCRs that carry critical functions in neurophysiology, ghrelin resistance due to deactivation of GHSR may stand at the nexus of a variety of pathways leading to synaptic deficits in AD. To this end, ghrelin mimetics alone may have limited capacity to address the changes of many signaling pathways that are under the regulation of GHSR in AD-related conditions, which supports the use of a combination of ghrelin mimetics and agonists targeting other GHSR-interacting GPCRs for the mitigation of AD brain pathology.

In summary, increasing evidence supports and accentuates a critical role of ghrelin signaling dysfunction in the pathogenesis of AD. Based on current research progress, we thus propose a concept of “ghrelin resistance” in AD brains. Our hypothesis is that GHSR is desensitized in AD brains, leading to diminished ghrelin signaling and compromised neurotropic effects of ghrelin. In addition to the determined inhibitory effect of Aβ on GHSR, GHSR1b, and/or LEAP2 abnormalities may also contribute to the development of “ghrelin resistance” in AD. Indeed, ghrelin signaling also carries other important functions that regulate apoptosis and cell death [130–132], autophagy [133–135], mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress [136–138]. The disruption of the ghrelin system may also affect neuronal fitness through these mechanisms. Additionally, the hypothalamus–hippocampus circuits in cognition have received increasing recognition [139–141]. Given the abundance of GHSR in the hypothalamus and hippocampus [142] and hypothalamic pathology in AD [143,144], GHSR dysfunction may also occur in the hypothalamus, leading to impaired hypothalamic–hippocampal crosstalk. In addition to the dysfunction of ghrelin receptor, the paradoxical increase in circulating bioactive ghrelin in AD patients calls into question whether such a disease-associated ghrelin elevation is a compensatory response to GHSR deactivation that exerts a neuroprotective effect or a pathological change that contributes to the etiopathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disorder. Lastly, the protective effects of the cocktail therapy targeting both GHSR and DRD1 in AD-related conditions indicate the importance of the understanding of GHSR-related regulation of other GPCRs in physiology and pathology. The answers to these questions will help to fully depict the role of ghrelin system deregulation in AD and have a positive impact on the development of novel therapeutic avenues targeting ghrelin signaling for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disorder.
