The influence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression and severity on the structural and functional integrity of the cerebral vasculature is well recognized. The retina is an extension of the brain; thus, changes in retinal vascular features may serve as markers of AD cerebrovascular pathologies. However, differentiating normal aging-versus AD-induced retinal vascular changes is unresolved. Therefore, we compared and quantified changes in superficial (SVP), intermediate (IVP), and deep (DVP) retinal vascular plexuses in young, middle-age, and old triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xT-AD) to the changes that occur in age-matched controls (C57BL/6j). We used immunostaining combined with a novel tissue optical clearing approach along with a computational tool for quantitative analysis of vascular network alterations (vessel length and density) in SVP, IVP, and DVP. All three layers had comparable structural features and densities in young 3xTg-AD and control animals. In controls, IVP and DVP densities decreased with aging (−14% to −32% change from young to old, p &lt; 0.05), while no changes were observed in SVP. In contrast, vascular parameters in the transgenic group decreased in all three layers with aging (−12% to −49% change from young to old, p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, in the old group, SVP and DVP vascular parameters were lower in the transgenics compared to age-matched controls (p &lt; 0.05). Our analysis demonstrates that normal aging and progression of AD lead to various degrees of vascular alterations in the retina. Specifically, compared to normal aging, changes in vascular features of SVP and DVP regions of the retina are accelerated during AD progression. Considering recent advances in the field of depth-resolved imaging of retinal capillary network and microangiography, noninvasive quantitative monitoring of changes in retinal vascular network parameters of SVP and DVP may serve as markers for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer’s disease and discriminating AD-induced vascular attenuation from age-related vasculopathy.

pmc1. Introduction

Alterations in cerebral vessels are increasingly recognized as significant contributors to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid β (Aβ) and tau accumulation in cerebral and leptomeningeal capillaries, loss of pericytes, attenuation of endothelial tight junctions, impaired vasoregulation, and disrupted blood-brain barrier are among vascular pathologies identified in the AD brain(Bourassa et al., 2019; Castillo-Carranza et al., 2017; Grammas, 2011; Koizumi et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2016; Sagare et al., 2013). Additionally, AD’s acquired, and genetic risk factors are closely linked to vascular dysfunction (Bourassa et al., 2019; Nelson et al., 2016; Sakai et al., 2014).

A growing body of literature suggests that quantification of dynamic changes in cerebral vasculature can be used as an image-based biomarker to assess AD pathology’s severity and progression in the brain(Bourassa et al., 2019; Koizumi et al., 2016). Indeed, imaging modalities such as arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) have shown that cerebral blood flow decreases years before AD’s clinical presentation and considerably worsens as patients progress to clinical stages of the disease(Wang et al., 2013). However, expensive and time-consuming whole brain vascular imaging methods are unsuitable for screening millions of AD patients and at-risk individuals. In contrast to whole brain imaging, high-resolution imaging of the retina assessing AD-induced changes in retinal architecture and vascular features may serve as a more practical and cost-effective approach for early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression.

The retina is an extension of the central nervous system (CNS), shares many structural and functional properties with the brain, and is readily visible using noninvasive optical imaging modalities. Retinal vasculature is organized in three layers: superficial vascular plexus (SVP), located within the retinal nerve fiber (RNFL) and ganglion cell (GCL) layers, intermediate vascular plexus (IVP), confined between the inner plexiform (IPL) and inner nuclear (INL) layers, and deep vascular plexus (DVP), situated between the INL and outer plexiform layer (OPL)(Duggan et al., 2020; Fruttiger, 2007; Simmons and Fuerst, 2018; Yu et al., 2018). SVP comprises major retinal arteries, veins, and arterioles; IVP is mainly composed of arterioles and capillaries, whereas DVP has a rich capillary network and collecting venules(Ganesan et al., 2011; Paques et al., 2003). There is a network of arteries and veins that travel between these vascular layers(Ganesan et al., 2011; Paques et al., 2003).

Retinal vascular abnormalities correlate with age-associated hippocampal microvascular changes and cognitive decline seen in the elderly, suggesting that monitoring the degree of the alteration in the retinal vascular structure and function may serve as a tool that can be used for the assessment of the progression of neurodegeneration in the aging brain(Hagino et al., 2004; Lesage et al., 2009; Ravi Teja et al., 2017). In AD, histopathologic studies conducted in animal models of AD as well as human samples show amyloid and tau deposition in retinal and brain vasculature along with perivascular neuroinflammation(Dutescu et al., 2009; Koronyo-Hamaoui et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2009; Ning et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2021). Additionally, high-resolution depth-resolved imaging studies using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) have reported the occurrence of retinal vascular changes in patients at preclinical and clinical stages of AD, supporting the concept that retinal vascular changes in AD may correlate with brain pathologies(Bulut et al., 2018; Gameiro et al., 2018; Grewal et al., 2018; Haan et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2018; Lahme et al., 2018; Querques et al., 2019; Van De Kreeke et al., 2019; Yoon et al., 2019b). However, these promising findings are preliminary and appear to be contradictory (Querques et al., 2019; Van De Kreeke et al., 2019), failing to demonstrate how the extent of AD-induced retinal vascular changes can be used to discriminate retina vascular alterations caused by aging or cardiovascular diseases from those caused by AD. Furthermore, although it has been shown that retinal blood flow in each vascular plexus is coupled and regulated with metabolic demand in their respective retinal layers (Kornfield and Newman, 2014), how disease burden and the progression of AD alters the retinal vascular distribution and neuronal layers are still unclear.

In the current study, we investigated, for the first time, the age-dependence of architectural features and density of retinal vasculature in young, middle age, and old age groups in an AD mouse model as compared to age-matched controls. We used the 3xTg-AD model because it expresses both amyloid and tau pathologies and closely mimics AD’s cerebral and retinal pathologic manifestations in human(Chiasseu et al., 2017; Chiquita et al., 2019; Oddo et al., 2003b). Using an immunofluorescent approach combined with a novel optical clearing technique designed to allow for the visualization of the deeper vascular layers of the intact retina using confocal microscopy for quantitative retinal vascular analysis, we demonstrated that all three retinal vascular plexuses exhibit age-dependent vascular attenuation accompanying the progression of AD from young to old age. Furthermore, SVP and DVP densities were significantly lower in the old transgenic model than in age-matched control eyes. Our analysis suggests that assessing changes in SVP and DVP vascular density may lead to the development of an image-based biomarker that can be used for AD diagnosis and staging.

2. Methods

2.1. Animals and their care

The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all animal experiments. Mice were maintained with food and water access ad libitum and on a 12-h light and dark cycle.

The triple transgenic B6; 129-Psen1tm1Mpm Tg (APPSwe, tauP301L)1Lfa/Mmjax (3xTg-AD) and C57BL/6j mice were used for the studies. 3xTg-AD mouse expresses the pathological hallmarks of AD (Fig. 1) and degenerating retinal structure and function in an age-dependent manner(Chiquita et al., 2019; Ioshimoto et al., 2012). The original line of 3xTg-AD mice was obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained at the University of Texas Medical Branch animal facility with genotyping confirmation of the mutations in randomly selected progenies. 3xTg-AD mice will be referred to as “transgenic” in this manuscript. C57BL/6j mice served as controls. Animals were grouped into three age groups of 2-month-old that will be called “young,” 8–14-month-old that will be called “middle-age,” and 18–20-month-old that will be called “old.” At least three animals (out of 22 animals) were included in each age/genotype group. Only one eye yielded quality images in some animals needed to quantify vascular density; thus, each age/genotype group eventually consisted of three to five retinas. To eliminate potential confounding sex-dependent differences, only female mice were used in this study(Carroll et al., 2010).

2.2. Retinal flat-mount immunofluorescent staining and optical clearing

Anesthesia was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of a 60 mg/kg Ketamine and a 0.5 mg/kg Dexmedetomidine combination followed by cervical dislocation for euthanasia. Then, cardiac perfusion was performed using 20–40 ml of ice-cold PBS, followed by 20–40 ml of freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Both eyes were enucleated and were immediately immersed in ice-cold PFA 4% for overnight fixation. Next, the eye was placed under a dissecting microscope to isolate the retina, an incision was made around the limbus, and the cornea, iris, lens, and vitreous body were removed. The retina was carefully dissected from the underlying retinal pigment epithelial (RPE), choroid, and sclera. Retina tissue was then washed in PBST (PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20) and incubated in PBST containing 5% normal goat serum for 4 h at room temperature (RT) or overnight at 4° C. A 48-h incubation with anti-mouse anti-collagen IV antibody (Abcam, ab19808, 1:200 in PBST containing 5% normal goat serum) at RT followed. Following incubation with the primary antibody, the retinas were washed with PBST and probed with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 546, 1:200, Life Technologies) for 12 h at RT. Finally, the intact whole retina samples were washed with PBS and then optically cleared using a method that we reported previously using 2,2′-Thiodiethanol (TDE) as the agent for tissue clearing(Nazari et al., 2021). In brief, each sample was incubated at room temperature in an increasing concentration of TDE that started with 10% TDE in PBS for 1 h and then in progressively increasing TDE solution concentrations, in 10% increments, up to 60% TDE. Retinal tissue generally started to clear after incubation in 50% TDE solution. Retina samples were placed on a glass slide with retinal ganglion cell side up, and four to six radial cuts were made to flatten the retina. The samples were then mounted with 60% TDE solution and covered with a glass coverslip.

Brain tissues were collected, fixed overnight in ice-cold PFA 4%, and transferred to 30% sucrose solution for ~48 h until the tissue sunk into the sucrose solution. Then, the brain samples were placed in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) and were preserved in −80° freezer for future staining. Representative young and old transgenic and control animal brain samples were stained for Aβ and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau). Five-micron brain tissue sections were cut and placed on frosted glass slides. Sections were blocked in PBST containing 5% normal goat serum for 4 h at room temperature (RT) and then, incubated withanti-amyloid-β (1:200; clone 6E10; Biolegend #803007) and anti-p-tau (1:500; monoclonal antibody AT180, Invitrogen #MN1040) antibodies overnight at 4C. Sections were washed in 1x PBS and incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:500; AAF488; Invitrogen #A-11029). Slides were viewed under a confocal microscope, and pictures were taken from representative frontal cortex, dentate gyrus (DG), CA1, and CA3 layers of the hippocampus (Fig. 1).

2.3. Retina vascular visualization using confocal microscopy

A confocal microscope (LSM880, Carl Zeiss) equipped with 405, 488, 561 nm lasers with a × 20 air objective (20 × /0.8) was used for imaging. Midperipheral fields (0.5–1.5 objective distances from the optic nerve head margin) were selected while focusing only on the superficial microvascular plane (Fig. 1). Two non-overlapping regions of interest (ROI) from each petal (eight ROIs in total for each sample) were imaged. After selecting each field, the focal plane was reset to the superficial vascular plexus. Z-stacks encompassing all three retinal vascular networks (usually 40–60 μm in thickness) were captured at 1 μm intervals. Initially, four 413 × 413 μm squares were scanned and stitched with Zen lite (blue edition; Carl Zeiss Meditec) to create a composite 810 × 810 μm picture. Since image quality was poor at some areas of this larger square, only one of the 413 × 413 μm (1000 × 1000 pixel) images from each area was used for final quantification. Z-stacks corresponding to each ROI were opened with the ZEN lite program (blue edition; Carl Zeiss Meditec). Image contrast and brightness were adjusted to allow maximum identification of the vascular plexus. Three vascular plexuses were identified based on their location within the retina and in relation to other vascular plexuses and inter-layer connecting blood vessels, their morphology, and their density(Ganesan et al., 2011; Milde et al., 2013; Paques et al., 2003). Superficial vascular plexus (SVP) was identified as the most superficial (innermost - closer to the vitreous cavity) vascular plexus of the retina. SVP consists of large retinal arteries and veins that branch out to arterioles, venules, and capillaries, located within the inner 15 μm of the retina. Connecting vessels originate from these arterioles and venules reaching deeper into the retina to connect to the intermediate vascular plexus (IVP). IVP is closely located to SVP (5–12 μm) and usually consists of a vascular net with open loops. Penetrating vessels between IVP and deep vascular plexus (DVP) branch out from IVP at a steep angle and travel deeper (10–25 μm) to connect to DVP. DVP consists of a dense plexus of interconnected capillaries sometimes interspersed with larger collecting venules. Within ZEN blue, z scans were played from the most superficial (inner) to the deeper scans, and successive scans that contained the superficial, intermediate, and deep vascular plexuses were identified based on the above features. In samples where SVP and IVP were too close to each other to be readily identifiable, the images were reviewed by 2–3 of the investigators to help to define the boundaries of the layers. After z stacks encompassing each vascular layer were identified, average orthogonal projections of the layers were extracted within ZEN lite and saved as.tif files. As part of this effort, we also attempted to characterize the penetrating blood vessels connecting vascular layers; however, identifying details of penetrating vessels in the presence of artifacts was not reliably possible.

2.4. Retinal vascular quantification

Tif images with faint vascular outlines were opened in the Microsoft Paint program, and vessels were traced manually (Fernández-Sánchez et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2012) with a 10–15-pixel width Wacom Intuos pen. The orthogonal views were subsequently processed by AngioTool 0.5a, a Java-based publicly available open-source software accessible from the National Cancer Institute (https://ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/display/ROB2).(Zudaire et al., 2011) AngioTool has been used to study retinal capillary plexus, post-embryonic retinal vascular development, and choriocapillaris(Sugano et al., 2018; Zudaire et al., 2011). AngioTool quantifies vascular network morphological and spatial parameters such as ROI area, vessel area, vessel density, the total number of intersections, total vessel length, and the total number of endpoints based on a set of user-defined intensity, vessel diameter, and particle size thresholds. These parameters were optimized to delineate the vascular structure in different retinal vascular layers(Singh et al., 2017; Sugano et al., 2018; Zudaire et al., 2011). The steps involved in the application of AngioTool for analysis of vessel structure is summarized here: 1) Enhancement of vessel structure with the multiscale Hessian analysis and smoothing with a recursive Gaussian filter, 2) Segmentation and skeletonization of the vessels, and 3) Calculation of the morphometrical parameters. First and second-order retinal arteries and veins were studied in a pilot analysis of retina images and were found to have a diameter greater than 30 pixels. Any vessels wider than 30 pixels were filtered out from the quantification before quantifying retinal arterioles, venules, and capillaries(Ganesan et al., 2011; Paques et al., 2003). Because collagen IV antibody stains both intact and degenerated vessels, we set a lower width limit of 5 pixels to eliminate degenerated vessels from quantification. AngioTool quantification was performed by a trained investigator who was blind to the age and genotype assignment of the samples. One or two senior investigators reviewed faint and noisy images to adjudicate the vessel’s outline in doubt. Vessel intensity was set at 20–50 for all images (on a scale of 0–255). The option checkboxes, “Remove small particles” and “Fill holes,” were selected if the immunofluorescent artifacts were seen as small particles on the background or small holes within the thickness of the vessels (Fig. 2).(Zudaire et al., 2011) In the current study, we analyzed three morphology and density parameters: total vessel length (TL-linear pixel length), the total number of intersections (TI), and the total number of endpoints (EP) (Fig. 2B). (Singh et al., 2017; Wälchli et al., 2015; Zudaire et al., 2011) Total vessel length was calculated as the sum of all the vessels length defined by the distance between two vessel intersections or between an intersection and an endpoint. The number of intersections indicates the amount of branching in a capillary plexus. A higher number of endpoints indicates a denser vascular plexus with a higher number of vessels. Similarly, total vessel length is an indicator of vessel density in each region of interest. Since some images were manually enhanced for the analysis using a digital pen, as described above, vessel diameter and total vessel area were excluded from analysis.

2.5. Data analysis and statistics

Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations, were used to describe the sample population. The study outcomes were modeled to detect differences among groups using mixed-effects linear regression for accounting for repeated observations within the subject. Since all subjects provided multiple biological samples from each eye, 3-level models were initially employed with subject identification number as first, eye (right/left) as second, and observation as the third level with each subsequent level being nested within the previous one. Initial analysis revealed that the second level (eye) did not contribute significantly to the observed variation in any of the outcomes; therefore, in the final analyses, 2-level models were employed using random intercept for subject identification number to account for repeated observations within subjects. Mixed-effect linear regression modeling was performed using the R package nlme(Pinheiro et al., 2020). All analyses were performed using the R language for Statistical Computing(R Core Team, 2020).

3. Results

In this study, we analyzed the retinal vascular density by measuring the number of vessel intersections, endpoints, and total length in three distinct regions of the retina. Each of these vascular measurements provides an estimate of overall vessel density. For each vascular layer, data were analyzed for age-dependent changes within each genotype. The subsequent analysis compared vascular parameters of transgenic versus controls for each age group. Figs. 3–5 provide example images and bar graphs summarizing vascular measurements from each retinal region. Fig. 1 shows amyloid β and phosphorylated tau expression in brain regions of old 3xTg-AD animals compared to young 3xTg-AD and old C57Bl/6j.

3.1. Superficial vascular plexus (SVP)

In the SVP, the total number of intersections (TI), total vessel length (TL), and the total number of endpoints (EP) decreased by age in the transgenic group but not in the control group (Fig. 3). The relative difference of the total number of SVP intersections (TI) in old relative to young subjects was −34% in the transgenics (p = 0.004) and −18.64% in the controls (p = 0.181). The relative difference of the total SVP vascular length (TL) in old relative to young subjects was −21% in the transgenics (p &lt; 0.001) and −6% in the controls (p = 0.7). The relative difference of the total number of endpoints (EP) of SVP in old relative to young subjects was −32% in the transgenics (p = 0.006) and −16% in the controls (p = 0.161).

Comparing 3xTg-AD to control groups, SVP vascular parameters in young subjects, the TI, TL, and the EP were not statistically different.

Similarly, in the middle age group, SVP parameters did not differ by genotype. However, in old subjects, one of the SVP vascular parameters, the TI was lower in 3xTg-AD relative to controls (p = 0.028). In contrast, the other parameters, TL and EP were not statistically different by genotype.

3.2. Intermediate vascular plexus (IVP)

In the IVP, several density vascular parameters exhibited an age-dependent difference in transgenic and control groups (Fig. 4). The relative difference of TI in old compared to young subjects was −31.44% in the transgenics (p = 0.026) and −30.97% in the controls (p = 0.041). The relative change in the TL in old compared to young subjects was −13.04% in the transgenics (p = 0.001) and −14.24% in the controls (p = 0.14). The relative difference of the EP in old compared to young subjects was −24.4% in the transgenics (p = 0.111) and −12.92% in the controls (p = 0.393).

For young subjects, IVP parameters TI, TL, and EP were not statistically different in the 3xTg-AD animals compared to control groups.

Similarly, in the middle age group, TI and EP did not differ by genotype. However, TL was significantly lower in the middle age transgenic compared with the control groups (p = 0.02). For the old subjects, the TI, TL, and EP did not differ between the transgenic and control groups.

3.3. Deep vascular plexus (DVP)

In the DVP, TI, TL, and EP changed by age in transgenic and control groups (Fig. 5). For TI, the relative difference in old compared to young subjects was −48.7% in the transgenics (p = 0.004) and −32.7% in the controls (p = 0.001). For TL, the relative difference in old compared to young subjects was −24.0% in the transgenics (p = 0.001) and −14.1% in the controls (p = 0.018). For EP, the relative difference in old compared to young subjects was −26.9% in the transgenics (p = 0.023) and −30.5% in the controls (p &lt; 0.001).

For young subjects, TI, TL, and EP were not statistically different in the 3xTg-AD and control groups. Similarly, in the middle age group, DVP parameters did not differ by genotype. However, for the old subjects, TI (p = 0.037) and TL (p = 0.016) were significantly lower in 3xTg-AD compared to controls. However, the EP (p = 0.312) did not differ by genotype.

4. Discussion

Aging is the most significant risk factor for AD, possibly because age-related cerebral neuronal and vascular changes predispose individuals to AD neurodegeneration(Brown and Thore, 2011). Although cerebral neuronal and vascular loss is detectable with advanced imaging modalities (Wang et al., 2013), isolating aging-versus AD-associated neurovascular degeneration, two simultaneously occurring vascular alterations in an AD, is a challenge. We quantified retinal SVP, IVP, and DVP densities in young, middle age, and old AD transgenic and control mice using a novel tissue optical clearing combined with an immunofluorescent method that enhanced our ability to detect the deeper retinal vascular network(Nazari et al., 2021). In control animals, DVP and, with a lesser degree, IVP densities decreased with natural aging. In contrast, all three retinal vascular plexuses (SVP, IVP, and DVP) significantly attenuated with aging in the transgenic group. Comparing transgenic and control animals, our study demonstrated that SVP and DVP densities were significantly lower in old transgenic mice compared to their age-matched controls. Thus, we propose that SVP and DVP densities are indicators of AD-related vascular rarefaction in the retina, as supported by several recent clinical OCTA studies of human retina (Bulut et al., 2018; Grewal et al., 2018; Lahme et al., 2018; Yoon et al., 2019a; Y. S. Zhang et al., 2019b). Enhanced age-dependent retinal vascular attenuation in AD model, as noted by our quantification method, was in parallel with the histologic evidence of AD’s pathologic hallmarks, amyloid β and phosphorylated tau, in old 3xTg-AD brain (Fig. 1).

Our observations of an enhanced retinal microvascular loss in 3xTg-AD retina compared to nontransgenic controls are in agreement with studies that quantified cerebral vasculature in AD models and showed a significant decline in cerebral microvascular density and morphology associated with AD pathologies(Bourasset et al., 2009; Do et al., 2014; Kouznetsova et al., 2006; Szu and Obenaus, n.d.). AD-associated vascular attenuation may start early in the course of the disease, as shown in the 3xTg-AD model manifesting a reduction in the brain vascular volume at six months of age, before the appearance of pathological plaque and tangle lesions (Do et al., 2014). Multiple theories have been proposed to explain such predisposition to vascular remodeling and loss in AD brain, including mechanical displacement of microvessels by amyloid plaques, the adaptation of the vascular network to a declining metabolic demand caused by neuronal loss (Berisha et al., 2007; Joyal et al., 2018; Usui et al., 2015), and toxic effects of amyloid-β that induces a pro-inflammatory reaction targeting microvessels via astrocytes and microglia activation(Paris et al., 2013). Such retinal vascular alterations in association with retinal pathologic changes caused by AD may initially manifest as decreased flow in the anatomically intact retinal vascular plexuses. However, active vessel remodeling and vascular drop-out partially mediated by inflammatory phagocytic processes (Binet et al., 2020) may eventually ensue.

Multiple investigations have suggested a correlation between the retinal microvascular network flow and vascular density with metabolic demands originating from various retinal sublayer (Fernández-Sánchez et al., 2018; Kiryu et al., 1995; Kornfield and Newman, 2014; Lavia et al., 2020; Paques et al., 2003; Sapieha et al., 2008). Thus, retinal vascular loss caused by senescence and AD may potentially be a path-ophysiologic consequences of neuronal loss and the associated decreased metabolic demand during aging and AD progression. Aging neurodegeneration, unlike Alzheimer’s pathology, primarily affects outer retinal layers(Cunea et al., 2014; Curcio, 2001). Thus, a relatively stable SVP, mildly attenuated IVP, and severely attenuated DVP in nontransgenic animals, as observed by us and others (Fernández-Sán-chez et al., 2018), may be explained by normal aging-associated outer retinal degeneration and the resulting decline in outer retinal metabolic demand. In contrast to animal studies, OCTA studies on humans have found that all three superficial, intermediate, deep capillary plexuses attenuate in the parafoveal retina with normal aging(Garrity et al., 2017; Lavia et al., 2020). Absence of a macula in rodents and the relative discordance between the histology and OCTA findings that partially originates from OCTA’s inability to detect vessels with no blood flow-may explain these seemingly contradictory observations.

Our immunofluorescent observations that show an enhanced vascular loss in AD versus aging are consistent with prior studies(Bennett et al., 2018; Buée et al., 1994; Fischer et al., 1990; Paris et al., 2004; X. Zhang et al., 2019a). It is established that unlike aging and cardiovascular diseases that usually cause diffuse cerebral vascular pathologies (Schager and Brown, 2020), Alzheimer’s-related cerebral vasculopathy are skewed toward areas with a higher amyloid and tau burden, such as the hippocampus(Bennett et al., 2018; Buée et al., 1994; Fischer et al., 1990; Paris et al., 2004; X. Zhang et al., 2019a). Similar to the changes that have been reported in the brain, amyloid and tau deposition in the retina are concentrated in GCL, inner and outer plexiform layers, and INL (Grimaldi et al., 2019; Xia et al., 2021), perfused by SVP, IVP, and DVP. However, IVP that supplies IPL and INL and assumes a transitory network to transfer blood to DVP is a very reactive layer in response to metabolic demands(Kornfield and Newman, 2014). Although the estimated blood volume in IVP is significantly less than SVP and DVP, IVP flow increases in response to the light stimulus significantly more than the other layers(Kornfield and Newman, 2014). IVP’s potent response to increased metabolic demand may be derived from the stimulus type (for example, flicker light stimulates middle retinal neurons served by IVP) (Lau and Linsenmeier, 2012). Alternatively, IVP may have differential autoregulation pathways compared with the other retinal vascular plexuses or have a differential pathologic burden around its vessels (Horsfield et al., 2013; Hudetz et al., 1995; Meyer et al., 2008; Reilly et al., 2003; X. Zhang et al., 2019a). IVP attenuation from young to old age occurred in both transgenic and control animals. IVP density was lower in middle-aged transgenic animals than controls, but it was not different between old transgenic and control groups. This observation may be due to a faster IVP attenuation in AD transgenic retina from young to middle age compared to middle age to old age. It may also show a comparable aging and AD degenerative burden on bipolar and amacrine cells located in INL (Usui et al., 2015) and higher IVP resilience to AD metabolic insult in older transgenic animals(Kornfield and Newman, 2014).

Decreased SVP and DVP density in 3xTg-AD animals is likely associated with compromised retinal vascular function caused by amyloid and tau deposition(Shi et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2021). Such altered retinal vascular function that may include blood-retinal barrier dysfunction, increased vascular leakage, and toxic protein accumulation, possibly contributes to the retinal thickness and volume as quantified by OCT and OCTA. Retinal thickness is determined by the sum of its vascular and neuronal mass. Thus, it is conceivable that SVP atrophy contributes to inner retinal thinning detected by OCT in animal models and patients with AD.(Ascaso et al., 2014; Nazari et al., 2018) On the other hand, a simultaneous increase in vascular permeability and resultant localized retinal edema due to the amyloid/tau vasculopathy (Xia et al., 2021) could counter the thinning effect of degenerative processes. These potential simultaneous mechanisms highlight that a combination of complex trophic and atrophic processes will ultimately determine the retinal sublayer thicknesses.

Another aspect of our work is the method used to achieve a detailed view of the retinal vascular network and quantify retinal vascular density. In a well-accepted AD model (Oddo et al., 2003a, 2003b, 2003a), we used a novel modified tissue optical clearing technique to enhance visualization of retinal vascular layers. While high-resolution imaging of deeper retina with conventional confocal microscopy is possible (Ganesan et al., 2011; Paques et al., 2003), this approach is often compromised due to the optical diffraction from the retina’s inner nuclear and plexiform layers(Singh et al., 2017). We developed and applied a modified tissue optical clearing method to minimize light scattering and absorption to render deeper retinal vasculature visible for better vascular quantification(Nazari et al., 2021). In addition, we utilized a semiautomated vascular skeletonization and quantification approach using AngioTool (Sugano et al., 2018; Zudaire et al., 2011) to quantify and contrast age-related retinal vascular changes in AD transgenic versus age-matched controls. With this approach, we attained a less user-dependent, and more reproducible quantification of retinal capillary plexus structure and density than the manual tracing of retinal vessels as reported previously(Fernández-Sánchez et al., 2018).

With regards to the choice of the animal models used in our study, it should be noted that 3xTg-AD model is developed on B6; 129 background that in turn, is developed by cross-breeding C57bl/6 and 129 mice. Thus, although previous studies on brain vascular pathologies in 3xTg-AD mice have used C57bl/6 as control (Do et al., 2014; Hohsfield et al., 2014), C57bl/6j may not function as an ideal immediate wild-type control for the 3xTg-AD model. However, considering the identical vascular development and remodeling in C57bl/6 and 129S2/Sv mice (Rust et al., 2019) and similar aging pathologies in C57bl/6 and B6; 129 (Haines et al., 2001), a growing body of literature continues to use C57bl/6 as controls for studies involving 3xTg-AD.(Gardner et al., 2020; King et al., 2018; Kosaraju et al., 2016; Nakashima et al., 2010; Shapira et al., 2018).

Conclusion.

Individuals with preclinical and clinical AD show decreased retinal vascular density(Jiang et al., 2018; O’Bryhim et al., 2018; Van De Kreeke et al., 2019). However, the extent of age-related versus AD-related retinal vascular changes is not clear yet. Our findings suggest that normal age-related retinal vascular changes are accelerated by AD pathology, and the pattern of retinal capillary loss caused by aging versus AD is different. Thus, we propose that a noninvasive retinal imaging-based grading system that weighs SVP and DVP densities against IVP density may detect AD-induced neurovascular pathologies’ initiation and progression. The translation aspects of these findings need to be further validated in humans.

Fig. 1. Amyloid-β and phosphorylated-tau deposition in brain sections.

Brain cortex, CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) areas of young and old 3xTg-AD and old C57Bl/6j are immunostained for amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Panel A demonstrates amyloid-β immunoreactivity (green) in old 3xTg-AD brain sections (middle column). Similarly, panel B demonstrates phosphorylated tau immunoreactivity (green) in old 3xTg-AD brain sections. Young 3xTg-AD and old C57Bl/6j sections did not stain with anti-amyloid-β (6E10) or anti-phosphorylated tau (AT180) antibodies (panels A and B). Cell nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). Magnification: x20. White scale bar: 100 μm.

Fig. 2. Image analysis of retinal vascular plexus.

(A) Retinal flat-mounts were stained for collagen IV. Eight non-overlapping regions of interest (ROI) from the midperipheral retina were Imaged (left). Tissue optical clearing allowed better visualization of intermediate and deep vascular plexuses for AngioTool analysis. A magnified view of all three layers from a representative ROI is shown on the right (10x, scale bar 1000 μm). Flat projections of each superficial, intermediate, and deep vascular plexuses were created with ZEN Lite, and the layers were analyzed using AngiTool. (B) Representative superficial (SVP), intermediate (IVP), and deep (DVP) vascular plexus views before (left) and after (right) AngioTool analysis. Vessel outlines and intersection points were highlighted. Only vessels with 5–29-pixel diameter were filtered for detection. (C) Intersections (thick arrow) and endpoints (thin arrow) were detected by AngioTool. Total vessel length is the sum of vessel lengths in each field.
