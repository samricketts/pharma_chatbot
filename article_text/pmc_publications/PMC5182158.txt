The ubiquitin mutant UBB+1 has been identified as a hallmark of neurodegenerative disease. In this study, we characterize polyubiquitinated forms of UBB+1 in vitro and from patient samples. The ability of UBB+1 to be readily ubiquitinated by several E2 enzymes provided a mechanism for the controlled synthesis and purification of defined conjugates. This allowed us to utilize polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates for biochemical assays, as well as solution NMR. Coupled with our immunoassay for detection of ubiquitinated forms of UBB+1 in patient blood samples, we gain a clearer picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disease.

1. Introduction

Inhibition and decreased function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a common hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s and Huntington’s (1–4). Many suspect that this disruption in protein homeostasis is a root cause of cytotoxicity, however, there is a debate as to whether these proteins are truly toxic or merely a symptom brought on by other factors (5). Aside from the classic disease causing protein (e.g. alpha-synuclein, Parkin, or Huntingtin) there is frequently a disruption in the ubiquitin (Ub) gene UBB mRNA transcript itself and many forms of polyUb are found within aggregates (6). Specifically a frame shift mutation near the end of the UBB mRNA sequence results in UBB+1, a Ub variant carrying a G76Y mutation followed by 19 additional residues (6–8).

Recent work has uncovered that UBB+1 may in fact be more pathological than an aggregated protein, such as alpha-synuclein (9). From a physiological viewpoint, this is a reasonable assumption given the concentration of Ub is relatively high (~40µM) in the cell compared to other proteins (10). A great deal of in vitro work provides many hints as to how UBB+1 can be detrimental to cell function, specifically its ability to inhibit proteasomal degradation (11, 12). The main outcome of UBB+1 and other variants (e.g. UBBG76V/+25) expressed in organisms (mouse and drosophila) is the accumulation of polyUb conjugates (5, 6, 13, 14). Interestingly, artificial expression of UBB+1 in HeLa and yeast cells also produced an accumulation of polyUb conjugates and simultaneous inhibition of proteasomal degradation (8, 15), suggesting this is a general property of UBB+1 and not necessarily restricted to neuronal cells. It is established that the length of C-terminal extension and also the residue at position 76 in UBB+1 both influence how proteasome and deubiquitinases (DUBs) are impacted by UBB+1 variants (9, 11, 14, 16).

With our current understanding it is unclear if UBB+1 has the same signaling and recognition properties as Ub wild-type (UbWT). Structural investigation of UBB+1 demonstrated that the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of E2-25K (UBE2K), binds UBB+1 similar to UbWT, while the C-terminal extension itself forms no direct interactions (11). However, even with essentially the same binding mode, UBB+1 appeared to have an increased affinity for E2-25K UBA (11). It is known that polyubiquinated forms of UBB+1 (polyUb–UBB+1) are present in the cell, yet very little is understood regarding their signaling properties.

In this study we setout to establish methods for controlled synthesis of polyUb–UBB+1 and characterize the properties of these conjugates with DUBs, as well as various components of the UPS. We then utilize solution NMR methods to probe the structural conformations of K48- and K63-linked polyUb–UBB+1. By implementing an immunoblot protocol for patient blood, we detect the presence of physiological polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates in AD patients.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Synthesis and purification of polyUb–UBB+1

Conventional linkage specific enzymes were used to generate polyUb–UBB+1. By default UBB+1 served as the proximal unit, while the chain length was controlled by addition of UbK48R/K63R for dimeric conjugates or UbWT for longer forms (17, 18). In brief NLEL170-782/UbcH7, UBE2S, E2-25K, and Ubc13/Uev1 were used to make K6, K11, K48, and K63 linkages, respectively according to (19, 20). Incorporation of an N-terminal 6xHis tag on UBB+1 allowed for easy isolation of polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates, which were then separated on a superdex 75 16/60 size exclusion column (GE Life Sciences). Immunoblots of conjugates were performed with several rabbit primary antibodies in a 1:1,000 dilution: anti-His6 (GenScript A00174-40), anti-ubiquitin (Dako Z0458), anti-K48 ubiquitin clone Apu2 (Millipore 05-1307), anti-K63 ubiquitin clone Apu3 (Millipore 05-1308). All polyUb conjugates were run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE (GeneScript) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Thermo Scientific) using an eblot Protein transfer system (Genscript). Membranes were incubated with IgG goat anti-rabbit HRP (Bio-Rad) secondary antibody in a 1:50,000 dilution and visualized using a ChemiDoc Imaging system (BioRad). For unambiguous communication, UBB+1 conjugates are named following the system from (21) throughout.

2.2 Fluorescein labeling of UBB+1

Purified UBB+1 containing an N-terminal Cys was labeled with 5-meleimido-fluorescein (5MF, Sigma 38132). 250 µM Cys-UBB+1 was incubated with a 12 fold molar excess of 5MF for 6 hours at ambient temperature, in a total volume of 1mL PBS, pH 7.4. The reaction was quenched by introducing a 15 fold molar excess of 2-mercaptoethanol for 1 hour. The labeling reaction was centrifuged at top speed for 10 minutes and the supernatant was dialyzed into PBS pH 7.4 buffer. Finally, FluoresceinUBB+1 was loaded onto a Superdex 75 10/300 GL size exclusion column (GE Life Sciences) in PBS pH 7.4 buffer. FluoresceinUBB+1 appeared as a single peak and was concentrated in 3,500 MWCO centrifugal unit (Amicon). The purity of FluoresceinUBB+1 was determined with non-reducing SDS-PAGE and labeling efficiency according to (22).

2.3 Gel based deubiquitnation and proteasome assays

All DUBs used were obtained recombinantly: USP2, USP5, OTUB1, OTUD3, and AMSH following existing methodology (23–25). Purified human 26S proteasome (Cat#E-365) was purchased from Boston Biochem and stored −80°C. For proteasome assays 4 µg of proteasome was mixed with 20 µg of the respective polyUb conjugate in proteasome buffer (10%(w/v) glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 25 mM TRIS pH 7.4) and incubated at 30°C. Time point samples were taken, mixed with 4× PLD and boiled at 95°C for 5 minutes. Immunoblots were performed as in 2.1.

2.4 Patients and Ethics

AD patients were selected from among those undergoing treatment in the Department of Adult Psychiatry Medical University of Lodz. Following assessment of the research plan, The Local Ethics Committee (Consent of Research Review Board at the Medical University of Lodz, Poland) granted approval for this study (No. RRN/227/11/KE). All patients voluntarily gave their informed consent in writing prior to enrollment in this study, which has approval for the use and characterization of patient samples. Venous blood samples were extracted from patients (n=8) clinically diagnosed with AD, as well as a healthy control group (n=8). AD patients were selected for the study based on the criteria described in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV). The control and AD patients were selected by age and sex. Cognitively healthy patients 2 men and 6 women: mean age 56±7.75, MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) in reference range (&gt;27) and AD patients 2 men and 6 women: mean age 58.13±8.81, MMSE 21±7.87 (see Supplementary Table 1).

2.5 Preparation and processing of blood samples

4 mL venous blood samples were drawn into K3-EDTA tubes using the S-monovette blood collection system (Sarstedt). Freshly collected samples were subjected to the cell lysis process: 600 µL of whole blood from each sample was combined with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche) and lysed using a TissueRuptor (QIAGEN) at max speed for 30 sec. The cellular debris were cleared by spinning at top speed in a refrigerated Eppendorf centrifuge for 15 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was diluted 20 times (5 µL of blood + 95 µL of PBS pH 7.4 buffer) and 13.4 µL of 100% TCA was added to each sample. Samples were vortexed, incubated on ice for 30 min, and spun down at top speed for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded and the protein pellet was resuspended in 500 µL of ice-cold acetone. In the final step samples were spun down at 4°C for 15 min at top speed, the acetone supernatant was discarded and the protein pellet was resuspended in 75µL of 2×PLD. 10 µL of each sample was run out on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE (GeneScript). The gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane (Thermo Scientific) using an eblot Protein transfer system (Genscript). To assess loading, each membrane was stained with Ponceau S (Sigma). UBB+1 was detected with a 1:1,000 dilution of monoclonal mouse anti-Ubiquitin +1 antibody [40B3] (Abcam: ab24259). Membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse AffiniPure HRP-IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, 115-035-003) in a 1:50,000 dilution. Membranes were washed with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate solution (Thermo Scientific) for 5 minutes and the membrane was placed in a film cassette with film (Kodak). Following a 60 second exposure, the film was developed, fixed and digitized.

2.6 GST-ubiquitin binding domain pulldown assay

300 µg of GST-Rpn10UIM and GST-UBQLN1UBA were immobilized on 50 µL of glutathione-agarose beads (GE-Healthcare) in PBS, pH 7.4 buffer at room temperature for 30 min, followed by three washes with PBS buffer. Next, 800 µL of a 12.5 µM solution of each Ub species (K6-, K48-, or K63-linked, as well as monomeric) was added to each 1 mL column separately and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature with constant rotation. Columns were washed with PBS buffer and bound proteins were eluted in 50 mM TRIS, 10 mM reduced glutathione, pH 7.4. Elution fractions were collected and mixed with PLD and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (see section 2.1).

2.7 Solution NMR measurements

All NMR experiments were performed at 298K on Bruker Avance III 600 MHz equipped with a cryoprobe. Protein samples were exchanged into NMR buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 5% D2O (v/v/), 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, pH 6.8). 1H,15N -SOFAST-HMQC spectra were acquired with 128 points in the indirect (15N) dimension and processed in TopSpin v3.1 (Bruker). Chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) were quantified as follows: (1) CSP=[(δHA−δHB)2+((δNA−δNB)/5)2]1/2,

where δH and δN are the 1H and 15N chemical shifts, respectively, for a given residue in proteins A and B.

2.8 Modeling protocol for Ub–UBB+1

Structural models of dimeric Ub–UBB+1 were carried out on the HADDOCK v2.1 webserver (26). The Ub–Ub linkages were created with unambiguous restraints as previously described (27). PDB:1D3Z and PDB:2KX0 were used as source coordinates for wild-type Ub and UBB+1, respectively. An ambiguous restraint (AIR) was used to simulate the tail of UBB+1 contacting the hydrophobic patch in the distal Ub, such that L8, I44, and V70 in one Ub were allowed to freely interact with the fully flexible fragment G75-Q95 in UBB+1. All docking was performed under identical conditions starting with 3,000 rigid-body structures from which 300 were taken for solvent refinement in water. The coefficient for (EDist) was set to 0.02 in the rigid body docking step, 0.2 during semi-flexible simulated annealing, and 0.5 for solvent refinement to ensure the isopeptide linkage was maintained. The AIR restraint for G75-Q95 was omitted for simulations in which the tail of UBB+1 was not intended to contact the distal Ub.

3. Results and discussion

3.1 Enzymatic assembly and purification of ubiquitinated UBB+1

Widespread reports on polyubiquitinated forms of UBB+1 in living cells encouraged us to focus our investigation on precise E1/E2 pairs capable of ubiquitinating UBB+1. Utilizing established methodology, we carried out enzymatic reactions to form K6, K11, K48 and K63 linkages, for details see supplementary methods (Fig S1). As visible from the lack of mono-Ub at the endpoint and distribution of polyUb chains, UbWT was efficiently conjugated into higher molecular weight forms for all linkage types (Fig 1A). Gel analysis shows a distinct difference in migration between monomeric forms of UBB+1 and UbWT, which allowed us to differentiate between the two monomers (Fig 1B). Except for the K11 reaction with UBE2S, the monomeric pool of UBB+1 was greatly reduced suggesting that it was incorporated into polyUb conjugates. The use of a N-terminal 6xHis tagged UBB+1 variant clearly demonstrated the formation of polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates across the range of ubiquitination reactions (Fig 1C). We note that the high molecular weight anti-6xHis signal at the start of each reaction is from 6xHis tagged E1 activating enzyme (28). Again with this analysis, it does not appear that UBE2S can readily form K11 conjugates on UBB+1. To directly monitor UBB+1 without the ambiguity of 6xHis in the high molecular weight region, we introduced a N-terminal cysteine and labeled with a fluorophore (5MF). Proving the existence of high molecular weight polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates, new fluorescent signals appeared in the region at reaction endpoints, as well as a distribution of lower molecular weight polymers (Fig 1D). The fluorescent labeling approach is unambiguous, however detection with anti-His is more sensitive which explains the improved detection of intermediate conjugates. Collectively these results demonstrate that conventional in vitro ubiquitiation methods can direct formation of polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates. Taken with previous reports on E2-25K(UBE2K) (11) and that UBB+1 induced accumulation of polyUb conjugates (15), it is likely several E2/E3 enzymes are capable of ubiquitinating UBB+1 at multiple lysines.

Using this efficient enzymatic approach for synthesis of polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates, we scaled up the reactions to obtain large (mg) quantities. With a straightforward purification scheme, we isolated pure forms of K6, K48, and K63 linked Ubn–UBB+1 chains ranging from dimer to pentamer (Fig S2&amp;S3). As an added bonus, the high molecular weight fractions contained a mixture of polyUb–UBB+1 of six Ub units or longer. Just as Ub, UBB+1 was able to accommodate N-terminal tags and point mutations. This greatly expands the capability for designing assays. Importantly, conventional linkage specific antibodies were able to detect both K48- and K63-linked forms of Ub–UBB+1 (Fig 1E&amp;F). This confirms that the linkages are indeed formed, as the epitopes are fragments from K48- or K63 linkages.

3.2 Exploring the polymeric state of UBB+1 from Alzheimer’s patient samples

The polymeric state of UBB+1 in vivo is not fully understood and appears to vary based on the concentration of UBB+1 in the cell (6, 29). For example, manipulating expression levels of UBB+1 in transfected HeLa cells allows for UBB+1 conjugates to form, mainly linked through K29 and K48 (8). When levels of UBB+1 are relatively low, the proteasome is competent to degrade UBB+1, however at higher levels the proteasomal machinery is inhibited (29). To gain a clearer picture of how UBB+1 conjugates are presented in AD we optimized an immunoblot procedure for patient blood samples (Fig S4). Although it is well documented that UBB+1 accumulates in neuronal tau plaques of patients, there does appear to be a detectable amount of UBB+1 in the circulating blood of both healthy and AD patients (Fig 2A&amp;B). Interestingly the overall pattern of UBB+1 does not change significantly between healthy and AD patient samples and in many cases the expected molecular weight of polyUb–UBB+1 from patient samples does not match that of the control conjugate (Fig 2A&amp;B, right lane). The highly flexible nature of the C-terminal extension on UBB+1 is readily accessible to proteases and we observed that treatment with protease inhibitors impacted the levels of detectable polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates (Fig S5). We caution that these results are based solely on a single monoclonal antibody, however we place greater confidence in these findings considering that the UBB+1 epitope is exceedingly rare in nature. Furthermore, there was no cross-reactivity with any wild type polyUb conjugates and polyUb–UBB+1 was recognized independent of polymer length. Originally UBB+1 was reported to be concentrated in the brain, but since then UBB+1 has been detected in other organs of the body, such as Mallory bodies in hepatic cells (30). We now demonstrate that polyubiquitinated forms of UBB+1 are readily detectable in the venous blood of both healthy and AD patients. Given that the blood brain barrier is decreased in AD (31) one would expect that UBB+1 is free to circulate, however we failed to detect clear patterns of UBB+1 levels corresponding to AD or healthy patients. Assuming that all polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates are free chains, with UBB+1 at the proximal end we are rather perplexed that polyUb–UBB+1 is presented as a distribution of polymers. This leads us to speculate that there is a broad spectrum of polyUb–UBB+1, but further investigation would be needed to determine what, if any role these conjugates play. Based on the difference in observed molecular weight of polyUb–UBB+1 between patient and in vitro control conjugates, we cannot yet rule out the possibility that polyUb–UBB+1 carries addition posttranslational modifications under physiological conditions.

3.3 Screening of UBB+1 conjugates with deubiquitinases

As a first test to characterize polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates, linkage selective DUBs were evaluated against their respective dimeric Ub–UBB+1 linkage. OTUD3 disassembled the K6 linkage of both wild type and Ub-UBB+1 dimers equally well (Fig 3A). K48 linked dimers were also processed nearly the same by OTUB1 (Fig 3B). Surprisingly AMSH cleaved the K63-linked Ub–UBB+1 dimer much slower in respect to wild-type (Fig 3C). Clearly K63-linked Ub–UBB+1 conjugates can be cleaved by DUBs, but it is unclear why AMSH activity is reduced. Based on the structure of AMSH-LP in complex with K63-Ub2 it is not expected that the tail of UBB+1 would have any impact on binding or catalysis (32). As linkage specific OTU family DUBs, OTUD3 and OTUB1 are “endo” DUBs, which cleave Ub-Ub bonds within the chain, making it unlikely that a C-terminal extension could have a significant impact their activity(23, 33). USP2 a highly active DUB that indiscriminately cleaves polyUb chains from the distal end (24) made short work of both K48- and K63-linked Ub–UBB+1 conjugates (Fig 3D&amp;E). In a predicable fashion, USP5(IsoT), a DUB which cleaves from the proximal end and requires a free G76 in Ub (25) was blocked from cleaving Ub–UBB+1 chains (Fig 3F&amp;G). Collectively this data set demonstrates that the C-terminal extension of UBB+1 generally will not impact the activity of “endo” DUBs or DUBs that cleave from the distal end, however, with the example of AMSH each case would need to be assessed individually.

We then set to determine how human proteasome would disassemble polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates. Given that Ub dimers are poor proteasomal substrates (34), we used longer forms of polyUb–UBB+1 (n&gt;4). In general, the proteasome did not discriminate between polyUb and polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates. K6-linked conjugates are processed slowly by the proteasome and virtually no monomeric Ub product was detected within 6 hours (Fig 3H). This could be explained by the “closed” conformation of K6-linked polyUb (35), limiting access of certain DUBs. It is well established that K48-linkages are slowly processed by the proteasome (34), and this was the case for both UbWT and UBB+1 conjugates (Fig 3I). On the other hand, K63-linkages are rapidly disassembled by proteasome and we observed this for both polyUb and polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates (Fig 3J). Interestingly, we did not observe a band corresponding to monomeric UBB+1 for any linkage type with proteasome. This leads us to believe that the proteasome is either truncating the C-terminal extension of UBB+1 (15) or degrading it (29). Regardless, it is notable that free UBB+1 is not detectable and it is highly probable that polyUb–UBB+1 is favored for proteasomal degradation (29). Overall, the incorporation of UBB+1 does not seem to alter the activity of proteasomal DUBs. We note that several of the DUBs tested, including the proteasome have been reported to be inhibited by UBB+1. However, our system is a fundamentally different experimental condition, in which the concentration of UBB+1 is never in excess of UbWT, especially for longer conjugates. If inhibition were accomplished through competitive binding interactions, this would explain why we never observed broad scale inhibition of DUBs in this study.

3.4 Binding properties of UBB+1 conjugates

Our investigation with DUBs demonstrated that it was difficult to predict how Ub–UBB+1 conjugates would be recognized, which led us to investigate if proteasomal shuttling factors and polyUb receptors could bind polyUb–UBB+1conjugates. The UBA domain of the UBQLN1 proteasome shuttle was able to bind all forms of Ub tested: K6-, K48-, K63-linked dimeric Ub-UBB+1 conjugates, as well as monomeric (Fig 4A). This result suggests that Ub–UBB+1 can be shuttled to the proteasome by canonical UBL/UBA proteins. Notably, recognition of UBB+1 by anti-Ub was not impaired (Fig 4A, bottom panel). Combined with the observation from the linkage specific antibodies (Fig 1E&amp;F), it appears that immunodetection of Ub–UBB+1 is ambiguous given that the epitope (isopeptide linkage) is never altered. Additionally, the UIM domain of Rpn10, one the primary polyUb receptors at the proteasome was also capable of binding the whole panel of Ub-UBB+1 conjugates (Fig 4B). As demonstrated by the loading controls (Fig S6), Ub–UBB+1 does not form any unexpected interactions with GSH agarose. The enhanced signal from mono-UBB+1 compared to UbWT could be explained by the higher binding affinity of UBB+1 for certain domains (11). Taken together, these results suggest a wide range of polyUb-UBB+1 linkage types can reach the proteasome. This could in part explain how UBB+1 disappeared over the course of our proteasome assays (Fig 3H–J). Furthermore, since recognition of UPS machinery is not impaired by UBB+1 it is also likely that polyUb-UBB+1 can enter other non-degradative Ub signaling pathways. The structural arrangement of UbWT in respect to the binding domain does not appear to deviate in the case of UBB+1 (Fig S7). Clearly it is well supported that the tail of UBB+1 has high entropy and conformational freedom (Fig 4C). Coupled with a known structure of UBB+1 in complex with the UBA domain of E2-25K it is implied the flexibility the UBB+1 tail is reduced upon binding (Fig 4D). Yet thus far we are uncertain as to how the tail of UBB+1 impacts binding and how it is positioned in the bound state.

3.5 Solution NMR investigation of UBB+1 conjugates

To complement our experiments with DUBs and Ub-binding domains, we set to examine the structural and conformational features of polyUb–UBB+1 using proven solution NMR methods for observing dynamic polyUb chains (36). With essentially nothing known about the structural properties of UBB+1 conjugates we began with dimeric Ub–UBB+1 systems. K48- and K63-linked UBB+1 conjugates were 15N-labeled on the distal Ub resulting in Ub(15N)–48UBB+1 and Ub(15N)–63UBB+1. For the K48 conjugate, it is evident that the classical “closed” conformation (36) is maintained in UBB+1, as the CSPs in the distal Ub of Ub(15N)–48UBB+1 versus monoUb are nearly identical to those of wild-type K48-Ub2 (Fig 5A&amp;B and S8). Based on these CSPs we predicted a structural model of Ub(15N)–48UBB+1 (Fig S9A). When in the closed conformation, there is clearly no steric hindrance from the tail in UBB+1, which can be positioned well away from the interface. On the other hand, when we artificially bias the tail of UBB+1 (in silico) by forcing it to interact with the hydrophobic patch of the distal Ub, it appears that the tail can extend into the interface and possibly disrupt the closed conformation (Fig S9B). However, it is not clear under which conditions this could occur. CSPs observed in Ub(15N)–63UBB+1 (Fig 5C and S10) also closely resemble those in wild-type K63-Ub2 (Fig 5D and S11) and support the classical extended conformation (37) lacking non-covalent interdomain contacts for both constructs. Even though it is theoretically possible for the tail of UBB+1 to contact the distal Ub, this would be accompanied by a global conformational change in the K63-linked dimer to a more compact form (Fig S12). We cannot rule out that other minor conformations are sampled by the K63 linkage (37–40), however a direct comparison of the 15N longitudinal relaxation time values (15N-T1) measured in the distal Ubs in Ub(15N)–48UBB+1 and Ub(15N)–63UBB+1 yields the same pattern as the corresponding wild type Ub dimers (Fig S13). Therefore, 15N-T1 relaxation and CSPs data clearly demonstrate that K48- and K63-linked forms of UBB+1 are structurally similar to their wild-type forms, but not completely identical. Based on other NMR derived structures of UBB+1 (Fig 5E) it is clear that the tail region is highly flexible and samples many positions around the UBB+1 molecule (11). Interestingly, certain conformations of the tail are not possible when a distal Ub is added. Therefore, ubiquitination of UBB+1 likely affects the conformational freedom of the tail depending on which linkage is formed, just as binding of receptors does. For example, the tight hydrophobic interdomain contacts characteristic for K6 and K48 linkages would likely be more restrictive on the conformations of the UBB+1 tail than K63 linkages. While our data demonstrate that the tail does not significantly impact the structures of K48- and K63-linked Ub-UBB+1 we cannot rule out that other linkage types could be affected by the tail (e.g. K11, Fig 5E).

4. Conclusions

The UBB+1 mutant is an actor in neurodegenerative diseases and in all organisms tested, a significant portion of UBB+1 is present in ubiquitinated forms. By characterizing the reactivity of UBB+1 with E2 enzymes, we present a method to generate large quantities of polyUb–UBB+1 for in vitro studies. Although in large concentrations, monomeric UBB+1 can inhibit DUBs, we demonstrate that in most cases polyUb–UBB+1 can be processed by a range of DUBs, including the proteasome. Furthermore, K6-, K48-, and K63-linked polyUb–UBB+1 conjugates retain a native like binding ability for proteasomal polyUb receptors. Consistent with these observations, solution NMR confirmed that K48 and K63-linked dimeric UBB+1 do not differ structurally from their wild-type forms. Collectively these experiments establish that incorporation of UBB+1 into polyUb has a minimal impact on downstream signaling properties. As we have shown with common Ub antibodies (K48 and K63 linkage specific and anti-Ub) recognition of UBB+1 conjugates is indistinguishable from UbWT conjugates, especially at high molecular weights. To gain a more accurate picture of UBB+1, our enzymatically synthesized UBB+1 conjugates validated a monoclonal UBB+1 antibody, which we used to detect various forms of UBB+1 from patient blood samples. The ability to detect UBB+1 from a minimally invasive procedure as opposed to a brain biopsy, may serve to better diagnose neurodegenerative diseases at an earlier stage. We note that although polyUb–UBB+1 is detectable in blood, more tests and larger sample sets would be needed to determine exactly how polyUb–UBB+1 is presented in neurodegenerative disease.

(B) UBB+1 and an excess of UbWT are reacted together and disappearance of monomeric UBB+1 indicates ubiquitination of UBB+1. (C) Reaction of UbWT and N-terminal 6xHis tagged UBB+1 is analyzed with anti-His. (D) UBB+1 fluorescently labeled with 5MF on an N-terminal cysteine is reacted with an excess of UbWT. Recognition of (E) K48- and (F) K63- linkage specific antibodies is not impaired by the presence of UBB+1. *We attribute the multiple bands of Ub–UBB+1 to the migration properties of polyUb with long flexible extensions.

Figure 2 Immunoblot analysis of control and AD patient blood samples. The anti-UBB+1 antibody efficiently recognized the control K48-linked polyUb–UBB+1 conjugate and showed no reactivity with the control K48-linked UbWT conjugate. In both health and AD blood, UBB+1 was detected primarily in polymeric forms. Even with the same UBB+1 conjugate as in (Fig 1E), the anti-UBB+1 antibody resulted in a unified band, as opposed to the multiple bands observed with antibodies with epitopes on the Ub molecule (14).

Figure 3 Screening dimeric Ub–UBB+1 conjugates with DUBs. (A) Time course of wild type Ub–6Ub (top) and Ub–6UBB+1 (bottom) incubated with OTUD3. (B) Time course of OTUB1 with Ub–48Ub (top) and Ub–48UBB+1 (bottom). (C) AMSH incubated with wild type Ub–63Ub (top) and Ub–63UBB+1 (bottom). USP2 was incubated with dimeric (D) K48- and (E) K63-linked conjugates. In similar fashion USP5 was incubated with dimeric (F) K48- and (G) K63-linked conjugates. Time course of 26S proteasome with control and UBB+1 conjugates: (H) wild type Ubn–6Ub (left panel) and Ubn–6UBB+1 (right panel), (I) wild type Ubn–48Ub (left panel) and Ubn–48UBB+1 (right panel) and (J) wild type Ubn–63Ub (left panel) and Ubn–63UBB+1 (right panel). All proteasome assays were analyzed with antiUb.

Figure 4 A panel of Ub–UBB+1 conjugates and UbWT controls were subjected to GST pull-down with a known Ub receptors. (A) GST-UBQLN1UBA and (B) GST-Rpn10UIM show interactions with all conjugates. Elutions were visualized with Coomassie (top) and anti-Ub (bottom). (C) All 20 states from NMR derived structure of UBB+1 (PDB: 2KX0) are aligned by residues 2–75 (green) and the tail (red) exhibits a high degree of conformational freedom. (D) UBB+1 in complex with the UBA domain of E2-25K (blue, PDB:3K9O) is aligned to several NMR states. The tail of UBB+1 is sterically restricted from conformations overlapping where the UBA domain binds.

Figure 5 Structural conformations of Ub–UBB+1 explored by solution NMR. Residue specific CSPs from distal domains in K48 linked dimers versus monoUb: (A) Ub(15N)–48Ub and (B) Ub(15N)–48UBB+1. Increased CSPs around Ub’s hydrophobic patch (L8,I44,V70) indicate the formation of the interdomain interface. Residue specific CSPs for K63 linked dimers versus monoUb: (C) Ub(15N)–63Ub and (D) Ub(15N)–63UBB+1. (E) 20 states of UBB+1 (PDB:2KX0) K6,K11,K48, and K63 (magenta sticks) and L8,I44,V70 (yellow sticks) suggest the tail (red) can limit access to key residues.
