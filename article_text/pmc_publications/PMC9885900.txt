Objective:

Endothelial cell (EC) coupling occurs through gap junctions and underlies cerebral blood flow regulation governed by inward-rectifying (KIR) channels. This study addressed effects of KIR channel activity on EC coupling before and during Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Methods:

Intact EC tubes (width: ~90–100 μm; length: ~0.5 mm) were freshly isolated from posterior cerebral arteries of young Pre-AD (1–3 months) and aged AD (13–18 months) male and female 3xTg-AD mice. Dual intracellular microelectrodes applied simultaneous current injections (±0.5–3 nA) and membrane potential (Vm) recordings in ECs at distance ~400 μm. Elevated extracellular potassium ([K+]E; 8–15 mmol L−1; reference, 5 mmol L−1) activated KIR channels.

Results:

Conducted Vm (ΔVm) responses ranged from ~−30 to 30 mV in response to −3 to +3 nA (linear regression, R2≥0.99) while lacking rectification for charge polarity or axial direction of spread. Conduction slope decreased ~10–20% during 15 mmol L−1 [K+]E in Pre-AD males and AD females. 15 mmol L−1 [K+]E decreased conduction at lower thresholds in AD animals (~±20 mV) versus Pre-AD (~±25 mV). AD increased (~10–15%) conducted hyperpolarization during 8–12 mmol L−1 [K+]E.

Conclusions:

Brain endothelial KIR channel activity modulates bidirectional spread of vasoreactive signals with enhanced regulation of EC coupling during AD pathology.


pmcIntroduction

Cerebrovascular networks control delivery of oxygen and nutrients throughout the brain using coordination of local and conducted signals for vasodilation and vasoconstriction in accord with neuronal metabolic demand [12,26]. This general process, known as neurovascular coupling, is conveyed via the endothelial cell (EC) layer as a retrograde spread of hyperpolarization from capillaries to dilate arterioles and pial arteries [11,34]. Further, as an intercellular conduction of electrical charge through gap junctions that is insulated by cellular membranes [6], such spread of vasoreactivity is independent of the direction of the blood flow while subservient to parenchymal activation [10]. Relative to the site of the initiation, electrical signals can conduct in a bidirectional manner along the endothelium but whether they are in equal in strength along axial retrograde and anterograde routes remains unknown.

The EC layer of resistance arteries conforms to passive cable properties, whereby highly expressed K+ channels (e.g., KCa2.3, KCa3.1, KIR2.1) and connexins (e.g., Cx37, Cx40) that compose gap junctions govern membrane (Rm) and axial resistance (Ra) respectively [4,6]. In such manner, the strength of electrical conduction can be finely tuned via modifying Rm using activators and blockers of K+ channel activity [4], whereas the function of gap junctions and the corresponding Ra is “all or nothing” [8]. Prior studies demonstrate that progressive opening of endothelial Ca2+-activated small- and –intermediate conductance K+ (SKCa/IKCa) channels of skeletal muscle arteries robustly hyperpolarizes membrane potential (Vm) up to the Nernst potential for K+ (~−90 mV) while effectively eliminating electrical conduction in tandem [4]. This observation was dependent on the opening of SKCa/IKCa channels and not due to potential effects of Vm hyperpolarization itself or an impairment in gap junction patency [4]. As an integral component for blood flow regulation throughout the brain [35], the potential for vascular inward-rectifying (KIR2) channel activity to regulate electrical conduction along cerebrovascular endothelium has not been explored.

Using a dual intracellular electrode method in endothelial tubes of mouse posterior cerebral arteries [21], the current study addressed (1) bidirectional efficacy and (2) potential KIR2 channel regulation of electrical conduction. Further, in light of recent data for the impact of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) on overall vascular health [17,33], and specifically on endothelial KIR2 channels [20,31,39,50], our study model of choice entailed young Pre-AD (1–3 months) and aged AD (13–18 months) 3xTg-AD animals [19,40]. With a normal reference of 5 mmol L−1 for extracellular potassium ([K+]E) [11,25,29] elevated [K+]E as 8 to 15 mmol L−1 activated KIR2 channels [37]. Regardless of experimental conditions and pathology group, rectification was virtually absent with respect to both charge polarity (hyperpolarization and depolarization, ΔVm~−30 to 30 mV at ~400 μm distance) and axial spread. In young Pre-AD animals, elevated [K+]E decreased conduction only at the extreme conducted ΔVm changes as ≥±25 mV. Conduction in AD animals was most sensitive to elevated [K+]E with a consistent decline at 15 versus 5 mmol L−1 [K+]E for conducted ΔVm~±20 mV and evidence of enhanced conduction of hyperpolarization within the 8 to 12 mmol L−1 [K+]E range. A decline in electrical conduction (regardless of charge polarity) was most notable in young Pre-AD males and AD females during 15 versus 5 mmol L−1 [K+]E. Block of potentially open KIR2 channels with 10 to 100 μmol L−1 BaCl2 during resting conditions (5 mmol L−1 [K+]E) did not alter overall efficacy of electrical conduction. Altogether, these data support the potential for equal efficacy for both retrograde and anterograde signaling of endothelium-dependent cerebral blood flow control. Further, an elevated concentration of extracellular K+ ions as a surrogate for neuronal or astrocyte activity not only initiates vasoreactive signals [34] but also “auto-regulates” their conduction along the pre-capillary endothelium. Finally, conditions of AD pathology may either decrease or increase the spatial domain of hyperpolarization and vasodilation underlying hyperemic blood flow increases depending on the conditions for vasoreactive stimuli and open K+ channels.

Methods

Animal care and use

All animal housing, care, use, and experimental protocols for this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Loma Linda University and performed in accord with the National Research Council’s “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (8th Edition, 2011). The 3xTg-AD mice mouse model [19,40] generated from homozygous breeding pairs obtained from the Jackson Laboratories [Wilmington, MA, USA; (B6;129-Tg(APPSwe,tauP301L)1Lfa Psen1tm1Mpm/Mmjax); Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center (MMRRC) stock #034830] was used for all experiments (1 to 18 months, 41 males and 38 females). All animals were housed on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle at 22–24°C with fresh water and food available ad libitum. For individual experiments, animals were selected randomly with respect to age/pathology group and biological sex.

Solutions and reagents

The preparation and composition of solutions for dissection, isolation of endothelial tubes from posterior cerebral arteries, and experimental Vm have been previously described and illustrated [18]. In brief, physiological salt solution (PSS; pH 7.4, 295–300 mOsm) contained (in mmol L−1) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 Glucose. For dissection of the brain and arteries, PSS lacked CaCl2 while containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. For isolation of intact endothelium, PSS with reduced Ca2+ (0.1 mmol L−1 CaCl2) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin contained papain (0.31 mg mL−1; P4762, Sigma), dithioerythritol (0.5 mg mL−1; D8255, Sigma), collagenase (0.75 mg mL−1; C8051, Sigma), and elastase (0.13 mg mL−1; E7885, Sigma). Elevated K+ PSS was prepared as 8, 10, 12, or 15 mmol L−1 KCl with a matching equimolar decrease of NaCl in accord with maintained osmolarity. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) or ThermoFisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) unless otherwise indicated.

Arterial dissection and isolation of endothelial tubes from the mouse brain

Isolation of mouse posterior cerebral arteries and respective endothelial tubes has been previously described and illustrated [18]. In brief, the brain was removed and placed in chilled (4°C) dissection PSS (lacking CaCl2) following isoflurane inhalation for anesthesia and decapitation. Posterior cerebral arteries were then removed from the brain and divided into segments that were partially digested in dissociation PSS (with low CaCl2 and enzyme cocktail) at 34°C for 10 to 12 min. Following digestion, arterial segments were triturated using borosilicate glass capillary tubes [1B100-4, World Precision Instruments (WPI), Sarasota, FL, USA] with an internal tip diameter of 80 to 120 μm to remove adventitia, smooth muscle cells, and internal elastic lamina to isolate intact endothelial tubes.

Immunohistochemistry and visualization of KIR2.1 and Connexins

Immunofluorescence was performed with modification from a prior study [7]. A CultureWell two well chambered coverslip (GRACE Bio-Labs; Bend, Oregon) was placed over a Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus Microscope slide (ThermoFisher). An intact endothelial tube was secured in one well with pinning pipettes and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes and washed (3 × 5 minutes each) in PBS. The endothelial tube was then permeabilized and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% Triton-X (Bio-Rad), and 10% Normal Goat Serum (MilliporeSigma; Burlington, Massachusetts) for 2 hour at room temperature and then washed (3 × 5 minutes) in PBS. The endothelial tube was incubated overnight at 4°C with one of the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal primary antibody for Cx37 (42-4400, ThermoFisher), Cx40 (36-4900, Invitrogen, ThermoFisher), or KIR2.1 (APC-026; Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel). The tube was washed (3 × 5 minutes) in PBS and then incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with AlexaFluor 488 (PIA32731, ThermoFisher) in blocking buffer for 2 hr in the dark. Following incubation, the tube was washed with PBS (3 × 5 minutes). Images of KIR2.1 channels and connexins were acquired using a fluorescent microscope (Eclipse Ti-S; Nikon) equipped with a 60X objective [Plan Apo k (numerical aperture: 0.95); Nikon), GFP filter set with solid state illumination (MIRA Light Engine; Lumencor, Inc., Beaverton, OR), 16-megapixel monochrome camera (DS-Qi2, Nikon), and Nikon imaging software (NIS Elements-F 4.60.00).

Intracellular current injections and recording of conducted ΔVm

The apparatus and procedure for examining electrical conduction of ΔVm along posterior cerebral artery endothelial tubes in response to focal current injection stimuli has been previously described [18,21]. In brief, microelectrodes were pulled (P-97, Sutter Instruments) from glass capillary tubes (GC100F-10, Warner Instruments, Holliston, MA, USA), backfilled with 2 mol L−1 KCl (tip resistance: ~150 MΩ), and then secured in connection with headstages (0.1× gain) corresponding to electrometers dedicated to current injection (Axoclamp 2B; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and Vm recordings (Axoclamp 900A; Molecular Devices) respectively. At a distance of ~400 μm, each microelectrode was secured in an EC at 400× magnification. Current (±0.5–3 nA, ~6 sec pulses) was injected using the Axoclamp 2B system in combination with a function generator (FG-8002; EZ Digital, Seoul, South Korea) while ΔVm was recorded using the digitally operated Axoclamp 900A amplifier. Both amplifier outputs were integrated into a data acquisition system (Digidata 1550A; Molecular Devices), whereby all data were acquired at a 10 Hz frequency on a Hewlett-Packard personal computer using Axoscope software (Molecular Devices). Data were collected before and during progressive concentrations of KCl for elevated extracellular potassium ([K+]E) from 8 to 15 mmol L−1 (reference, 5 mmol L−1) or BaCl2 (10–100 μmol L−1) to activate and block KIR2 channels respectively [37,44]. An incubation time of ~3 min was allowed for each concentration of elevated [K+]E or BaCl2 before applying an additional round of current injections. For bidirectional conduction experiments, one round of current injections and corresponding Vm recordings were applied before and after a switch of respective electrodes while maintaining the same position for the endothelial tube and distance between electrodes. A ~5 min washout period was applied using PSS containing 5 mM [K+]E between each treatment application. Endothelial tubes were continuously superfused with PSS at 37°C during all experiments.

Data and statistical analysis

For individual electrical conduction experiments, the difference in peak and resting Vm in an EC at a distance of ~400 μm during current injection pulses (−3 to +3 nA) comprised conducted ΔVm measurements. The slope of electrical conduction (current injected vs. conducted ΔVm) data was determined using linear regression (R2≥0.99). For experiments that examined conducted ΔVm as a function of current pulse and progressive concentrations of [K+]E or BaCl2 per study group, a two-way repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc was applied. Comparisons of conducted ΔVm across biological sex and/or conditions of Pre-AD versus AD were analyzed using a mixed two-way ANOVA (repeated measures within groups alongside unpaired comparisons across groups) with Sidak post hoc. Select individual comparisons across Pre-AD and AD groups were examined using a two-tailed unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test in accord with parametric or non-parametric data sets respectively.

All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Differences within and/or across study groups were accepted as statistically significant with p &lt; 0.05. All summary data are presented as the mean±SEM. Note that the absence of statistically significant differences does not necessarily exclude the physiological or pathological importance of comparisons within and across study groups that indicate p &gt; 0.05.

Results

Outstanding questions remain for rapid, effective electrical signaling to govern cerebral blood flow and perfusion of the brain during health and disease. In accord with its inherent gene expression profile, anatomical structure, and integrative physiology, the EC layer serves as an electrical conduit along the vascular wall to marshal the mechanical activity of smooth muscle cells for the dilation or constriction of vascular resistance networks [1,2]. Thus, the goal of the current study was to ascertain bidirectional efficacy and potential KIR2 channel regulation of electrical spread along the posterior cerebral endothelium (Figure 1A). In turn, we examined a mouse model that develops conditions of AD starting at 6 mo of age [40] and profound (~50%) reductions in neurovascular coupling for cerebral blood flow by 12 mo [36].

The strength of electrical conduction is a product of concomitant gap junction and ion channel activities that govern transmembrane and cell-to-cell axial fluxes respectively [6]. Connexins that compose gap junctions and KIR2.1 channels are indeed expressed in the plasma membrane of mouse cerebrovascular ECs ([41,56]; Figure 2). Note that gap junction activity is relatively constant in ECs [8], whereas K+ channels in particular fine tune the spread of electrical signals as hyperpolarization and depolarization [4] that directly underlie vasodilation (i.e., decreased resistance to blood flow) and vasoconstriction (i.e., increased resistance to blood flow) respectively [54]. Thus, we focused on KIR2 channels as potential modulators of conducted hyperpolarization and depolarization along electrically-coupled cerebrovascular ECs.

Equal spread of electrical conduction along cerebrovascular endothelium regardless of charge polarity and axial direction

The most straightforward working paradigm for vascular conduction has been in the form of the spread of vasodilation from capillaries (or pre-capillary arteriolar terminals) to arteries in response to parenchymal activity [47,48]. In such manner, a recent demonstration of retrograde signaling in the brain has now clarified a key role for endothelial KIR2.1 channels for initiating this process to convey blood flow to activated cortical neurons in vivo [34]. In addition, other ex vivo (pressure myography) examinations have assessed cerebrovascular conduction using focal KCl-induced depolarization of middle cerebral arteries isolated from rodents [44,56] and humans [42] with resulting conducted vasoconstriction responses. In the current study, we found that the relative efficacy of conduction was similar for both hyperpolarization and depolarization (Figure 1B), thereby yielding a linear relationship (R2≥0.99) between the magnitude of intracellular current injected and the ΔVm response at a distance of ~400 μm (~12 EC lengths) away (Figure 1C). This finding is consistent with previous studies for skeletal muscle endothelium, that notably manifest robust function for SKCa/IKCa channels but not KIR2 channels [21]. Altogether, these data support the cerebrovascular endothelial layer as an electrical conduit that transmits vasodilator and vasoconstrictor signals equally.

Bidirectional axial signaling among ECs was originally observed in the skeletal muscle microcirculation of frogs [51] and rodents [46] in the 1990s. However, there has been a lack of evidence supporting an enhanced, reduced, or altogether absent spread of electrical conduction along coupled ECs in accord with axial direction. Here, we demonstrate experimental agreement with this notion when measuring the slope of electrical conduction before (9.2±0.8 mV/nA) and after (9.2±0.7 mV/nA) switching the current injection and Vm recording electrodes while maintaining the same distance between respective ECs as ~400 μm (Figure 3A). This general finding remains the same during conditions of AD as well (Before: 8.1±1.0 mV/nA; After: 7.8±0.8 mV/nA) (Figure 3B), whereby slope of conduction is not significantly different (p&gt;0.05) relative to Pre-AD animals. Thus, endothelial electrical signals of the brain spread in both axial directions equally and do not conform to a unidirectional, retrograde distribution pattern only.

Impact of progressive KIR2 channel activation on electrical conduction along cerebrovascular endothelium: enhanced regulation during AD

We have previously found that SKCa/IKCa channels can regulate electrical conduction along skeletal muscle endothelium during young, healthy conditions and aging [7]. Up to a physiological concentration of elevated [K+]E known to initiate vasodilation for increased blood flow (15 mmol L−1 [37]), we sought to address whether KIR2 channels play a similar role for autoregulation of electrical spread along cerebrovascular endothelium before and during conditions of AD. Electrical conduction was only impacted at the highest current injections (±3 nA; ΔVm:~±25 mV at 5 mmol L−1 [K+]E) in Pre-AD animals when shifting to elevated [K+]E (Figure 4A). In AD animals, significant modulation of electrical conduction became apparent as low as ΔVm~−12 mV (−1 nA; 5 mmol L−1 [K+]E) (Figure 4B). Further, elevating [K+]E within the 8–12 mmol L−1 range in AD animals increased conducted hyperpolarization to −2 nA (ΔVm, ~−22 mV vs. ~−19 mV at 5 mmol L−1 [K+]E) (Figure 4B). Overall, the slope of electrical conduction was decreased at 15 mmol L−1 [K+]E versus 5–12 mmol L−1 [K+]E during AD (Figure 4B) and only 5 mmol L−1 [K+]E during Pre-AD (Figure 4A). Key sex-based differences among groups include a reduced slope of magnitude (15 mmol L−1 [K+]E versus 5 mmol L−1 [K+]E in Pre-AD males that was not indicated for Pre-AD females (Table 2). Also, in AD animals, significant autoregulation of elevated [K+]E was only apparent during conducted hyperpolarization in males with no significant change in overall slope of conduction (Table 2). In contrast for AD females, autoregulation of elevated [K+]E was apparent during both hyperpolarization and depolarization with a significant decrease in slope of conduction at 15 mmol L−1 [K+]E (Table 2). Finally, block of any potentially open KIR2 channels with 10 to 100 μmol L−1 BaCl2 during 5 mmol L−1 [K+]E did not alter the slope of conduction in either Pre-AD or AD animals, whereby the slope of electrical conduction was ~10 mV/nA throughout (Figure 4 &amp; Figure 5; Table 2 &amp; Table 3). Altogether, endothelial KIR2 channels modulate spread of electrical charge in the presence of physiological elevations of [K+]E in the brain (e.g., during functional hyperemia). In such manner, this “auto-regulation” of conducted electrical signals by KIR2 channels is most pronounced in cerebrovascular endothelium of aged AD animals.

To assist with interpretation of individual graphs, summaries of numerical values have been included for effects of elevated [K+]E or BaCl2 on resting Vm (Table 1) and the impact of elevated [K+]E (Table 2) and BaCl2 (Table 3) on electrical conduction throughout Pre-AD and AD groups.

Discussion

Resistance artery endothelium is an intermediary organ that courses all throughout the body to help perfuse all other organs [1]. ECs are arranged longitudinally along the vascular wall while well-coupled through gap junctions to form an electrically conductive pathway to control tone and vasoreactivity over millimeter distances [45]. More recently, we have also found that the endothelial spread of electrical charge follows passive cable properties, whereby membrane resistance governed by K+ channel activity can be modulated using pharmacology to fine tune electrical conduction [4,6]. Endothelial KIR2 channels play a key role in blood flow regulation to and throughout the brain [35], whereby their activation initiates retrograde hyperpolarization and vasodilation in accord with neuronal metabolic demand [34]. In the current study, we sought to resolve a potential role of endothelial KIR2 channels for governing the spread of electrical conduction along isolated (but intact) cerebrovascular endothelium. We examined KIR2 channel activation using physiologically relevant increases in [K+]E for vasodilation (up to 15 mmol L−1) [27]. Further, as compromised regulation of endothelial KIR2 channels occurs in the brain during AD [20,31,39,50], we pursued this work in aging 3xTg-AD mice. As consistent with previous findings [4,21], we found that electrical conduction remains equally efficacious regardless of charge polarity (for hyperpolarization or depolarization) and axial direction. This general observation did not change across conditions of AD versus Pre-AD. Activation of KIR2 channels using 15 mmol L−1 [K+]E only had an impact for conducted ΔVm changes at ~25 mV or greater for hyperpolarization and depolarization young 3xTg-AD mice. In aged 3xTg-AD mice that manifest conditions of AD [40] and impaired cerebral blood flow [36], modulation of electrical conduction during activation of KIR2 channels was significantly more complex with enhanced decreases in hyperpolarization and depolarization at 15 mmol L−1 [K+]E (relative to ≥±20mV at 5 mmol L−1 [K+]E), and increased conducted hyperpolarization during 8 to 12 mmol L−1 [K+]E. The overall magnitude of electrical conduction (slope of linear relationship among current injection and conducted ΔVm) was reduced in both young and aged 3xTg-AD animals during 15 mmol L−1 [K+]E, supporting potential “autoregulation” of KIR2 channels for control of cerebral blood flow during functional hyperemia. Context of these findings within the broader literature and refined insights into cerebrovascular physiology are provided below.

Implications of equally efficacious spread of hyperpolarization and depolarization along cerebrovascular endothelium regardless of axial direction

A spatiotemporal distribution in changes of vascular resistance can occur independent of the direction of blood flow [10] and this has been best defined thus far in the form of retrograde signaling from capillaries to arterioles and arteries [34]. We observed equal bidirectional spread along the endothelium of pial arteries for both hyperpolarization and depolarization (Figure 3). Thus, local changes in vascular Vm initiated by neurotransmitters (e.g., norepinephrine, acetylcholine, substance P) secreted by peripheral nerve ganglia (e.g., superior cervical, sphenopalatine, trigeminal) [22] may spread in the anterograde direction from extraparenchymal arteries to also influence tone of parenchymal arterioles. Further, with capillaries identified as an electrical signaling nexus in the cerebral microcirculation [16,43], bidirectional spread among ECs can also convey signals to control venular tone [9,51] and associated post-capillary drainage of deoxygenated blood [24], clearance of toxins/metabolites [32] and leukocyte adhesion [53] as examples. Although the fundamental machinery remains the same as ion channels and gap junctions for tight regulation of EC-to-EC coupling, note that the precise gene expression makeup differs for ECs in cerebral capillaries as compared to arterioles and arteries [14]. With the neurovascular unit as a central focus, several unaddressed questions remain for electrical signaling regulation along cerebrovascular resistance networks pertaining to nerve input (central vs. peripheral), metabolic stimuli, and inflammation. In the context of the present study, potential counter regulation by pial arteries to fine-tune retrograde signals generated from capillaries to influence tone of parenchymal arterioles should be further explored.

Endothelial KIR2 channel regulation of electrical conduction: Impact of AD

Repolarization of neuronal or astrocytic excitation takes place through a massive cellular efflux of K+ ions that then come into extracellular contact with vascular KIR2 channels to control cerebral blood flow [15]. KIR2 channel activity involves a complex interplay among regulation of the channel pore and the resting Vm relative to the Nernst potential for K+ (EK) [35]. Per the KIR2 channel name, the “inward-rectifying” descriptor denotes an inward current “tail” that is readily apparent at &gt;EK as approximately &gt;−90 mV at 5 mM [K+]E or &gt;−60 mV at 15 mM [K+]E when examining a comprehensive current-voltage plot [27]. Inward currents indicate influx of K+ ions to influence a highly negatively charged resting Vm towards a relatively more depolarized EK. The presence of a net efflux of K+ ions (outward currents) and resulting hyperpolarization during elevated [K+]E as 8 to 15 mmol L−1 occurs due to a combination of an open pore and electrical drive to a more hyperpolarized EK relative to the resting Vm of the vascular wall as −30 to −45 mV. The little to no outward current observed at a resting [K+]E of 5 mmol L−1 may reflect KIR2 channel block by positively charged Mg2+ ions and polyamines that are electrostatically displaced from the channel pore when modestly elevating [K+]E up to 15 mmol L−1 where EK remains hyperpolarized relative to resting Vm [35]. As with prior studies examining electrical conduction during activation of endothelial SKCa/IKCa channels in skeletal muscle [4,7,8], we were most interested in potential current “leak” from cerebral ECs via activated KIR2 channels as associated with outward K+ currents.

As found in young, Pre-AD animals, elevation of [K+]E to 15 mmol L−1 primarily impacted the extremes of both conducted hyperpolarization and depolarization in response to ±3 nA (ΔVm, ~±30 mV; 5 mmol L−1 [K+]E) as a ≥20% reduction to ±21 to 24 mV (Figure 4A, Table 2). In the context of a Vm change that is sufficient for maximal dilation or constriction as ±10 to 20 mV [13,34,55], events of KIR2 channel opening or closing may not ordinarily have an impact on electrical conduction among ECs during healthy conditions. These findings for activated KIR2 channels are in contrast to those for SKCa/IKCa channels, whereby maximal activation can effectively obliterate electrical conduction without impacting gap junction patency [4]. This is not surprising provided the robust outward currents of open SKCa/IKCa channels throughout a functional Vm range most typical of vascular physiology (~−25 to −60 mV [5]) relative to the modest, outward current “hump” capable of being generated by KIR2 channels [27]. Although, as a note for the retrograde signaling paradigm from the neurovascular unit to arterioles/arterioles, capillary ECs are virtually devoid of SKCa/IKCa channels [34]. Thus, in contrast to KIR2 channels that regulate Vm throughout entire cerebrovascular resistance networks, current “leak” regulation via SKCa/IKCa channels will likely occur in pre-capillary segments only.

In AD animals, considerable downregulation of electrical conduction along cerebrovascular endothelium occurred during elevated K+ with conducted hyperpolarization as low as ΔVm~−10 mV to −1 nA and as high as ~−30 mV to −3 nA (Figure 4B, Table 2). Interestingly, there were select cases where conducted hyperpolarization to −2 nA (~19 mV during 5 mmol L−1 [K+]E) was enhanced during 8 to 12 mmol L−1 [K+]E by ~10–15%; an effect that was not apparent during the presence of 15 mmol L−1 [K+]E or any level of [K+]E during robust conducted hyperpolarization (−3 nA) or conducted depolarization (0.5 to 3 nA). With what information is known thus for cerebrovascular function during AD, such findings will require further investigation in the context of decreased phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) availability [39], enhanced cholesterol interaction [20], and/or redox status [31] pertaining to KIR2 channel regulation. Indeed, cholesterol may modify KIR2 channel activity [41] during conditions of AD [20]. As suggested by a computational modeling approach for capillary ECs [38], a “bi-stable switch” for enhanced versus diminished conducted hyperpolarization may emerge in accord with the level of KIR2 channel activity. It remains to be resolved as to how such biophysical phenomena effectively align with precise regulation of cerebral blood flow. As AD is becoming more prominently identified as a vascular disorder [17,33], we suggest in the context of our findings that perhaps KIR2 channel activation and significant “auto-regulation” of conducted vascular signaling may actually perturb optimal blood flow regulation among cerebrovascular resistance networks.

With some exception for trending decreases in conducted depolarization as ≥10 mV, we did not observe a substantial role for basal KIR2 channel activity during our present studies of EC-to-EC coupling (Figure 5). With considerations for focal KCl stimuli for vasoconstriction only and potential effects of epilepsy, these data are generally consistent with the observation that KIR channel block has negligible effects on arterial tone and intercellular conduction in human cerebral arteries [42]. Again, a role for the pre-capillary endothelial KCa channels may be more significant in this regard as demonstrated for health and old age/disease in skeletal muscle [3]. Although, even in the case of the more robust KCa channels, completely blocking them with apamin and charybdotoxin is modest (~30% enhancement of conduction) relative to completely opening them with a maximal concentration of NS309 (~100% reduction) [4]. This asymmetry for the effects of open versus closed ion channels on the spread of electrical signals represents the semi-permeable barrier integrity of the plasma membrane at rest while containing an enormous capacity for electrical responses to vasoactive molecules released during parenchymal activity.

Experimental Considerations

The current study contained several experimental limitations that merit discussion. The expression of KIR2 channels is dominant in both smooth muscle and endothelium of rodent [41,44] and human [42] cerebral arteries, whereas the current study only examined the endothelial layer. This obviates feedback mechanisms of voltage-gated K+ channels and large conductance K+ channels expressed in smooth muscle. Also, per approximations of computational modeling, the smooth muscle layer may diminish variances in electrical conduction among ECs, particularly with regard to any significant current leak to occur from the vascular wall [28]. However, recent findings have demonstrated that cerebrovascular brain perfusion remains stable in mice with an inducible smooth muscle-specific deletion of KIR2.1 channels [30]. Based on their findings from pressurized cerebral and skeletal muscle arteries, the authors attribute this finding to the remaining presence of other smooth muscle isoforms such as KIR2.2 that are virtually absent in cerebrovascular endothelium [30,52]. At least in an in vivo setting, we can not yet rule out the possibility that endothelial KIR2 channels are sufficient on their own for governing perfusion of the brain in the context of discrete and conducted signaling.

Next, our study used pial cerebrovascular segments as posterior cerebral arteries, whereas past conduction studies have primarily focused on capillaries and arterioles per the retrograde electrical signaling paradigm [34]. Also, there’s also a new found role for capillary ATP-regulated KIR6.1 ion channels for coupling brain metabolism to Vm hyperpolarization for retrograde vasodilation as well [23,43]. In addition, there is the possibility of potential interaction among endothelial KCa and KIR2 channels [49] that we did not account for. Indeed, unlike the current study for the relatively modest effect of opening or closing KIR2 channels, maximal opening of the KCa channels alone can eliminate the spread of all electrical signals along the endothelium layer [4]. Also, whereas we focused on elevated [K+]E levels that correspond to KIR2 channel activation for hyperpolarization, depolarizing levels of [K+]E (&gt;25 mmol L−1) may arise and trigger a vasoconstriction stimulus to control cerebral blood flow as well [15]. Finally, unlike previous studies that examined the skeletal muscle microcirculation [4,7], we did not isolate intact EC segments of sufficient length (≥1.5 mm) to ascertain length constant or potential dissipation of conducted signals per conditions of AD.

Summary and Conclusions

The cerebral microcirculation’s role for effective delivery of blood oxygen and nutrients to and throughout the brain is crucial for cognitive health during the mammalian lifespan. A single layer of electrically and chemically coupled endothelial cells in the intima of cerebral blood governs cerebrovascular resistance networks and corresponding blood flow across millimeter distances. Further, vascular physiology has emerged as a central mechanism for understanding cognitive health and the development of dementia. In addition to control of discrete signals, there is a strong premise for endothelial K+ channel regulation for conducted vascular signals as hyperpolarization (corresponds to vasodilation) and depolarization (vasoconstriction). The expression and function of endothelial KIR2 channels play an integral role for perfusion of the brain as best characterized throughout cerebral arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. In the present study, we sought to determine how KIR2 channel activity may alter electrical conduction along endothelium of posterior cerebral arteries isolated from young (1–3 mo) and aged (13–18 mo) mice that develop conditions of Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., extracellular buildup of amyloid) beginning at ~6 months of age. In brief, we found that KIR2 channel activation had the most profound influence on coordinated electrical signaling among endothelial cells of aged 3xTg-AD mice with noteworthy enhancement or impairment of conducted hyperpolarization depending on level of extracellular K+. Altogether, these findings point to a potential “auto-regulatory” role of KIR2 channel activation that may cause and/or accommodate disturbed cerebral blood flow during Alzheimer’s disease-type vascular impairment and corresponding dementia.

Figure 1. Experimental design and data analysis. (A) Dual intracellular electrodes were positioned in endothelial cell (EC) tubes of posterior cerebral arteries at a distance of ~400 μm (~12 cell lengths). Current (±0.5–3 nA), was injected into one electrode downstream of bath flow while Vm was recorded in a cell upstream. A subset of experiments switched electrodes to explore the bidirectional spread of electrical signals. Resistance of the plasma membrane (Rm) and axial EC-to-EC connections (Ra) are governed by K+ channels and gap junctions respectively [6]. With the assumption of a relatively constant resistance at gap junctions [4,8], the impact of KIR channel activity on electrical conduction was examined in male and female 3xTg-AD animals. (B) Sample measurement of conducted ΔVm responses (~−30 to +30 mV) in response to current pulses from −3 to +3 nA (~6 s pulses). Data were collected before and during progressive concentrations of KCl for elevated extracellular potassium ([K+]E) from 8 to 15 mmol L−1 (reference, 5 mmol L−1) or BaCl2 (10–100 μmol L−1) to activate and block KIR2 channels respectively. (C) Sample plot of current injected vs. conducted ΔVm data extracted from the trace in B to determine slope of electrical conduction via linear regression (R2≥0.99). The mV change from resting Vm per nA of current injected represents the strength of overall electrical conduction while equal for the spread of both hyperpolarization and depolarization corresponding to vascular dilation and constriction respectively [13].
