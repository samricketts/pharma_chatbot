Objectives:

Approximately 6.2 million Americans aged 65 or older have Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD). Unpaid family members and friends provide the bulk of caregiving for these individuals. Caregiving in rural areas adds unique challenges, particularly for ethnically/racially diverse caregivers. This study provides a profile of diverse, rural ADRD caregivers with an emphasis on multilevel factors that influence physical and mental health.

Methods:

A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 156 diverse rural ADRD caregivers.

Results:

65% of participants identified as White/Non-Hispanic (WNH; n=101) and 35% identified as ethnically/racially diverse (ERD; n=55). The majority of participants reported economic deprivation. More ERD caregivers were uninsured and had at least one chronic health condition. Higher proportions of ERD caregivers smoked cigarettes, consumed alcohol regularly, and had not seen or talked to a doctor in the previous year. There were no ethnic/racial group differences in stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, subjective health, or sleep quality.

Conclusion:

Rural caregivers, regardless of ethnicity/race, may benefit from extra supports in order to maintain optimal health. Further research is needed to disentangle the complex relationship between culture, caregiving, and health.

In the United States (U.S.), approximately 6.2 million people age 65 and older (11.3%) have Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD; Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures (ADFF), 2021). An estimated 11.2 million unpaid family members and friends provide the bulk (83%) of caregiving services for older adults and nearly half of these caregivers (48%) provide care for someone with ADRD (Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures (ADFF), 2021). ADRD family caregiving is challenging due to the progressive nature of ADRD and accompanying emotional, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms such as depression, agitation, confusion, and wandering (Cheng, 2017). Although some ADRD caregivers report positive experiences such as feelings of gratification, development of skills and a sense of purpose, greater closeness with the care recipient, and increased patience and a sense of humor (Cheng et al., 2016), many experience high rates of stress-related health problems including poor sleep quality, depression, high blood pressure, and heart disease (Cheng, 2017; Gao et al., 2019; Richardson et al., 2013; Vara-García et al., 2019).

Compared to urban areas, rural caregiving includes additional challenges such as fewer resources (Bouldin et al., 2018), greater geographic distances to formal care (McGrail et al., 2015), and greater needs for ADRD-related information and services (Bayly et al., 2020). Challenges of rural caregiving are compounded for culturally and linguistically diverse caregivers who are traditionally underserved by healthcare systems (Blewett et al., 2003), rely less on professional caregiving, experience greater delays in initial diagnosis (Lewis et al., 2021), and have more limited access to information, insurance, and healthcare services (Bayly et al., 2020; Findling et al., 2022; Jaramillo &amp; Willging, 2021).

Numbers of persons with ADRD and their family caregivers are expected to increase dramatically over the next 5–10years in rural areas (US Census Bureau, 2010; Weuve et al., 2015), particularly among ethnically/racially diverse communities such as Latinx and American Indians and Alaska Natives (Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures (ADFF), 2021; Demirovic et al., 2003; Garrett et al., 2015). Despite this trend, few studies focus on this group, including needs and risk factors for poor health. The purpose of this study is to provide a profile of this unique caregiving population, including expressed needs, based upon the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework (National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHHD), 2017) which addresses individual-, interpersonal-, and community/societal-levels of influence. The study also will explore similarities and differences by self-reported ethnicity/race, in order to identify areas in which different or additional supports may be needed. In doing so, we acknowledge that ethnicity and race are social constructs, rather than biological, which are rooted in our current health and social care systems (Breathett et al., 2021).

Methods

Design

A cross-sectional survey was administered to ADRD family caregivers within the six-county region of Northern Arizona. All activities were approved by the IRB at Northern Arizona University.

Sample

One-hundred fifty-six caregivers were recruited between January 2020 and September 2020 through community agencies, advertisements, and a regional ADRD research registry. Participants were included if they: 1) were 18years or older; 2) resided in this region; 3) did not live on tribal lands, and; 4) self-identified as providing unpaid care to a relative or friend with ADRD. Caregivers living on tribal lands were excluded due to resource and IRB constraints. This was a year-long study and it was not possible to obtain tribal IRB approvals to conduct research on tribal lands within that timeframe. Many Indigenous peoples live in the communities bordering tribal lands in this region, and they were invited to participate.

Measures

The survey was developed by the research team, in collaboration with community partners, and content validated through a modified Delphi process (Okoli &amp; Pawlowski, 2004) with an expert panel consisting of nine diverse ADRD policy makers, healthcare providers, and caregivers. See McCarthy et al. (2021) for details of the survey development process. English and Spanish versions were available.

Caregiver demographics and needs

Standard demographic items were used. Caregivers answered two questions about their ethnicity and race: ‘Do you identify as Hispanic, Latino, or of Hispanic origin? (No vs. Yes, select all that apply: Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano; Puerto Rican; Cuban; Other Hispanic, Latino, Hispanic origin)’ and; ‘Which of these groups would you say represents your race? (select all that apply: Caucasian or White; African American or Black; American Indian or Alaska Native; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; Asian; Other)’. Items related to emotional and instrumental needs were based on community input. One item about need for ‘emotional help (e.g. someone to listen to you, someone who knows what you are going through)’ and nine items about needs for instrumental help with providing care (physical, financial, legal, transportation, housing/utilities, food, respite, clothing, and recreation) were included. Items were rated from 1 (I feel like I can’t get any help at all) to 5 (I feel like I can get all the help I need) and dichotomized for analysis into 0 (less than some help) and 1 (some help or more).

Individual-level factors

Cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and exercise items were drawn from the 2018U.S. Health and Retirement Study survey which sampled older adults as well as caregivers. Service utilization was assessed with two single dichotomous items. Stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen et al., 1983). For this study, we used four PSS items deemed especially relevant by community partners, summed to range from zero to 16, with higher scores representing greater stress. The PSS is used frequently with dementia and other caregiver populations (Sheehan et al., 2021). Coefficient Omega (Hayes &amp; Coutts, 2020) for the scale in the current sample was low at ω=.54. Anxiety and depression were measured with the first two items of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-2; Spitzer et al., 2006) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2; Kroenke et al., 2003), summed to range from zero to six, with higher scores representing greater anxiety and depression. These brief measures have been validated in large samples of caregivers (Moon et al., 2020). Coefficient Omega for these scales in the current sample was acceptable at ω=.87 (GAD) and ω=.77 (PHQ). Single items to assess subjective physical and mental health during the past 30days were included (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2018). Sleep quality was measured with one 4-point Likert-scaled item from the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (Buysse et al., 1989).

Interpersonal-level factors

Care recipient Activities of Daily Living (ADL)/Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) needs were assessed with 21 items. The core 14 items were drawn from validated assessments of patient ADL/ IADL needs (Katz et al., 1963; Lawton &amp; Brody, 1969), with seven additional items (e.g. ‘Sitting, listening, and talking with them’.; ‘Communicating about their care with providers’.) suggested by community partners. Caregivers indicated all activities with which they provided help. Total activities were computed for each case and the median value was used as a cutoff to create a dichotomous variable (fewer than 10 needs [0] versus 10 or more needs [1]). Hours per day providing care was measured with one item. Caregiving burden was based on six items from the Zarit Burden Interview Short Form (ZBI-SF; Bédard et al., 2001) highlighted as important by community partners. Items were rated from 0 (never) to 4 (nearly always) and summed, with higher scores representing greater burden. Coefficient Omega for this scale in the current sample was acceptable at ω=.90. Positive aspects of caregiving were measured with the 9-item Positive Aspects of Caregiving scale (PCI; Tarlow et al., 2004), rated from 1 (disagree a lot) to 5 (agree a lot) and summed, with higher scores representing more positive experiences. This measure has been validated with ADRD caregivers and has shown acceptable reliability (citation; α=.89). Coefficient Omega for the scale in the current sample was acceptable at ω=.93.

Community/societal-level factors

Religious/spiritual/cultural affiliation was assessed with two dichotomous items. Provider cultural competence was assessed with eight items from the Cultural Competence and Service Provision Questionnaire (CCSP; Center for Mental Health Services, 2005), rated from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very) and summed, with higher scores representing greater perceived competence. Coefficient Omega for the scale was acceptable at ω=.94. The importance of provider cultural competence was assessed with four CCSP items, rated from 1 (not at all important) to 4 (extremely important) and summed. Coefficient Omega for this scale was acceptable at ω=.85. One item to assess whether participants would recommend their providers to other people of the same background was included.

Data collection

Both paper and electronic surveys were used. Paper surveys were distributed by partner agencies in our region. Electronic survey links were distributed via partner listservs and posted to ADRD Facebook pages and similar social media sites. Although community-based survey research may be vulnerable to faulty data, steps were taken in this study to reduce the risk that a single caregiver could submit multiple surveys. These steps included triangulating respondent age, gender, and level of education to identify if more than one respondent had the same characteristics and examining respondent IP addresses for duplicate electronic surveys. SPSS Statistics version 26 (IBM Corp, 2019) was used for data analysis. Data analysis Descriptive statistics were used to examine characteristics of the sample, stratified by ethnicity/race. Two mutually exclusive groups were created to explore ethnic/racial group similarities and differences within the sample: 1) Ethnically/Racially Diverse caregivers (ERD) consisting of participants who self-identified as Hispanic, Latino, or of Hispanic origin and/or who indicated African American or Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Asian, or Other among the racial groups with whom they identified, and; 2) White/Non-Hispanic caregivers (WNH) consisting of participants who did not identify as Hispanic, Latino, or of Hispanic origin, and who did not include African American or Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Asian, or Other among the racial groups with whom they identified. Chi square tests and independent samples t-tests were used to explore differences between groups on needs, individual-, interpersonal-, and community/societal-level factors. Bonferroni corrections (Tabachnick et al., 2007) were used to adjust for multiple comparisons within each level of variables. Statistical significance was interpreted according to the adjusted p-values.

Results

Approximately 65% of caregivers identified as White/NonHispanic (WNH; n=101) and 35% identified as ethnically/racially diverse (ERD; n=55) (Table 1). U.S. Census data show that the geographic region of the study consists of approximately 63% ‘white alone, not Hispanic/Latino’, 16% ‘Hispanic Latino’ and 21% ‘American Indian or Alaska Native alone’, suggesting that the sample is fairly representative of the regional population. Within the ERD group, 40 caregivers identified as Hispanic, Latino, or of Hispanic origin (23 Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano; 7 Puerto Rican; 6 Cuban; 4 Other Hispanic/Latino (e.g. Argentina, Columbian, Guatemalan, etc.). ERD caregivers indicated Caucasian or White (n=24), African American or Black (n=5), American Indian or Alaska Native (n=19), and Asian (n=2) among the categories that described their race.

The sample was generally well-educated (84% overall indicated having an Associate’s degree or higher), with significant differences in education between groups (omnibus test p=.001): A substantially higher proportion of ERD caregivers possessed a Bachelor’s degree (47% versus 26% among WNH), whereas a substantially higher proportion of WNH caregivers possessed an Associate’s (13% versus 1% among ERD) or a Master’s degree or higher (28% versus 6% among ERD). Approximately 59% of caregivers reported working for pay, with a significantly higher proportion among ERD caregivers (71% versus 53% among WNH; p=.033). The largest proportion of caregivers across both groups reported having just enough to make ends meet (47%), with similar proportions between groups. Approximately 17% of caregivers reported being uninsured, with a significantly higher proportion of uninsured in the ERD group (22% versus 15% among WNH; p=.003). Almost 43% of caregivers reported having at least one chronic health condition, with approximately twice as many ERD caregivers experiencing a health condition (60% versus 34% among WNH; p=.001). Approximately 23% of caregivers were spouses, with significantly more spousal caregivers in the WNH group (31% versus 8% among ERD; p=.002). The remaining caregivers consisted of adult children, other relatives, and friends.

Approximately 32% of caregivers indicated that they needed emotional help with caregiving (27% ERD, 35% WNH). The most common instrumental help needs (in descending order) were time for recreation (38% overall; 38% ERD; 38% WNH), respite (31% overall; 27% ERD; 33% WNH), physical (30% overall; 31% ERD; 29% WNH), financial (30% overall; 29% ERD; 35% WNH), legal (29% overall; 21% ERD; 33% WNH), housing/ utilities (28% overall; 19% ERD; 32% WNH), food (27% overall; 26% ERD; 28% WNH), transportation (26% overall; 22% ERD; 28% WNH), and clothing (26% overall; 31% ERD; 23% WNH). There were no significant differences between groups on need items.

Approximately 19% and 20% of caregivers smoked cigarettes and regularly consumed alcohol, respectively, with significantly higher proportions of each behavior in the ERD group (29% versus 11% among WNH for cigarettes, p=.007; 24% versus 14% among WNH for alcohol, p=.049; Table 2). Approximately 15% of caregivers reported having used the emergency room and 63% reported having seen or talked to a doctor about their own health in the previous 12months, with significantly more WNH caregivers reporting the latter (67% versus 38% among ERD; p&lt;.000). There were no significant differences by group in stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, subjective physical and mental health, or sleep quality. Groups were similar on hours per day providing care, burden, and positive aspects of caregiving.

Approximately 58% percent of caregivers reported being affiliated with a ‘religious, spiritual, cultural, or traditional group’ and 72% felt that this helped them to deal with caregiving responsibilities, with a higher proportion of WHN caregivers endorsing this item (70% versus 49% among ERD; p=.018). Although groups were similar in ratings of provider cultural competence, ERD caregivers rated the importance of cultural competence significantly higher than WNH caregivers (M = 8.65 versus M = 6.54 among WNH, p=.006). Approximately 70% of caregivers indicated that they would recommend their providers to other people of the same ethnic or cultural background, with no significant differences between groups.

Discussion

This study provides a profile of a unique population of ADRD caregivers who are both diverse and rural. It also explores similarities and differences by self-reported ethnicity/race, according to individual-, interpersonal-, and community/societal-levels of influence (NIMHHD, 2017). Overall, most caregivers in this study were female. However, significantly more WNH than ERD caregivers were female. In fact, females made up only 40% of caregivers in the ERD group. This unexpected finding suggests that within this diverse rural sample, gender may be a less important for determining who assumes caregiving responsibilities. Few studies have focused on male ADRD caregivers (Accius, 2017). Additional research is needed to better understand these caregivers’ experiences.

The majority of caregivers in the study had a college degree and were working for pay. At the same time, however, most reported having ‘not enough’ or ‘just enough’ income to ‘make ends meet’. This raises the possibility that, perhaps due to caregiving demands, rural caregivers may be underemployed in terms of hours or wages received. This finding is consistent with existing studies which show that caregiving across the spectrum of ADRD severity has a negative economic impact on families (Robinson et al., 2020; Szabo et al., 2019). For many caregivers, real or perceived financial strain can lead to poor outcomes including anxiety and depressive symptoms (Nam, 2016; Sun et al., 2009). Further, in national samples of ADRD caregivers, being employed has been linked with a lower likelihood of using formal support services (Feldman et al., 2021). Thus, some caregivers may find themselves in a ‘triple bind’ of working, barely surviving financially, and having little extra time to seek and receive supportive services. Seeking resources may also be complicated for diverse rural caregivers who may be hesitant to ask for help (Henning-Smith &amp; Lahr, 2018).

A large proportion of caregivers reported experiencing at least one chronic health condition including heart problems, diabetes, stroke, kidney disease, cancer, lung disease, and liver disease, with almost twice the proportion among the ethnically/ racially diverse subsample. This is noteworthy considering the relatively young age of these caregivers (i.e. average of 39years old), as well as the large percentage of uninsured caregivers in this group. Studies have documented comorbidities among individuals with ADRD (Wolters et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2014) ; but few have documented chronic health conditions among ADRD caregivers themselves. However, this finding is consistent with the literature about the high prevalence of chronic conditions in Latino/Latina, American Indian, and rural communities (Dominguez et al., 2015; Espey et al., 2014; Rural Health Information Hub, 2019).

All caregivers in this study were residing in rural areas which already face shortages of available of health resources to prevent chronic health conditions, compared to those residing in urban areas (Berman, 2019). Significantly higher levels of smoking and alcohol use reported by ethnically/racially diverse caregivers, as well as a lower likelihood of seeing or speaking with a physician about their own health problems, are consistent with longstanding, systemic health disparities experienced by communities of color (Cunningham et al., 2016; Lui et al., 2021; Martell et al., 2016; Smedley et al., 2003). Findings suggest that diverse rural caregivers may be in need of additional supports to facilitate healthy behaviors and outcomes.

Large numbers of caregivers reported needing emotional help with caregiving, as well as instrumental help with recreation, respite care, physical assistance with caregiving, financial and legal assistance, and assistance with housing/utilities, food, transportation, and clothing. This finding reflects research documenting the challenges experienced by rural caregivers including less access to resources and greater geographic distance to resources compared to their urban or suburban counterparts (Bayly et al., 2020; Bouldin et al., 2018; McGrail et al., 2015). It may be noteworthy that there were no significant differences in the expressed needs between ethnic/racial groups. In the context of ADRD family caregiving, rurality may be a more salient factor than ethnicity and race.

Our exploration of multi-level risk factors provides insight into where extra supports may be needed. More than a third of caregivers reported not having seen or talked to a doctor in the previous year. This proportion was significantly higher among diverse caregivers (62%). Studies demonstrate the value of primary care for the prevention of chronic illness and the promotion of positive health behaviors (Álvarez-Bueno et al., 2015; Fleming &amp; Godwin, 2008). However, primary and other healthcare tends to be more difficult to access in rural settings (McGrail et al., 2015), particularly for populations of color (Blewett et al., 2003). In order to increase engagement in healthcare for diverse rural caregivers, rural healthcare systems may need to enhance outreach and education activities within the communities they serve, perhaps through the use of telehealth and similar technologies (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2020).

In terms of outcomes (i.e. stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, subjective physical and mental health, sleep quality) there were no differences between ethnic/racial subgroups within the sample. This finding contrasts with existing research (Liu et al., 2021) and may partially be attributable to the rural southwestern U.S. context in which this study was conducted (i.e. with high numbers of residents who identify as Latinx or American Indian).

At the interpersonal level, there also were no differences by ethnicity/race in care provided, caregiving burden, or positive aspects of caregiving. However, participants reported providing an average of approximately 9h per day of care for their loved one, confirming previous findings that rural caregivers are more likely to provide more care compared to urban caregivers (Cohen et al., 2021). This greatly exceeds estimates from national studies of caregivers across chronic conditions (of which ADRD caregivers represent only 11% of respondents) which report that caregivers provide approximately 23.7h of care per week (AARP &amp; National Alliance for Caregiving, 2020).

At the community/societal level, most caregivers reported being a member of a religious, spiritual, cultural, or traditional group, with no differences by ethnicity/race. A significantly larger proportion of non-Hispanic White caregivers reported that these connections helped them to deal with caregiving demands. This is difficult to interpret in the context of literature that describes how Latinx and American Indian family caregivers possess culturally-based strengths that facilitate caregiving (C. Arévalo-Flechas et al., 2014; Goins et al., 2011). Further research is needed to disentangle the complex relationship between culture, caregiving, and health.

Study strengths and limitations

This study provides new insights into the experiences of rural ADRD caregivers. One strength of the study is the conceptual framework used for the examination by ethnicity/race which is recommended by recent position papers (Breathett et al., 2021; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), 2017). Another strength is the relatively large and diverse sample, even within the ‘ethnically/racially diverse’ group. This diversity adds value for understanding the broad range of rural ADRD caregivers although we acknowledge that there may be heterogeneity within the ERD subsample that the study was not able to adequately explore, as well as potential differences in how members of this subsample interpreted the survey questions. Supplementary analyses were conducted to examine demographic differences within the ERD subsample (Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic; Caucasian or White only vs. African American or Black only vs. American Indian or Alaska Native only vs. Asian only). With the exception of a trend-level difference in age between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic caregivers (Hispanic mean age = 36.47years, Non-Hispanic mean age = 45.53, p=.052), there were no significant differences between groups. Future research with diverse rural caregivers may benefit from more targeted research questions and sampling strategies.

Despite these strengths, at least three limitations must be acknowledged. First, the study occurred during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic prior to vaccines being made available. COVID-19 created many challenges for households across the U.S. including financial problems, job loss, reduced access to health care, and increased isolation (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2021; Williamson et al., 2020). Therefore, our findings should be considered within that context. Second, findings are based upon a convenience sample of self-identified caregivers. Convenience sampling is not uncommon for rural ADRD caregiver studies (Lewis et al., 2021; O’Connell et al., 2013). This may be due to uncertainty surrounding ADRD diagnosis, compared with other chronic illnesses with clearer diagnostic criteria and greater availability of patient registries to use for sampling purposes (e.g. heart disease, stroke, diabetes). Third, some survey items are not typically used for research purposes and some items from validated scales such as the PSS (Cohen et al., 1983) and ZBI (Bédard et al., 2001) were adapted for this study based upon input from community partners. Findings based on these measures should be interpreted with caution. Future research should include greater attention to the psychometric properties of all study measures.
