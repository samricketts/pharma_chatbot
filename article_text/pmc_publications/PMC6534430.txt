Objective:

Increased levels of worry, age, and presence of the apolipoprotein-E (ApoE) ε4-allele are associated with risk for developing cognitive declines and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Odor memory performance has been shown to vary as a function of age and ApoE-genotype, and odor memory tests are sensitive to pre-clinical AD. Worry is known to influence verbal memory; however, its effects on odor memory are unknown. This study aimed to assess the relationships between worry, age, and ε4-status on odor memory.

Method.

Worry was evaluated for young (n= 53) and older (n= 45) adults using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire. Odor memory was assessed using the California Odor Learning Test; an olfactory analogue to the California Verbal Learning Test.

Results.

A significant main effect of worry on long-delay free recall was found, such that increasing worry was associated with better recall across age and ε4-status. A significant interaction effect between ε4-status and worry on both short and long-delay cued recall was found, such that across age, higher worry was associated with increased cued-recall scores among ε4-negative adults, and decreased scores among ε4-positive adults.

Conclusions.

Findings demonstrate that worry influences odor memory and exerts a particular effect on cued recall among ε4-carriers who are at greater risk for developing AD. Worry is a modifiable predictor of cognitive decline and risk for dementia in aging. Future studies on the effects of treatments aimed at reducing worry (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapies for anxiety) on changes in cognitive functioning are warranted.

Age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are of great concern, particularly considering the increasing age of the general population. Intervention efforts are most effective in the earliest stages of AD, motivating efforts towards early identification of the disease.

Tests of olfactory function have shown great promise as pre-clinical indicators of AD (Albers, Gilmore, Kaye, Murphy, Wingfield, Bennett et al., 2014; Djordjevic, Jones-Gotman, De Sousa, &amp; Chertkow, 2008; Lehrner, Pusswald, Gleiss, Auff, &amp; Dal-Bianco, 2009; Murphy, 2018 in press; Ottaviano, Frasson, Nardello, &amp; Martini, 2016; Quarmley et al., 2017; Schubert et al., 2008) with prodromal declines in olfactory function occurring due to very early proliferation of AD-related neuropathology in the entorhinal and transentorhinal cortices, regions critical for processing olfactory information (Braak &amp; Braak, 1991; Christen-Zaech et al., 2003). These regions also serve important roles in hippocampal networks critical for memory. For example, impaired odor recognition has been demonstrated in patients with hippocampal lesions (Levy, Manns, Hopkins, Gold, &amp; Squire, 2003). Accordingly, odor tests can serve as early indicators for later cognitive impairment. Indeed, epidemiological research has reported that olfactory function predicts cognitive decline over a five-year period, with results suggesting that odor testing is useful in high-risk settings (Schubert et al., 2008).

The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, a genetic risk factor for AD, has also been associated with declines in a number of olfactory tasks, even in cognitively normal adults (Calhoun-Haney &amp; Murphy, 2005; Finkel, Reynolds, Larsson, Gatz, &amp; Pedersen, 2011; Gilbert &amp; Murphy, 2004; Larsson et al., 2016; Olofsson et al., 2016). Studies have shown that olfaction declines more rapidly than global cognitive function among carriers of the ε4 allele, with higher-level olfactory processing abilities, such as odor identification, declining faster than more peripheral functions such as odor detection (Calhoun-Haney &amp; Murphy, 2005), and with measurable declines in these abilities occurring as early as middle age in ε4/ε4 homozygotes (Josefsson, Larsson, Nordin, Adolfsson, &amp; Olofsson, 2017).

However, testing for ε4-positive status does not carry full sensitivity or specificity for the disease, and approximately 42% of those with non-familial and late-onset AD are not ε4-carriers (Bekris, Yu, Bird, &amp; Tsuang, 2010; Bird, 2008). Thus, additional factors must be contributing to the pathogenesis of AD, and research into modifiable risk factors has become a growing area of interest. Worry, or the act of dwelling on specific negative or troubling thoughts, is one such modifiable risk factor that has been linked to an increased chance of developing AD, with structural degeneration in the hippocampus and other regions posited as a potential neural mechanism (Mah, Szabuniewicz, &amp; Fiocco, 2016).

Worry is a behavioral (e.g., the act of and actions associated with allowing one’s mind to dwell on concerns or problems) and cognitive (e.g., thoughts about concerns, actual or potential problems, or danger) manifestation of negative emotions and physiological experiences (e.g. fear, uncertainty, disgust, stress), and is a hallmark symptom of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Anxiety in aging has been associated with an increased risk for the development of neuropathology associated with Alzheimer’s disease, such as proliferation of beta-amyloid (Palmer et al., 2007). The same biological risk factors for increased amyloid, such as possession of an ApoE ε4 allele, have also been associated with elevated levels of anxiety (Caselli, Reiman, Hentz, Osborne, &amp; Alexander, 2004; Holmes et al., 2016) in older adults. Worry and other perseverative thought processes (i.e., rumination) have been found to predict negative outcomes associated with emotional problems over and above diagnostic categories, even at subsyndromal levels (Ruscio, Seitchik, Gentes, Jones, &amp; Hallion, 2011). Among cognitively normal older adults, those with minimally elevated worry symptoms have been shown to demonstrate poorer performance in visual and paired associate learning and are also more likely to show clinically significant visual learning and memory declines over a two year period than those with minimal levels of worry (Pietrzak et al., 2012). Sub-clinical levels have also been associated with functional impairments, physical disability, and decreased quality of life in cognitively normal older adults (Braam et al., 2014). In line with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoc; Insel, Cuthbert, and Garvey, 2010) initiative, these findings suggest that worry may be a functional mechanism that cuts across diagnostic categories.

Worry is also associated with the physiological stress response, which refers to the biological or physiological symptoms occurring in response to a perceived threat. The perseverative nature of worry serves to prolong the physiological stress response beyond the time constraints of a stressful event, potentially increasing the risk for poor stress-related health outcomes (Ottaviani et al., 2016). Studies of the effect of stress and genetic risk for AD on verbal memory have found that older adults who reported high levels of chronic stress, defined by the authors as at least one high stress event in the past year, performed worse on long delay free recall than those with low stress, and performance was worst in those reporting high stress who also tested positive for the ApoE ε4 allele (Peavy et al., 2007). Similarly, increased cortisol levels, a hormone associated with worry and the experience of stress and anxiety, were negatively correlated with performance on verbal memory and learning and this effect was significantly more pronounced in ε4+ individuals (Lee et al., 2008). Taken together, research exploring the relationships among stress, anxiety, worry, and cognitive function suggest that worry may mediate some of the negative cognitive outcomes associated with stress and anxiety.

While no studies to date have directly examined the relationship between worry and odor memory, links between olfactory, emotion, and memory processing have been reliably shown. A wide variety of cognitive and behavioral studies have demonstrated effects such as olfactory cuing of emotional memories (Galliot et al., 2013), facilitation of the memory for specific unique events as a function of the emotion carried by odors (Saive et al., 2014), and heightened responses to odors in conditions with dysfunction in affective processing, such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (Cortese, Leslie, &amp; Uhde, 2015).

Connections between olfactory, memory, and emotion have also been demonstrated at the neural level (Soudry, Lemogne, Malinvaud, Consoli, &amp; Bonfils, 2011). The primary olfactory cortex (i.e., piriform cortex) shares a wide number of direct and indirect connections with regions known to be critical for functions such as emotional regulation, integration of affective and sensory information, emotional learning and memory, and reward-based decision making (e.g., the amygdala, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and insular cortex; (Cerf-Ducastel &amp; Murphy, 2001; Frasnelli et al., 2010; Lehn, Kjønigsen, Kjelvik, &amp; Håberg, 2013; Smitka et al., 2012). Thus, unlike other sensory systems in which primary sensory information is routed to sensory-association regions via the thalamus, olfactory information is sent directly to regions within the prefrontal cortex and limbic system, resulting in important neurologically-based relationships between mood, emotion, memory, and olfactory processing that affect cognitive, emotional, and social functioning across the lifespan (Sullivan, Wilson, Ravel, &amp; Mouly, 2015).

For example, these fronto-limbic networks have been shown to play important roles in the functional integration of primary olfactory information with information about important associated emotion and memory-related content (Benarroch, 2010; Cerf-Ducastel, Haase, &amp; Murphy, 2012; Murphy, Cerf-Ducastel, Calhoun-Haney, Gilbert, &amp; Ferdon, 2005). A recent study investigating functional connectivity using a cross-modal olfactory recognition memory paradigm also highlights the relationships between medial temporal regions implicated in AD (e.g., entorhinal cortex) and the OFC in odor memory processing, and suggest that associations between regions may vary as a function of memory accuracy and feelings of certainty or familiarity (Haase, Wang, Green, &amp; Murphy, 2013).

Importantly, while genetic and other non-modifiable risk factors for AD serve as useful biomarkers for who will develop the disease; they offer little with regard to intervention and prevention. In contrast, modifiable risk factors for AD such as worry can be directly treated and reduced to potentially improve health and quality of life. Thus, investigations into the relationship between chronic worry, aging, and preclinical markers of risk for AD have important implications.

To the authors’ knowledge, no study to date has investigated the effects of worry on odor memory performance. The present study sought to characterize the relationships between worry and odor memory as a function of age and ApoE-ε4 status in healthy young and older adults, which represents an important step towards understanding these relationships in relation to AD. We hypothesized significant differences in odor memory measures as a function of age, ApoE-ε4 status, and worry level, such that: (1) younger adults would perform better than older adults across all odor memory measures (2) odor memory performance would be associated with worry levels, and (3) the effect of worry on odor memory performance would vary as a function of ApoE-ε4 status.

Methods

Participants

Participants were 53 young (18–26 years; 27 males, 26 females) and 45 older (62–84 years; 23 males, 22 females) healthy adults. There were 21 ApoE ε4 positive and 32 ApoE ε4 negative young adults, and 18 ApoE ε4 positive and 23 ApoE ε4 negative older adults. ApoE genotype was not available for four of the older adults, so these cases were excluded from the final analyses.

Younger adults were primarily recruited from undergraduate psychology courses at San Diego State University, and older adults were primarily recruited through information and presentations at community centers and local businesses. The study was in compliance with regulations of the San Diego State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and subjects gave informed consent. Participants who met the age requirements screened for significant medical or psychiatric conditions that could affect cognition (e.g., history of traumatic brain injury, substance abuse, psychological diagnosis requiring medical or inpatient treatment). The study was part of a larger investigation exploring the effect of cortisol, thus participants were also excluded if they were diagnosed with any condition that could affect cortisol production (e.g. diabetes, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), or were currently using medications that may affect cortisol production (e.g. corticosteroids, steroid inhalers, antidepressants).

On the day of testing, participants were screened for depression using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer &amp; Brown, 1996) for younger adults, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; Yesavage et al., 1983) for older adults. Individuals were excluded if they scored a 20 or above on either scale, indicating the presence of moderate to severe depression. Older adult participants were screened for dementia using either the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), and excluded if they scored below recommended cutoffs of 26 on the MMSE (Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975) or 123 on the DRS (Lucas et al., 1998). All participants were assessed by a butanol threshold odor test (procedures are described in Murphy, Gilmore, Seery, Salmon, &amp; Lasker, 1990) and were excluded from the final analyses if testing revealed anosmia or severe hyposmia (i.e., butanol threshold odor test score &lt; 4 in both nostrils).

Procedures

Participants were administered screening tests, mood questionnaires, and tests of olfactory and cognitive function in the laboratory or their home. The testing session lasted approximately 2–3 hours, and participants received either monetary compensation or, when applicable, course credit for their participation.

ApoE Genotyping

All participants were genotyped for apoE allele type using a polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide, followed by digestion with the HhA1 restriction enzyme and polyacrylamide chain gel electrophoresis. Participants were categorized as ε4+ if they had at least one ε4 allele (i.e., ε2/4, ε3/4, and ε4/4).

California Odor Learning Test

The COLT was developed by Murphy, Nordin, &amp; Acosta (1997) as an olfactory analogue to the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT; Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, &amp; Ober, 1987) that uses odors instead of verbally presented words. Odors are distributed into the four semantic categories of spices and herbs, fruits, personal products, and sauces and condiments (e.g. cinnamon, oranges), and were matched on a one-to-one basis with the word items from the CVLT to allow for calculation of odor memory measures using the computerized scoring system developed for the CVLT (Delis et al., 1987).

Stimuli are presented to participants at suprathreshold level in opaque jars to avoid visual cues. During the odor presentation phases, participants are asked to close their eyes and presented with each odor for 5 seconds, with a 10 second inter-stimulus interval. The test consists of 5 immediate recall trials of 16 odors (List A) followed by a distracter trial of 16 different odors (List B); short delay recall of List A (free and category-cued; SDFR, SDCR), which is assessed directly after immediate recall of List B; long delay recall of List A (free and category-cued; LDFR, LDCR), which is assessed 20 minutes following the short delay portion; recognition memory; and lastly, odor identification.

Penn State Worry Questionnaire

Worry was measured with the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (Meyer, Miller, Metzger, &amp; Borkovec, 1990), which measures the participants’ general tendency to worry. The self-report questionnaire includes 16 items that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1, “Not at all typical of me” to 5, “Very typical of me.” Possible scores range from 16–80, with higher scores indicating higher worry. Items on the PSWQ measure aspects of worry such as rate, intrusiveness, and pervasiveness. The PSWQ has moderate to excellent psychometric properties across adult age groups (Crittendon &amp; Hopko, 2006; Hopko et al., 2003). It has been shown to have strong internal consistency and adequate convergent validity in both young and older adult samples (Beck, Stanley, &amp; Zebb, 1995) as well as samples with clinical anxiety disorders (Brown, Antony, &amp; Barlow, 1992). It has also been shown to have clinical utility as screening measure for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Fresco, Mennin, Heimberg, &amp; Turk, 2003) and to able to identify worry, over and above anxiety and depression (Meyer et al., 1990).

Statistical Analyses

Dependent variables of interest were highly correlated (see Table 2 below for correlations between COLT free and cued recall measures, and PSWQ scores), thus, multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) were conducted to determine the effect of age (young, older), ApoE ε4 status (negative, positive), PSWQ scores, and all 2-way interaction terms (Age*ApoE, Age*PSWQ, ApoE*PSWQ) on COLT recall memory measures. Two separate MANCOVA’s were conducted, one to examine effects on the free odor recall memory dependent variable (i.e., short and long delay free recall) and a second to examine effects on the cued odor recall memory dependent variable (i.e., short and long delay cued recall).

In all cases, Box’s Test indicated that the assumption of homogeneity of covariance matrices across groups was met. Follow-up analyses were conducted using univariate analysis of variance tests. To protect the family-wise p-value of .05, a p-value of .025 (.05/# of DVs) was used to determine significance of univariate post-hoc tests. Levene’s test indicated the homogeneity of variance assumption was met for each DV. Analyses were performed with SPSS statistical software, version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Results

Participant Characteristics

Demographic and clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. All adults scored within the normal range on self report measures of depression and global cognitive function. No significant age or ApoE group differences in odor threshold, MMSE, BDI-II, DRS, and GDS scores were found (p’s &gt; .05). Younger adults rated their current level of worry significantly higher than older adults, F(3, 90) = 17.64, p &lt;.001. There was no significant effect of ApoE status on the PSWQ, F(3, 90) = .001, p &gt; .97.

Free Odor Recall Memory

There were no significant effects of age or ApoE on free recall (p’s &gt; .09). The main effect of PSWQ was significant, Wilks’ Λ = .90, F(2, 86) = 4.73, p = .01, partial eta squared (η2) = .10, observed power = .78. No significant two-way interactions were found (p’s &gt; .15).

Follow-up univariate tests of significant multivariate effects indicated that the PSWQ had a significant effect on both short delay free recall, F(1, 87) = 9.37, p = .003, η2 = .10, and long delay free recall, F(1, 87) = 8.38, p = .005, η2 = .09 such that across age and ApoE groups, higher free recall scores were associated with higher PSWQ scores. In other words, higher self-reported worry was associated with more odors recalled on the free recall tasks.

Cued Odor Recall Memory

Results of the MANCOVA revealed significant main effects of the PSWQ [Wilks’ Λ = .85, F(2, 86) = 7.45, p = .001, η2= .15], ApoE [Wilks’ Λ = .92, F(2, 86) = 3.79, p = .03, η2 = .08], and age [Wilks’ Λ = .93, F(2, 86) = 3.29, p = .04, η2 = .07] on cued recall. These main effects were qualified by a significant ApoE*PSWQ interaction [Wilks’ Λ = .91, F(2, 86) = 4.32, p = .016, η2 = .09], and a significant age*ApoE interaction [Wilks’ Λ = .86, F(2, 86) = 7.19, p = .001, η2 = .14]. The age*PSWQ interaction was not significant (p &gt; .24).

Follow-up testing revealed that the PSWQ had a significant main effect on both short delay cued recall, F(1, 87) = 15.08, p &lt; .001, η2 = .15, and long delay cued recall, F(1, 87) = 12.46, p = .001, η2 = .13, such that across age and ApoE groups, higher cued recall scores were associated with higher PSWQ scores (i.e., higher self-reported worry).

ApoE also had a significant main effect for both short delay cued recall, F(1, 87) = 7.64, p = .007, η2 =.08, and long delay cued recall, F(1, 87) = 6.68, p &lt; .05, η2 = .07, such that across age and controlling for PSWQ, ε4 negative adults recalled significantly fewer odors during cued recall than ε4 positive adults (short delay: M = 3.71 vs 7.49; long delay: M = 3.85 vs 7.66).

The main effect of age was only significant for long delay cued recall, F(1, 87) = 5.17, p = .025, η2 = .06, (short delay cued recall: p &gt; .11). Young adults recalled significantly more odors than older adults (M = 7.40 vs 4.10), across ApoE groups and controlling for PSWQ.

Univariate analysis of the ApoE*PSWQ interaction indicated that the effect was significant for both short delay cued recall, F(1, 87) = 8.50, p = .005, η2= .09, and long delay cued recall, F(1, 87) = 6.10, p = .015, η2= .07 (See Figure 2). Results suggest that cued recall scores have a positive linear association with PSWQ scores in ApoE ε4- adults (i.e., higher cued recall scores are associated with higher PSWQ scores) whereas the relationship appeared quadratic in ApoE ε4+ adults (i.e., lower cued recall scores are associated with low and high PSWQ scores whereas midrange PSWQ scores are associated with higher recall scores). For ease of interpretation, Figures 1 and 2 display the interaction effect with PSWQ categorized according to cutoffs suggested by Korte, Allan, &amp; Schmidt (2016) to represent low, mid, and high levels of worry.

The age*ApoE interaction effect was also significant for both short delay cued recall, F(1, 87) = 11.85, p = .001, η2 =.12, and long delay cued recall, F(1, 87) = 6.13, p = .015, η2 = .07. One-way ANOVA’s were conducted within age groups to examine simple effects of the age*ApoE interaction. However, simple effects of ApoE were not significant within young (p &gt; .08) or older (p &gt; .12) adults.

Discussion

This is the first study to report on the relationships among odor recall, worry, and ApoE ε4 status. While higher cued recall scores were associated with higher PSWQ worry scores among ε4-negative adults, the positive effect of worry on cued recall memory for odors diminished with high levels of worry among ε4-positive adults (see Figures 1 and 2). Moreover, those with the highest and lowest levels of worry in the ε4+ group performed comparably low on the odor memory task whereas midrange worry levels were associated with better odor memory, consistent with a quadratic relationship. In contrast, higher worry was associated with better recall among ε4 noncarriers, indicating a linear relationship. This effect was found for both short and long delay cued recall scores whereas the effect was not significant for free recall scores. Notably, there were no ApoE group differences in PSWQ scores, thus, the significant interaction effect was not driven by group differences in worry.

The present findings are particularly interesting given known deficits in semantic categorization and the ability to use cues to aid recall in AD (Heindel, Salmon, &amp; Butters, 1990). For example, fMRI studies have shown that sustained activity levels in the entorhinal cortex, one of the earliest locations to develop AD-neuropathology, are correlated with subsequent performance on a cued-recall task (Fernández, Brewer, Zhao, Glover, &amp; Gabrieli, 1999). Research also supports utility of cued recall tests in distinguishing depression from MCI and early AD (Dierckx, Engelborghs, De Raedt, De Deyn, &amp; Ponjaert-Kristoffersen, 2007; Vogel, Mortensen, Gade, &amp; Waldemar, 2007), and in predicting conversion from MCI to AD (Dierckx et al., 2009).

There are several possible reasons that might explain the unique impact of worry and apoE on cued recall. A proposed mechanism of action for the expected findings is an overall reduction in neurological reserves as a result of compounding neurodegeneration in neural correlates of worry that overlap with olfactory processing pathways (Canteras, Resstel, Bertoglio, Carobrez, &amp; Guimarães, 2010; Mah et al., 2016; Sapolsky, 1992). For example, hippocampal lesions have been shown to result in reduced levels of anxiety, and the ventral hippocampus has been particularly linked to anxiety-related behavior and cognition (Bannerman et al., 2004). Effects of anxiety on cognitive functions outside of memory have also been found, with studies showing differences in prefrontal functioning and sustained attention abilities (Forster, Nunez Elizalde, Castle, &amp; Bishop, 2015).

Notably, semantic clustering during encoding, as well as item-specific search during recall, is associated with activity in the prefrontal cortex (Long, Oztekin, &amp; Badre, 2010). Cortical association areas in tempoparietal regions, as well as parahippocampal cortex may also be important for cued memory retrieval (Hayama, Vilberg, Rugg, 2012). Metabolic and functional differences have been observed between apoE ε4+ and ε4- adults in these regions, and activity in these same regions in younger adults correlates with areas of atrophy in early stages of AD; all of which has led to the hypothesis that alterations in connectivity may create conditions that lead to age- and AD-related atrophy (Buckner et al., 2005; Machulda et al., 2011). Given that brain regions associated with anxiety and anxious responses overlap with these areas (Arnsten, 2009; Pardon &amp; Rattray, 2008), we might speculate that individuals with high levels of worry may be primed to activate anxiety-related networks that are also associated with memory search. ApoE-related metabolic and functional differences within these networks could alter the effect of worry on performance.

Neuropsychological correlates are also important to consider. Previous research has reported impaired executive functioning performance associated with state-anxiety in ApoE-ε4 carriers (Stonnington, Locke, Dueck, &amp; Caselli, 2011). Cued recall invokes executive functions via the use of memory strategy (categorical association), thus, the present findings of significant differences in scores on cued, but not free, recall in ApoE-ε4 carriers may be related to underlying relative differences in executive functioning. Future studies may wish to include measures of additional cognitive abilities (e.g. executive functions, attention, and working memory) in order to determine their influence on the relationship between worry and memory.

An unexpected finding that should be noted was the direction of the main effects for age on PSWQ scores was such that younger adults rated their current level of worry an average of eleven points higher than older adults. We speculate that this discrepancy could be understood under the rubric of the socioemotional selectivity theory, which suggests that there is a positivity bias in older adults whereby positive information is more likely to be attended to than negative information, (Carstensen et al., 2011; Lee &amp; Knight, 2009). Some insight into this finding comes from research on stress showing that it can have paradoxical effects on performance, with the direction of the effect changing depending on type, timing, duration, and other factors of the stressor. Under low and high levels of stress, performance tends to be negatively affected; however, under moderate levels of stress, performance may be positively affected (Pardon, 2007). The findings in the present study may be reflecting the positive portion of an underlying quadratic relationship whereby performance is enhanced as worry increases from low to moderate levels, but impaired as worry increases from moderate to high levels.

The lack of an effect of ApoE-ε4 carrier status on free recall of odors is also worthy of discussion given previous findings showing declines in performance on a number of olfactory tasks in those with the ε4 allele. Whereas impairments on odor identification tasks among ApoE ε4 carriers have been well-documented in the extant literature, the relationship between ApoE ε4 status and recall of odors is less well-studied (for review see Albers et al., 2015 and Murphy, 2018). One possible explanation for the current findings is that the exclusion of individuals with anosmia or severe hyposmia may have inadvertently excluded individuals with underlying e4-related pathology. However, complete loss of olfactory function is not typical of preclinical AD, and declines in odor detection (i.e., such as those resulting in hyposmia or anosmia) have been found to occur later than declines in higher-order olfactory processing such as odor identification (Calhoun-Haney &amp; Murphy, 2005); thus, it is not likely that excluding individuals with severe olfactory impairment fully explains the present findings. Performance on free recall tasks can be affected by multiple factors in addition to impaired memory processes, including use of an inefficient memory strategy or impaired attentional processes, and with regards to the current findings this increased variability could have made it more difficult to detect group differences with regard to ApoE ε4 if they existed. Consequently, cued recall tasks that provide a memory strategy scaffolding (i.e., semantic cues) are thought to be better indicators of impaired memory processes, and have been found to be better than free recall at discriminating older adults with dementia from older adults without dementia (Grober &amp; Buschke, 1987). The current findings revealed impaired cued but not free recall among ApoE ε4 carriers, which might suggest that ApoE ε4 carriers may be less able to benefit from the provision of semantic cues, perhaps due to pathology in prefrontal cortex as described earlier. It is also interesting that among the younger adults in the current sample, the trend for ApoE ε4 carriers to perform better than ε4 noncarriers at cued recall of odors approached (p&gt;.08), though it did not reach, significance. See Table 1. Mondadori et al. (2007) reported similar findings with regard to verbal episodic memory. Across a series of experiments, the authors found that young ε4 carriers demonstrated better episodic memory performance than ε4 noncarriers, and that ε4 carriers recruited fewer neural resources during the learning and retrieval process even when participants were matched by performance. The authors hypothesized that cellular processes associated with ApoE ε4 that are beneficial to learning and memory early in life may contribute to neuronal damage later in life or be negated by the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in middle to old age (Mondadori et al, 2007).

Additionally, the finding that those with higher levels of worry have better odor free recall may be unexpected given previous findings of worse cognitive and functional outcomes among those with minimal or subclinical levels of worry. There is some evidence in the literature to support an enhancing effect of worry on performance. Beaudreau et al. (2017) found that elevated worry improved performance on tests of cognitive control and delayed verbal memory in older adults with anxiety or depression; however, this effect was only found among participants with high levels of depressive symptoms, which would not be consistent with the current findings given low depressive symptoms in the current sample. The processing efficiency theory of anxiety (Eysenck &amp; Calvo, 1992) may provide additional insight into these findings. According to the processing efficiency theory, worry interferes with memory processes by consuming attentional resources necessary for holding information in working memory. If attentional resources are not depleted, some individuals may be able to compensate and continue to perform effectively, but with reduced efficiency. On the other hand, if attentional resources are depleted, performance effectiveness will be impaired. With regards to the current findings, ε4 carriers may be more vulnerable to the negative effect of worry on attentional resources whereas ε4 noncarriers may be better able to recruit additional cognitive resources to maintain or improve performance effectiveness, albeit at reduced efficiency. Such an explanation could explain lower olfactory recall scores among ε4 noncarriers compared to carriers at higher levels of worry (see Figures 1 and 2). The findings of Mondadori et al. (2007) as described above seem to lend some support to this hypothesis, but future studies of worry that include brain imaging methods to compare brain activity between ε4 carriers and noncarriers during olfactory learning and memory tasks are needed to test this hypothesis.

As in all studies several limitations should be noted. In particular, the study was cross-sectional and thus causality cannot be determined. Additionally, the sample included a relatively small number of participants who reported high levels of worry and did not include objective measures of worry or anxiety beyond self-report. Thus, further research including longitudinal data and samples with clinical levels of worry and other symptoms of anxiety measured using a variety of measures (e.g., objective, observational, in vivo) are warranted. However, a notable strength of the current study was the use of a novel and comprehensive odor learning and memory test (i.e., the COLT). While the COLT does not have published reliability and validity information available, a number of olfactory tasks have been shown to be sensitive in detecting neurodegenerative declines, and thus the present results may be particularly helpful in elucidating the role of anxiety and stress-related factors, like worry, on cognitive declines in devastating conditions like AD.

Strikingly, the performance deficits associated with having an ε4 allele and high worry were not only present in older adults, but also were evident in adults below the age of 30 years old. Given that apoE groups did not differ with regard to level of worry, it is plausible that pathological differences among apoE ε4 carriers may affect brain regions that are associated with both memory and worry (e.g., hippocampus, prefrontal cortices), and that these differences may be evident on olfactory testing as early as young adulthood. Given that apoE ε4 carrier status and olfactory declines are associated with increased risk for AD, the present findings also add to evidence that cognitive deficits related to worry levels might compound deficits related to AD pathology. If this mechanism is supported, it suggests that there may be the potential to reduce risk of developing cognitive impairment in those with genetic risk for AD by intervening to reduce worry in those who report chronically high levels of worry.
