Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive form of dementia that results in problems with memory, thinking, and behavior. It often starts with abnormal aggregation and deposition of β amyloid and tau, followed by neuronal damage such as atrophy of the hippocampi, leading to Alzheimers Disease (AD). The aim of this paper is to map the genetic-imaging-clinical pathway for AD in order to delineate the genetically-regulated brain changes that drive disease progression based on the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We develop a novel two-step approach to delineate the association between high-dimensional 2D hippocampal surface exposures and the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) cognitive score, while taking into account the ultra-high dimensional clinical and genetic covariates at baseline. Analysis results suggest that the radial distance of each pixel of both hippocampi is negatively associated with the severity of behavioral deficits conditional on observed clinical and genetic covariates. These associations are stronger in Cornu Ammonis region 1 (CA1) and subiculum subregions compared to Cornu Ammonis region 2 (CA2) and Cornu Ammonis region 3 (CA3) subregions. Supplementary materials for this article, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work, are available as an online supplement.

pmc1 Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills. According to World Alzheimer Reports (Gaugler et al., 2019), there are around 55 million people worldwide living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia. The total global cost of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia was estimated to be a trillion US dollars, equivalent to 1.1% of global gross domestic product. Alzheimer’s patients often suffer from behavioral deficits including memory loss and difficulty of thinking, reasoning and decision making.

In the current model of AD pathogenesis, it is well established that deposition of amyloid plaques is an early event that, in conjunction with tau pathology, causes neuronal damage. Scientists have identified risk genes that may cause the abnormal aggregation and deposition of the amyloid plaques (e.g. Morishima-Kawashima and Ihara, 2002). The neuronal damage typically starts from the hippocampus and results in the first clinical manifestations of the disease in the form of episodic memory deficits (Weiner et al., 2013). Specifically, Jack Jr et al. (2010) presented a hypothetical model for biomarker dynamics in AD pathogenesis, which has been empirically and collectively supported by many works in the literature. The model begins with the abnormal deposition of β amyloid (Aβ) fibrils, as evidenced by a corresponding drop in the levels of soluble Aβ-42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Aizenstein et al., 2008). After that, neuronal damage begins to occur, as evidenced by increased levels of CSF tau protein (Hesse et al., 2001). Numerous studies have investigated how Aβ and tau impact the hippocampus (e.g. Ferreira and Klein, 2011), known to be fundamentally involved in acquisition, consolidation, and recollection of new episodic memories (Frozza et al., 2018). In particular, as neuronal degeneration progresses, brain atrophy, which starts with hippocampal atrophy (Fox et al., 1996), becomes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Studies from recent years also found other important CSF proteins that may be related to hippocampal atrophy. For instance, the low levels of chromogranin A (CgA) and trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), and high level of cystatin C (CysC) are evidently associated with hippocampal atrophy (Khan et al., 2015; Paterson et al., 2014). Indeed, the impact of protein concentration on behavior can also be through atrophy of other brain regions. For example, there exists potential entorhinal tau pathology on episodic memory decline (Maass et al., 2018). As sufficient brain atrophy accumulates, it results in cognitive symptoms and impairment. This process of AD pathogenesis is summarized by the flow chart in Figure 1. Note that it is still debatable how Aβ and tau interact with each other as mentioned by Jack Jr et al. (2013); Majdi et al. (2020); however, it is evident that Aβ may still hit a biomarker detection threshold earlier than tau (Jack Jr et al., 2013). In addition, as noted by Hampel et al. (2018), it is likely that highly complex interactions exist between Aβ as well as tau, and the cholinergic system. For instance, the association has been found between CSF biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology in AD (Remnestål et al., 2021). It has also been found that other factors, such as dysregulation and dysfunction of the Wnt signaling pathway, may also contribute to Aβ and tau pathologies (Ferrari et al., 2014). In addition, the M1 and M3 subtypes of muscarinic receptors increase amyloid precursor protein production via the induction of the phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway and increase BACE expression in AD brains (Nitsch et al., 1992).

The aim of this paper is to map the genetic-imaging-clinical (GIC) pathway for AD, which is the most important part of the hypothetical model of AD pathogenesis in Figure 1. Histological studies have shown that the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease pathology and has already been considerably damaged at the first occurrence of clinical symptoms (Braak and Braak, 1998). Therefore, the hippocampus has become a major focus in Alzheimer’s studies (De Leon et al., 1989). Some neuroscientists even conjecture that the association between hippocampal atrophy and behavioral deficits may be causal, because the former destroys the connections that help the neuron communicate and results in a loss of function (Watson, 2019). We are interested in delineating the genetically-regulated hippocampal shape that drives AD related behavioral deficits and disease progression.

To map the GIC pathway, we extract clinical, imaging, and genetic variables from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study as follows. First, we use the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) cognitive score to quantify behavioral deficits, for which a higher score indicates more severe behavioral deficits. Second, we characterize the exposure of interest, hippocampal shape, by the hippocampal morphometry surface measure, summarized as two 100 × 150 matrices corresponding to the left/right hippocampi. Each element of the matrices is a continuous-valued variable, representing the radial distance from the corresponding coordinate on the hipppocampal surface to the medial core of the hippocampus. Compared with the conventional scalar measure of hippocampus shape (Jack et al., 2003), recent studies show that the additional information contained in the hippocampal morphometry surface measure is valuable for Alzheimer’s diagnosis (Thompson et al., 2004). For example, Li et al. (2007) showed that the surface measures of the hippocampus could provide more subtle indexes compared with the volume differences in discriminating between patients with Alzheimer’s and healthy control subjects. In our case, with the 2D matrix radial distance measure, one may investigate how local shapes of hippocampal subfields are associated with the behavioral deficits. Third, the ADNI study measures ultra-high dimensional genetic covariates and other demongraphic covariates at baseline. There are more than 6 million genetic variants per subject.

The special data structure of the ADNI data application presents new challenges for statistically mapping the GIC pathway. First, unlike conventional statistical analysis that deals with scalar exposure, our exposure of interest is represented by high-dimensional 2D hippocampal imaging measures. Second, the dimension of baseline covariates, which are also potential confounders, is much larger than the sample size. Recently there have been many developments for confounder selection, most of which are in the causal inference literature. Studies show inclusion of the variables only associated with exposure but not directly with the outcome except through the exposure (known as instrumental variables) may result in loss of efficiency in the causal effect estimate (e.g. Schisterman et al., 2009), while inclusion of variables only related to the outcome but not the exposure (known as precision variables) may provide efficiency gains (e.g. Brookhart et al., 2006); see Shortreed and Ertefaie (2017); Richardson et al. (2018); Tang et al. (2021) and references therein for an overview.

When a large number of covariates are available, the primary difficulty for mapping the GIC pathway is how to include all the confounders and precision variables, while excluding all the instrumental variables and irrelevant variables (not related to either outcome or exposure). We develop a novel two-step approach to estimate the conditional association between the high-dimensional 2D hippocampal surface exposure and the Alzheimer’s behaviorial score, while taking into account the ultra-high dimensional baseline covariates. The first step is a fast screening procedure based on both the outcome and exposure models to rule out most of the irrelevant variables. The use of both models in screening is crucial for both computational efficiency and selection accuracy, as we will show in detail in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. The second step is a penalized regression procedure for the outcome generating model to further exclude instrumental and irrelevant variables, and simultaneously estimate the conditional association. Our simulations and ADNI data application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.

Our analysis represents a novel inferential target compared to recent developments in imaging genetics mediation analysis (Bi et al., 2017). Although we consider a similar set of variables and structure among these variables as illustrated later in Figure 2, our goal is to estimate the conditional association of hippocampal shape with behavioral deficits. In contrast, in mediation analysis, researchers are often interested in the effects of genetic factors on behavioral deficits, and how those are mediated through hippocampus. Direct application of methods developed for imaging genetics mediation analysis to our problem may select genetic factors that are confounders affecting both hippocampal shape and behavioral deficits. In comparison, we aim to include precision variables in the adjustment set as they may improve efficiency.

The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 includes a detailed data and problem description. We introduce our models and a two-step variable selection procedure in Section 3. We analyze the ADNI data and estimate the association between hippocampal shape and behavioral deficits conditional on observed clinical and genetic covariates in Section 4. Simulations are conducted in Section 5 to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method. We finish with a discussion in Section 6. The theoretical properties of our procedure are included in Section S9 in the supplementary material.

2 Data and problem description

Understanding how human brains work and how they connect to human behavior is a central goal in medical studies. In this paper, we are interested in studying whether and how hippocampal shape is associated with behavioral deficits in Alzheimer’s studies. We consider the clinical, genetic, imaging and behavioral measures in the ADNI dataset. The outcome of interest is the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale cognitive score observed at 24th month after baseline measurements. The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale cognitive 13 items score (ADAS-13) (Mohs et al., 1997) includes 13 items: word recall task, naming objects and fingers, following commands, constructional praxis, ideational praxis, orientation, word recognition task, remembering test directions, spoken language, comprehension, and word-finding difficulty, delayed word recall and a number cancellation or maze task. A higher ADAS score indicates more severe behavioral deficits.

The exposure of interest is the baseline 2D surface data obtained from the left/right hippocampi. The hippocampus surface data were preprocessed from the raw MRI data, where the detailed preprocessing steps are included in Section S3.1 of the supplementary material. After preprocessing, we obtained left and right hippocampal shape representations as two 100 × 150 matrices. The imaging measurement at each pixel is an absolute metric, representing the radial distance from the pixel to the medial core of the hippocampus. The unit for the measurement is in millimeters.

In the ADNI data, there are millions of observed covariates that one may need to adjust for, including the whole genome sequencing data from all of the 22 autosomes. We have included detailed genetic preprocessing techniques in Section S3.2 of the supplementary material. After preprocessing, 6, 087, 205 bi-allelic markers (including SNPs and indels) of 756 subjects were retained in the data analysis.

We excluded those subjects with missing hippocampus shape representations, baseline intracranial volume (ICV) information or ADAS-13 score observed at Month 24, after which there are 566 subjects left. Our aim is to estimate the association between the hippocampal surface exposure and the ADAS-13 score conditional on clinical measures including age, gender and length of education, ICV, diagnosis status, and 6, 087, 205 bi-allelic markers.

3 Methodology

3.1 Basic set-up

Suppose we observe independent and identically distributed samples {Li = (Xi, Zi, Yi), 1 ≤ i ≤ n} generated from L, where L = (X, Z, Y) has support ℒ=(X×Z×Y). Here Z∈Z⊆Rp×q is a 2D-image continuous exposure, y∈Y is a continuous outcome of interest, and X∈X⊆Rs denotes a vector of ultra-high dimensional genetic (and clinical) covariates, where we assume s &gt;&gt; n. We are interested in characterizing the association between the 2D exposure Z and outcome Y conditional on the observed covariates X.

Denote Xi = (Xi1, …, Xis)T. Without loss of generality, we assume that Xil has been standardized for every 1 ≤ l ≤ s, and Zi and Yi have been centered. To map the GIC pathway, we assume the following linear equation models: (1) Yi=∑l=1sXilβl+〈Zi,B〉+ϵi(outcome model);

(2) Zi=∑l=1sXil∗Cl+Ei(exposure model).

In (1), the matrix B∈Rp×q is the main parameter of interest, representing the association between the 2D imaging treatment Zi and the behavioral outcome Yi, βl represents the association between the l-th observed covariate Xil and the behavioral outcome Yi, and ϵi and Ei are random errors that may be correlated. The inner product between two matrices is defined as 〈Zi, B〉 = 〈vec(Zi), vec(B)〉, where vec(·) is a vectorization operator that stacks the columns of a matrix into a vector. Model (2), previously introduced in Kong et al. (2020), specifies the relationship between the 2D imaging exposure and the observed covariates. The Cl is a p×q coefficient matrix characterizing the association between the lth covariate Xil and the 2D imaging exposure Zi, and Ei is a p × q matrix of random errors with mean 0. The symbol “*” denotes element-wise multiplication. Define M1={1≤l≤s:βl≠0} and M2={1≤l≤s:Cl≠0}, where we assume |M1|&lt;&lt;n and |M2|&lt;&lt;n; here |M1| and |M2| represent the number of elements in M1 and M2 respectively.

To estimate B, the first step is to perform variable selection in models (1) and (2). For all the covariates Xl, we group them into four categories. Let A={1,…,s}, and denote C the indices of confounders, i.e. variables associated with both the outcome and the exposure; P denotes the indices of precision variables, i.e. predictors of the outcome, but not the exposure; I denotes the indices of instrumental variables, i.e. covariates that are only associated with the exposure but not directly with the outcome except through the exposure; S denotes the indices of irrelevant variables, i.e. covariates that are not related to the outcome or the exposure. Mathematically speaking, C={l∈A∣βl≠0andCl≠0}, P={l∈A∣βl≠0andCl=0}, I={l∈A∣βl=0andCl≠0} and S={l∈A∣βl=0andCl=0}. The relationships among different types of X, Z and Y are shown in Figure 2, where U denotes possible unmeasured confounders. Since we are interested in characterizing the association between Z and Y conditional on X, further discussion of U will be omitted for the remainder of the paper.

When there are no unobserved confounders U, the estimate of B has underlying causal interpretations. In this case, the ideal adjustment set includes all confounders to avoid bias and all precision variables to increase statistical efficiency, while excluding instrumental variables and irrelevant variables (Brookhart et al., 2006; Shortreed and Ertefaie, 2017). Although we are studying the conditional association rather than the causal relationship due to the possible unobserved confounding, our target adjustment set remains the same. In other words, we aim to retain all covariates from M1=C∪P={l∈A∣βl≠0}, while excluding covariates from ℐ∪S={l∈A∣βl=0}.

3.2 Naive screening methods

To find the nonzero βl’s, a straightforward idea is to consider a penalized estimator obtained from the outcome generating model (1), where one imposes, say Lasso penalties, on βl’s. However, this is computationally infeasible in our ADNI data application as the number of baseline covariates s is over 6 million. Consequently, it is important to employ a screening procedure (e.g. Fan and Lv, 2008) to reduce the model size. To find covariates Xl’s that are associated with the outcome Y conditional on the exposure Z, one might consider a conditional screening procedure for model (1) (Barut et al., 2016). Specifically, one can fit the model Yi = Xilβl + 〈Zi, B〉 + ϵi for each 1 ≤ l ≤ s, obtain marginal estimates of β^lMZ’s and then sort the |β^lMZ|’s for screening. This procedure works well if the exposure variable Z is of low dimension as one only needs to fit low dimensional ordinary least squares (OLS) s times. However, in our ADNI data application, the imaging exposure Z is of dimension pq = 15, 000. As a result, one cannot obtain an OLS estimate since n &lt; pq. Thus, to apply the conditional sure independence screening procedure to our application, one may need to solve a penalized regression problem for each 1 ≤ l ≤ s, such as arg minB,βl[12n∑i=1n(Yi−〈Zi,B〉−Xilβl)2+Pλ(B)], where Pλ(B) is a penalty of B. In theory, for each l ∈ {1, …, s}, one can obtain the estimates β^l,λMZ, and then rank the |β^l,λMZ|’s. However, this is computationally prohibitive in the ADNI data with s &gt; 6, 000, 000. First, the penalized regression problem is much slower to solve compared to the OLS. Second, selection of the tuning parameter λ based on grid search substantially increases the computational burden.

Alternatively one may apply the marginal screening procedure of Fan and Lv (2008) to model (1). Specifically, one may solve the following marginal OLS on each Xil by ignoring the exposure Zi:argminβl[12n∑i=1n(Yi−Xilβl)2]. The marginal OLS estimate has a closed form β^lM=n−1∑i=1nXilYi, and one can rank |β^lM|’s for screening. Specifically, the selected sub-model is defined as M^1∗={1≤l≤s:|β^lM|≥γ1,n}, where γ1,n is a threshold. Computationally, it is much faster than conditional screening for model (1) as we only need to fit one dimensional OLS for s &gt; 6, 000, 000 times. However, this procedure is likely to miss some important confounders. To see this, plugging model (2) into (1) yields Yi=∑l=1sXil(βl+〈Cl,B〉)+〈Ei,B〉+ϵi.

Even in the ideal case when Xil’s are orthogonal for 1≤l≤s,β^lM is not a good estimate of βl because of the bias term 〈Cl, B〉. Thus, we may miss some nonzero βl’s in the screening step if βl and 〈Cl,B〉 are of similar magnitudes but opposite signs. We illustrate this point in Figures 5 in Section 5, in which cases the conventional marginal screening on (1) fails to capture some of the important confounders.

3.3 Joint screening

To overcome the drawbacks of the estimation methods discussed in Section 3.2, we develop a joint screening procedure, specifically for our ADNI data application. The procedure is not only computationally efficient, but can also select all the important confounders and precision variables with high probability. The key insight here is that although we are interested in selecting important variables in the outcome generating model, this can be done much more efficiently by incorporating information from the exposure model. Specifically, let C^lM=n−1∑i=1nXil∗Zi∈Rp×q be the marginal OLS estimate in model (2) for l = 1, …, s. Following Kong et al. (2020), the important covariates in model (2) can be selected by M^2={1≤l≤s:‖C^lM‖op≥γ2,n} where ∥⋅∥op is the operator norm of a matrix and γ2,n is a threshold.

We define our joint screening set as M^=M^1∗∪M^2. Intuitively, most important confounders and precision variables are contained in the set M^1∗. The only exceptions are the covariates Xl for which both βl and 〈Cl, B〉 are of similar magnitudes but opposite signs. On the other hand, these Xl will be included in M^2 and hence, M^ along with instrumental variables with large ‖Cl‖op. In Section S9 of the supplementary material, we show that with properly chosen γ1,n and γ2,n, the joint screening set includes the confounders and precision variables with high probability: P(M1⊂M^)→1 as n → ∞. In practice, we recommend choosing γ1,n and γ2,n such that |M^1∗|=|M^2|=k, where k is the smallest integer such that |M^|≥⌊n/log(n)⌋. We set them to be of equal sizes following the convention that the size of screening set is determined only by the sample size (Fan and Lv, 2008), which is the same for M^1∗ and M^2. Depending on the prior knowledge about the sizes and signal strengths of confounding, precision and instrumental variables, the sizes of |M^1∗| and |M^2| may be chosen differently. In the simulations and real data analyses, we conduct sensitivity analyses by varying the relative sizes of M^1∗ and M^2.

In general, the set M^ includes not only confounders and precision variables in M1=C∪P, but also instrumental variables in I and a small subset of the irrelevant variables S. Nevertheless, the size of |M^| is greatly reduced compared to that of all the observed covariates. This makes it feasible to perform the second step procedure, a refined penalized estimation of B based on the covariates {Xl:l∈M^}.

3.4 Blockwise joint screening

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is a ubiquitous biological phenomenon where genetic variants present a strong blockwise correlation (LD) structure (Wall and Pritchard, 2003). If all the SNPs of a particular LD block are important but with relatively weak signals, they may be missed by the screening procedure described in Section 3.3. To appropriately utilize LD blocks’ structural information to select those missed SNPs, we develop a modified screening procedure described below.

Suppose that X = (X1, …, Xs)T can be divided into b discrete haplotype blocks: regions of high LD that are separated from other haplotype blocks by many historical recombination events (Wall and Pritchard, 2003). Let the index set of each b non-overlapping block be B1,…,Bb with ∪j=1bBj={1…,s}. For l = 1, …, s, we define βlblock,M=∑j=1b1(l∈Bj)|Bj|∑i∈Bj|βiM|andClblock,M=∑j=1b1(l∈Bj)|Bj|∑i∈Bj‖CiM‖op,β^lblock,M=∑j=1b1(l∈Bj)|Bj|∑i∈Bj|β^iM|andC^lblock,M=∑j=1b1(l∈Bj)|Bj|∑i∈Bj‖C^iM‖op,

where 1(·) is the indicator function of an event. We also define M^1block,∗={1≤l≤s:β^lblock,M≥γ3,n}andM^2block={1≤l≤s:C^lblock,M≥γ4,n}.

We propose to use the new set M^block=M^1∗∪M^2∪M^1block,*∪M^2block, rather than M^=M^1*∪M^2, to select important covariates. Intuitively, when |βl1| &gt; |βl2|, Xl1 is much more easily selected compared with Xl2 by M^1*. However, suppose that l1∈B1 and l2∈B2, with only a small proportion of Xl in B1 having |βl| &gt; 0, whereas a large proportion of Xl in B2 has |βl| &gt; 0. It may well be the case that βl1block,M&lt;βl2block,M, meaning that Xl2 can be selected more easily than Xl1 by M^1block,∗. In addition, as β^lM is not a good estimate of βl due to the bias term 〈Cl, B〉, β^lblock,M is not a good estimate of βlblock,M either. Therefore, some Xl with nonzero βlblock,M may not be included in M^1block,∗. Nevertheless, they will be included in M^2block and hence M^block.

Theoretically, when γ1,n, γ2,n, γ3,n and γ4,n are chosen properly, P(M1⊂M^block)→1 as n → ∞; see Theorem 3 in Section S9 of the supplementary material. In practice, we recommend choosing γ1,n, γ2,n, γ3,n and γ4,n, such that |M^1∗|=|M^2|=|M^1block,∗|=|M^2block|=k, where k is the smallest integer such that |M^block|≥2⌊n/log(n)⌋. The threshold here is twice the threshold what we suggested in Section 3.3 since we unionize two additional sets.

3.5 Second-step estimation

In this step, we aim to estimate B by excluding the instrument variables I and irrelevant variables in S from M^ (or M^block) and keeping the other covariates. This can be done by solving the following optimization problem: (3) arg minB,{βl,l∈M^}[12n∑i=1n(Yi−〈Zi,B〉−∑l∈M^Xilβl)2+λ1∑l∈M^|βl|+λ2‖B‖∗].

Denote (B^,β^) the solution to the above optimization problem. The Lasso penalty on βl is used to exclude instrumental and irrelevant variables in M^, whose corresponding coefficients βl’s are zero. The nuclear norm penalty ‖·‖*, defined as the sum of all the singular values of a matrix, is used to achieve a low-rank estimate of B, where the low-rank assumption in estimating 2D structural coefficients is commonly used in the literature (Zhou and Li, 2014; Kong et al., 2020). For tuning parameters, we use five-fold cross validation based on two-dimensional grid search, and select λ1 and λ2 using the one standard error rule (Hastie et al., 2009).

4 ADNI data applications

We use the data obtained from the ADNI study (adni.loni.usc.edu). The data usage acknowledgement is included in Section S2 of the supplement material. As described in Section 2, we include 566 subjects from the ADNI1 study. The exposure of interest is the baseline 2D hippocampal surface radial distance measures, which can be represented as a 100 × 150 matrix for each part of the hippocampus. The outcome of interest is the ADAS-13 score observed at Month 24. The average ADAS-13 score is 20.8 with standard deviation 14.1. The covariates to adjust for include 6, 087, 205 bi-allelic markers as well as clinical covariates, including age, gender and education length, baseline intracranial volume (ICV), and baseline diagnosis status. The average age is 75.5 years old with standard deviation 6.6 years, and the average education length is 15.6 years with standard deviation 2.9 years. Among all the 566 subjects, 58.1% were female. The average ICV was 1.28 × 106 mm3 with standard deviation 1.35 × 105 mm3. There were 175 (184 at Month 24) cognitive normal patients, 268 (157 at Month 24) patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 123 (225 at Month 24) patients with AD at the baseline. Studies have shown that age and gender are the main risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (Vina and Lloret, 2010; Guerreiro and Bras, 2015) with older people and females more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease. Multiple studies have also shown that prevalence of dementia is greater among those with low or no education (Zhang et al., 1990). On the other hand, age, gender and length of education have been found to be strongly associated with the hippocampus (Van de Pol et al., 2006; Jack et al., 2000; Noble et al., 2012). Previous studies (Sargolzaei et al., 2015) suggest that the ICV is an important measure that needs to be adjusted for in studies of brain change and AD. In addition, the baseline diagnosis status may help explain the baseline hippocampal shape and the AD status at Month 24. Therefore, we consider age, gender, education length, baseline ICV and baseline diagnosis status as part of the confounders, and adjust for them in our analysis. In addition, we also adjust for population stratification, for which we use the top five principal components of the whole genome data. As both left and right hippocampi have 2D radial distance measures and the two parts of hippocampi have been found to be asymmetric (Pedraza et al., 2004), we apply our method to the left and right hippocampi separately.

We use the default method (Gabriel et al., 2002) of Haploview (Barrett et al., 2005) and PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) to form linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks. Previous studies report that about 50 genetic variants are associated with AD; see the review in Sims et al. (2020) for details. This provides support for our assumption that |M1|&lt;n (n = 566). On the other hand, a genome-wide association analysis of 19,629 individuals by Zhao et al. (2019) shows that 57 genetic variants are associated with the left hippocampal volumes and 54 are associated with the right hippocampal volumes. This provides support for our assumption that |M2|&lt;n. Therefore, we apply our blockwise joint screening procedure on those SNPs on each part of hippocampal outcome Yi and exposure Zi marginally. We choose the thresholds γ1,n, γ2,n, γ3,n and γ4,n such that |M^block|=2⌊n/log(n)⌋=178. In Table S1 of the supplementary material, we list the top 20 SNPs corresponding to left and right hippocampi, respectively. As suggested by one referee, we plot similar figures as the Manhattan plot for M^1∗, M^1block,∗, M^2 and M^2block in Figure S1 of the supplementary material, where genomic coordinates are displayed along the x-axis, the y-axis represents the magnitude of |β^lM|,β^lblock,M,‖C^lM‖op and C^lblock,M and the horizontal dashed line represents the threshold values γ1,n, γ2,n, γ3,n, and γ4,n, respectively.

From Table S1 and Figure S1, one can see that there are quite a few important SNPs for both hippocampi. For example, the top SNP is the rs429358 from the 19th chromosome. This SNP is a C/T single-nucleotide variant (snv) variation in the APOE gene. It is also one of the two SNPs that define the well-known APOE alleles, the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (Kim et al., 2009). In addition, a great portion of the SNPs in Table S1 has been found to be strongly associated with Alzheimer’s. These include rs10414043 (Du et al., 2018), an A/G snv variation in the APOC1 gene; rs7256200 (Takei et al., 2009), an A/G snv variation in the APOC1 gene; rs73052335 (Zhou et al., 2018), an A/C snv variation in the APOC1 gene; rs769449 (Chung et al., 2014), an A/G snv variation in the APOE gene; rs157594 (Hao et al., 2017), a G/T snv variation; rs56131196 (Gao et al., 2016), an A/G snv variation in the APOC1 gene; rs111789331 (Gao et al., 2016), an A/T snv variation; and rs4420638 (Coon et al., 2007), an A/G snv variation in the APOC1 gene.

Among those SNPs that have been found to be associated with Alzheimer’s, some of them are also directly associated with hippocampi. For example, Zhou et al. (2020) revealed that the SNPs rs10414043, rs73052335 and rs769449 are among the top SNPs that have significant genetic effects on the volumes of both left and right hippocampi. Guo et al. (2019) identified the SNP rs56131196 to be associated with hippocampal shape.

We then perform our second-step estimation procedure for each part of the hippocampi. Here XM^ denotes the SNPs selected in the screening step, the population stratification (top five principal components of the whole genome data) and the five clinical measures (age, gender, education length, baseline ICV and baseline diagnosis status), and Z denotes the left/right hippocampal surface image matrix. To visualize the results, we map the estimates B^ corresponding to each part of the hippocampus onto a representative hippocampal surface and plot it in Figure 3(a). We have also plotted the hippocampal subfield (Apostolova et al., 2006) in Figure 3(b). Here Cornu Ammonis region 1 (CA1), Cornu Ammonis region 2 (CA2) and Cornu Ammonis region 3 (CA3) are a strip of pyramidal neurons within the hippocampus proper. CA1 is the top portion, named as “regio superior of Cajal” (Blackstad et al., 1970), which consists of small pyramidal neurons. Within the lower portion (regio inferior of Cajal), which consists of larger pyramidal neurons, there are a smaller area called CA2 and a larger area called CA3. The cytoarchitecture and connectivity of CA2 and CA3 are different. The subiculum is a pivotal structure of the hippocampal formation, positioned between the entorhinal cortex and the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus proper (for a complete review, see Dudek et al. 2016).

From the plots, we can see that all the 15, 000 entries of B^ corresponding to both hippocampi are negative. This implies that the radial distance of each pixel of both hippocampi is negatively associated with the ADAS-13 score, which depicts the severity of behavioral deficits. The subfields with strongest associations are mostly CA1 and subiculum. Existing literature (Apostolova et al., 2010) has found that as Alzheimer’s disease progresses, it first affects CA1 and subiculum subregions and later CA2 and CA3 subregions. This can partially explain why the shapes of CA1 and subiculum may have stronger associations with ADAS-13 scores compared to CA2 and CA3 subregions.

We examine the effect size of the whole hippocampal shape by evaluating the term 〈Zi,B^〉. Specifically, we calculate the proportion of variance explained by imaging covariates as follows: R2=∑i=1n(yi−y¯)2−∑i=1n(yi−y¯−〈Zi,B^〉)2∑i=1n(yi−y¯)2.

Our results show that the shape of the left hippocampi and that of the right one account for 5.83% and 4.71% of the total variations in behavior deficits, respectively. Such effect sizes are quite large compared with those for polygenic risk scores in genetics. In addition, we perform permutation test to test whether the R2 statistic is significant. In particular, we randomly permutate the (Y1, …, Yn}, denoted by {Yi*,…,Yn*}, and we then apply our estimation procedure based on (Xi,Zi,Yi*), obtain B^∗, and calculate (R2)*. We repeat this for 1,000 times and and we obtain the {(R(k)2)∗,1≤k≤1000}, which mimics the null distribution. Finally, the p-value can be calculated as 11000∑k=110001{(R(k)2)∗≥R2}. The p-values for both hippocampi are less than 0.001, suggesting that the R2’s are significantly different from zero.

We also conduct sensitivity analysis by varying the relative sizes of M^1* and M^2 in the joint screening procedure. The estimates B^s are similar among different choices of |M^1*| and |M^2|; see supplementary material Section S5 for details. In addition, we repeated our analysis on the 391 MCI and AD subjects. We have similar findings that the radial distances of each pixel of both hippocampi are mostly negatively associated with the ADAS-13 score. And the subfields with strongest associations are mostly CA1 and subiculum; see supplementary material Section S6 for details. As suggested by one referee, we have performed the SNP-imaging-outcome mediation analysis proposed by Bi et al. (2017); see Section S7 in the supplementary material for the detailed procedure. There is no evidence for the mediating relationship of SNP-imaging-outcome from our analysis.

5 Simulation studies

In this section, we perform simulation studies to evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed method. The dimension of covariates is set as s = 5000, and the exposure is a 64 × 64 matrix. The Xi∈Rs is independently generated from N(0, Σx), where Σx = (σx,ll′) has an autoregressive structure such that σx,ll'=ρ1|l−l'| holds for 1 ≤ l, l′ ≤ s with ρ1 = 0.5. Define B as a 64 × 64 image shown in Figure 4(a), and C a 64 × 64 image shown in Figure 4(b). For B, the black regions of interest (ROIs) are assigned value 0.0408 and white ROIs are assigned value 0. For C, the black ROIs are assigned value 0.0335 and white ROIs are assigned value 0. Further we set Cl = vl * C, where v1 = −1/3, v2 = −1, v3 = −3, v207 = −3, v208 = −1, v209 = −1/3, and vl = 0 for 4 ≤ l ≤ 206 and 210 ≤ l ≤ s. We set the parameters β1 = 3, β2 = 1, β3 = 1/3, β104 = 3, β105 = 1, β106 = 1/3, and βl = 0 for 4 ≤ l ≤ 103 and 107 ≤ l ≤ s. In this setting, we have C={1,2,3}, P={104,105,106}, I={207,208,209} and S={1…,5000}\{1,2,3,104,105,106,207,208,209}.

The random error vec(Ei) is independently generated from N(0, Σe), where we set the standard deviations of all elements in Ei to be σe = 0.2 and the correlation between Ei,jk and Ei,j’,k’ to be ρ2|j−j'|+|k−k'| for 1 ≤ j, k, j′, k′ ≤ 64 with ρ2 = 0.5. The random error ϵi is generated independently from N(0, σ2), where we consider σ = 1 or 0.5. The Yi’s and Zi’s are generated from models (1) and (2). We consider three different sample sizes n = 200, 500 and 1000.

5.1 Simulation for screening

We perform our screening procedure (denoted by “joint”) and report the coverage proportion of M1, which is defined as |M^∩M1||M1|, where the size of the selected set |M^| changes from 1 to 100. In addition, we report the coverage proportion for each of the confounding and precision variables, i.e. each of the j’s in the set M1={1,2,3,104,105,106}. All the coverage proportions are averaged over 100 Monte Carlo runs.

To control the changing size of the |M^|, we first set |M^1*|=|M^2|=1 by specifying appropriate γ^1,n and γ^2,n. Then we sequentially add two variables, one to M^1* by increasing γ^1,n and one to M^2 by increasing γ^2,n, until |M^| reaches 100. Note that we always keep |M^1*|=|M^2| in the procedure. We may not obtain all the sizes between 1 and 100 because |M^| may increase by at most 2. Therefore, for those sizes that cannot be reached, we use a linear interpolation to estimate the coverage proportion of M1 by using the closest two end points.

We compare the proposed joint screening procedure to two competing procedures. The first is an outcome screening procedure that selects set M^1*. For fair comparison, we let |M^1*| range from 1 to 100. The second is an intersection screening procedure, that selects set M^∩=M^1*∩M^2. We let |M^∩| range from 1 to 100, while keeping |M^1*|=|M^2|. Similarly, for those specific sizes that |M^*| cannot reach, we use linear interpolation to estimate the coverage proportions. We plot the results for (n, s, σ) = (200, 5000, 1) in Figure 5. The remaining results for (n, s, σ) = (200, 5000, 0.5), (500, 5000, 1), (500, 5000, 0.5), (1000, 5000, 1) and (1000, 5000, 0.5) can be found in Figures S4 – S8 of the supplementary material.

From the plots, one can see that both the “intersection” and “outcome” screening methods miss the confounder X3 with a very high probability even as the size of the selected set approaches 100. In contrast, our method can select X3 with high probability when |M^| is relatively small. For confounders X1 and X2, all three methods perform similarly. For the precision variables, the “outcome” method and our “joint” method perform similarly in covering these variables, while the “intersection” performs badly. Combining the results, one can see that our method performs the best as our method selects all the confounders and precision variables with high probabilities. In addition, we find that the coverage proportion of our method increases when the sample size increases, which validates the sure independence screening property developed in Section S9 of the supplementary material.

5.2 Simulation for estimation

In this part, we evaluate the performance of our estimation procedure after the first-step screening. For the size of M^ in the screening step, we set |M^|=⌊n/log(n)⌋. We compare the proposed estimate with the oracle estimate, which is calculated by adjusting for the ideal adjustment set including only confounders and precision variables as X and then estimate B by using the optimization (3) without imposing the l1-regularization. We report the mean squared errors (MSEs) for β and B defined as ‖β−β^‖22 and ‖B−B^‖F2, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the average MSEs of the proposed and oracle estimates for β and B among 100 Monte Carlo runs when n = 200, 500 and 1000. We can see that the MSE decreases as the sample size increases. In terms of the primary parameter of interest B, the proposed estimate is close to the oracle estimate.

We plot the 2D map of B^ based on the average of 100 Monte Carlo runs in Figure 6(c). For comparison, we also plot the corresponding average oracle estimate B^oracle in Figure 6(b) and the true B in Figure 6(a). One can see that the proposed method recovers the signal pattern reasonably well.

We also report the sensitivity and specificity of the estimates in Section S8.1 of the supplementary material. We have found that although the proposed method may not remove all of the instrumental variables, eliminating even just some of the instruments greatly reduces the MSEs of both β and B, compared to the method where we do not impose l1-regularization on β in the second-step estimation.

5.3 Screening and estimation using blockwise joint screening

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is a ubiquitous biological phenomenon where genetic variants present a strong blockwise correlation (LD) structure (Wall and Pritchard, 2003). In Section 3.4, we propose the blockwise joint screening procedure to appropriately utilize LD blocks’ structural information. The performance of this procedure is illustrated in this section using an adapted simulation based on the settings of Dehman et al. (2015).

For i = 1, …, n, Xi∈Rs is independently generated from an s-dimensional multivariate distribution N(0, Σx), where Σx = (σx,ll′) is block-diagonal. If l ≠ l′ are in the same block, the covariance σx,ll′ = 0.4, else σx,ll′ = 0, and the diagonal elements σx,lls are all set to 1. We set Xij to 0, 1 or 2 according to whether Xij &lt; d1, d1 ≤ Xij ≤ d2, or Xij &gt; d2, where d1 and d2 are thresholds determined for producing a given minor allel frequency (MAF). For instance, choosing d1 = Φ−1(1 – 6MAF/5) and d2 = Φ−1(1 – 2MAF/5), where Φ is the c.d.f. of standard normal distribution, corresponds to a given fixed MAF. In order to generate more realistic MAF distributions, we simulate genotype Xij, where the MAF for each j is uniformly sampled between 0.05 and 0.5 (Dehman et al., 2015).

Adapting the simulation setting of Section 5.1 according to Dehman et al. (2015), we set s = 5000, with 300 blocks of covariates of size 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 52 replicated 50 times. We perform 100 Monte Carlo runs, and the ordering of the block is drawn at random for each run. The settings for B and C remain the same as before: B is as in Figure 5(a), and C is as in Figure 5(b). Further we set Cl = vl * C, where v1 = −1/3, v2 = −1, v3 = −3, v207 = −3, v208 = −1, v209 = −1/3, and vl = 0 for 4 ≤ l ≤ 206 and 210 ≤ l ≤ s. We set β1 = 3, β2 = 1, β3 = 1/3, β104 = 3, β105 = 1, β106 = 1/3, βj = 1/4 for j∆PLD, and βl = 0 otherwise. Here PLD is a randomly selected block consisting of K consecutive indices from {210, 211, …, s}, where K ∈ {2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 52}. We have C={1,2,3}, P={104,105,106}∪PLD, I={207,208,209} and S={1…,5000}\(C∪P∪I). The other settings are the same as the ones in Section 5.1.

We consider three different sample sizes n = 200, 500 and 1000. We first perform the screening procedure and report the coverage proportion of M1=C∪P. We also report the coverage proportion for each of the confounding and precision variables. In particular, we include the screening results, in which s = 5000, σ = 1, n = 200, 500, 1000, and K = 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 52, can be found in Figures S23 – S40 of the supplementary material.

From the plots, one can see that the blockwise joint screening method (blue dotted line) selects PLD and M1 with higher probability compared with the original joint screening method (green solid line). Based on the results, the blockwise joint screening method can better utilize precision variables with block structures to select M1.

In addition, we evaluate the performance of the two proposed estimation procedure after the first-step screening. For the sizes of M^ and M^block in the screening step, we set |M^|=⌊n/log(n)⌋ for the original joint screening procedure, and |M^block|=2⌊n/log(n)⌋ for the blockwise joint screening procedure. We report the average MSEs for β and B when (n, s, σ) = (200, 5000, 1) in Table 2. The complete results, in which s = 5000, σ = 1, n = 200, 500, 1000, and K = 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 52, can be found in Table S7 of the supplementary material.

In summary, the blockwise joint screening estimate outperforms the original joint screening estimate when the sample size n is small or block size of precision variables K is large. For the rest of the scenarios, there are no significant differences between the two methods.

In the supplementary material, we assess the variable screening results for various sparsity levels of instrumental variables in Section S8.2, evaluate the performance of our estimation procedure for different covariances of exposure errors in Section S8.3, and assess the sensitivity of the choices for different sizes of M^1* and M^2 in Section S8.4.

6 Discussion

This paper aims at mapping the complex GIC pathway for AD. The unique features of the hippocampal morphometry surface measure data motivate us to develop a computationally efficient two-step screening and estimation procedure, which can select biomarkers among more than 6 million observed covariates and estimate the conditional association simultaneously. If there was no unmeasured confounding, then the conditional association we estimate corresponds to the causal effect. This is, however, not the case in the ADNI study because we have unmeasured confounders such as Aβ and tau protein levels. To control for unmeasured confounding and estimate the causal effect, one possible approach is to use the generic variants as potential instrumental variables (e.g. Lin et al., 2015).

There are a number of other important directions for future work. Firstly, the vast majority of AD, known as “polygenic AD”, is influenced by the actions and interactions of multiple genetic variants simultaneously, likely in concert with non-genetic factors, such as environmental exposures and lifestyle choices among many others (Bertram and Tanzi, 2020). Therefore, various types of interaction effects, such as genetic-genetic and imaging-genetic, could be incorporated into the outcome generating model (1). However, this may significantly increase the computation as the dimension of genetic relevant covariates will increase from 6, 087, 205 to more than 90 billion covariates, if we add all the possible imaging-genetics interaction terms. One may consider interaction screening procedures (Hao and Zhang, 2014) as the first-step. Secondly, this study simply removes observations with missingness. Accommodation of missing exposure, confounders and outcome under the proposed model framework is of great practical value and worth further investigation. Thirdly, baseline diagnosis status is an important effect modifier, as the effect of hippocampus shape on behavioral measures can be different across the CN/MCI/AD groups. However, the relatively small sample size in the ADNI study does not allow us to conduct a reliable subgroup analysis. The subgroup analyses are pertinent for further exploration when a larger sample size is available. Fourthly, in the ADNI dataset, there are longitudinal ADAS-13 scores observed at different months as well as other longitudinal behavioral scores obtained from Mini-Mental State Examination and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, which can provide a more comprehensive characterization of the behavioral deficits. Integrating these different scores as a multivariate longitudinal outcome to improve the estimation of the conditional association requires substantial effort for future research. Lastly, one could consider incorporating information from other brain regions. For instance, an entorhinal tau may exist on episodic memory decline through other brain regions, such as the medial temporal lobe (Maass et al., 2018).
