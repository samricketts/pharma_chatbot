Synapse or dendritic spine loss is the strongest correlate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and neurofibrillary tangles, but not amyloid-β plaques, associate more closely with transition to mild cognitive impairment. Yet, how dendritic spine architecture is affected by hyperphosphorylated tau is still an ongoing question. To address this, we combined cell and biochemical analyses of the Tau P301S mouse line (PS19). Individual pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were targeted for iontophoretic microinjection of fluorescent dye, followed by high-resolution confocal microscopy and 3D morphometry analysis. In the hippocampus, PS19 mice and non-transgenic (NTG) littermates displayed equivalent spine density at 6 and 9 months, but both genotypes exhibited age-related thin spine loss. PS19 mice exhibited significant increases in synaptic tau protein levels and mean dendritic spine head diameter with age. This suggests that CA1 pyramidal neurons in PS19 mice may undergo spine remodeling in response to tau accumulation and age. In the mPFC, spine density was similar among PS19 mice and NTG littermates at 6 and 9 months, but age-related reductions in synaptic tau levels were observed among PS19 mice. Collectively, these studies reveal brain region-specific changes in dendritic spine density and morphology in response to age and the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau in the PS19 mouse line.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Synapse or dendritic spine loss correlates more strongly with cognitive impairment than Aβ plaques or NFTs in AD (DeKosky and Scheff, 1990, Terry et al., 1991, Boros et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2018). Older studies of 11C-Pittsburgh compound B imaging suggested that only 13% of cognitively normal individuals that are positive for Aβ will transition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD (Rowe et al., 2013), whereas recent positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tau indicates a stronger correlation of tau changes with cognitive impairment and transition to MCI (Hanseeuw et al., 2019). These findings highlight the need to better understand how changes in tau influence synapses and dendritic spines.

Most excitatory synapses occur on dendritic spines, which are actin-rich protrusions on dendrites (Bertling and Hotulainen, 2017). Spine morphology is highly dynamic and inextricably linked to synaptic activity and strength (Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001, Matsuzaki et al., 2004, Hayashi and Majewska, 2005, Bertling et al., 2016, Bertling and Hotulainen, 2017, Efimova et al., 2017, Pfeiffer et al., 2018). Dendritic spines are generally classified on the basis of their three-dimensional morphology as stubby, mushroom, or thin (Peters and Kaiserman-Abramof, 1970, Chang and Greenough, 1984, Harris et al., 1992, Hering and Sheng, 2001). Stubby spines are hypothesized to be transitional structures that may enlarge to mushroom spines, which are more stable structures with a wide head and thin neck. Thin spines are dynamic, and lack the wide, stable head indicative of mushroom spines. Notably, dendritic spine density in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is inversely correlated with Braak stage in AD, suggesting that tau pathology may be associated with spine loss (Boros et al., 2017, Boros et al., 2019).

Under normal conditions, tau is primarily localized to axons and promotes formation and stabilization of microtubules; however, in AD, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and mislocalizes to somatodendritic compartments (Avila et al., 2004, Ittner et al., 2010, Zempel et al., 2010). How dendritic spine morphology is affected by tau mislocalization in AD is still unclear. Here, we used the Tau P301S mouse line (PS19), a commonly used tauopathy model with several AD-relevant features (Yoshiyama et al., 2007, Takeuchi et al., 2011, Briggs et al., 2017, Chalermpalanupap et al., 2018, Dejanovic et al., 2018), to test whether hyperphosphorylated tau is associated with detrimental changes in dendritic spine morphology in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex and if these dendritic events correspond to tau accumulation in synaptic compartments.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCESDURES

Animals

All experimental procedures were performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Tau P301S (Line PS19) mice were purchased from the Jackson Lab (B6;C3-Tg(Prnp-MAPT*P301S)PS19Vle/J, stock #008169) and bred with non-transgenic (NTG) mice on a B6C3 background. The PS19 mouse line overexpresses 1N4R human tau with the frontotemporal dementia-associated P301S mutation under the control of the mouse prion protein promoter (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). PS19 mice and NTG littermate controls were aged to 6 and 9 months. Mice were housed 5-7 per cage on a 12 h light/dark cycle and had ad libitum access to food and water. Both male and female mice were used.

Lucifer Yellow Microinjections and Spine Morphometry Analysis

Perfusions and Brain Tissue Processing

For perfusions for iontophoretic microinjections, mice were anesthetized with Fatal Plus (Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Catalog #0298-9373-68) and transcardially perfused with cold 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich, Catalog #P6148) for 1 min, followed by 4% PFA with 0.125% glutaraldehyde (Fisher Scientific, Catalog #BP2547) for 10 min. A peristaltic pump (Cole Parmer) was used for consistent administration of PFA. Immediately following perfusion, each brain was extracted and drop-fixed in 4% PFA with 0.125% glutaraldehyde for 8-12 h at 4°C. Following fixation, brains were coronally sliced in 250 μm thick sections using a Leica vibratome (VT1000S, speed 70, frequency 7). Brains were sliced in 0.1 M PB and stored at 4°C, one slice per well in a 48-well plate, in 0.1 M PB with 0.1% sodium azide (Fisher, Catalog #BP922I).

Iontophoretic Microinjections

Iontophoretic microinjections were performed based on previously described methods (Greathouse et al., 2018, Henderson et al., 2019). A Nikon Eclipse FN1 upright microscope with a 10X objective and a 40X water objective was placed on an air table. The tissue chamber used was assembled in the lab and consisted of a 50x75 mm plastic base with a 60x10 mm petri dish epoxied to the base. A platinum wire was attached so that the ground wire could be connected to the bath by an alligator clip. The negative terminal of the electric current source was connected to a glass micropipette filled with 2 μl of 8% Lucifer yellow dye (ThermoFisher, Catalog#L453). Micropipettes (A-M Systems, Catalog #603500) with highly tapered tips were pulled fresh the day of use. A manual micromanipulator was secured on the air table with magnets that provided a 45° angle for injection. Brain slices were placed into a small petri dish containing 1X PBS and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min at room temperature. After incubation in DAPI, slices were placed on dental wax, and then a piece of filter paper was used to adhere the tissue. The filter paper was then transferred to the tissue chamber filled with 1X PBS, and weighted down for stability. The 10X objective was used to visualize advancement of the tip of the micropipette in X, Y, and Z planes until the tip was just a few micrometers above the tissue. The 40X objective was then used while advancing the tip into layer 2/3 of the mPFC or the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Once the microelectrode contacted a neuron, 2 nA of negative current were applied for 5 min to fill the neuron with Lucifer yellow. After 5 min, the current was turned off and the micropipette was removed from the neuron. Neuron impalement within the mPFC and CA1 occurred randomly in a blind manner. If the entire neuron did not fill with dye after penetration, the electrode was removed and the neuron was not used for analysis. Multiple neurons were injected in each hemisphere of the mPFC and hippocampus of each animal. After injection, the filter paper containing the tissue was moved back into the chamber containing 1X PBS. The tissue was carefully lifted off the paper and placed on a glass slide with two 125 μm spacers (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Catalog #70327-20S). Excess PBS was carefully removed with a Kimwipe, and the tissue was air-dried for 1 min. One drop of Vectashield (Vector Labs, Catalog #H1000) was added directly to the slice, and the coverslip (Warner, Catalog #64-0716) was added and sealed with nail polish. Injected tissue was stored at 4°C in the dark.

Confocal Microscopy

Confocal microscopy was used to capture images of Lucifer yellow-filled dendrites on layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the mPFC and pyramidal neurons in CA1 of the hippocampus. Our methods are based on previously described methods (Greathouse et al., 2018, Henderson et al., 2019), and are detailed as follows. Imaging was performed by a blinded experimenter on a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) Ti2 C2 confocal microscope, using a Plan Apo 60X/1.40 NA oil-immersion objective. Three-dimensional z-stacks were obtained of secondary dendrites from dye-impregnated neurons that met the following criteria: (1) within 80 μm working distance of microscope, (2) relatively parallel with the surface of the coronal section, (3) no overlap with other branches, (4) located between 40 μm and 120 μm from the soma. Nikon Elements 4.20.02 image capture software was used to acquire z-stacks with a step size of 0.1 μm, image size of 1024 x 512 px, zoom of 4.8x, line averaging of 4x, and acquisition rate of 1 frame/sec.

Dendritic Spine Morphometry

Confocal z-stacks of dendrites were deconvolved using Huygens Deconvolution System (16.05, Scientific Volume Imaging, the Netherlands). The following settings were used: deconvolution algorithm: GMLE; maximum iterations: 10; signal to noise ratio: 15; quality: 0.003. Deconvolved images were saved in .tif format. Deconvolved image stacks were imported into Neurolucida 360 (2.70.1, MBF Biosciences, Williston, Vermont) for dendritic spine analysis. For each image, the semi-automatic directional kernel algorithm was used to trace the dendrite. The outer 5-10 μm of each dendrite were excluded from the trace. All assigned points were examined to ensure they matched the dendrite diameter and position in X, Y, and Z planes, and were adjusted if necessary. Dendritic spine reconstruction was performed automatically using a voxel-clustering algorithm, with the following parameters: outer range = 5 μm, minimum height = 0.3 μm, detector sensitivity = 80%, minimum count = 8 voxels. The semi-automatically identified spines were examined to ensure that all identified spines were real, and that all existing spines had been identified. If necessary, spines were added by increasing the detector sensitivity. Additionally, merge and slice tools were used to correct errors made in the morphology and backbone points of each spine. Each dendritic spine was automatically classified as a dendritic filopodium, thin spine, stubby spine, or mushroom spine based on constant parameters (Greathouse et al., 2018, Henderson et al., 2019).

Three-dimensional dendrite reconstructions were exported to Neurolucida Explorer (2.70.1, MBF Biosciences, Williston, Vermont) for branched structure analysis, which provides measurements of dendrite length; number of spines; spine length; number of thin, stubby, and mushroom spines, and filopodia; spine head diameter; and spine neck diameter, among other measurements. The output was exported to Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA). Spine density was calculated as the number of spines per 10 μm of dendrite length.

Values per animal were calculated by averaging the values for all dendrites corresponding to that animal. To assess apical and basal dendrites separately, values for either apical or basal dendrites were averaged per animal. For an animal to be included in statistical analyses for dendritic spine density and morphology a minimum of 100 μm of dendrite length had to be reconstructed and analyzed; thus, there were instances where an animal was not included in the analysis of apical dendrites, but was included in the collective analysis of all dendrites for that animal. The number of neurons, dendrites, dendritic length, and spines analyzed per animal are provided in Table 1.

Immunohistochemistry and Image Processing

Perfusions and Brain Tissue Processing

For immunohistochemistry, mice were anesthetized with Fatal Plus and transcardially perfused with cold 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 min. Immediately following perfusion, each brain was extracted and dissected into two hemispheres. The left hemisphere was placed in 0.1 M PB with 0.1% sodium azide and stored at 4°C.

Left hemispheres were coronally sliced in 50 μm thick sections using a Leica vibratome (VT1000S, speed 70, frequency 7). Brains were sliced in 0.1 M PB and stored at −20°C in cryoprotectant solution with 0.01% sodium azide (300 g sucrose, 500 mL 0.1 M phosphate buffer, 300 mL ethylene glycol, 0.1 g sodium azide, bring to 1 L with phosphate buffer).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) &amp; Antibodies

50 μm thick sections containing prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were washed in 1X PBS on a shaker for 10 min at room temperature. Slices were then washed in 1X PBS-T (250 μL Triton X-100 + 1 L 1X PBS). Next, slices were incubated in blocking buffer (20 mL 10X PBS, 10 mL normal goat serum, 10 mL normal horse serum, 2 g bovine serum albumin, 0.1 g saponin, in 500 mL dH2O) for 1 hour at room temperature. Slices were washed in PBS-T for 10 min at room temperature, then placed in primary antibody (NeuN and AT8 at 1:500) overnight at 4°C on a shaker. The next day, slices were washed in PBS-T five times for 15 min at room temperature, then incubated in secondary antibody (1:100) in the dark on a shaker for 1 hour at room temperature. Slices were then washed in PBS-T three times for 15 min at room temperature, followed by one wash in PBS for 15 min, then one wash in PBS + DAPI for 15 min. Finally, slices were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium, sealed with clear nail polish, and stored at 4°C.

Primary antibodies: NeuN Rabbit Polyclonal Antibody (Invitrogen, Catalog #PA5-78499) and Phospho-Tau (Ser202, Thr205) Monoclonal Antibody (AT8) (Invitrogen, Catalog #MN1020). Secondary antibodies: AlexaFluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Life Technologies, Catalog #A21202) and AlexaFluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Life Technologies, Catalog #A11037).

Confocal Microscopy

Confocal microscopy was also used to capture images of slices following immunohistochemistry. Imaging was performed on a Nikon Ti2 C2 confocal microscope, using a Plan Fluor 20X/0.75 NA air objective. Three-dimensional z-stacks were obtained of hippocampal CA1 and layer 2/3 mPFC. Nikon Elements 4.20.02 image capture software was used to acquire z-stacks with a step size of 0.85 μm, image size of 1024 x 1024 px, and acquisition rate of 1 frame/sec. Subsequently, 20X images with a zoom of 3x were acquired, with all other imaging parameters remaining the same.

Image Processing

Following IHC image acquisition, post-image processing was performed using Fiji ImageJ. Each image file was a two channel z-stack. Additionally, due to the thickness of the slices used, each side of the slice was stained while the center of the slice remained unstained. The Split Channels function was used to separate the two channels. The channel corresponding to the NeuN staining was used to determine which stacks would be used to generate maximum intensity projections with the Z Project function. Two maximum intensity projections were created per image, corresponding to each side of the slice. The same stacks were used to generate maximum intensity projections on the channel corresponding to AT8 staining. Brightness was adjusted for each channel separately, then the Merge Channels function was used to overlay the NeuN and AT8 images.

Biochemical Analysis of Synaptic Tau Levels

Perfusions

Mice were anesthetized with Fatal Plus and transcardially perfused with cold 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 min. Immediately following perfusion, each brain was extracted and dissected into two hemispheres. The right hemisphere was flash frozen in 2-methylbutane (Sigma, Catalog #320404), placed on dry ice, and stored at −80°C.

Synaptosomal Fractionation

Flash-frozen hemispheres were sub-dissected to obtain the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Synaptosomal fractionation was performed, based on previously described methods (Hallett et al., 2008, Greathouse et al., 2018). Samples were thawed in 75 μL of ice cold TEVP buffer + 320 mM sucrose and homogenized. The initial homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 x g at 4°C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 8 M urea buffer and saved as an insoluble fraction. 30 μL of the supernatant was saved as a whole homogenate, and the remainder was centrifuged for 15 min at 9200 x g at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was saved, and the pellet was resuspended in 60 μL of TEVP buffer + 35.6 mM sucrose, vortexed, and left on ice for 30 min. Next, the pellet was centrifuged for 30 min at 21,130 x g at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was saved, and the pellet was rinsed in 100 μL of TEVP buffer (10 mM Tris base, 1 mM Na3VO4, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) and resuspended in 30 μL of TEVP buffer, resulting in the synaptosomal fraction. All obtained fractions were stored at −80°C.

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs)

ELISA kits were used to detect levels of total human tau (ThermoFisher, Catalog #KHB0041), and human tau phosphorylated at S199 (ThermoFisher, Catalog #KHB7041), T231 (ThermoFisher, Catalog #KHB8051), and S396 (ThermoFisher, Catalog #KHB7031). Protein concentrations for synaptosome, whole homogenate, and insoluble fractions were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce). For synaptosome and insoluble fraction ELISAs, samples were run in duplicate and 20 μg of protein were loaded per well. Assays were conducted based on the protocol provided with each kit, with the exception of the chromogen incubation times, which were modified to avoid saturation: total tau (1 min 45 sec), pS199 tau (18 min), pT231 (30 min, as recommended), and pS396 tau (26 min). For whole homogenate ELISAs, 20 μg of protein were loaded per well. Assays were conducted based on the protocol provided with each kit, with the exception of the chromogen incubation times, which were modified to avoid saturation: total tau (1 min 45 sec), pS199 tau (18 min), pT231 (10 min 30 sec), and pS396 tau (26 min). Separate standard curves were generated for the modified incubation times. ELISAs were read at 450 nm on a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices).

Western Blotting &amp; Antibodies

Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Twenty-five micrograms of protein per sample were loaded into each well. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Images were captured using an Odyssey Image Station (Li-Cor), and band intensities were quantified using Odyssey Application Software (3.0, Li-Cor).

Primary antibodies: PSD95 (D27E11) XP Rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling, Catalog #3450), Synaptophysin (D35E4) Rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling, Catalog #5461), Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (6C5) Mouse mAb (MilliporeSigma, Catalog #MAB374). Secondary antibodies: AlexaFluor 680 goat anti-rabbit (Life Technologies, Catalog #A21109) and IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse (Li-Cor, Catalog #926-32210).

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 8.4.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used for comparison of dendritic spine morphometry between groups. Unpaired t-tests with Holm’s correction were used for comparisons of tau levels between 6 mo and 9 mo PS19 mice. For instances where the assumption of homogeneity of variance was not met, Welch’s t-test was used.

RESULTS

Hyperphosphorylated tau at 6 and 9 months in PS19 mice

NFT-like tau inclusions have been reported in 6 month old PS19 mice, in both the hippocampus and prelimbic prefrontal cortex, with neuronal loss becoming evident at 9 months of age (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). To assess our colony, we performed IHC on PS19 mice and NTG littermates at 6 and 9 months. The vast majority of NeuN+ neurons displayed robust hyperphosphorylated AT8+ tau (Ser202/Thr205) in CA1 of the hippocampus and layers 2/3 of the prelimbic prefrontal cortex in PS19 mice at 6 and 9 months (Figs. 1 and 2). NTG littermates showed little to no AT8 staining in the hippocampus at 6 and 9 months (Fig. 1). However, AT8+ neurons in the prefrontal cortex were observed from 9 month old NTG littermates, suggesting that an increase in phosphorylation of endogenous tau occurs with age in the prefrontal cortex, but not CA1 (Fig. 2). Additionally, both NTG and PS19 mice exhibited a noticeable decline in NeuN+ cells in the prefrontal cortex at 9 months compared to 6 months (Fig. 2). Having confirmed the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau, we explored dendritic spine density and morphology as well as synaptic tau levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex from 6 and 9 month old animals.

PS19 mice exhibit increased spine head diameter with age in the hippocampus

We examined whether spine density and morphology in the hippocampus of 6 and 9 month old PS19 mice differed from age- and sex-matched NTG littermate controls. Individual pyramidal neurons in CA1 of the hippocampus were targeted for iontophoretic microinjection of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow, followed by high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy, deconvolution, and neuronal three-dimensional reconstructions for morphometry analysis (Fig. 3). Numbers of mice, neurons, dendrites, and spines are provided in Table 1.

Both NTG and PS19 mice exhibited reductions in dendritic spine density with age, driven by decreased thin spine density (Fig. 4, A-B). To determine whether dendritic spine changes existed on polar dendritic arbors, we separated spines based on whether they were sampled from apical or basal dendrites. There was no difference in overall spine density or the densities of each spine type on apical dendrites (Fig. 4, C-D). However, basal dendrites from 9 month old animals had lower dendritic spine densities, due to a reduction in thin spine density (Fig. 4, E-F). Next, we examined dendritic spine length and head diameter. We observed no differences in dendritic spine length between NTG and PS19 mice at either age, and observed no age-dependent effects (Fig. 4, G-I). However, PS19 mice exhibited an increase in dendritic spine head diameter with age on apical dendrites, basal dendrites, and all dendrites collectively (Fig. 4, J-L). Overall, there was no effect of P301S tau genotype on spine density, length, or head diameter in CA1 of the hippocampus at 6 months or 9 months of age. However, head diameter was greater among PS19 mice at 9 months compared to 6 months of age.

Synaptic human tau levels in the hippocampus of PS19 mice

Next, we examined whether human tau accumulated in synaptic compartments in the hippocampus of PS19 mice. To measure human tau levels, synaptosome fractions were isolated biochemically from the hippocampus of 6 and 9 month old PS19 mice. The synaptosome fractions are enriched for both presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins. Based on the very low levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) present, it is likely that the synaptosome fractions contained only minor amounts of proteins from other cellular compartments (Fig. 5, A-B). Levels of total human tau, as well as human tau phosphorylated at S199, T231, or S396, were quantified by ELISAs. The ELISAs are specific for human tau and do not measure endogenous murine tau, as indicated by the absence of signal in the NTG samples (Fig. 5, C-F). S199 and T231 are two of the earliest phosphorylated sites on tau in AD (Maurage et al., 2003, Luna-Munoz et al., 2007), and tau phosphorylated at S396 is found in paired helical filaments (Bramblett et al., 1993).

We observed a significant increase in total human tau levels in hippocampal synaptosomes from 6 to 9 months (Fig. 6A). However, levels of human tau phosphorylated at S199, T231, or S396 in synaptosomes were similar at 6 and 9 months (Fig. 6, B-D). Soluble whole homogenate and insoluble fractions were isolated from the same hippocampal tissue samples during the synaptosome fractionation process. Levels of total human tau in the soluble whole homogenate and the insoluble fraction, as well as human tau phosphorylated at S199, T231, and S396, were similar at 6 and 9 months in PS19 mice (Fig. 6, E-L). Collectively, we found that tau accumulates in synaptic compartments in the hippocampus from 6 to 9 months, and this corresponds with an increase in mean dendritic spine head diameter among CA1 pyramidal neurons.

Dendritic spine density and morphology in mPFC of PS19 mice

Next, we tested whether PS19 mice exhibit dendritic spine changes in the prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Individual pyramidal neurons in layers 2/3 of the mPFC from 6 and 9 month old PS19 mice and NTG littermates were targeted for iontophoretic microinjection of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow, followed by high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy and neuronal three-dimensional reconstructions for morphometry analysis (Fig. 7).

We observed a significant main effect of age on dendritic spine density in the mPFC, although this effect did not result from any specific differences between groups (Fig. 8A). Additionally, the densities of thin, stubby, and mushroom spines were similar between NTG and PS19 mice at 6 and 9 months of age (Fig. 8B). The overall spine density on apical dendrites, as well as the density of individual spine types, was similar between groups (Fig. 8, C-D). There was a significant main effect of genotype on basal spine density; however, none of the groups differed significantly from each other (Fig. 8E). The densities of thin, stubby, and mushroom spines on basal dendrites were similar between groups (Fig. 8F).

Spine length was similar between NTG and PS19 mice at 6 and 9 months of age (Fig. 8G). On apical dendrites, there was a significant main effect of genotype on spine length, although none of the groups differed significantly from each other (Fig. 8H). On basal dendrites, spine length was similar between groups (Fig. 8I). In the mPFC, mean dendritic spine head diameter was similar between groups for all dendrites combined, as well as for apical and basal dendrites separately (Fig. 8, J-L). Overall, we did not observe any robust effects of the P301S tau transgene on dendritic spine density or morphology on layer 2/3 mPFC pyramidal neurons at 6 or 9 months in comparison to NTG littermates.

Synaptic human tau levels in the prefrontal cortex of PS19 mice

To assess synaptic human tau levels, synaptosome fractions were isolated from the PFC of 6 and 9 month old PS19 mice. We observed a significant reduction of total human tau levels in PFC synaptosomes with age (Fig. 9A). No significant differences in levels of human tau phosphorylated at S199, T231, or S396 were detected (Fig. 9, B-D). Levels of human tau were quantified in soluble whole homogenate and insoluble fractions obtained from the same PFC samples during isolation of synaptosome fractions. PS19 mice displayed similar levels of total human soluble and insoluble tau, as well as human tau phosphorylated at S199, T231, or S396 at 6 and 9 months in the PFC (Fig. 9, E-L). Together, these results suggest that a reduction of total human tau levels in synaptosomes does not correlate with changes in dendritic spine density or morphology among layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the mPFC of PS19 mice.

DISCUSSION

The present study revealed that accumulation of hyperphosphorylated human tau in synaptosomes corresponded with an increase in mean dendritic spine head diameter with age in the hippocampus of PS19 mice. This contrasted with the lack of spine phenotypes in the mPFC, despite a decrease in synaptic human tau levels with age in the prefrontal cortex. Although behavioral and electrophysiological deficits have been reported in the PS19 line at the ages assessed in our study (Yoshiyama et al., 2007, Takeuchi et al., 2011, Briggs et al., 2017, Chalermpalanupap et al., 2018), we did not observe robust differences in spine density when PS19 mice were compared to NTG littermates. We hypothesize that this may be explained by the evolving idea that pathologic tau accumulation drives functional silencing of synapses without the physical collapse of dendritic structure.

In this study, we used confocal microscopy to capture z-stacks of fluorescent dendrites, then employed deconvolution to reduce light blur in the images, and finally reconstructed the dendrites in three dimensions using Neurolucida360. One limitation of this methodology is that confocal microscopy approaches have lower resolution than light-based super-resolution microscopy or electron microscopy. Therefore, confocal microscopy can yield inaccuracies with respect to spine identification, measurement, and classification. Non-super-resolution light microscopy-based methods fail to resolve short-necked spines and are more likely to fail to detect spines in the z-direction (Pfeiffer et al., 2018; Tønnesen et al., 2014). However, the combination of confocal laser scanning microscopy and deconvolution employed in this study improves the resolution of confocal z-stacks. Based on comparisons with serial section transmission electron microcopy studies, the protocol used here results in accurate measurements of dendritic spine length, volume, and density (Dumitriu et al., 2011). Absolute measurement of spine head diameter and neck diameter may be less reliable, especially if the true size of these structures lies at or below the resolution limit.

Another limitation of this approach is that every neuron sampled from PS19 mice may not express the P301S human tau transgene. Our immunohistochemistry on PS19 mice at 6 and 9 months of age demonstrated that the majority of NeuN+ cells in CA1 and the prefrontal cortex are overwhelmingly positive for AT8 staining (Figs. 1 and 2). While this does not rule out the possibility that neurons injected with Lucifer yellow had silenced the P301S tau transgene, it does seem likely that the vast majority of analyzed neurons did express the transgene and exhibited accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau.

In contrast to the findings herein, past studies reported synapse loss in PS19 mice (Yoshiyama et al., 2007, Crescenzi et al., 2014, Dejanovic et al., 2018). However, these studies relied on immunohistochemical staining of synaptic markers, which does not yield image resolution that is comparable to the methods employed here. Furthermore, synaptophysin, a presynaptic marker, was used for synapse quantification in two of the studies (Yoshiyama et al., 2007, Crescenzi et al., 2014), whereas our methods assess the postsynaptic dendritic spine. While the presence of dendritic spines is predominantly linked to the presence of presynaptic axon terminals, it is possible that axon terminal loss could precede spine degeneration, resulting in discrepancies between our study and others (Yoshiyama et al., 2007, Crescenzi et al., 2014). For instance, in a murine model of prion disease, electron microscopy revealed a selective loss of presynaptic compartments in CA3, while postsynaptic dendritic spines remained (Gray et al., 2009). Therefore, it is possible that pathologic tau drives presynaptic axon terminal loss, but not structural degeneration of postsynaptic spines in PS19 mice.

A new and evolving hypothesis is that pathologic tau drives functional silencing of synapses without the physical degeneration of dendritic structure. Mice expressing human wildtype tau or human tau with a P301L mutation have greater percentages of silent neurons, based on in vivo calcium imaging (Busche et al., 2019). Moreover, despite the lack of robust spine loss observed in this study, PS19 mice exhibit deficits in synaptic function, including impaired long-term potentiation in CA1 of the hippocampus (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). Our findings in the hippocampus support in vitro studies showing that hyperphosphorylated tau does not induce spine loss in primary hippocampal neuron cultures or organotypic slices (Shahani et al., 2006, Hoover et al., 2010, Miller et al., 2014). Hoover et al. (2010) revealed that cultured hippocampal neurons expressing P301L tau had deficits in synaptic transmission due to loss of surface α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, but no gross reductions in spine density. Thus, further studies are required to determine how mutant tau drives synaptic silencing without physical degeneration of the spine cytoskeleton in hippocampal neurons.

We observed that among hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in PS19 mice, mean dendritic spine head diameter increased from 6 to 9 months in the hippocampus. We hypothesize that these dendritic structures enlarge to accommodate the increasing amounts of tau in somatodendritic compartments. It is possible that these dendritic spine structural changes are a result of tau-mediated gain of function. Examples may include tau increasing Fyn kinase localization and nanoclustering in dendritic spines (Ittner et al., 2010, Padmanabhan et al., 2019) as well as possible increases in tau-actin interactions in dendritic spines (Frandemiche et al., 2014). Increased tau interactions with Fyn kinase and actin could promote tau association with other postsynaptic proteins, contributing to enlargement of dendritic spines.

There are reports in postmortem PFC of upregulation of both glutamatergic presynaptic boutons in MCI cases (Bell et al., 2007) and GluR2 AMPA receptor subunits in MCI and early AD cases (Williams et al., 2009). The increase in GluR2 AMPA receptor subunits would be expected to result in increased spine head diameter, which could explain our observations in PS19 hippocampal spines. However, this contrasts with the finding of reduced surface AMPA receptor expression in vitro (Hoover et al., 2010), as well as with the classic description of silent synapses lacking functional AMPA receptors. Thus, further work will be required to determine whether the increased spine head diameter in PS19 mice serves only to accommodate high levels of tau, or whether there are compensatory increases in neurotransmitter receptors at the spine head. Notably, in AD cases, dendritic and synaptic structural remodeling could represent compensatory plasticity responses during the transition from no cognitive impairment to MCI (Boros et al., 2017, Boros et al., 2019), and our data suggest these architectural changes could be driven by tau-related disease processes.

In contrast to increased synaptic tau and enlargement of dendritic structures in the hippocampus, synaptic tau levels declined with age in the PFC of PS19 mice, with no notable alterations in dendritic spine density or morphology. These differing observations may represent brain region-specific differences in response to tau accumulation. There are intrinsic differences in spine turnover between the hippocampus and cortical regions, with spines in the hippocampus exhibiting more rapid and frequent remodeling and turnover in comparison to cortical spines (Grutzendler et al., 2002, Trachtenberg et al., 2002, Holtmaat et al., 2005, Pfeiffer et al., 2018). Therefore, PFC neurons in PS19 mice may lack the necessary machinery to structurally remodel dendritic spines in response to tau accumulation, possibly due to cell type-specific differences in gene expression.

Tau, including phosphorylated tau, is present in presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments in the PS19 mouse model (Yoshiyama et al., 2007, Dejanovic et al., 2018, McInnes et al., 2018). As expected, we observed tau in synaptosome fractions. There were no measurable differences in levels of tau phosphorylated at S199, T231, or S396 in synaptosomes or insoluble fractions from PS19 mice at 6 months and 9 months of age by the methods employed herein. Given the evidence that soluble tau, rather than NFTs, is the pathologic tau species (Santacruz et al., 2005, Yoshiyama et al., 2007, Kopeikina et al., 2012, Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2012, Polydoro et al., 2014, Ghag et al., 2018), and the fact that NFT-like inclusions are already present in PS19 mice at 6 months (Yoshiyama et al., 2007), we may have selected time points at which it is too late to capture these changes.

In this study, we observed an increase in mean dendritic spine head diameter and synaptic tau protein levels with age in the hippocampus of PS19 mice. In the PFC, there were no changes in spine density or morphology, despite a reduction in synaptic tau. Our findings suggest that hyperphosphorylated tau does not drive robust dendritic spine degeneration in PS19 mice, and that there may be brain region-specific differences in dendritic spine remodeling in response to hyperphosphorylated tau.
