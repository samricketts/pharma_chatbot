Background

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a growing public health challenge. Prior research suggests that Non-Hispanic(NH) Whites (Whites), Non-Hispanic African Americans (African Americans), and Hispanics have differing risks for ADRD.

Objective

To examine the existence of Serious Psychological Distress (SPD) among Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics; to calculate the predicted probability of ADRD in Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics, and to decompose the differences among ADRD populations, quantifying the burden of higher SPD among African Americans and Hispanics, compared to Whites.

Data and Method

We use nationally representative data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2007-2015) to estimate the association between ADRD and race, ethnicity, and SPD. Using Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis, we estimate to what extent higher SPD among Hispanics and African Americans was associated with higher ADRD rates compared to Whites.

Results

After controlling for individuals’ demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and co-existing medical conditions, the presence of SPD was still significantly associated with a higher likelihood of having ADRD. The model predicted significantly higher likelihood of having ADRD among African Americans (7.1%) and Hispanics (5.7%) compared to Whites (4.5%). Higher rates of having SPD among African Americans explained 15% of White-Black difference and 40% of the White-Hispanic difference in ADRD rates, respectively.

Discussion and Conclusion

Our findings suggest a significant relationship between SPD and ADRD and that the burden of SPD was greater among African Americans and Hispanics with ADRD. Efficient screening using self-reported SPD, compared to simply using diagnoses codes of mental illness, may be more helpful to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in ADRD.

INTRODUCTION

People living with Alzheimer’s disease and other related dementias (ADRD) gradually and progressively lose the ability to meet their own needs, including the ability to perform activities of daily living,1 transportation and mobility tasks,2,3 social planning and interactions,4,5 and personal financial management,6 to name a few. Because of the burden of disease and the projected increase in Alzheimer’s prevalence as the Baby Boomer generation enters Medicare eligibility, the significance of ADRD in the healthcare policy context cannot be understated.7

It has previously been demonstrated that racial and ethnic minorities with ADRD experience disparities. African Americans and Hispanics are less likely to be taking antidementia medicines8 and discontinue antidementia medications at a higher rate.9 There may be a cultural preference among African American and Hispanic elders with ADRD to remain in a community setting,10 and ensuring support for their caregivers would be vital to this endeavor.11-14 The literature suggests that receipt of a diagnosis of ADRD may be complicated by cultural perceptions of normal aging among minorities,15,16 language barriers among Hispanics,17 and a lack of trust in the medical community among African Americans.18

Alzheimer’s diagnosis is associated with distress. Depression and anxiety have been considered as common co-existing conditions for ADRD. However, diagnosis rates of depression and anxiety are low among minorities compared to Whites, and this may be due to cultural preference, stigma, or lack of care access. The initial shock of diagnosis is followed by cognitive decline that includes agitation as a symptom. The extent to which African Americans or Hispanics experience greater serious psychological distress (SPD) in ADRD remains underexplored in the literature. SPD is defined in the literature as distress serious enough to warrant further evaluation by a health care professional.19

The objective of this study is to examine the existence of SPD among Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics; to calculate the predicted probability of ADRD in Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics; and to decompose the differences among ADRD populations, quantifying the burden of SPD, depression, and anxiety among African Americans and Hispanics, compared to Whites. The purpose of including the self-reported SPD measure in our study is to capture the significant under-diagnosis of mental illness among African American and Hispanic patients and to capture past 30-day subjective SPD experience.

We hypothesize that subjective SPD might contribute to the burden of ADRD among African Americans and Hispanics compared with the measure of diagnosed depression and anxiety. Given that depression and anxiety are often under-diagnosed in African-Americans and Hispanics compared to Whites, treating SPD is an important avenue for symptom alleviation. This study adds to the literature examining the existence of the SPD among ADRD populations and quantifies to what extent SPD among African Americans and Hispanics may be associated with the higher rates of ADRD among African Americans and Hispanics, compared to Whites. We use the Blinder-Oaxaca20 decomposition technique to deconstruct differences between Whites and African Americans, and White and Hispanics, respectively, and to quantify the burden of SPD among African Americans and Hispanics, compared to Whites.

METHOD

Data

Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), we combined eight years of data from 2007 to 2015 using the consolidated household file and medical condition files. The MEPS is a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized population in the United States that uses a complex overlapping panel design to survey Americans on their health status, access to care, and health expenditures. According to the MEPS user manual, “The sample design of the survey includes stratification, clustering, multiple stages of selection, and disproportionate sampling. Furthermore, the MEPS sampling weights reflect adjustments for survey nonresponse and adjustments to population control totals from the Current Population Survey.” The MEPS public use files include variables to obtain weighted estimates and to implement a Taylor-series approach to estimate standard errors for weighted survey estimates. These variables, which jointly reflect the MEPS survey design, include the estimation weight, sampling strata, and primary sampling unit (PSU). To be included in the MEPS, a sub-set of individuals who completed two years of data collection through National Health Interview Survey (NHIS uses a stratified multistage sample design) are purposely selected by the MEPS statisticians. MEPS over-samples African Americans and Hispanics and then calculates survey weights for all individuals in each data year.21 The response rate has consistently ranged from 70% to 80% between 2007 and 2015.21,22 We used person-level survey weights in all analysis. We limit our sample to U.S. adults aged 65 or more who identified as Non-Hispanic White (White), Non- Hispanic African American (African American or Black), or Hispanic. MEPS samples only non-institutionalized individuals; thus, our sample can be considered to be community-dwelling adults aged 65+ (MEPS age is top coded at age 86). MEPS defines institutionalization as being in a facility such as a prison, hospital, military barracks, or long-term in-patient psychiatric care/memory care unit for the entire survey period. Subjects are interviewed three times in the first year of participation and two times in the second year. If the person had intermittent hospitalization(s) or admission(s) to nursing care facilities between interviews, their expenditure data and question responses would still be captured in the survey, provided they are still alive, still residing at the address of record, and they or their proxy completed the interview. In the case of severe cognitive impairment, a household proxy who may be any individual greater than age 18 who lives with the respondent is permitted to answer on behalf of the respondent. Less than 1% of the responses on Serious Psychological Distress were reported by a proxy. Missing data was not a limitation.

The MEPS medical condition files presented up to 30 diagnoses codes per patient. We used this sub-file to identify ADRD and other co-existing conditions. These diagnosis codes are generated by a question that asks respondents or their proxies to identify the conditions they have. Providers of patients are contacted to verify patients’ health records. Each disease that is named by a respondent/proxy is coded with an ICD-9 code after verifying the diagnoses with the patients’ health care providers. For example, if an individual or the proxy states that they have Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety, and heart disease, the individual would have one of the codes 290, 291, 292, 294, 331, or 797 to identify the Alzheimer’s disease/cognitive impairment; the code 300 to identify the anxiety; and a code such as 429 to identify the heart disease. The ICD-9 codes are reviewed and imputed by MEPS statisticians. We identified persons with ADRD using ICD-9 codes 290, 291, 292, 294, 331, and 797. Psychiatric diagnoses were identified using ICD-9 codes for depression (311), and anxiety (300). Other coexisting conditions that have been well documented in the literature as salient to ADRD include diabetes (ICD-9 code 250), high blood pressure (ICD-9 796), and heart disease (ICD-9 429).

SPD was identified using scores from the Kessler-6 screener. The Kessler-6 was originally created by Ronald Kessler for use in the National Health Interview Survey to screen the general population and “the scales were designed to be sensitive around the threshold for the clinically significant range of the distribution of nonspecific distress in an effort to maximize the ability to discriminate cases of serious mental illness (SMI) from non-cases.” The screener asks questions such as, “During the past 30 days, about how often did you feel restless or fidgety?”23 “How often did you feel so down that nothing could cheer you up?” Specifically, the questions ask about feeling 1) nervous, 2) worthless, 3) hopeless, 4) restless or fidgety, 5) "so depressed that nothing could cheer you up", and, 6) "that everything was an effort". The answers are structured as a Likert scale with 5 being “all the time” and 0 being “not at all”. The Kessler-6 screener for SPD has been used widely in the literature with a score of 13 or greater indicating distress serious enough to warrant additional evaluation by a healthcare provider.24 We use the standard method of categorization, with people with scores of 13 or greater classified as having SPD and scores of 12 or less being categorized as not having SPD. The resultant binary variable is equal to 1 if the Kessler-6 score was 13 or more and equal to 0 otherwise.

Our combined sample for the 8 years of data included a total of 31,516 individuals of whom 20,611 were White; 6,116 were African American; and 4,789 were Hispanic. Races and ethnicity are mutually exclusive and based on self-report. Individuals who indicated that they were White and not Hispanic are characterized as White. Those who indicated that they were African American or Black but not Hispanic are characterized as Non-Hispanic African American (African American). Individuals who stated that they were Hispanic are categorized as Hispanic regardless of race.

Study Design

We first present prevalence rates of SPD, diagnosis of depression, and diagnosis of anxiety by race/ethnicity and the presence of the ADRD. In the case of SPD, prevalence is based on past 30-day report of symptoms, because the screener specifically asks about past 30-day experience of symptoms. In the case of depression and anxiety, prevalence is based on ICD codes for depression or anxiety in the survey year, since conditions are constructed into a single survey year file and reflect ever having reported depression or anxiety in the past year. Chi-square tests are used to determine whether racial and ethnic minority groups were more likely to have ADRD, SPD and other co-morbidities. We then described and compared the sample characteristics by race and ethnicity among individuals with and without ADRD. We employed multivariable logistic regression to examine the factors associated with ADRD diagnosis. Our key independent variable was SPD.

We used the Andersen behavioral model to select the covariates. Specifically, in Model 1a of Table 2, we controlled for age, gender, marital status, self-reported health status (poor, fair, good, very good/excellent), education (no high school degree vs. high school degree), family income (under 100% Federal Poverty Level—FPL, 100%-200% FPL, and above 200% FPL), health insurance coverage (public vs. private health insurance), US Census Region, and the year indicator. To further test the association of the SPD and ADRD, In Model 1b of Table 2, we also controlled for the health needs factors that have been documented in the literature as having an association with ADRD. We included the presence during survey of commonly identified chronic conditions of diabetes, heart diseases, and high blood pressure. We also controlled for the diagnoses of depression or anxiety in Model 1b.

Finally, we implemented the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method to parse disparities between African Americans; Hispanics; and Whites separately into two components: disparities due to observed characteristics and those related to unobserved heterogeneity.20,25,26 We first estimated the likelihood of having ADRD among Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics. The values of each need, enabling, or predisposing factor were applied to the other race/ethnic group (e.g., White and African American; or White and Hispanic). After the subtraction of the two regression models, terms were rearranged to indicate the extent to which differences of controlled variables among the two groups (e.g., SPD rates among African American vs. SPD rates among Whites) were associated with reduced or increased racial/ethnic differences in the likelihoods of having ADRD. Since our outcome variable was dichotomous, we used the non-linear decomposition methods proposed by Fairlie and Bartus.33,35 This decomposition method has been widely used in the health services research literature to identify the contribution of specific factors to racial and ethnic disparities.30-27

Stata 15 MP was used to conduct the analysis. We took into account the complex survey design by using sampling weight, sampling strata and primary sampling unit when correcting standard errors. The study involved only secondary analysis of data; therefore, it was deemed exempt from further consideration by our Institutional Review Board.

RESULTS

Figure 1 describes the rates of SPD by race/ethnicity among adults aged 65 and above. We also presented the rates of individuals who had a diagnosis of depression or anxiety. Among the ADRD cohort, there are significantly higher rates of SPD, depression, and anxiety than among the no-ADRD cohort. African American and Hispanic individuals had significantly higher rates of having SPD among the non-ADRD cohort.

Figure 1 also shows that the rates of SPD were two to three times higher than the rates of having a diagnosis of depression or anxiety. This gap between SPD and mental health diagnosis was pronounced among African American and Hispanic individuals. For example, among the ADRD cohort, the presence of SPD between White and African American individuals was not significant; however African Americans were significantly less likely to have a diagnosis of depression or anxiety.

Table 1 provides descriptive statistics of our sample. Consistent with the literature, we identified significant differences in demographic and socioeconomic status by race and ethnicity. Compared to Whites, African American and Hispanic individuals were less likely to have a high school degree or high family income. They were more likely to have only public health insurance. Meanwhile, African Americans were more likely to have diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension; and Hispanics were more likely to have hypertension and diabetes. These are common co-existing physical conditions of ADRD.

Table 2 presents the results of logistic regression after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors (Model 1a), and socioeconomic factors plus health needs factors (Model 1b). Model 1a shows that having SPD was significantly associated with higher likelihood of having ADRD when controlling for socioeconomic factors. The likelihood was reduced but still significant after controlling for health needs factors. Model 1b indicates that individuals with diagnosis of depression or anxiety were also significantly more likely to have ADRD.

Consistent with the literature, we also found that African American and Hispanic individuals were more likely to have ADRD than White individuals. After controlling for the comprehensive list of covariates, our results did not show significant association between education, family income, and insurance and the development of ADRD.

To test our hypothesis that SPD may be responsible for higher disease burden among African American and Hispanics, we used the decomposition approach. Table 3 shows the results of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition. The predicted likelihoods of having ADRD among the African American and White aging population were 7.1% and 4.5% respectively. Our covariates explained 19% of the racial difference of having the ADRD (2.6%). Among all covariates, SPD explained 14.8% of the total difference. In our sample, SPD rates were 24% among African Americans and 17% among Whites. The decomposition results suggest that if African Americans had the same SPD rate as Whites, we may observe a 14.8% lower likelihood of developing ADRD among African Americans, if other covariates were controlled. The contribution of a diagnosis of depression and anxiety was minimal. Other major factors associated with racial disparities were age and self-reported health.

Our model explained more ethnic (Hispanic vs. White) differences in developing ADRD (89.9%). The presence of SPD explained 40% of the total differences between Whites and Hispanics. The SPD rate was 27% among Hispanics, 10 percentage points higher than that of Whites. If Hispanics had the same low rate of SPD as Whites, we may also observe reductions of ADRD prevalence among Hispanics. Like in the model that decomposed differences between African Americans and Whites, diagnosis of depression and anxiety only explained minimal differences between Hispanics and Whites. Age, self-reported health, and geographic location showed substantial contribution to explain the ethnic differences.

DISCUSSION

Our findings are consistent with prior research documenting racial and ethnic disparities in ADRD,28,29 yet to our best knowledge this is the first study we know of that specifically examines differences in ADRD and SPD by race and ethnicity. Our findings suggest that African Americans and Hispanics have higher odds of ADRD, and this remained true after controlling for sociodemographic, physical health, and mental health characteristics.18,30 Our decomposition results suggest that SPD contributed to the burden of ADRD among African American patients disproportionately to Whites. This is significant, given that higher levels of negative symptom experience are associated with a faster disease trajectory, and greater need for custodial care among individuals with Alzheimer’s.2,4,5,31-34

The importance of evaluating self-reported SPD

The observed results showed opposite contributions of SPD (positively associated with racial/ethnic disparities in having ADRD) and depression and anxiety (negatively associated with racial/ethnic disparities in having ADRD). This finding suggests the importance of diagnosing mental health conditions. It also signals the importance of evaluating self-reported mental health given the substantial under-diagnosis of depression and anxiety among minorities, and this finding is consistent with the under-diagnosis of depression and anxiety among minorities. For example, in a study examining diagnosis of depression versus experience of depression, Williams and colleagues found that while formal diagnosis of depression was highest among Whites, African Americans had more severe major depressive disorder symptoms within the past year.35 Furthermore, even when diagnosed with depression, Hispanics and African Americans have lower odds of receiving pharmacotherapy,36,37 receive less brand-name pharmacotherapy,38 and are less likely to receive psychotherapy.26

There are several observations that can be made on the temporality of mood disorders such as depression and ADRD. First, late-life depression onset can be a prodromal indication of ADRD. There is also bi-directionality between overall mental health and subsequent development of ADRD.39 Depression is therefore both a modifiable risk factor for ADRD and a complication of ADRD. More research is needed to uncover the relationship between lifetime mental health/illness and subsequent development of ADRD. If better-controlled mental illness can ameliorate the development of ADRD in later life, the policy implication would be for ongoing efforts to improve mental health care across the lifespan and population level mental health.

Higher levels of SPD among minorities with ADRD

There are several reasons why minorities with ADRD may experience higher levels of SPD. First, there is abundant research to suggest that African Americans experience racism in seeking medical care, receiving less evidence-based care and fewer novel treatments.38,40 Specifically, one study suggests that African Americans are less likely to receive next-generation ADRD medications and discontinue ADRD medications at a faster rate.9

Secondly, there are barriers that impact African Americans’ seeking and receiving help for mental health issues.41-43 These could be classified as diagnostic barriers, personally mediated racism barriers, and internalized racism barriers which are discussed in turn. For example, a diagnostic barrier might be part of the reason that schizophrenia is over-diagnosed in African Americans and that mood disorders are under-diagnosed.37,44-46

Thirdly, a reason why minorities with ADRD may experience higher levels of SPD may be related to cultural norms around marriage, family living structure, and socialization. Cultural norms and family and social factors may contribute dually to SPD and ADRD. In our study, we observed current marital status as a protective factor for ADRD. It is notable that African Americans had a lower proportion of individuals who were currently married, while marriage rates were similar between Whites and Hispanics. Hispanics face their own unique challenges in meeting both SPD and ADRD needs. While many aging Hispanics speak English well, linguistically tailored, health-literate services may be needed,47,48 especially in the latter stages of ADRD progression when language impairment occurs. Finally, in mixed-status immigration households (i.e., families that encompass undocumented, documented, and citizen family members) there may be fear of interacting with the health care system, and this may cause elders and their families to delay or forgo care for both SPD and ADRD.49-51

Unobserved factors that are associated with disparities in ADRD

Substantial disparities were not explained by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics that were commonly being considered as major predictors to the ADRD. Examples of unobserved factors can be physician-patient relationship, internalized racism, etc. Eack and colleagues found that physician-perceived dishonesty among African Americans mediated the appropriate diagnosis of schizophrenia.52 In this instance, the diagnostic barrier is a difference of perception in the physician-patient encounter. Other studies have demonstrated that Whites have a higher propensity to endorse psychological symptoms, and non-endorsement by African Americans and Hispanics of psychological symptoms in the patient-physician encounter may present a diagnostic barrier.1,53,54 Personally-mediated racism refers to actions undertaken or which an individual fails to undertake based on conscious and unconscious racial bias. A systematic review of studies of racism in healthcare found that there was strong evidence of personally-mediated racism among physicians.

Internalized racism refers to ways of acting and being that reflect an acceptance and embrace of social injustice based on race or ethnicity. An example of internalized racism would be that an African American patient is treated poorly by a doctor but attributes this to the doctor not liking him as a person, not to the fact that he is African American. Experiencing racism and discrimination may alter the way that individuals present, and the diagnosis of depression in African Americans may be compounded by internalized racism. James et al55 found that there was an indirect association between internalized racism and past-year major depressive disorder via self-esteem, and Mouzon and colleagues56 found that internalized racism was positively associated with depressive symptoms and SPD among African Americans. We speculate that internalized racism, compounded by unconscious bias, may create a clinical encounter where the principal challenge to accurate diagnosis is that the actual experience of the patient is poorly expressed by the patient and poorly understood by the physician, and this may inhibit identification and treatment of mental health issues across the lifespan.

Limitations

There are several limitations that should be noted. First, the MEPS is cross-sectional in nature, therefore the direction of causality between SPD and ADRD is difficult to establish. However, given that the questions used to ascertain SPD ask about symptom presence in the past 30 days, we are quite confident that those who screen positive for SPD experienced their symptoms within the past 30 days. Second, the cross-sectional nature of the data limit longitudinal analysis that would be able to observe exposures and outcomes over time for the same individual. Additional research should explore the directionality of SPD and ADRD. Third, our findings only presented the association of SPD and having ADRD. Development of ADRD may take up to 20 years. The pre-clinical period may be critical to prevent or delay onset of ADRD.

Although we controlled for chronic conditions, we did not control for how well these chronic conditions were managed throughout the participant’s lifetime, which plays a key role in the development of dementia. The risk factors for dementia build up over a lifetime. Fourthly, the findings of our study only generalize to non-institutionalized older adults, given that the sample is drawn from non-institutionalized older adults. Finally, given the data limitation, we were only able to use three-digit ICD-9 codes available in our data. Future research may use more specific ADRD diagnosis codes. Our data, however, provide comprehensive measures of demographic and socioeconomic factors to help us estimate racial and ethnic disparities, and we were able to estimate the association of the existence of SPD with racial and ethnic disparities after controlling for these complex factors.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS

Evaluation of SPD may be necessary beyond the current focus on existing diagnosis of depression and anxiety. Our findings showed that although minorities have SPD, they have much lower rates of diagnosis of depression and anxiety. CMS alternative payment models33,57,58 that have been used to motivate primary care doctors to evaluate mental health conditions through the annual wellness check among Medicare beneficiaries may support greater screening and diagnosis for mental health conditions.

Significant racial differences in having ADRD were not explained by covariates. It is possible that the social determinants of health across the lifespan contribute to the differences. These would include employment-related exposures, housing-related exposures, access to lifelong learning to stimulate cognitive activity, and social stresses experienced.

While we did not have direct evidence, we speculated that well-controlled mental illness and better-managed mental health care can help with ADRD treatment and potentially reduce disparities.59-61 Given the greater burden of ADRD and SPD in African Americans, ongoing research to identify culturally acceptable treatments for ADRD and SPD are warranted. To close the gap between African Americans, Hispanics, and Whites in ADRD prevalence and treatment will require multi-sector collaboration to address social determinants that put minorities at risk of a higher disease burden; medical care to diagnose and treat ADRD in a culturally competent way; and social care to support both those with ADRD and their caregivers in the setting of their preference. Given the anticipated increase in ADRD in the next 40 years, finding solutions to ADRD disparities is a critical health care issue. Treatments will need to be acceptable to a diverse set of elders, and psychosocial care will need to be malleable to the cultural and linguistic preferences of elders and their caregivers.

CONCLUSION

This study adds to the literature on prevalence of SPD among people over age 65 and to the evidence on racial and ethnic disparities in ADRD, finding that African Americans and Hispanics had higher odds of ADRD and that SPD was associated with ADRD. Decomposition analysis showed that SPD was a significant driver of racial and ethnic disparities in having ADRD. Evaluation of subjective measure on SPD may be necessary beyond the current focus on existing diagnosis of depression and anxiety.

Notes:

1. Data source: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 2007-2015.

2. Logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios. In Model 1a of Table 2, we controlled for age, gender, marital status, self-reported health status (poor, fair, good, very good/excellent), education (no high school degree vs. high school degree), family income (under 100% Federal Poverty Level—FPL; 100%-200% FPL; and above 200% FPL), health insurance coverage (public vs. private health insurance), US Census Region, and the year indicator. In Model 1b of Table 2, we also controlled for the health needs factors that have been documented in the literature as having an association with ADRD.

All the regression models accounted for complex survey design by using sampling weights, sampling strata and primary sampling unit when adjusting standard errors.

3. Number of observations=30,956; Degrees of freedom=380; F(25, 356)=33.70

ADRD: Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias

Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition was used to parse out disparities between minority racial groups and NH whites due to proposed models, and observed characteristics in the models.

To better interpret the finding, we convert the coefficient to the percentages. For example, the coefficient of SPD in the White vs. African American in decomposition is = 0.0038569, 95% CI=(0.0026623, 0.0050515), p value&lt;0.001. The decomposition model also showed that the total different in having ADRD between African American and White groups was .0257771. Hence, we calculated that the presence of SPD contributed to 14.96% (=0.0038569/.0257771) of the difference.

HIGHLIGHTS

This study addresses the excess burden of serious psychological distress in African Americans and Hispanics with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).

The presence of SPD was still significantly associated with a higher likelihood of having ADRD (coef = 0.88, p&lt;0.001). The model predicted significantly higher likelihood of having ADRD among African Americans (7.1%) and Hispanics (5.7%) compared to Whites (4.5%).

Substantial differences in racial differences of having ADRD was not explained by individual-level demographic and socioeconomic factors and health needs; availability and provision of culturally competent mental health care is needed to address SPD among ADRD minority populations.
