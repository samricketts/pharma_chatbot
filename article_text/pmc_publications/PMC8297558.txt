Understanding care and end-of-life preferences for persons living with dementia (PLWD) is of particular importance in long-term care (LTC) settings, such as nursing homes and assisted living communities, where nearly one-half of residents have some form of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia.1 Although most LTC providers record care preferences on standardized assessments and have policies to obtain advance directives at admission, few target or tailor their approach for PLWD to ensure that their preferences are captured while they are able to convey them.2

Me &amp; My Wishes improves LTC providers’ and family caregivers’ understanding of everyday and end-of-life care preferences of PLWD by creating videos of residents talking about their preferences.3,4 The videos empower residents to convey their preferences and trigger communication among residents, family, and staff about person-centered care. A care team member shares each resident’s personalized video with the interdisciplinary care team and family members during quarterly care plan meetings. The care team member follows prompts to facilitate conversation about aspects of the video to be addressed in the care plan. Family members unable to attend the care plan meeting view videos via a secure Web-based video server (Kaltura).

We conducted a stage II5 efficacy study of Me &amp; My Wishes among PLWD, their family, and staff caregivers in LTC settings. This study was approved by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. Using a randomized wait-list control design, we block randomized 5 nursing homes and 3 assisted living communities in the Pacific Northwest into 2 groups based on size, proportion of residents with Medicaid, and proportion of residents with mild to moderate cognitive impairment.

Our primary outcome was communication of preferences: documentation of goals of care conversations (presence or absence in the medical record at all time points) and self-report of conversation about preferences (ascertained by asking residents, staff, and family whether or not the video facilitated conversation about preferences). As a result of coronavirus disease 2019 visitation restrictions in LTC, we used Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant platforms to remotely record Me &amp; My Wishes videos and to collect data, including administering surveys and audio recording the care plan meetings.

We enrolled 50 PLWD, 50 family, and 38 staff. At the time of video sharing (treatment), documentation of a goals of care conversation was 3.32 times more likely than when compared with baseline [95% confidence interval (0.78, 14.15), P &lt; .105] (Table 1). Calculated value (estimated marginal mean) of the percentage of residents at baseline with documentation of a goal of care conversation was 19% and increased to 44% at time of video sharing (treatment). Post-hoc power analysis suggested that our sample size of 36 residents had 65% power to detect the effect. After the video was shared in the care planning meeting, care team members facilitated questions with the resident and family about preferences conveyed in the video 85% of the time. In a follow-up survey, 75% of residents, 90% of family members, and 94% of staff agreed the video facilitated additional conversations about resident preferences, though not all of these conversations translated into documentation in the medical record.

Our findings indicate that sharing Me &amp; My Wishes videos in nursing homes and assisted living communities facilitated conversations among PLWD, their families, and staff about their preferences and improved documentation of goals of care conversations. These findings build on prior research demonstrating that this intervention is feasible and acceptable.4

Though viewing Me &amp; My Wishes videos prompted conversation, more consistent documentation of conversations about resident care preferences is important to providing person-centered care and increasing the likelihood that resident wishes will be honored.2,6,7 Providers could create policies around documentation of care conversation practices,8 and monitor implementation as part of their Quality Assurance Performance Improvement program.

We note several limitations, including a sample size without the power to detect statistical significance. Findings may also be muted or underestimated because we measured documentation; conversations may occur without being documented. Future research would benefit from a larger and more representative sample, as well as testing a telehealth delivery approach that could facilitate remote family participation when visitation is not feasible or permissible.

In conclusion, we found that the Me &amp; My Wishes videos led to additional self-reported conversations and improved documentation about resident preferences. Sharing resident-specific videos in the care plan meeting engages residents in their care and sets the foundation for continued conversations. As the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues to complicate in-person communication, such videos offer a means to facilitate and subsequently document conversations that can help family and staff caregivers provide every day and end-of-life care that is concordant with residents’ wishes.

Table 1 Goals of Care Documentation, Fixed Effects From General Estimating Equations

	OR [95% CI]	P Value	
Time 2 (3 mo)	1.1 [0.29, 4.27]	.886	
Time 3 (6 mo)	0.24 [0.04, 1.32]	.100	
Time 4 (9 mo)	0.48 [0.04, 6.13]	.571	
Video sharing (treatment)	3.32 [0.78, 14.15]	.105	
Follow-up (3 mo post-video)	2.32 [0.24, 22.8]	.470	
Effect coding (1, 0; presence or absence) was used for each fixed effect. Time 1 (baseline) is the reference category. Example, goal of care documentation for a participant in the immediate group at time of video sharing would receive effect coding: time 2 (1); time 3 (0), time 4 (0), treatment (1), follow-up (0). A participant in the wait-list group at time of video sharing would receive effect coding: time 2 (0), time 3 (1), time 4 (0), treatment (1), follow-up (0).
