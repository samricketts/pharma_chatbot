Background

Growing evidence suggests that critical periods in early life may contribute to one’s risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in later life. In this paper we explore the role that exposure to infant mortality plays in later life Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.

Objective

To determine if exposure to early life infant mortality is associated with later mortality from Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Also, we explore how these associations differ by sex and age group, along with the role of state of birth and competing risks of death.

Methods

We use a sample of over 400,000 individuals aged 50 and above with the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study with mortality follow-up, allowing us to examine how early life infant mortality rates along with other risk factors play in one’s individual mortality risk.

Results

We show that infant mortality rates are associated with death from Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias among those under 65 years of age, but not those over 65 at baseline interview. Moreover, when factoring in competing risks of death, the associations are relatively unchanged.

Conclusion

These results suggest that those exposed to worse adverse conditions during critical periods increase their likelihood of death from Alzheimer’s and related dementia earlier than average, due to that exposure increasing their susceptibility to develop illness later on in life.

pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and has garnered increased attention in recent years [1–3]. ADRD is a progressive disease that is commonly believed to manifest decades before symptoms arise in individual. These symptoms typically come in the form of memory loss or problems with language, which can lead to a myriad of other issues such as mobility problems or lower quality of life as the disease progresses [4,5]. Furthermore, given increased population aging in the United States, it is presumed that ADRD will have an increased prevalence, as there have been massive increases in longevity over time so that there will be more individuals that develop the disease [6,7]. Therefore, identifying the specific pathways of later life ADRD is of great significance in order to minimize the burden that the condition imposes on our population health system.

Potential causes of ADRD are linked to various stages across the life course. However, researchers have increasingly sought to uncover early life factors. For instance, some studies have found associations between ADRD and childhood socioeconomic status [8], early-life advantage [9], and rural residence [10]. Developmental and origins of adult health and disease (DOHaD) and life course frameworks stress the importance of critical periods, such as pre- or post-natal periods, in which an individual is particularly sensitive to adverse exposures. One famous example that examines these critical periods in early life was done by Barker (1986), who looked at area-level infant mortality rates (IMR) in the United Kingdom during the 1920’s and individual-level ischemic heart disease mortality in the 1970’s and found a positive association between the two [11]. Known as the “Barker hypothesis”, it posits that exposure to adverse conditions in the form of infant mortality during these critical periods increase one’s susceptibility to the development of disease in later life. This finding has been reaffirmed for heart diseases [12,13] and other outcomes, such as cognition [14] and stroke [15], but not ADRD. Moreover, much of the setting of these studies has often been examined in the context of either the United Kingdom or Europe more broadly, but not the United States.

The linkage of adverse exposures during critical periods of development with later life ADRD is a challenging endeavor. This is due to the fact that ADRD, unlike some other forms of illness, is more concentrated towards the end of the life course, and thus greater attention is paid to potential determinants in mid and later life [16–19]. Indeed, age is often one of the most significant factors of ADRD, due to the fact that the majority of people who die from ADRD are over 65 years of age. Additionally, there are other factors outside of age that play a major role, such as genetics or family histories [20,21]. For instance, a study by Han and colleages (2020) found a link between those with a higher polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease and rapid cognitive decline [22].

Outside of predetermined factors, modifiable risk factors can operate through various pathways, such as education, physical activity, and smoking status [23–25]. A study by Kivipelto and colleages (2005) found that mid-life obesity was associated with an increased risk of ADRD later in life, even when factoring in sociodemographic variables [27]. Other issues that have been identified include cardiovascular issues, such as hypertension and blood pressure, which reveal positive relationships with ADRD [28]. Diabetes, stroke prevalence and place of death, too, in late-life have been shown to be associated with ADRD prevalence or death in later life, or poorer brain health, which sets the conditions for ADRD to potentially develop [29–32].

Another important consideration in examining adverse exposures early in the life course deals with the issue of mortality selection and sex. As previously mentioned, the majority of individuals who die from ADRD are over 65 years of age. However, the Barker hypothesis framework proposes that those exposed to worse environmental conditions may either die from ADRD at an earlier age than expected, or die from other causes of illness before they would live to see a diagnosis from the disease. In other words, it could be shown that there is a negative relationship in some instances, between infant mortality rates and later life ADRD. Thus, it is vital to investigate any potential relationship between adverse conditions in the form of IMR and ADRD by stratifying a sample between those above 65, and those below. Relatedly, it is critical to also look at the relationship between early life environments and ADRD by sex as well, given that evidence is mixed on which sex is more harmed by exposure to adversity [33,34]. However, evidence from studies on ADRD find that women on average are more impacted by ADRD than men, and deteriorate from the condition at a quicker rate [35].

Taken together, despite all of the evidence laid out above concerning ADRD, there is scant research regarding how exposure to adverse conditions during critical periods of development may be associated with ADRD in later-life. One previous study examined this relationship and found that states with the highest rates of infant mortality was associated with an elevated dementia risk among African Americans, but not whites, though the studied individuals were drawn from California residents [36]. Apart from this example, there exists virtually no research on how early life exposure to IMR and ADRD mortality are associated. This, combined with the fact that the prospects for both the prevalence and mortality of ADRD is expected to increase [6], means that there is a fundamental need to examine this relationship. Thus, this paper asks the following questions: 1) is there an association between exposure to IMR in early life and later life ADRD mortality?; 2) are these associations different by age and sex group?; 3) how does place in the form of state of birth influence these effects?; and 4) what are the role of competing causes of death, if any?

Data and Methods

Data

This study opts to use data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study (DHS). The DHS is a study undertaken from 1995 to 1996 in which individuals from the ages of 50–71 years old were recruited from the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), who responded to a mailed questionnaire [37]. This questionnaire, initially mailed to 3.5 million members of the AARP, eventually resulted in over 620,000 responses from individuals. From this, nearly 570,000 individuals provided enough information that was compatible for the study of health. The participants of this large study were drawn from six states in the United States (California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania), and two metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Georgia and Detroit, Michigan), who provided both written and informed consent. In the initial study in 1995–1996, participants of the DHS were asked information in the questionnaire that revolved around nutrition, along with questions on health, such as prior diagnoses of illness, among others. In addition to the information collected at baseline, basic demographics of each individual (race/ethnicity, sex, etc.) were collected, along with other variables that are commonplace to the study of health and mortality.

The DHS is a distinct data source due to its large sample size, which is vital to the study of rare outcomes, such as dementia. Additionally, it is essential to have such a large sample size in order to study how outcomes vary across different states. Other data sources provide information on the phenomena studied in this paper, but often are constrained by either smaller sample size, being limited to a single cohort, or not containing broad information on different geographies.

Measures

ADRD Mortality.

The main outcome of interest looked at in this study is mortality from ADRD. All causes of death in the sample are provided from follow-up of the DHS through 2011, a period of sixteen years. The vital status of a given participant in the study is determined by the annual linkage of the cohort members in the DHS to the Social Security Administrations Master Death Files [38]. From this, the International Classification of Disease (ICD) Codes are given to ascertain the cause of death (see supplement material for specific ICD codes).

Infant Mortality Rates.

Infant mortality rates used in this study represent a proxy for early life conditions, similar to prior studies on outcomes across the life course. They are calculated to represent the annual, state-level rate by taking the number of infant deaths over the total infant population of the state, multiplied by 1,000. We obtained these rates in a similar manner that prior studies have [39], from various volumes of United States Vital Statistics for our birth years of interest (1925–1945) and for the whole population in a state, which covers the entire range of birth years in our sample and all states of birth [40]. These values are then standardized to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one to make interpretation simpler. Specifically, these values are standardized separately for each sample (age and sex groups) that is used for analysis.

State of Birth.

State of birth was ascertained in this study through linkage of the first three digits of the individuals social security numbers, which was provided in the baseline survey, allowing identification of states [41]. From this, the sample includes participants from all fifty states.

Covariates.

Similarly, race and ethnicity are controlled for in models to account for mortality risks that exist between racial groups. Due to our rather small sample size for non-white populations, we opt to create a binary white/non-white metric. Educational attainment is considered along the following levels: less than high school, high school, some college, and college degree or more. These levels are incorporated to account for the influence that education has across the lifespan with regard to health and well-being, especially with regard to outcomes such as dementia [42,43]. Other variables that are health variables, specifically body mass index and heart issues which are known risk factors, particularly in mid-life, along with of stroke history and diabetes, which are important risk factors in later life. All four of these metrics were gathered from respondents in the baseline questionnaire. Respondents were asked by interviewers if they ever had been diagnosed with diabetes or heart issues, in life. Stroke history is self-reported among respondents, whereas body mass index is calculated from height and weight collected from respondents at baseline. Finally, we also opt to control for self-rated health, given its proven predictive power with regards to forms of mortality.

Analytic Strategy

Before analysis, we began with a sample of 566,397 individuals in the original DHS. Specific observations were dropped due to them having invalid states of birth or information on birth in a United States territory or insular region. A further 2,686 observations were dropped from our sample due to missing information on infant mortality rates and year of birth in our study. This left us with a total sample of 397,794 individuals. We then stratified our sample into four separate groups by age and sex to examine the differential impact that adverse conditions in early life may have on later life ADRD. We employ a series of cox proportional hazard models for each age-sex group with age as the timescale. For modeling of ADRD mortality, model 1 controls for infant mortality, both in a linear and quadratic form, along with race and year of birth as baseline covariates. Model 2 estimates the baseline model but adds a control for educational attainment. Model 3 then opts to add in the known risk factors for ADRD, which are heart disease, diabetes, smoking status, and BMI. Finally, model 4 introduces self-rated health as a covariate. After this, to see the role that place of birth operates as a pathway through mortality, we re-estimate all models with state of birth fixed effects.

Results

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics. Of the 397,794 individuals in our sample, 3,048 died from ADRD during the mortality follow-up period. The overall sample is 61.85% (246,046) male and 38.15% (151,748) female. Over 90% of the sample is non-Hispanic white, whereas those who are non-white account for 7.37% (29,334). The average age of the sample was 62.17 (SD=5.38). For our independent variable of interest, infant mortality, the average rate was 56.19 deaths per 1,000 (SD=13.58) with a range of 28.2 per 1,000 to 158.51 per 1,000; we standardize these values of IMR for our models. Regarding known risk-factors for ADRD, 14.30% (56,873), 9.22% (36,688), and 64.55% (248,201) of individuals had a self-reported history of heart disease, diabetes, and having ever smoked, respectively, and there was an average body mass index of 27.31 (SD=4.84) at baseline interview. From this, our sample stratified by age and sex is presented in Table 2, where there are 144,958 and 101,088 males under 65 and those 65 and older, respectively. Females under 65 are composed of 94,644 individuals, whereas those 65 and older are 57,104.

Figure 1 shows the predicted probability for ADRD mortality, stratified by sex and age group. For all groups, IMR are associated with later life ADRD mortality from values of about 40 per 1,000 to 100 per 1,000. However, depending on the group, the effect is stronger at different levels of IMR, and then proceed to level off at higher values, which is consistent with a selection effect. For instance, the group of younger males sees a peak around 70 per 1,000, whereas for females 65 and older see a peak around 80 per 1,000, and a subsequent decline.

Figure 2 then shows the same analysis, but controlling for state of birth, where we see similar trends, but only slightly. For full results for all models analyzed, Tables 3 and 4 show hazard ratios for ADRD mortality, stratified by sex and age. For the baseline findings, females see across age groups a positive association between infant mortality and later life ADRD. Likewise, males under the age of 65 see a positive association, but only one state of birth fixed effects are introduced.

Given the fact that the relationship between IMR and ADRD appeared to be non-linear and potentially affected by selection, we also opted to consider a competing risks approach to our analysis, to ensure the robustness of our findings. Thus, we opted to re-run the final model of analysis, but considering the competing morality risks of stroke, cardiovascular disease, and all other causes of death. We choose stroke and cardiovascular diseases given that they are major causes of death, and specifically are diseases that those suffering from ADRD tend to die from, if not from ADRD itself [44]. Even when factoring in these competing risks, our associations between early life IMR and remain relatively unchanged, with the size and the direction of the point estimates being quite similar (see Supplementary Table 1). For competing risks that include state of birth fixed effects, this is also the case (see Supplementary Table 2).

Discussion

A great deal of research concerning mortality from ADRD has emphasized predetermined or modifiable risk factors specific to the individual. Likewise, much of the research on forms of health and mortality in recent years have focused on contextual factors, yet this focus has largely neglected ADRD [8,43]. Additionally, when these contextual factors are accounted for, they tend to have a disproportionate focus on more contemporaneous factors compared to early life, likely a result of the fact that ADRD is something known to exclusively impact aging populations. Our study adds to the literature on early life factors by exploring how exposure to adverse socioeconomic and environmental conditions during critical periods of development, influence later life mortality from ADRD. We opt to use infant mortality as a proxy for these conditions, given that it has been used in the past to look into other forms of death or health conditions, initially by [11] and since then others [13,14]. Ultimately, the findings presented throughout this research suggest several implications.

First, we further our understanding of how we may think about the how exposure to adverse conditions during critical periods of development. In this paper, we find that birth in areas of high infant mortality is associated with a higher likelihood of death from ADRD among those under 65 for females and for males under 65, when factoring in state of birth. This relationship is significant around 40 deaths per 1,000 and exists until about 100 deaths per 1,000, where it levels off. This relationship also exists for those 65 and over, though the relationship is somewhat weaker. Dying from ADRD before the age of 65 is classified as early-onset dementia, which is associated with atypical syndromes and has higher levels of mortality, and accounts for less than a tenth of all deaths from the illness [45]. Thus, given that we see an association between early-life infant mortality and later life ADRD mortality among younger individuals, particularly females, and at lower levels than one would expect, we argue that those exposed to worse adverse conditions during critical periods increase their likelihood of death from ADRD earlier than average, due to that exposure increasing their susceptibility to develop illness later on in life.

Second, we find in this paper that when factoring in controls for state of birth that the associations between IMR and later life ADRD mortality dissipates for females of both age groups but reveals an association for males under 65 years of age. However, in looking at IMR at specific levels, it shows that infant mortality is still significant with later life ADRD, and follows a non-linear relationship, peaking around 60 or 70 deaths per 1,000 depending on the group, and declining thereafter. These findings imply that the IMR measure captures broader state-level factors, and failure to control for these may lead to misunderstandings of how specific pathways work to influence mortality across the life course. Given that different states often have different policy regimes that people are born into, and thus may have an impact through different mechanisms that may influence, it is always important to consider them as they could work to shape an individual’s health and mortality profile throughout the life course.

Third, many studies of how exposure to adverse socioeconomic and environmental conditions via infant mortality have primarily been done in the context of the United Kingdom or Europe more broadly. Our study adds to this literature in the sense that our setting is in the United States, where we find evidence that exposure to worse state-level infant mortality is linked with working-age ADRD death. This finding essentially establishes evidence for the Barker hypothesis in the United States, and should be replicated for other causes of death, to test its robustness.

There are some limitations to this study that are in need of being mentioned. One limitation is the timing and degree of exposures during the critical period. We use state-level IMR as a proxy for early life socioeconomic and environmental conditions. Given how larger units of geography may mask more heterogeneity, we have no way of knowing if the state average IMR was constant across all areas of a state. For instance, it could be that individuals living in one county had an IMR substantially lower than another, thus exposing them to a more benevolent environment. Future research should aim to consider finer units of geography (i.e., county or tract) to see if the relationships observed in this paper are robust to outcomes. Another limitation to this study is in regard to the sample composition. The data utilized in this study was primarily gathered from mostly white individuals across eight states in the United States, (California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania). Given that illnesses such as Alzheimer’s and dementia are geographically clustered like other forms of illness, future research should consider information from individuals across all fifty states. However, despite the residence component, it is important to note that in our examination of the early life environment, this research does have information on individuals born across all fifty states.

These limitations notwithstanding, this study is novel in the sense that it allows us to explore the role of early life insults on later life ADRD mortality. The data source allows us to see if a disease that is known for predominantly impacting the oldest individuals in society is linked to events that occur earlier in life. Moreover, the data in this study allow us to consider the impact of mechanisms such as known-risk factors for ADRD, and if these differ by age and sex group. Ultimately, our findings suggest that exposure to adverse conditions in early life are related to ADRD mortality among those who die before 65, especially among females. Future studies would benefit from employing larger sample sizes, particularly for non-white populations, to see if these relationships are influenced dramatically by race. Furthermore, examinations of additional measures of early life exposures would be beneficial, such as pollution or lead. Unpacking which early life factors matter more regarding the risk for ADRD mortality would better help inform specific public health interventions in the United States, especially since the nation is bound to continue aging in the coming decades.
