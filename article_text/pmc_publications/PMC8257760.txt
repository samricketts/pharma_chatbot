Objective:

Our understanding of why older adults with depression are at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains incomplete. Most adults living with AD are women, and women have a near twofold lifetime risk of depression. We examined the risk of depression upon incident AD, and how sex influences this risk.

Methods:

Using the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center database, older adults (age 50+) with normal cognition, who visited memory clinics across the United States between September 2005 and December 2019, were followed until first diagnosis of AD or loss to follow up. Multivariable survival analyses were performed to determine if recent and/or remote depression were independent risk factors for AD, and if this depression-related risk exists for each sex and was moderated by sex.

Results:

652 of 10,739 enrolled participants developed AD over a median follow-up of 55.3 months. Recent depression (active within the last 2 years) was independently associated with increased risk of AD (HR=2.0; 95%CI, 1.5–2.6) while a remote history of depression was not (HR=1.0; 95%CI, 0.7–1.5). After stratification by sex, recent depression was an independent predictor in females (HR=2.3; 95%CI, 1.7–3.1) but not in males (HR=1.4; 95%CI, 0.8–2.6). No interaction between recent depression and sex was observed.

Conclusions:

Only recent history of depression was associated with higher risk of AD. This association was significant among women only, but was not moderated by sex. Future analyses should determine if these findings extend to other populations and may be explained by variable distribution of neurobiological or other modifiable risk factors between the sexes.

Introduction:

Late life depression has been associated with approximate two-fold increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (1, 2). There has been conflicting evidence regarding the relationship between early life depression and risk of AD development (3–6). While it is known that older adults with depression are at increased risk of AD, our understanding of mechanistic links remains incomplete and improved understanding will be critical for design of effective interventions to prevent cognitive decline.

Increasing evidence supports the importance of considering sex when evaluating potentially modifiable risk factors for AD. Women have a higher prevalence of AD than men and approximately two thirds of adults living with AD in the United States (US) and Canada are women (7–9). This in part reflects increased longevity, but several studies have also documented increased incidence of AD among women (7, 8, 10). This may reflect varying biological and environmental risk factors between the sexes, such as medical comorbidity, increased risk associated with APOE genotype, hormonal changes, educational attainment, differences in health behaviors, and gender related factors (8, 11). In addition to greater risk of AD, women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk of depression, which may also be attributable to underlying neurobiological and psychosocial differences (12, 13). Women more frequently present with an atypical subtype of depression that has been associated with inflammation and metabolic changes, potentially further increasing risk of AD (14–16).

The duration, severity, and time of onset of depression are also relevant to subsequent risk of AD. While some studies have demonstrated an association between early onset depression and increased risk of AD, other studies have indicated that most of this risk is associated with having had active depression in later life (3, 17, 18). A small number of studies have previously examined whether the increased risk of AD associated with late life depression differs between the sexes with conflicting findings (19). This variability may relate to use of small sample sizes and differing methodologies. In view of the high prevalence of both depression and AD in later life, an increased understanding of this relationship could have important implications for preventive interventions and allow for more personalized approaches according to individual risk profiles. Therefore, we undertook to investigate the relationship between depression categorized by recency and increased risk of incident AD with adjustment for more known and emerging risk factors in a large well-characterized sample of older adults attending memory clinics across the US. We also examined how this association differs by sex by incorporating a moderator analysis. Specifically, we hypothesized that recent depression would be associated with increased risk of AD while a more remote history of depression would not. We also hypothesized that this risk would be greater in women and that sex would moderate the association between depression and increased risk of AD.

Methods:

Study Sample

Data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset was used for this analysis. The NACC database is funded by the National Institute on Aging and located in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Washington School of Public Health. A Uniform Data Set (UDS) was implemented in 2005 to collect standardized longitudinal clinical data from participants. Since then, the UDS has undergone two revisions, including a major revision in 2015 which became UDS v3. The UDS encompasses data collected approximately annually at participating Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs) across the United States. It is a case-series rather than a population-based sample. Ethical approval for the conduct of the NACC study was obtained from each of ADCs’ Institutional Review Boards (IRB). Detailed descriptions of UDS can be found in other studies (20–22).

We restricted our cohort to subjects who had a minimum of 2 visits at ADCs between September 2005 and December 2019, were aged ≥50 years and had normal cognition at baseline (i.e., their first ADC visit) (n = 10,835). Patients were followed until dropout or first diagnosis of dementia where AD was considered primary or contributory pathology (probable or possible). Those who developed dementia where AD was not considered a primary or contributory clinical etiology were excluded (n=96). This left a baseline sample of 10,739 participants for our primary analysis.

Study Variables

Cognition and AD

Normal cognition in this study was defined as having normal cognitive testing scores and a global CDR® Dementia Staging Instrument score of 0. Global CDR was completed by the clinician or trained health professional based on the participant’s behavioral and neurological assessments and co-participant’s report, if available. Neuropsychological assessments consisted of a battery of validated instruments which have previously been described (23). AD etiologic diagnosis was made by a clinician or formal consensus panel based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/AD and Related Disorders Association criteria before 2015 (24), and the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association criteria from 2015 onwards (25). Total Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (using D-L-R-O-W) was also obtained at baseline (available in UDS form C1: Neuropsychological Battery Summary Scores, versions 1 and 2).

Depression

Depression was determined by “a clinician based on subject/informant report, medical records, and/or observation.” A history of depression was documented in the Subject Health History form (UDS form A5 (26)) based on the instructions to “include depressive disorders for which a clinician was consulted, whether or not treatment (behavioral or drug) was received. Depression includes major depressive disorder, situational depression, bipolar disorders, dysthymic disorders, and other depressive syndromes for which a clinician was consulted. Assessment can include DSM diagnoses, chart reviews, clinicians’ opinion, or whether the subject is taking an SSRI [serotonin reuptake inhibitor] for a depressive/mood disorder.”

Following the medical history interview with the subject and co-participant, clinician determined whether participant had “active depression in the last two years” or had “depression episodes more than two years ago” diagnosed or treated by a physician. We subcategorized participants into the following groups: (1) recent depression (active within the last two years) only, (2) remote depression (active more than two years ago) only, (3) depression active both in the last two years and more than two years ago, or (4) no history of depression. The “(4) no history of depression” group was used as the reference in calculating hazard ratios in survival analyses. These groupings were created using depression variables obtained from the Subject Health History form (UDS form A5).

Medical comorbidities, medications &amp; health behaviors

Medical comorbidities were collected using the Subject Health History form (UDS form A5). A medical condition was considered to be present if it occurred within the last year, requires active management, or existed in the past. The following conditions were considered in the study analysis: hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, heart attack/cardiac arrest, stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) &amp; vitamin B12 deficiency. Other possible risk factors including years of smoking, history of alcohol abuse, hearing and visual impairments and the presence of ∈4 allele in apolipoprotein E (APOE) were included. Years of smoking and history of alcohol abuse were obtained from the Subject Health History form (UDS form A5). Hearing and visual impairments (without aids) and were noted by the clinician as per Subject Physical Evaluation form (UDS form B5). APOE information was obtained from individual ADCs and reported to NACC using the NACC Neuropathology form (27), with some additional APOE information reported by the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADCG) and the National Institute of Aging Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease Data Storage Site (NCRAD). Moreover, the current use of antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and/or hormonal therapy (estrogen and/or progestin) was also taken into consideration. This medication information was recorded by the clinician or ADC staff (UDS form A4). This includes all prescription medications that were taken by the subject within two weeks of intake assessment.

Statistical Analyses

Baseline demographic and clinical data were compared between groups that developed dementia due to AD and did not develop dementia using the Pearson’s chi-squared test and analysis of variance for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether depression was an independent risk factor for incident AD. In this survival analysis, the outcome of interest was survival free time until first diagnosis of AD or dropout (i.e., duration in follow up during which AD was not detected). All cases lost to follow up (for any cause) are censored when they drop out. Bivariate analyses were first performed to determine which variables were associated with increased risk of AD. Significantly associated variables along with depression variables were then tested for multicollinearity (tolerance &lt; 0.4 as a cut-point) and included in the final multivariable model.

We then conducted sex-stratified multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses to determine whether the association between depression and incident AD was significant in women and men separately. An interaction term was also created for sex and recent depression to determine if sex interacted significantly with depression to increase risk of AD. This interaction term was added into a multivariable Cox regression along with individual main effect terms (sex and depression) and significantly associated variables from the multivariable analysis.

Individual regression results were reported in terms of hazard ratios (HR), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). All statistical analyses, except testing the assumption of proportional hazards, were conducted using SPSS v23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The assumption of proportional hazards was tested and confirmed via Schoenfeld residuals using R version 3.6.1. Censoring at the last date of contact was used to account for participants who had not received a diagnosis of AD before loss to follow up. A p-value (P) &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant for all analyses.

Results:

A total of 10,739 study participants at baseline were followed for a median duration of 55.3 months (range = 0.2–169.6 months). Over this time, 652 developed AD. Comparison of baseline clinical and demographic characteristics of the study sample across the four depression subgroups are outlined in Table 1. Compared to individuals without history of depression, individuals with any history of depression were more likely to be female, have history of vitamin B12 deficiency, have history of alcohol abuse, take antidepressants, anxiolytics, hormonal therapy, have lower mean age, higher baseline MMSE score, and more years of smoking. Subjects with recent depression had the lowest mean years of education and were more likely to have visual impairment and hypercholesterolemia compared to other depression subgroups.

Survival Analyses

In unadjusted bivariate survival analyses (Table 2), individuals who had recent depression had an increased risk of AD (HR = 1.48; 95%CI, 1.14–1.92; P=0.004). In an adjusted multivariable survival analysis, we found that recent depression only but not a remote history of depression was associated with increased risk of AD (HR = 1.98; 95% CI, 1.50–2.61; P&lt;0.0005) (Table 3, Figure 1). Older age, lower MMSE score, History of stroke/TIA, heart attack, and the presence of APOE ∈4 allele were also associated with increased risk of AD (Table 3). In survival analyses stratified by sex, recent depression was significantly associated with increased risk of AD in women only (HR=2.27; 95%CI, 1.66–3.09; P&lt;0.0005) (Table 4).

Interaction between depression and sex

When an interaction term between recent depression and sex was added in the separate multivariable Cox regression with significant variables from Table 3, no significant interaction between sex and recent depression for the risk for AD was observed (HR=1.45; 95%CI, 0.76–2.77; P=0.256).

Discussion:

In this study, we found that older adults with normal cognition at baseline and with a history of recent depression (within the last 2 years) had approximate two-fold increased risk of subsequent AD compared to those without a history of depression. Furthermore, only individuals with recent depression, but not individuals with remote depression (before 2 years ago), had a significantly higher risk of developing AD. We also found in survival analyses stratified by sex that recent depression was associated with two-fold increased risk of AD in women only. The adjusted HRs of 2.0 in the overall sample and women only are equivalent to a medium effect size in terms of Cohen’s d (28), indicating moderate clinical significance.

These findings are in line with previous findings in this dataset (18, 29) and are similar to analyses in other datasets that found an increased risk for recent depression of similar magnitude (3, 5, 17). While remote and recent depression were not mutually exclusive in previous analyses (18, 29), our study separated individuals with recent and/or remote depression into three groups: (a) only recent depression (b) only remote depression (c) both recent and remote depression. We found that only those with recent depression had increased risk lending support to the hypothesis that depression in older adults occurs as part of behavioral prodrome of AD, rather than being a true risk factor. This is consistent with a number of other studies that have documented a relationship between depression in late life and AD but failed to find an association with a more remote history of depression (3–5, 17, 30, 31). Conversely other studies with long durations of follow up have documented associations between depressive episodes in earlier life and subsequent increased risk of dementia (32, 33). Some variability in findings may be attributable to differences in how studies defined early onset depression or how far back the behavioral prodrome of AD may be considered to extend. For example, a more recent cohort study with over 28 years of follow up found a positive association between depression and increased risk of dementia only for those with depressive symptoms 11 years prior to dementia diagnosis but not before that time (17). These findings do not preclude the possibility that depression and AD have shared causes. We also have limited understanding of how depression interacts with the neuropathology of AD and several studies indicating accelerated decline when depression is comorbid (34). Those with persistent or treatment resistant depressive symptoms are at particularly increased risk (35).

We also found that increased risk with recent depression was present in women only. A previous study in a hospital-based population with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) at baseline found a positive association in women but not men (36). Conversely, several population-based studies have reported a positive association between depression and risk of AD in men only (30, 37, 38). Conflicting findings may reflect variable distribution of associated risk factors in different populations and use of varying methodology to assess depression. To assess whether sex truly modifies risk of depression upon AD, we conducted a moderator analysis but did not find that there was a significant interaction between sex and depression on risk of AD. This is similar to some previous studies that have examined this (32, 38). This raises the possibility that variable distribution of other risk factors not accounted for in this analysis could account for the observed association. A recent review of depression and sex related increased risk of AD concluded that few studies had included adequate sex-segregated data to provide a meaningful analysis on this topic with conflicting findings in the small number of available studies (19).

With regard to vascular conditions such as previous heart attack or stroke/TIA, we found that these were associated with increased risk of AD as supported by other studies (18, 39). In stratified analyses, stroke/TIA remained significantly associated in men while heart attack was predictive in women. Older age, presence of APOE ∈4 allele and lower MMSE scores were independent predictors of subsequent AD development in both sexes. While the hazard ratios of baseline cognition and age were comparable between the sexes, the hazard ratio for APOE ∈4 allele status was greater, but not significantly so, in women compared to men. We note that in a previous study, the effect of APOE ∈4 allele on conversion to MCI/AD was stronger in women than men with a significant interaction between APOE ∈4 allele and sex (40).

This study has several strengths. Firstly, our study is one of few that examines multiple risk factors for AD and we were therefore able to adjust for a range of confounders. Dementia diagnoses were based upon standardized diagnostic criteria in specialist memory clinic settings. It is also one of the largest among the limited published literature that examines the impact of sex and incorporates a moderator analysis to examine whether sex modifies the effect of depression on the risk of developing AD. Our study also has limitations that merit consideration. The number, severity, and length of previous depressive episodes were unknown. Age at first onset of depression was unknown. Depression diagnosis was not based on diagnostic interview although was determined by specialist clinicians familiar with diagnosis and assessment of depression in the course of a standardized assessment. The CDR score was not based on structured interview although staff received training regarding administration. We also did not have data regarding other variables such as physical activity, age at menopause and depression subtype, which may contribute differentially to the risk of developing AD (4, 14, 41, 42). The NACC dataset is a clinic-based sample and is best described as a case series, hence the findings may not be generalizable to community populations. A proportion of patients were lost to follow up for causes that could not be determined but a survival analysis technique was employed to compensate for this limitation.

In conclusion, we found that a recent but not remote depression was associated with increased risk of AD and that this risk was significant only among women in sex-stratified analyses. We did not observe a significant interaction between sex and depression on subsequent risk of AD suggesting that variable distribution of other sex related variables not accounted for in this analysis could account for the excess risk associated with depression here. Future analyses should determine if these findings extend to other populations and may be explained by variable distribution of neurobiological or other modifiable risk factors between the sexes.
