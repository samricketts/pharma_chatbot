The pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains largely unclear. Exploring the genetic/epigenetic loci showing pleiotropic association with the neuropathologies of AD may greatly enhance understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of AD. In this study, using data from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), we undertook a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach integrating GWAS and DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) data to explore pleiotropic epigenetic loci for AD neuropathologies, including amyloid-β- (Aβ) load and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangle density. We performed GWAS of DNA methylation in brain tissues from 592 participants and mapped 60,595 cis-SNP-CpG pairs after correction for multiple-testing. By linking cis- mQTL with GWAS results for Aβ load and Tau tangles, we identified 47 CpGs showing pleiotropic association with Aβ load by MR analysis. We then used gene expression data from 537 individuals and performed quantitative trait methylation (QTM) analysis. We found that 18 of the 47 CpGs were in cis associated with 25 mRNAs/genes, comprising 41 unique CpG-mRNA/gene pairs. Our findings shed light on the role of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of Aβ.

Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease and a major cause of disability, affects patients’ quality of life and brings a tremendous economic burden to the society (Alzheimer’s Association, 2016; GBD 2017 DALYs and HALE Collaborators, 2018). Neuropathologically, AD brains contain an extracellular buildup composed of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and intraneuronal accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (Congdon and Sigurdsson, 2018; Ising and Heneka, 2018; Jansen et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020). However, the exact neuropathogenesis of AD remains to be unclear. Therefore, it is important to further explore the pathological mechanisms underlying AD and identify genetic/epigenetic loci showing pleiotropic association of with AD neuropathologies.

Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed the complex genetic architecture of AD (Jansen et al., 2019; Lambert et al., 2013), the identified genetic variants only accounted for a portion of the heritability (Escott-Price et al., 2017; Sims et al., 2020). DNA methylation is an epigenetic marker that has been reported to play a key role in many biological processes and diseases (Ahuja et al., 2016; Horvath, 2012; Klose and Bird, 2006). Previous methylome-wide association studies (MWASs) have been successful in identifying DNA methylation loci/regions associated with AD neuropathologies. For example, multiple differentially methylated probes (DMPs) in ABCA7, B1N1 and SORL1, differentially methylated regions (DMRs), and variably methylated regions (VMRs) were found to be associated with the burden of AD neuropathologies or pathological diagnosis of AD (De Jager et al., 2014; Huo et al., 2019; Lunnon et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2018; Watson et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2015). However, these findings could be subject to confounding factors and reverse causation that might influence the results. As a result, more studies are needed to explore pleiotropic DNA methylation loci for AD neuropathologies.

It is a major public health goal to identify modifiable causes of a disease/disorder in order to develop effective interventions or therapeutic strategies. However, risk factors identified by conventional observational epidemiology studies were often found to be misleading because the findings were subject to confounding, reverse causation and selection bias (Lawlor et al., 2004; Lawlor and Smith, 2006). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often considered to be the gold standard to make pleiotropic inferences as all the characteristics, except the exposure of interest, are comparable among the groups (Bhide et al., 2018). However, conduction of RCTs is time-consuming, expensive, and in some cases, the allocation of exposure is unethical or impractical.

Mendelian randomization (MR) refers to methods that use proxy of modifiable risk factors to examine the pleiotropic effect of these risk factors on diseases/disorders by utilizing data from observational epidemiology studies without the need of conducting a conventional RCT (Emdin et al., 2017). MR uses instrumental variables (IVs) as the proxy to mimic randomization of individual to an exposure to ensure comparability of individuals with respect to known/unknown confounding factors, thereby enabling the estimation of a pleiotropic association with an outcome (Lawlor et al., 2008). Genetic variants are often used as the IVs because random allocation of alleles of genetic variants occur during gamete formation, well before the exposure or outcome. Estimation of the pleiotropic association can be made because the inherited genetic variants are independent of potentially confounding factors.

Recently, a novel analytical framework was applied to evaluate the pleiotropic association between DNA methylation levels and diseases that could minimize confounding and reverse causation through an MR approach integrating cis- DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (cis-mQTL) and GWAS data (Hannon et al., 2018; Hannon et al., 2017; Huan et al., 2019; Richardson et al., 2018; Richardson et al., 2017). Here, we adopted this novel MR approach to search for DNA methylation loci showing pleiotropic association with AD neuropathologies and to explore functional mechanisms underlying the association of genetic variants with AD neuropathologies.

Materials and methods

Study participants

Data for the present study were drawn from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), both of which are ongoing, prospective studies of brain aging and dementia in older individuals (Bennett et al., 2018; Bennett et al., 2012b). All participants were free of dementia at enrollment, and agreed to annual clinical evaluations and brain donation upon death. The clinical evaluation includes detailed neurologic examination and clinical classification of dementia and AD (Bennett et al., 2018). Postmortem human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissues were obtained from deceased participants to measure DNA methylation, gene expression and neuropathological protein. More details regarding the design of ROSMAP study can be found in previous publications (Bennett et al., 2018; Bennett et al., 2012a; Bennett et al., 2012b).

Written informed consent was obtained from participants at the beginning of each study as was an Anatomical Gift Act. Participants also signed a repository consent to allow their data to be re-purposed. Both studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Rush University Medical Center. The ethics approval was given in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The clinical data can be requested at https://www.radc.rush.edu/ and the omics data can be requested at https://www.synapse.org/.

Assessment of neuropathological phenotypes

All the data used in our analyses were collected by ROSMAP study. The collection of whole blood and brain tissues was described previously (Bennett et al., 2018). Detailed procedures for postmortem brain examination and neuropathological phenotyping have been described previously (Yu et al., 2015). In brief, neuropathological hallmarks including amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) were quantified across the brain in both studies. Aβ protein was identified by molecularly-specific immunohistochemistry and quantified by imaging analysis, with values being summarized as percent area occupied by Aβ. Aβ scores in eight regions (i.e., hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, midfrontal cortex, inferior temporal, angular gyrus, calcarine cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and superior frontal cortex) were averaged. Tau protein was identified by molecularly specific immunohistochemistry (antibodies to abnormally phosphorylated Tau protein, AT8). Cortical density (per mm2) was determined using systematic sampling. Tau scores in the same eight regions were averaged. Both indices were square root transformed to approach a normal distribution. More information is available at https://www.radc.rush.edu.

Genotyping and genotype imputation

Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. Detailed information regarding the pipeline of quality control of the genotyping data was reported in a previous publication (De Jager et al., 2012; Ng et al., 2017). Dosages for all SNPs (&gt;35 million) was imputed on the 1000 Genomes reference using BEAGLE 3.3.2. Imputed SNPs were filtered based on minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt; 0.01 and imputation INFO score&gt; 0.3, yielding 7,321,515 imputed SNPs that were used for further cis-mQTL mapping.

DNA methylation profiling

DNA methylation data were generated using the 450K Illumina array from DLPFC, and quality control was conducted as described previously (Ng et al., 2017). A total of 420,131 methylation sites (i.e., CpGs) remained after quality control, and all data had been adjusted for age at death, sex, and experimental batch (De Jager et al., 2014).

Gene expression data

Gene expression data were generated using RNA-seq from DLPFC at an average sequence depth of 90 million reads. Detailed description of the data generation and processing was described previously (Ng et al., 2017). Only highly expressed genes were kept (mean expression &gt; 2log2(FPKM)), resulting in 55,889 mRNA and 50,999 expressed genes.

Statistical and bioinformatics analysis

Using data collected from ROSMAP study, we undertook an MR approach which included a series of analyses, as outlined below, to examine the pleiotropic association of DNA methylation with AD neuropathologies. We first performed a genome-wide mQTL analysis to identify SNPs associated with DNA methylation in participants with both genetic and DNA methylation data. The cis-mQTL analysis followed a similar approach to the one described in a previous study (Hannon et al., 2018). In brief, linear regression was performed to test the association between each SNP and CpG, with each individual CpG as the dependent variable and each individual SNP as the independent variable, adjusted for the first three principal components. In total, 7,321,515 imputed genetic variants against each of the 420,131 eligible CpGs were tested by using the R package “MatrixEQTL”. SNPs within 1 Mb of a CpG site showing significant association with the CpG (known as cis-mQTLs) were identified. We applied a conservative multiple testing correction to define cis-mQTLs (i.e., 0.05/number of SNP-CpG pairs=1.35×10−10) to reduce weak instrument bias in the MR analysis. In the case of multiple variants showing significant association with the same individual CpG, we chose the cis-mQTL variant with the smallest P-value as the instrumental variable (IV) for the CpG site. We then performed GWAS for AD neuropathologies, including amyloid-β- (Aβ) load and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangle density, adjusted for age at death, sex, education and the first three principal components. MR was undertaken with DNA methylation as the exposure, AD neuropathology as the outcome, and cis-mQTL as the IV. The analysis was done using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as implemented in the mr_ivw function of the R package “MendelianRandomization” (Yavorska and Burgess, 2017). In the context of a single genetic variant as the IV, this is equivalent to a Wald ratio approach which allows distinct or overlapping samples to be used for the genetic association analysis in MR (Teumer, 2018). The weight was set to be delta to include the second-order term from the delta expansion in the calculation of the standard error of the estimate. We used the observed correlation between DNA methylation and the corresponding AD neuropathology to account for the correlation between genetic association with DNA methylation and genetic association AD neuropathologies due to sample overlap (Yavorska and Burgess, 2017) (see the supplementary file for the R and shell codes used for the analyses). We used false discovery rate (FDR) to adjust for multiple testing.

We performed the heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) test, as provided in Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) (Zhu et al., 2016), to test the existence of linkage in the observed association. Rejection of the null hypothesis (i.e., PHEIDI&lt;0.05) indicates that the observed association in MR might be due to two distinct genetic variants in high linkage disequilibrium with each other.

In addition, a cis- mRNA- quantitative trait methylation (QTM) analysis was performed to explore the association between the identified CpGs and gene expression in participants with both DNA methylation and gene expression data. A cis-CpG-mRNA pair was defined as the target CpG residing in ± 10 kb of the corresponding gene encoding the mRNA (FDR P&lt;0.05). In brief, linear regression was performed to test the association between each CpG and mRNA, with each individual mRNA as the dependent variable and each individual CpG as the independent variable, adjusted for age at death, sex, education and postmortem interval.

The annotations of transcripts were based on the Affymetrix exon array S1.0 platforms. To functionally annotate putative transcripts, we conducted functional enrichment analysis using the functional annotation tool “Metascape” (Zhou et al., 2019) and the gene concept network analysis using the R package “clusterProfiler” (Yu et al., 2012) for the genes harboring the identified CpGs and the cis-associated genes, separately. Gene symbols corresponding to putative genes (P&lt;0.05) were used as the input of the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis.

Data cleaning and statistical/bioinformatical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Chicago, IL, USA), R version 4.0.0 (https://www.r-project.org/), PLINK 1.9 (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/) and SMR (https://cnsgenomics.com/software/smr/).

Results

The characteristics of the included participants

Fig. 1 is the flow chart showing the different stages of our analysis. Among the 1,708 participants who had genetic data, 1312 died during follow up (mean age at death: 89.61±6.42; male: 33.1%), and 1168 participants had brain neuropathology data, of whom 764 (65.4%) were diagnosed as having pathological AD. A total of 740 participants had methylation data and 542 participants had gene expression data. Pairwise association analyses between genetic variants and DNA methylation were performed for 592 participants who had both genotype and methylation data (mean age at death: 88.26±6.47; male: 36.4%) for further cis-mQTLs mapping and MR analysis. The cis paired association tests of the identified pleiotropic CpGs with mRNAs were performed in 537 participants (mean age at death: 88.44±6.70; male: 36.9%).

Putative pleiotropic CpGs for AD neuropathology

We identified more than 370 million cis- mQTL SNPs at P &lt; 0.05 and found that 60,595 CpGs had at least one cis-mQTL SNP (P&lt;1.35×10−10; Fig. 2). We therefore selected the cis-mQTL variant with the smallest P-value as the IV for each CpG in the MR testing.

We undertook 60,595 tests to evaluate the pleiotropic associations between genetically determined DNA methylation and AD neuropathologies to explore putative pleiotropic effect of DNA methylation on AD neuropathology. MR analysis identified 47 pleiotropic associations between genetically determined CpGs and Aβ load, including 44 positive associations and 3 negative associations with Aβ load, but no significant pleiotropic association between genetically determined CpGs and Tau tangles (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 3).

Of the 47 identified CpGs, 26 were located in the intragenic region with approximately 70% located in gene body (including 5’UTR, coding sequence [CDS], intron and 3’UTR) and 30% in the transcription start site (TSS), and the remaining 21 in intergenic regions (Supplementary Table 2). Examination by chromatin states revealed that most of the identified CpGs were in strong transcription and promoter sites. More information of the pleiotropic CpGs can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

Association of the pleiotropic CpGs with mRNAs

To further dissect the relationship between DNA methylation and Aβ load, we evaluated the influence of the methylation levels on gene expression. We identified 774 CpG-mRNA pairs using cis- mRNA-QTM analysis. Among the 47 CpGs, 18 CpGs were in cis associated with 25 mRNAs involved in 25 genes comprising 41 CpG-mRNA/gene pairs (Table 2). We found that 24 CpGs were positively associated with mRNAs, and 17 CpGs negatively associated with mRNAs.

Pathway analysis/Functional informatics

GO enrichment analysis of biological process, molecular function, and cellular component pathways showed that the genes harboring the identified CpGs were involved in four GO terms, including nervous system development (R-HSA-9675108), forebrain development (GO:0030900), signaling by TGF-beta Receptor complex (R-HSA-170834), and stress-activated MAPK cascade (GO:0051403; Figure 4A). Concept network analysis of genes harboring the identified CpGs revealed multiple domains related with neuron generation, development and differentiation (Fig. 4B). GO enrichment analysis of cis-associated genes identified only one significant GO term of Golgi vesicle transport (GO:0048193; Fig. 4C). Concept network analysis of cis-associated genes revealed domains associated with leukocyte deregulation and DNA damage recognition (Fig. 4D). More information can be found in Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 3–4.

Discussion

In this study, we integrated GWAS and mQTL data in MR analysis to explore putative pleiotropic DNA methylation loci for AD neuropathology. We identified 47 pleiotropic DNA methylation loci for Aβ load. Among the 47 CpGs, 18 CpGs were associated in cis with 25 mRNAs involved in 25 genes comprising 41 CpG-mRNA/gene pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine putative pleiotropic epigenetic loci for AD neuropathology through an MR approach.

Evidence is accumulating that DNA methylation is related to AD (De Jager et al., 2014; Huo et al., 2019; Lunnon et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2015). However, previous studies focusing on exploring the association between differential DNA methylation and AD are prone to confounding and reverse causation (Dekkers et al., 2016; Huo et al., 2019; Wahl et al., 2017). As a result, some disease-associated CpGs from MWAS may reflect the influence of the diseases on DNA methylation rather than the pleiotropic effects of DNA methylation on the diseases. By contrast, MR incorporates cis-mQTL information into GWAS analyses and has the potential to increase the power of GWAS in identifying pleiotropic loci associated with complex diseases (Hannon et al., 2018; Hannon et al., 2017; Richardson et al., 2017). This novel analytical framework that integrates GWAS and mQTL data in MR analysis enabled us to identify multiple epigenetic loci that showed pleiotropic relationship with Aβ load, indicating that DNA methylation resides along the pleiotropic pathway linking genetic variants with AD neuropathology.

Some of the casual CpGs identified in our study have been reported to be associated with Aβ load or AD related risk factors. For example, the epigenetic locus cg24523650 in EIF2AK2 was associated with Aβ load by a previous EWAS study of AD neuropathology (Huo et al., 2019). Two other methylation loci, cg08152546 and cg13180678 which reside in or are close to CENPV, were associated with aging (Florath et al., 2014; Weidner et al., 2014), a major risk factor for AD. In addition, we identified several pleiotropic epigenetic loci, such as cg00473245 in RAB20 and cg27036936 in KIAA1462, that were associated with metabolism-related disorders such as metabolic syndrome, obesity and diabetes (Akinyemiju et al., 2018; Nilsson et al., 2014). Increasing evidence suggests epidemiological and pathological links between AD and metabolic traits (Jansen et al., 2019; Sims et al., 2020). Previous research identified common genetic architectures shared between AD and metabolic traits, and shed light on molecular mechanisms underlying the association between AD and metabolic dysregulation (Zhu et al., 2019). Whether and how these identified epigenetic loci affect the risk of AD via metabolic pathways warrants further investigation.

Some of the genes harboring the identified CpGs were reported to be involved in the development of the nervous system or AD neuropathologies. For example, we identified cg20829347 in SOX1 as a pleiotropic epigenetic site for Aβ load. SOX1 encodes a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors, and was reported to be involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of cell fate (Berger et al., 2016). SOX1 plays an important role in regulating neurogenesis in the nervous system (Kan et al., 2004). In addition, we found cg05090851 in UBB as a pleiotropic epigenetic site for Aβ load. UBB encodes ubiquitin, which has a major role in targeting cellular proteins for degradation and is also involved in the maintenance of chromatin structure, regulation of gene expression, and stress response (Grumati and Dikic, 2018). An aberrant form of ubiquitin was found to be accumulated in brain tissues of AD patients (Munari et al., 2018).

Although it is widely hypothesized that DNA methylation could influence gene expression, its relationship with transcriptional activity in influencing AD neuropathology is not fully understood. We found that two of the identified CpGs (cg18975376 and cg03325931) were associated with the expression of BAMBI which encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein related to transforming growth factor beta type I (TGF-β1) family (Bai et al., 2017). It was found that impairment of TGF-β1 signaling was associated with exacerbated Aβ deposition and neurofibrillary tangle formation (Estrada et al., 2018). In addition, many of the identified pleiotropic CpGs for Aβ load showed in cis association with genes that might be involved in AD neuropathologies. For example, cg04480325, cg04521224 and cg06480171, located in the intergenic region, were associated in cis with the expression of QPCT which encodes human pituitary glutaminyl cyclase and is responsible for the presence of pyroglutamyl residues in many neuroendocrine peptides. It was found that lowering QPCT expression could reduce the amount of pyroglutamate-amyloid-β, a major constituent of Aβ deposits in human AD (Alexandru et al., 2011).

We also found that some of identified pleiotropic CpGs were in cis associated with genes which have not been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. For example, cg20577663 in CDRT4 was in cis associated with the expression of ADORA2B which encodes an adenosine receptor. Adenosine receptor signaling plays important roles in normal physiology, and was reported to be involved in cardiovascular diseases (Geldenhuys et al., 2017; Gile and Eckle, 2016; Novotný, 2015). In addition, cg24523650 in EIF2AK2 was in cis associated with the expression of STRN which encodes striatin, a cell–cell junctional protein involved in maintaining correct cell adhesion (Lahav-Ariel et al., 2019). More studies are needed to reveal the exact function of these genes in the development of AD neuropathology.

Our study has some strengths. The Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging projects have similar procedures in the collection of ‘omics’ data and pathologic data, which allows various types of data to be merged for analyses that may have small to moderate effects. The MR approach greatly reduced confounding bias and reverse causation. Therefore, the identified DNA methylation loci likely represent some ‘true’ pleiotropic epigenetic markers for AD neuropathology. The ROSMAP studies have a very high rate of participation in the follow up and autopsy, which reduced bias from selective attrition. We only included study participants of European ancestry in our analyses and controlled for the first three principal components the cis-mQTL analysis; therefore, population stratification is less likely to be a problem.

Our study also has some limitations. Our MR analysis was based on the following four assumptions: 1) the genotype is associated with DNA methylation; 2) the genotype is not associated with confounding factors that bias the associations between DNA methylation and amyloid-β load; 3) the genotype is related to amyloid-β load only via its association with DNA methylation; and 4) all the associations are linear and unaffected by statistical interaction. In the cis-mQTL analysis, we filtered genetic variants with conservative multiple testing, and chose the genetic variant with the smallest P-value for each CpG, minimizing the concern of weak IV (assumption 1). Non-association of genotype with confounders is often based on the biological belief that the genotype will not be associated with socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics that commonly confound the effects of exposure (i.e., DNA methylation) on the outcome (i.e., amyloid-β load) (Lawlor et al., 2008). Moreover, we used data from the same studies in obtaining both genotype-DNA methylation and genotype- amyloid-β load estimates, further alleviating the concern about violation of assumption 2 (Lawlor et al., 2008). Regarding assumption 3, we acknowledge that with the use of single-variant-based MR method, we could not rule out the possibility of horizontal pleiotropy which could distort the MR results. A recent study found that horizontal pleiotropy was detectable in approximately 50% of significant causal relationships in MR, and could induce severe distortions in MR estimates as well as around 10% of false positive causal relationships (Verbanck et al., 2018). We performed HEIDI test and found that of the 47 identified CpGs, the test was available for 16 CpGs. The HEIDI test was not significant for most CpGs except one (cg03671802 in RAX; Supplementary Table 1), indicating that these observed associations were less likely subject to horizontal pleiotropy. However, caution should still be executed in interpreting the MR results because the HEIDI test was not feasible for the remaining identified CpGs. It is often difficult to validate the linearity assumption (Lawlor et al., 2008). Violation of the assumption is not essential when the purpose is to test the null hypothesis of no effect of the exposure (e.g., DNA methylation) on the outcome (e.g., amyloid-β load), but can cause problems when the purpose is to estimate the size of the effect. We adopted correction for multiple testing to reduce false positive rate; however, we may have missed important SNPs or methylation loci. Moreover, our pathway analysis only included pleiotropic methylation loci in association with gene expression, and we did not consider other methylation loci that could also affect the development of Aβ. More studies are needed to systematically explore the role of DNA methylation in influencing transcriptional activity in the neuropathogenesis of AD.

In conclusion, by performing multi-stage analyses incorporating GWAS and mQTL data through an MR approach, we identified multiple pleiotropic DNA methylation loci for Aβ load. Our findings shed light on the role of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of Aβ load. Future studies are needed to validate our findings and elucidate the exact functions of the identified epigenetic loci and the associated genes in the development of AD neuropathology.

Highlights

We aimed to search for pleiotropic DNA methylation loci for neuropathologies of AD.

We adopted a Mendelian randomization approach integrating GWAS and DNA methylation quantitative trait loci data.

We identified 47 pleiotropic CpGs for Aβ load but none for neurofibrillary tangles.

Some CpGs were found related with Aβ load and others represent novel epigenetic loci.

Many identified CpGs were associated in cis with mRNAs involved in nervous system or AD neuropathologies.
