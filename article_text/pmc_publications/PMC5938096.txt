INTRODUCTION

Characterizing progression in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is critically important for early detection and targeted treatment. The objective was to develop a prognostic model, based on multivariate longitudinal makers, for predicting progression-free survival in patients with mild cognitive impairment.

METHODS

The information contained in multiple longitudinal makers was extracted using multivariate functional principle components analysis and used as predictors in the Cox regression models. Cross-validation was used for selecting the best model based on ADNI-1. External validation was conducted on ADNI-2.

RESULTS

Model comparison yielded a prognostic index computed as the weighted combination of historical information of five neurocognitive longitudinal markers that are routinely collected in observational studies. The comprehensive validity analysis provided solid evidence of the usefulness of the model for predicting AD progression.

DISCUSSION

The prognostic model was improved by incorporating multiple longitudinal makers. It is useful for monitoring disease and identifying patients for clinical trial recruitment.

1. Introduction

The growing public health threat posed by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has raised the urgency to discover and assess prognostic markers for the early detection of the disease. In this regard, a great deal of effort has been dedicated to building models for predicting AD based on a single marker, or a combination of multiple markers, which captures the heterogeneity among subjects and detects the disease progression of subjects at risk [1].

Since mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a risk state for AD, existing research has identified a number of biomarkers that predict clinical changes of MCI patients [2–7], including neurocognitive markers, neuroimaging markers, genetics, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based markers. Although these studies showed an enhancement of the prognostic value when multivariate markers are considered, the prediction was either qualitative change (i.e., conversion from MCI to AD as a binary response) or quantitative change (i.e., cognitive scores) in the next few years. These studies did not examine the prediction of time from MCI to AD, which is usually the primary outcome in prevention clinical studies of AD [8].

Relatively few recent studies have investigated the timing from MCI to AD over the duration of follow-up based on Cox regression models [9–11]. These studies assessed the predictive utility of various candidate prognostic markers independently or in combination, but only focused on the baseline measurements of the markers. Li, et al. [12] developed a joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data technique to examine the comparative utility of the longitudinal markers in determining the risk of incident AD conversion at future time points. However, they analyzed each longitudinal marker independently because of the limitation of the current state-of-the-art joint modeling software. To our knowledge, no prior study has leveraged multiple longitudinal markers and time-to-event information jointly to investigate the prognosis of Alzheimer’s disease.

The overarching goal of this study is to develop a prognostic model, which relies on serial measurements of multiple markers, for predicting progression-free survival in patients with MCI. The prognostic model uses several cutting-edge statistical methods, which enable it to facilitate clinical decision-making based on all the information collected. We evaluated the model using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1), a public dataset that is well suitable for this task because of its large sample size, breadth of markers, and prospective structure. The combined prognostic value of longitudinal neurocognitive tests, neuroimaging, genetics, and CSF markers was assessed using the prognostic model. External validation of the model is carried out on ADNI-2 to demonstrate the usefulness of the model across studies. The main output of the prognostic model is a prognostic index which can be updated over time as new measurements are available. Such an index is useful for monitoring disease progression for MCI patients and to enrich clinical trials with subjects likely to develop AD in the timeframe of the trial.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Study population

Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal observational study investigating whether serial brain imaging, clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Detailed information regarding the ADNI study procedures, including participant inclusion and exclusion criteria and the complete study protocol can be found at http://www.adni-info.org. The ADNI-1 dataset included 379 patients with amnestic MCI at baseline evaluation who had at least one follow-up visit. Criteria for MCI diagnosis were the same as defined by Petersen et al. [13]. As part of the ADNI-1, subjects were assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months, and continued follow-ups were conducted annually as part of the ADNI-2. The ADNI-2 study had the same overall goals as ADNI-1. ADNI-2 enrolled an additional group of 424 patients in early MCI, late MCI, and significant memory concern, with at least one follow-up visit and collected over 4-year worth of longitudinal data. We considered all these subjects as MCI patients in our analysis. All subjects were given a written informed consent at the time of enrollment, and the study has been approved by the local institutional review board at all participating sites. The data are publically available at http://ida.loni.ucla.edu and were downloaded on April 15, 2017.

In the present study, the candidate prognostic factors were the longitudinal neurocognitive and imaging markers with the strongest predictive utility identified by Li, et al. [12], and are available in both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets: Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive 13 items (ADAS-Cog 13); Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT immediate: sum of 5 trials; RAVLT learning: trial 5 – trial 1); Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ); Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE); volumetric data of middle temporal gyrus (MidTemp) and hippocampus from structural magnetic resonance imaging; and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). We also considered cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, total tau (t-tau) and amyloid-beta 1–42 peptide (Aβ42), which have been identified as being amongst the most promising and informative AD biomarkers [14,15]. Relevant demographic and genetic variables (i.e., age, gender, education and APOE genotype) were employed as other prognostic variables given their potential effects on disease progression in AD [16]. Sample size and descriptive statistics for key variables at baseline are shown in Table 1.

2.2 Statistical analysis

We adopted a novel method to jointly model the historical observations of markers as well as time-to-event of interest (e.g. conversion from MCI diagnosis to AD diagnosis) using a functional principal component (FPC) approach and Cox regression model [17,18]. The observed longitudinal values of a specific marker were assumed to come from a latent longitudinal process. The FPC analysis (FPCA) was employed to extract the trajectory pattern of the process [19]. The overall trend and changing patterns of the marker were estimated from the entire sample. Each marker trajectory of an individual was summarized as a set of FPC scores. This approach has the advantage of handling missed, irregularly observed data, measurement errors, and no pre-specified form of the longitudinal trajectory [19]. Because the longitudinal markers of interest were all associated with AD and are likely to be highly correlated, a non-negligible correlation may exist between the FPC scores that derived individually from each longitudinal maker. The correlated scores can lead to interpretation difficulty and multicollinearity issues in the regression analysis. To address this issue, we adopted a multivariate FPC (MFPC) approach [20], which extends the FPC approach by accounting for the correlation among multiple longitudinal makers. We used the MFPC scores, which capture the essential information in the multiple longitudinal markers, as new prognostic factors for predicting risk of event in a survival model. The statistical approach is detailed in the Appendix A.

We first used the ADNI-1 dataset to investigate whether multivariate longitudinal markers, compared to baseline values of the markers, could enhance the predictive performance of AD conversion in terms of discriminating patients with high and low risk. We did not thoroughly explore every possible combination of the markers, but mainly focused on the five that have strong comparative predictive value and are commonly measured in studies of Alzheimer’s disease, i.e., ADAS-Cog 13, RAVLT immediate, RAVLT learning, FAQ, and MMSE. Two preplanned Cox regression models were specified, with the first model (Model 1) including only baseline observation of the five markers, and the second model (Model 2) incorporated the longitudinal information of the five markers by including the multivariate FPC scores derived from the longitudinal markers of interest. We selected the first 12 MFPC scores which account for at least 95% total variation in the five longitudinal markers. We also included baseline age, gender, education years and number of the APOE ε4 alleles as covariates in both models. Since the exact date of conversion from MCI to AD was not known, the survival endpoint was defined as the date of the first follow-up with an AD diagnosis. Subjects that did not convert were censored at the date of their last interview. The two models were specified as

(1) hi(t)=h0(t)exp{γ1baselineAgei+γ2genderi+γ3educationi+γ4APOEε4i+γ5ADAS-Cog13i+γ6RAVLT.immei+γ7RAVLT.learni+γ8FAQi+γ9MMSEi};

(2) hi(t)=h0(t)exp{γ1baselineAgei+γ2genderi+γ3educationi+γ4APOEε4i+∑p=112βpMFPCscoresip},

where h0(t) was the baseline hazard function, γi and βp were regression coefficients. There was no error term in Cox model as the randomness was implicit to the survival process. The MFPCscoresi were calculated from the subject i’s longitudinal measures that collected prior to the visit of AD diagnosis or censoring. It is worth mentioning that MFPCscoresi can be calculated for subjects with only baseline observation, but repeated measures may provide more precise information for risk prediction. For a comprehensive comparison, we also investigated the predictive ability of baseline imaging markers by including hippocampal volume, MidTemporal volume, and FDG-PET in addition to the five baseline neurocognitive markers in Model 1. We refer this model as Model 1a.

We assessed the performance of each prognostic model using an integrated area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (iAUC; range 0 ~ 1, higher is better) [21]. We consider iAUC = 0.78 to be an acceptable predictive performance as suggested in the previous study [23]. We also used integrated Brier score [22] (lower is better) as a calibration tool to assess the agreement between the predicted and true risks. To avoid overestimation of the predictive performance, we conducted a 10-fold cross validation (CV) for survival model [24]. The 10-fold CV process was repeated 100 times to account for the variation due to data splitting. To provide a benchmark for comparison, internal validation for ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 was performed using repeated 10-fold CV. For the external validation, parameter estimations from ADNI-1 were used to calculate the performance measures for ADNI-2. To conduct comparable MFPC analyses, the longitudinal trajectories in ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets were defined on the same time domain with the largest follow-up time in ADNI-1 as the upper bound.

In the second analysis, the structural form of Model 2 was used to evaluate changes to the performance of the model as additional longitudinal markers were added. In addition to the five neurocognitive-based longitudinal markers used in the first analysis, we included three longitudinal imaging markers: hippocampal volume, MidTemporal volume, FDG-PET, to calculate MFPC scores. Because only a subset of subjects had all the markers, we conducted model comparisons by restricting subjects to those with all eight markers. We also investigated the additional predictive value of CSF biomarkers based on subjects whose CSF data were collected in addition to imaging markers. We only considered the baseline CSF biomarkers in the analysis, because only a small number of subjects in ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 had at least two CSF observations.

Based on the estimated Cox model (2), prognostic index (PIADNI) for each patient was computed as the weighted combination of the regression coefficients and the prognostic variables (Equation 3).

(3) PIADNI=γ1baselineAgei+γ2genderi+γ3educationi+γ4APOEε4i+∑p=112βpMFPCscorelp

In the external validation, the parameters estimated from ADNI-1 were used to compute the PIADNI in ADNI-2. Risk groups for conversion from MCI to AD were formed by the quartiles of the PIADNI that computed in ADNI-1. In addition, we demonstrated how the PIADNI for a hypothetical patient was updated over time as new clinical information became available. All the analyses were performed using R (version 3.2.1).

3. Results

The results of the first analysis were summarized in Table 2. The multivariate baseline markers (Model 1) showed that the internal predictive performance (iAUCINT) on ADNI-1 dataset was 0.776, which was closed to the pre-specified threshold of 0.78. Model 1a had about 4 percentage point increases in mean iAUCINT compared to Model 1, by including baseline volumetric MRI (hippocampus, MidTemporal), and FDG-PET in the model. Model 2 had about 7 percentage point increases in mean iAUCINT to 0.846, compared to Model 1, by utilizing all information from the multivariate longitudinal markers. For ADNI-2, the external predictive performance (iAUCEXT) was as good as internal performance in both models. For example, ADNI-2 had internal performance of iAUCINT= 0.909 and external performance of iAUCEXT= 0.933 for Model 2. The performance statistics favored Model 2 with largest mean iAUCs and smallest Brier score in both internal and external validations, which indicated that the longitudinal neurocognitive markers had the best predictive value. Therefore, we considered Model 2 to be a more preferable model.

Results for the second analysis which added longitudinal imaging markers to the collection of neurocognitive markers are shown in Table 3. All four models had the same functional forms as Model 2, except that the 12 MFPC scores were derived from different sets of multivariate longitudinal markers. Specifically, the MFPC scores in Model 2a incorporated the longitudinal information of the five neurocognitive markers in the first analysis. From Model 2b to Model 2d, longitudinal hippocampus, MidTemporal, and FDG-PET were incorporated successively and in combination into MFPC score calculation. The models had similar predictive performance (Model 2b through Model 2d), with slightly higher mean iAUCINT as the additional imaging markers were added to the model. This suggests that predictive performance can be improved by including additional longitudinal imaging markers, but the improvement was modest when the neurocognitive measures and genetic variable were already in the model. In general, ADNI-2 had higher internal and external performance compared with ADNI-1. This may be explained by a high variability in progression status in ADNI-2 population, i.e., the larger differences in multiple clinical outcomes between individuals progressed to AD and those who did not make it easier to classify the two groups. Moreover, the additional predictive value of CSF markers was small when neurocognitive and imaging markers had already in the model. Based on a small subset of ADNI-2 (n = 177) and 10-fold CV, iAUCINT increased one percentage point by adding baseline total tau (t-tau) and Aβ42 as predictors into Model 2d. We did not further consider the model with imaging and CSF markers because of the small improvement in predictive performance. Model2a was potentially more suitable for clinical settings because the cognitive and functional markers can be collected at minimal cost and without specific equipment.

We selected Model 2a as the prognostic model for further analysis and determined the prognostic index PIADNI for both datasets based on the parameters derived from ADNI-1. The cohort in each dataset was categorized into four risk groups based on the quartiles of the PIADNI computed from the ADNI-1 data. Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the AD diagnosis risk groups. Survival curves for ADNI-1 were similar to the survival curves for ADNI-2 in the sense that the risk curves were in the same order (from top to bottom: low, mid-low, mid-high, and high). This indicates that the PIADNI quartiles which categorize four groups for ADNI-1 can be well applied to ADNI-2. The survival curves in the validation ADNI-2 dataset generally agree well with those calculated from the ADNI-1 dataset. For example, in both studies, 50% in the high risk cohort are expected to have an AD diagnosis around 1 year, and 80% are expected to have an AD diagnosis by 2 years. Although the follow up periods of ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 were different, these two cohorts were reasonably similar, and thus the two datasets were combined, and used to estimate final parameters in MFPCA and Cox regression.

Based on the estimated MFPC scores for each subject and the Cox regression coefficients (Table B.1), the PIADNI can be computed. Large values indicate greater risk of conversion from MCI to AD and the PIADNI quartiles (based on pooled data; 25%: −0.78; 50%: 0.29; 75%: 1.56) can help to estimate the risk for an individual and enhance interpretation based on survival curves. In addition, when new marker information becomes available for an individual, his/her MFPC scores, as well as PIADNI, can be updated based on the longitudinal trajectories with new data. In Appendix B, we selected one target MCI patient from ADNI-1 population to demonstrate how PIADNI was updated over time. In short, for this patient, PIADNI based on the baseline observations was −0.65, which categorized the patient into mid-low risk group. By incorporating the additional measurements that were collected at three follow-up visits, the value of PIADNI increased to 0.34 (mid-high risk group), suggesting that the patient was at increased risk of conversion from MCI to AD and further intervention could be initiated as necessary. Based on the Kaplan-Meier curves in Figure 1, we can get an estimation of patients’ survival based on the risk groups they are in. For any future time point, we can also approximate the baseline risk function h0(t) in Model 2 with splines or parametric functions and calculate the survival risk of AD diagnosis for this patient.

4. Discussion

In this paper, we assessed the performance of multivariate longitudinal markers for the prediction of the timing of AD diagnosis (conversion) for MCI patients. We proposed a novel statistical method to jointly analyze time-to-AD from MCI as well as the history of multiple longitudinal makers of cognitive, functional/behavioral, neuroimaging and CSF. A prognostic model for AD diagnosis based on multiple longitudinal measurements was developed. Such prognostic models with multivariate longitudinal markers have not been developed before.

One strength of this study was that the prognostic value of the model was evaluated via both internal and external validations. External validation is the gold standard for reproducibility [25], and the good predictive performance in ADNI-2 external study underscores the general usefulness of the proposed prognostic model. Our results suggest that including the history of multivariate longitudinal markers, in addition to baseline variables, can greatly enhance prognostic performance. The prognostic index generated from the prognostic model has classified individuals into four risk groups of AD diagnosis by its quantiles. Both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 studies indicated that 50% of subjects in the cohort of high risk remained prediagnosis at year one, and 50% of subjects in the cohort of mid-high risk group remained prediagnosis at year three. The emphasis of the proposed PIADNI was that it efficiently utilized the longitudinal information of multiple markers manifested by the MFPC scores, and can be updated dynamically to reflect the patient’s latest prognosis.

A model based on cognitive and functional assessments as prognostic factors can be widely used in clinical setting because of their broad availability. Our analyses showed that the improvement in predictive power by adding imaging biomarkers and baseline CSF markers is limited when cognitive and functional variables were already in the model. The proposed prognostic index PIADNI has the following advantages: (1) it is easy to compute with commonly measured variables; (2) it is useful to estimate when an individual will convert from MCI to AD; (3) it can identify candidate individuals for clinical trials from those who have registered in ongoing observational studies and may already have a history of biomarker observations. For example, if a preventative trial requires participants to be many years from AD diagnosis, the bottom percentage (e.g. 25%) of individuals with the smallest PIADNI (based on the longitudinal measures until the time point) might be selected. Alternatively, to increase the probability of detecting significant differences between treatment and control patients, a trial might recruit from the cohort with sufficient progression in the time frame (e.g. 3 years) of a trial. In this case, the untreated mid-high risk group may be more appropriate, as indicated by the corresponding survival curve in Figure 1. Individuals from whose PIADNI fall within this risk group might be candidates for recruitment.

We applied multivariate functional principle analysis (MFPCA) to multiple longitudinal marker data. The MFPCA can effectively deal with measurement errors and capture the temporal correlation in the markers as well as correlations among markers. It does not require a pre-defined functional form for the longitudinal trajectory and allows missing observations and different time visits for subjects. The computed MFPC scores may lack clinical interpretability, and not all scores are significantly associated with the likelihood of AD diagnosis (Table B.1). We investigated the variable selection for the MFPC scores. However, a more parsimonious model, which excluded the insignificant MFPC scores, gave no improvement in predictive performance for PIADNI. The approaches used in this study can be broadly applied to longitudinal studies of neurodegenerative diseases. A calculator for computing MFPC scores and prognostic index is available upon request from the authors. Although the methods can be implemented in available software, a well-documented and further validated web-based calculator is needed to facilitate their use in clinical settings.

There are several limitations in our study. First, although MFPC score can be calculated even if some subjects had only one observation, we required majority of subjects in the model building dataset to have at least two observations to ensure the accuracy of the parameter estimation in MFPCA. Second, for simplicity and without loss of generality, we assume the survival time is continuous. However, the AD conversion in ADNI study were diagnosed about every 6 month at follow-up visits. Further improvement of the model could be made by considering survival time as observed in grouped form or considering AD conversion as an interval censoring problem. Third, death is treated as a non-informative right-censoring event in our analyses. Cox proportional hazard model may produce biased parameter estimates of the predictor effects when failing to account for the competing risk of death in elder population. The competing risk approaches could be adopted to improve our method depending on the study of interest. Fourth, we did not thoroughly explore the prognostic performance of all combinations of markers. A potentially more powerful prognostic index could be developed using a combination of other imaging, clinical, genetic or fluid biomarker variables. In addition, participants who volunteered for studies such as ADNI may not represent the more general clinical population and the potential selection bias exists. We used ADNI-2 dataset for external validation because of its breadth of cognitive, imaging and CSF biomarkers, and similarity to ADNI-1. If only commonly collected neurocognitive and demographic variables are of interest, external validation on other studies with large sample sizes, such as the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center dataset, would provide additional validation and replication for our findings. Moreover, although the proposed method can easily incorporate multiple longitudinal markers and are computational efficient as compared with the joint modeling approach adopted in a previous paper [12], it may not well address the informative censoring issue for the longitudinal marker. For example, subjects with more serious disease status may be more likely to experience the event or withdraw from the study earlier than healthier individual, leading to fewer longitudinal measurements. To investigate the impact of the informative censoring, we conducted additional simulation studies to compare the proposed approach with joint models and found that the informative censoring had very limited effects on risk prediction. However, it is important to consider the issue in future methodology development.

Finally, given the lack of disease-modifying treatments for AD and recent failures of several promising drugs in clinical trials, it is believed that treatments may need to be initiated early in the disease process to be effective. Our finding demonstrated how a single risk score based on multivariate longitudinal variables is useful and valuable for early diagnosis, and for targeted recruitment for clinical trials.

Model 2b through Model 2d, longitudinal information of volumetric MRI (hippocampus, MidTemporal), and FDG-PET were added to the MFPC score calculation successively and in combination, e.g., Model 2b included hippocampal volume, Model 2c included hippocampal and MidTemporal volumes, Model 2d included hippocampal, MidTemporal volumes and FDG-PET.

Highlights

A novel and efficient statistical method for prognosis of progression-free survival in mild cognitive impairment patients using multiple longitudinal markers.

The prognostic model was evaluated via both internal and external validations.

The longitudinal profiles of multiple markers, all of which are routinely collected in observational studies, could enhance the prognostic accuracy of Alzheimer’s disease, if they are properly included in the prognostic model

A prognostic index produced by the prognostic model is useful for monitoring disease progression and identifying patients for clinical trial recruitment.

Research in context

Systematic review

Publications on prognostic and predictive modeling using longitudinal markers in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients were searched in PubMed and in references and citations of relevant publications. Previous research has identified a few biomarkers, e.g. neurocognitive, imaging, and CSF, using logistic regression or Cox regression. No previous methods leveraged both multiple longitudinal data and time-to-event data for predicting AD progression.

Interpretation

Our objective was to propose a prognostic model, which relies on multiple longitudinal markers, for prediction of progression-free survival in MCI patients. We assessed the prognostic performance of a wide breadth of longitudinal markers using both internal and external validations.

Future directions

There are still opportunities to further optimize prognostic models by using newly discovered AD related markers. For substantial advances beyond the work presented here, clinical trial data are encouraged to be made available for validating prognostic models.
