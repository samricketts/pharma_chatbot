The authors tested the hypothesis that wrist-worn actimeters can quantify the severity of post-stroke apathy. The authors studied 57 patients admitted to an acute rehabilitation unit for ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. After accounting for motor deficit of the affected arm and age, each increment of Apathy Inventory correlated with 5.6 fewer minutes moving per hour. The overall statistical model had an R2 of only 0.341, suggesting unexplained factors for total movement time. Wrist-worn actimeters may serve as an objective, quantifiable measure of post-stroke apathy in patients with an intact upper extremity, but cannot alone be used to diagnose apathy.

Introduction

Apathy occurs in approximately 35% of patients after stroke and is associated with more disability and lower quality of life {1–4}. Apathy is defined as a reduction in goal-directed behavior and flattening of emotions in comparison with the patient’s prior degree of function, not due to an impairment of arousal or medication side effect {5}. It is typically defined using scales, based on patient report or clinician observation, all of which involve subjective interpretation {6}. As in most behavioral disorders, there is currently no objective, quantifiable definition of apathy. This serves as a limitation for the conduct of observational and clinical trial research, as subjective measures limit inter-rater reliability and the interpretation of outcomes (e.g., quantifying change over time).

One approach to quantify human behavior is the use of actimeters. These are small, typically wireless, accelerometers or gyroscopes that can be secured to subjects’ bodies to record movement, typically for many days at a time. They have been used to quantify total movement, inter-limb patterns, and body position with the potential for secondary analyses including sleep duration, circadian rhythms, and steps taken per day (reviewed in {7}; recent examples in stroke recovery are {8; 9}). Actimeters are a promising tool for clinical research because they are affordable, user-friendly, non-invasive, and produce outputs that are ecologically valid and linearly quantifiable, unlike many standard clinical research tools.

Actimeters have already been used in studies investigating apathy in order to determine if there is an association between apathy and the amount of time that subjects move {10; 11}. These studies were performed in patients with a variety of brain injuries, as well as in Alzheimer disease, and found that apathetic patients generally move less during the day. These findings may not be extrapolated to stroke survivors, as post-stroke motor dysfunction directly affects movement ability. Thus, metrics associated with quantity of movement may reflect stroke severity rather than apathy severity.

Here, we asked whether amount of movement measured by a wrist-watch style actimeter on the unaffected wrist correlates with severity of apathy in patients with stroke. We studied patients undergoing acute rehabilitation as this setting provides a controlled environment with similar daily demands placed on all patients. This study aimed to determine the potential utility of actimeters as a measure of apathy severity, and therefore their potential utility in future clinical trials. We hypothesized that subjects with apathy would move less throughout the day. We also performed exploratory analyses on the correlation of amount of movement with recovery during rehabilitation.

Methods

Subjects

From July 2014 to May 2015 we studied patients admitted to an acute rehabilitation hospital for deficits due to an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. To ensure that the actimeter values were not affected by disorders of movement, we did not study patients with bilateral upper extremity weakness (one arm had to have a Fugl-Meyer score of 66 out of 66), or movement disorders such as Parkinson disease. We also excluded patients where we could not diagnose apathy severity including those on sedating or anti-psychotic medications during the day, hypoarousal such as from an infection or sleep disturbance, or active psychiatric disease other than depression. The study was approved by the Burke Rehabilitation Hospital Committee for Human Rights in Research, and all subjects or their legally authorized representatives gave signed informed consent.

Behavioral outcome measures

Apathy was quantified using the Apathy Inventory Clinician Version (AI-C) {12}, scored weekly by the subjects’ treating speech therapist as part of standard of care. The AI-C asks the clinician to report on: (1) emotional blunting; (2) loss of initiative (i.e., goal-directed behavior); and (3) loss of interest in activities and other people. Each question is scored 0 = no problem to 4 = major problem, with a total score ranging 0–12. Scores of 4 and above are considered clinically significant apathy. Scores were based on behaviors observed over the previous week. We report the AI-C score closest to the time of the actimetry recording.

To quantify depressive symptoms, we interviewed patients with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; 0–60 with higher scores representing worse depression){13}. Note that this was only performed on the subset of patients with intact communication ability (mild or no aphasia as judged by treating speech pathologist).

Motor dysfunction was assessed with the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer motor scale by subjects’ treating occupational therapists {14; 15}. This scale assesses reflexes, strength, and dexterity with scores ranging 0 (flaccid paralysis) to 66 (full strength). Disability was assessed at admission and discharge by treating therapists using the FIM™ (UB Foundation Activities, Inc.). Scores range 18–126 with lower scores representing more disability.

For the multiple regression analysis, the Fugl-Meyer upper limb assessment was used as a measure of stroke severity. The Fugl-Meyer was chosen in place of the FIM because Fugl-Meyer is an impairment measure, which means it is less affected by other factors. For example, we have observed that apathy can directly affect many of the measures within the FIM (e.g., apathetic patients are scored lower on language measures because they do not initiate speech, even though their language skills are intact).

Actimeter

Quantity of movement was assessed using a wrist-watch style actimeter (GENEActiv, Activinsights Ltd, Kimbolton, UK) that uses a tri-axial accelerometer. It was set to record acceleration at 40 Hz with all data recorded onto the device in units of milli-g (1000 milli-g = 1 g = 9.81 m/s2). Subjects wore the actimeter on the wrist of an upper extremity with intact strength (normal Fugl-Meyer score of 66). Data were collected for at least 36 hours (two nights and the intervening day), though only analyzed from the day and the second night. We documented the schedule of therapy sessions and meals for all subjects during the day.

Actimeter data processing

Acceleration values were extracted from the device and analyzed further in custom Matlab scripts (Matlab 2012b, Mathworks, USA) unless otherwise noted. In order to minimize the effect of gravity on acceleration values, we removed slowly changing acceleration values (greater than approximately two seconds) using a detrending algorithm with a moving window (“locdetrend” from chronux.org; {16}). We then converted the three axes into one by calculating the total euclidean distance of all axes from the origin. Finally, we binarized all acceleration values empirically into movement (&gt;0.3 milli-g) or not movement. This binarization removed the influence of movement amplitude from the final analyses as we were interested in amount of time moving rather than its amplitude. Results are all displayed as “total movement time” meaning the amount of time where the acceleration value was considered to be movement versus not movement.

Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were also performed in Matlab using built in and Statistics Toolbox codes. Scatter plots were produced with the code “scatter.m” after confirming that there were no overlapping data points. As some data were not Gaussian distributed, we report medians and interquartile ranges, and compare groups using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. Boxplots were created using Matlab’s “boxplot.m” with default parameters. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed using Matlab’s “linearmodel.fit” with default parameters.

Results

Subjects studied

57 subjects consented and completed data acquisition; we collected data from an additional 14 subjects, but in 11 subjects, these data were not used because the subjects removed the actimeters prior to study completion, and device error occurred in 3 subjects. Of the 11 subjects who removed the device, 4 of them had apathy. Of the 57 subjects studied, 33 had sufficient communication ability to perform the MADRS interview for depression symptoms.

Subjects had a wide range of apathy scores (Figure 1) with 21 (36%) having apathy (defined as AI-C ≥ 4) and the remaining 36 (44%) without apathy. Note that this does not reflect the demographics of the population at this hospital as reported in {3}, but rather reflects our attempt to obtain data on a similar number of subjects with versus without apathy. Apathetic and non-apathetic subjects were well matched on age and gender, but those with apathy were generally more disabled from their stroke and had less recovery during their stay in rehabilitation (Table 1).

Correlation of apathy severity versus quantity of movement

Our primary aim was to investigate whether there was a correlation between apathy severity and amount of movement during the hours of 9AM–5PM (Figure 2). During this time subjects typically participated in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, meals and free time. We found that apathy severity inversely correlated with total movement per hour (Pearson r = −0.49, p&lt;0.001).

It is also possible that age and stroke severity affect total movement, so we accounted for these factors in a multiple linear regression. We used the Fugl-Meyer motor score of the more affected upper extremity as a marker for stroke severity (note that the actimeter was on an unaffected upper extremity). We found that after accounting for age and stroke severity, movement time remained inversely correlated with AI-C (Table 2) - with each incremental higher number that subjects scored on the AI-C, they moved approximately 5.6 minutes less per hour from 9AM to 5PM. Fugl-Meyer score of the affected limb also correlated with amount of movement performed by the unaffected limb, but age did not.

Depression scoring with the MADRS was only available in the 33 subjects with intact communication. In this subgroup, we found no significant correlation between severity of depression symptoms and total movement time (Pearson p-value=0.17), we therefore did not include MADRS score in the multiple regression analysis.

We performed further exploratory analyses on the correlation of apathy severity with movement time during different settings (Figure 3). We found that apathetic subjects moved less during physical and occupational therapy sessions, as well as in the time period outside of physical therapy (all p&lt;0.001 using T-tests). At night, defined as 11PM to 7AM, there was no difference in total movement between apathetic and non-apathetic subjects suggesting no difference in amount of sleep or movement during sleep.

Previous studies have found that patients with post-stroke apathy recover slower during acute rehabilitation {2; 3; 17; 18}. Here we confirmed this finding as apathy severity correlated with change in FIM from admission to discharge (Pearson r = −0.44, p-value &lt;0.001). Movement time also correlated with change in FIM (Pearson r = 0.41, p-value = 0.002), but could be due to a strong association with apathy severity. To determine this, we tested the association between movement time and change in FIM on the 36 non apathetic subjects (AI-C&lt;4) and found no correlation between movement time and change in FIM (Pearson r = 0.06, p-value = 0.71).

Conclusions

The primary finding of this study is that in patients with stroke undergoing inpatient rehabilitation, the amount of movement of their unaffected upper extremity correlates well with their severity of apathy. This finding remained positive even after accounting for the severity of stroke (defined by the weakness of their more affected side) and age. These findings suggest that actimeters may serve as a useful adjunctive measurement of apathy severity.

Other studies have looked at the correlation of apathy with amount of movement by actimeter and produced similar findings to ours. The closest study to ours was by Müller and colleagues who used wrist-watch style actimeters to study 24 patients with a variety of brain injuries (stroke, hypoxia, tumor and trauma), and 12 age-matched controls {11}. Half of the patient subjects had significant apathy and half had minimal to no apathy. The authors found that patients with significant apathy moved less, while patients without significant apathy were similar to controls. In another study, David and colleagues studied 107 patients with Alzheimer Disease over seven days and found that the 43 with apathy had reduced daytime mean motor activity versus the 64 without apathy {10}. These studies, combined with ours, suggest that actimeters may be useful adjunct measures of apathy in a wide range of conditions including psychiatric diseases such as Major Depressive Disorder and Schizophrenia, and other neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson disease.

Both Müller et al. and David et al. also reported that patients with apathy had more periods of daytime napping. We did not specifically measure this as it is impossible to differentiate sleeping versus sitting still while awake with a wrist-watch actimeter alone. David and colleagues also sought to determine if actimeters can be used to diagnose apathy. They used ROC analysis and reported that amount of movement could be used to distinguish apathy versus non-apathy, though with a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 71%. Our findings suggest that actimeters alone cannot be used to diagnose apathy as there is significant variability in the amount of movement in subjects with no signs of apathy (AI-C of 0; Figure 2); instead, actimeters could be used as an adjunctive tool in combination with other clinical assessments.

The consistent findings, across this and other studies, of inverse correlations between apathy severity and amount of daytime movement, suggest that actimeters may be useful tools for generating outcome measures in clinical trials for treatment of post-stroke apathy. As reviewed by Dobkin and Dorsch {7}, actimeters and similar non-invasive, mobile tools, offer significant advantages for clinical research. They can record data from subjects in their homes, making the information more ecologically valid and lower cost. They can record information for many days to ensure that more aspects of behavior are captured. And the data they produce is linear and therefore easier for analysis than typical clinical scales with arbitrary scoring systems. On the other hand, current outputs from these devices are limited in that what they report may not reflect the behavior of interest (e.g., measuring all movement rather than goal-directed movement), but advancements in algorithm and device development suggest that this hurdle can be overcome (e.g., see {8; 9; 19}).

A secondary finding from this study is regarding the role of apathy and recovery. Our finding that apathy correlates with less recovery of disability (FIM) during rehabilitation stay is consistent with other studies {2; 3; 17; 18}. The mechanism by which apathy affects recovery is not clear. It could be due to reduced participation in rehabilitation, but a study that looked specifically at participation found no correlation with apathy or depression, though participation did correlate with executive function{20}. Apathy’s role in recovery could also be due to reduced practice outside of therapy – we did not measure this specifically, but we found no correlation between overall activity (movement of the unaffected extremity) and recovery in the non-apathetic subjects. Previous meta-analyses have reported that amount of therapy time provided correlates with recovery after stroke {21; 22}. Future studies could use actimeters on the affected extremities to determine more specifically the role of practicing of movement and rate of recovery.

This study has multiple limitations affecting interpretation and generalization. One is that our measure of apathy severity (AI-C score) may not always represent post-stroke apathy. In some cases this is because subjects may have had apathy prior to their stroke (families were not interviewed as part of the scoring process). In other cases the apathy may be due to concurrent depression or neurodegenerative disease. These are not significant limitations as the goal of the study was to determine if apathy could be quantified by actimeters in patients with stroke, regardless of the cause. Another limitation is that actimeters measure any movement of the extremity, and are unable to identify specifically goal-directed movement which is a core aspect of apathy. Furthermore, goal-directed behavior is only one aspect of apathy, with goal-directed cognition and emotional expression not measureable by these devices. Finally, our statistical model of apathy severity, stroke severity and age (Table 2) explained less than half of the variance in amount of movement (adjusted R2=0.341), suggesting that there are other unexplained factors. This remaining variability in movement time suggests that further information is required prior to using movement time as a diagnostic test of post-stroke apathy.

The findings here suggest multiple directions of future research. One is to better explain the variability in movement time not explained by age, apathy severity, and stroke severity. This could include measures of fatigue and sleepiness, pain, or other measures of motivation. Further data should also come from inpatient and outpatient populations over longer periods of time, to determine if movement amount is stable, and if it correlates with the change in apathy severity that occurs in some patients naturally over time {3; 23}. Actimeters could be used as low-cost exploratory outcome measures in clinical trials of apathy treatments in a variety of conditions. Finally, quantification of apathy may be improved by algorithms that allow actimeters to measure goal-directed behavior, as well as the addition of other devices that can be used to measure goal-directed cognition and emotional expression (e.g., {24}).
