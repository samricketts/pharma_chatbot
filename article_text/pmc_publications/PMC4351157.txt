The earliest sites of brain atrophy in Alzheimer’s disease are in the medial temporal lobe, following widespread cerebral cortical amyloid deposition. We assessed 74 cognitively normal participants with clinical measurements, Aβ-PET imaging, MRI, and a newly developed technique for MRI-based hippocampal subfield segmentation to determine the differential association of amyloid deposition and hippocampal subfield volume. Compared to amyloid-negative participants, amyloid-positive participants had significantly smaller hippocampal tail, presubiculum, subiculum, and total hippocampal gray matter volumes. We conclude that, prior to the development of cognitive impairment, atrophy in particular hippocampal subfields (HS) occurs preferentially with Aβ accumulation.

Introduction

According to the amyloid hypothesis, a predominant feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis is the deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide in the form of senile plaques in brain tissue [1–3]. The accumulation of Aβ appears to precede other AD pathophysiology, including cortical volume loss [4–6]. However, thus far clearance of Aβ plaques in symptomatic AD patients is not associated with improved survival [7]. The failure of such Aβ clearance therapies may be due to their initiation late in the overall course of AD, as it is now recognized that the accumulation of Aβ deposits and the resulting pathophysiological process is ongoing years prior to any clinical manifestations [8]. The concept of preclinical AD initially was based on brain autopsy studies that found substantial numbers of Aβ plaques and other lesions characteristic of AD in cognitively normal individuals [9–11]. More recently, studies using the PET tracer 11C Pittsburgh compound B (PIB), which specifically binds to Aβ plaques, have provided insights into the nature of amyloid accumulation [12]. PIB retention in cognitively normal older adults predicts progression to early symptomatic AD and AD dementia and is greater in individuals with symptomatic AD than in cognitively normal individuals [13–15].

Although Aβ accumulation begins in the neocortex, cortical atrophy – another hallmark of AD pathogenesis – first appears in the medial temporal regions [10,16–20]. Atrophy of the whole hippocampus has been correlated with Aβ accumulation as detected by PIB, but shows moderate sensitivity and low specificity to AD [14,21–26]. Van Leemput et al. have developed a fully automated method of hippocampal subfield (HS) segmentation in ultra-high resolution MRI data [27]. Investigation of the relationship between Aβ accumulation and differential hippocampal atrophy at the subfield level may be informative in the understanding the progression of AD pathophysiology. By examining both HS volumes and Aβ binding in the same participants, we can better define their relationships to determine the differential effect of Aβ accumulation on individual HS volumes.

Materials and Methods

74 community dwelling volunteers (mean age 67.9 years, 52 males) enrolled in studies at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University were assessed with the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale. All participants were cognitively normal (CDR=0). All procedures were approved by Washington University’s Human Research Protection Office. Written consent was obtained from each participant and their informant.

Volumetric MRI was obtained on a Siemens (Erlangen, Germany) TIM Trio 3T MRI scanner with 12-channel head coil. Voxel size=1×1×1mm was obtained sagitally. All MRI sessions were processed through the FreeSurfer 5.1 image analysis suite, which is documented as follows: (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). The technical details of these procedures are described in prior publications [28–39]. HS segmentation used the Freesurfer pipeline, yielding 10 segments for both left and right hippocampus: CA1, CA2/3, CA4/DG, subiculum, presubiculum, hippocampal tail, fimbria, inferior lateral ventricle, choroid plexus and hippocampal fissure [27]. Certified raters examined all segmentations and subsegmentations for problems and outliers. All scans that passed segmentation examination had no issues with subsegmentations. Additional information surrounding the FreeSurfer quality control process may be found at: (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/TroubleshootingData).

Aβ PET imaging was conducted following bolus injection of ≈12 mCi of 11C PIB and 60 minute dynamic PET scan in 3D mode (septa retracted). Mean cortical binding potential (MCBP) was calculated for each scan using regions obtained by sampling the precuneus, gyrus rectus, prefrontal, and lateral temporal cortex as previously described [16]. Values were dichotomized to MCBP≥0.16 (n=18, “PIB positive” (PIB+)) or &lt;0.16 (n=56, “PIB negative” (PIB−)), and results for subvolumes were compared between these two groups. Because we were interested in identifying the earliest changes in amyloid to compare with hippocampal subvolumes, we chose a level of 0.16, slightly lower than has been used in other dichotomizations [16].

Mean and standard deviation for age, education, gender, intracranial volume (ICV) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) for PIB+ and PIB− individuals were determined. Total hippocampal gray matter volume was determined by totaling the volumes of hippocampal tail, presubiculum, subiculum, CA1, CA2/3, and CA4/DG. Unpaired t-tests compared demographic variables and hippocampal subfields (HS) and total volumes. A Pearson correlation was used to correlate MCBP and subfield volumes. A Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to control for the false discovery rate.

Results

Demographic variables did not differ in age, gender or intracranial volume (ICV) between PIB+ and PIB− participants, but PIB+ mean MMSE was significantly lower (p = 0.03) and PIB+ education was significantly higher (p = 0.04) (Table 1). Compared with the PIB− group (mean MCBP=0.02), the PIB+ group (mean MCBP=0.49) had significantly smaller hippocampal tail, presubiculum, subiculum, and total hippocampal gray matter volumes after Benjamini-Hochberg correction, whereas the groups did not differ in CA1, CA2/3, or CA4/dentate gyrus (Table 1, Figure 1). Examining MCBP as a continuous variable across all subjects it was correlated with all of the HS volumes. However, examining PIB+ and PIB− groups separately, there was no correlation of MCBP with hippocampal subfield volumes in PIB− subjects (all p &gt; 0.5) whereas in PIB+ subjects MCBP and all HS volumes remained inversely correlated although not significant under the 95% confidence level due to small sample size (n= 18): (hippocampal tail −0.34, p = 0.17; presubiculum −0.33, p= 0.19; CA-1 −0.27, p = 0.27; CA2-3 −0.43, p = 0.07; subiculum −0.43, p= 0.07; CA4 (DG) −0.45, p = 0.09; total hippocampal gray matter −0.43, p = 0.07).

Discussion

We found that hippocampal tail, presubiculum, subiculum, and total hippocampal gray matter volumes normalized for age, gender, ICV, and education were significantly lower in cognitively normal PIB+ compared with cognitively normal PIB− older adults. This provides evidence that in the early stages of the preclinical AD within the hippocampus there is evidence of preferential involvement of certain subregions over others. Interestingly, we show that even in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease with normal MMSE scores, those subjects who are PIB+ differed both in hippocampal subfield volumes and in MMSE scores. While the mean MMSE in PIB negative of 29.18 and mean MMSE of 28.11 in PIB+ are both normal, they do differ significantly (p = 0.03), likely resulting from the early stages of hippocampal atrophy. This is supported by the lack of correlation between MCBP and hippocampal subfield volumes in PIB− subjects and the inverse correlation of MCBP with hippocampal subfield volumes in PIB+ subjects.

Although to our knowledge this is the first documented investigation of associations between HS atrophy and Aβ accumulation in humans, the topic has previously been studied in mice. Simon et al. found signs of neurodegeneration in the CA1 and entorhinal cortex in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice, while Beauquis et al. discovered that these mice had reduced hippocampal volume with fewer pyramidal and granular neurons at 5 months of age [40,41]. Studies have also found degeneration of specific types of neurons in transgenic mice, including GABAergic septo-hippocampal neurons and calretinin interneurons [42,43].

Studies of humans have observed whole hippocampal volume loss in individuals in the preclinical, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia stages of AD [23,44,45]. Smaller hippocampal volume is also associated with conversion from asymptomatic and MCI stages to AD dementia [46–49]. Moreover, hippocampal atrophy has been associated with Aβ accumulation, as detected using PIB: asymptomatic PIB+ individuals have increased rates of hippocampal atrophy, and correlations between inferior temporal region PIB retention and hippocampal volume have been found [21,22]. Subfields of the hippocampus, however, appear to be preferentially vulnerable to AD, as their volumes distinguish individuals with MCI from controls more accurately than global hippocampal volumes [26].

Previous studies of HS atrophy across stages of AD have discovered varied results. Studies of preclinical AD have found no changes in neuronal number or volume [50,51]. Two studies of MCI found greater subicular atrophy, though studies have also found CA1 and CA2/3 atrophy [26,52,53]. In AD, various studies have found atrophy predominantly in the CA1 and subiculum [50,53–56], but also in the entorhinal cortex [55]. Each of these studies utilized different methods to determine subfield volumes. Some relied on manual HS delineation [26,54–56] – an accurate but severely time consuming method – while others used a faster automated method [52]. Our study utilized a fully automated method of HS segmentation developed by Van Leemput et al., which primarily uses geometrical rules to delineate each HS [27]. Van Leemput et al. validated their technique against manual hippocampal segmentations of 10 individuals and found that CA1, CA2/3, CA4/DG, presubiculum, and subiculum all had reasonable Dice overlap coefficients (&gt;0.62) (Dice overlap coefficients measure the similarity of two samples by comparing the number of species shared by two samples to the number of species in each unique sample). Pearson’s correlations, however, were only significant for CA2/3 and CA4/DG, though subiculum also correlated to some degree.

Limitations of the study

An intrinsic limitation of using the Van Leemput methods is that the internal boundaries of the hippocampus are not visible in 1mm T1 data. Further, the DICE overlap data comes from much higher resolution T1 data (0.38×0.38×0.8mm3) than applied to in this study. Thus, the method was not validated on more standard T1 imaging protocols. Large parts of CA1 are actually labeled as CA23 by Van Leemput's software. Comparisons of automated segmentations with manual delineations show that this method underestimates the volume of CA1; CA1, defined histologically, would include most if not all of the subiculum as defined by Van Leemput et al. [57]. Thus, further studies with a more anatomically accurate segmentation tool may be required. An automated method recently developed by Yushkevich et al. using MRI data acquired with a shorter scan time generally produces better DICE overlap coefficients [58]. Instead of using geometrical rules, this method uses multi-atlas segmentation to propagate subfield labels from a set of manually segmented training MRI scans to the target MRI scan. The manual segmentations of the training data were derived from comparison to labeled postmortem data in published atlases. The method also requires the use of a high resolution T2 scan.

An alternative method, delineating hippocampal shape, may also be closely associated with Aβ accumulation in cognitively normal individuals. Previous studies using hippocampal shape analysis have found differences in hippocampal deformation between individuals with symptomatic AD and asymptomatic individuals, especially in the CA1 and subiculum [49,59]. Moreover, automated hippocampal shape determination can be used to discriminate between individuals with AD dementia, individuals with MCI, and asymptomatic individuals with more accuracy than hippocampal volumetry [60,61]. Most importantly, variation of hippocampal shape – determined both manually and automatically – is predictive for AD in asymptomatic individuals [62,63]. These studies highlight the potential usefulness of hippocampal shape as a measure of early AD pathology.

In summary, we have shown that some hippocampal subfields (and not others) significantly differ in volume between cognitively normal PIB+ and PIB− participants. Moreover, given the uncertainty of the exact HS boundaries as measured using the automated process described, our study also highlights the importance of current efforts to develop a standardized protocol for efficiently and accurately determining subfield volumes.
