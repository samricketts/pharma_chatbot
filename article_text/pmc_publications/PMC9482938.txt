Latin American and Caribbean countries face complex challenges to improve brain health and reduce the impact of dementia. Regional hubs devoted to research, capacity building, implementation science, and education are critically needed. The Latin American brain health institute represent an important step to address many of these needs.

pmcLatin American and the Caribbean countries (LACs) urgently require the development of harmonized, innovative, multisectoral, educational, and regional centers focused on brain health and dementia research1. The prevalence of dementia in LACs is higher than that in Europe or the US and is expected to increase by 100-250% by 20502. Environmental inequities, including social determinants of health (SDH) and unique genetic profiles of LAC populations, are the main factors that impact the prevalence, presentation, and risk of dementia1. Fragile and unsuitable integrated health care and development systems, overburdened public health organizations, unstable economies, substantial inequalities, caregiver burden3,4, limited funding/research infrastructure, and lack of training1 are all critical drivers of this urgent call to action.

The Latin American brain health institute (BrainLat) was recently created in order to tackle many of these challenges. Launched at the University Adolfo Ibáñez (Chile), BrainLat is guided by an international advisory board (60 institutions) and is affiliated with the Global Brain Health Institute (GBHI), which works in partnership with the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and Trinity College Dublin (TCD). GBHI is an Atlantic Philanthropy funded initiative that aims to reduce the scale and impact of dementia. Links to GBHI, together with connections with regional initiatives and public centers, have been spurring BrainLat research collaborations and joint training programs, crucial to boost productive networking. BrainLat is supporting the regional dementia research agenda through seed grants, postdoctoral positions, specialized infrastructure, educational programs, and permanent full-time research positions (Table 1). BrainLat’s focus on strengthening regional and international multidisciplinary brain health research and diplomacy has empowered innovative brain health leaders across LACs.

Regional capacity building is a core goal of BrainLat as illustrated by ongoing consortia, including the Latin America and Caribbean consortium on dementia, LAC-CD1,5 and The Multi-Partner Consortium to Expand Dementia Research in Latin America, ReDLat6. LAC-CD, a task force consisting of more than 250 dementia experts in LACs, has been harmonizing practices, providing professionals with training opportunities, and developing a new knowledge-to-action regional plan that includes a biomarker framework1. ReDLat, a research project involving 13 sites across Latin America and the US, aims to expand open regional research by combining genomic, social determinants of health, neuroimaging, and cognition in over 4,000 individuals to improve the characterization of Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration6. ReDLat is funded by the Alzheimer’s Association, the National Institutes of Aging of the National Institutes of Health, the Rainwater Foundation, Alector, and Takeda. BrainLat supports ReDLat consortium by providing dedicated research positions (faculty positions, postdocs), seed grants, and funds for mobility. The institute complements ReDLat research by focusing on novel and affordable biomarkers (e.g., electroencephalogram, functional magnetic resonance imaging, blood-based biomarkers) relevant to the region7,8. BrainLat, in association with LAC-CD and The ISTAART is currently delivering webinars focused on dementia with content that includes biomarkers, technology, care, and interventions after surveying regional experts’ knowledge on these topics.

Despite its short tenure, BrainLat already has a high impact. Researchers at BrainLat have co-authored more than 130 academic publications, developed transfer of available technological innovation (e.g., Neureka (https://www.neureka.ie/), and provided regional professional training (Table 1). BrainLat is also involved in different LAC-CD and ReDLat ongoing collaborations with external centers across the globe (e.g., NIH intramural center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias, European Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) consortium, World Health Organization (WHO)-Alzheimer’s Association global consortium to assess the impact of coronavirus, and Creative Ageing International) as well as regional organizations (e.g., Inter-American Development Bank, local research centers).

Efforts to improve the landscape of dementia in LACs are plagued by a lack of critical mass. Another core goal of BrainLat relies on increasing education and training through three novel programs. First, the BrainLat fellowship for brain health, leveraging content created at GBHI, will be launched in 2024 to train a new generation of regional leaders in brain health. Inspired by the GBHI Atlantic Fellows for Equity in Brain Health program, the BrainLat fellowship will include regional adaptations to address specific needs and challenges of the region. The second initiative consists of a Ph.D. program in brain health that will bring together researchers from diverse disciplinary perspectives (i.e., psychology, neuroscience, computational approaches, geriatrics, health economics, epidemiology, diplomacy, and engineering, among others). Starting in 2023, this research-oriented PhD program will focus on supervisor-based mentoring and will benefit from the multidisciplinary faculty as well as synergies with the fellowship program. Third, the European-Latin American Brain Health Academy (ELBHA) is a training program coordinated by BrainLat and GBHI at TCD, bringing innovative educational modules for use by multiple professional groups. ELBHA takes a transdisciplinary approach to expand the educational ecosystem for scientists, government policymakers, private organizations, and entrepreneurs in brain health. This year, the Inter-American Development Bank, in association with the Ministry of Health of Argentina, will fund ELBHA’s first international courses on brain health in the country. Designed by BrainLat and faculty from Europe, the US, and LACs, the educational curricula include classical (dementia research, care and prevention, risk factors, health economics), and innovative approaches to promote brain capital9 and brain health diplomacy10. Launching these educational initiatives represents an enduring investment for the region.

Finally, the long-term goal of BrainLat is to foster multilateral efforts via capacity building, implementation science and diversity, hoping said efforts become sustainable in the region. This is perhaps the most challenging goal, as it requires the integration of care and public systems with research, as well as coordination across private/public sources and local/regional/international stakeholders. BrainLat initiatives, taken together, will accelerate opportunities to improve brain health and brain capital by connecting various stakeholders, universities and institutions, governments and NGOs toward a common purpose. By forging translational research and educational collaborations across the continent, these initiatives will build research capacity and evidence, support the realization of regional dementia plans, enhance the regional health systems’ infrastructure in brain health, and facilitate future agreements with governments to increase the budget for dementia prevention, care and research. BrainLat is also committed to improve diversity in leadership (women, people of color, native and indigenous people). Through a combination of interdisciplinary innovation, collaboration, and creativity, we hope to transform our local challenges into global opportunities for brain health.
