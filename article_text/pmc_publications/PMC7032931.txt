The protein molecules must fold into unique conformations to acquire functional activity. Misfolding, aggregation, and deposition of proteins in diverse organs, the so-called “protein misfolding disorders (PMDs)”, represents the conformational diseases with highly ordered assemblies, including oligomers and fibrils that are linked to neurodegeneration in brain illnesses such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent studies have revealed several aspects of brain pathology in CAA and AD, but both the classification and underlying mechanisms need to be further refined. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a small molecule but a critical regulator in controlling the expression of genes at the level of post-transcriptional modification. Increasing evidence with the advent of RNA sequencing technology suggests possible links between miRNAs and these neurodegenerative disorders. To provide insights on the small RNA-mediated regulatory circuitry and the translational significance of miRNAs in PMDs, this review will discuss the characteristics and mechanisms of the diseases and summarize circulating or tissue-resident miRNAs associated with AD and CAA.

Protein misfolding disorders

Protein misfolding disorders (PMDs) are a group of pathologies characterized by the deposition of aggregated misfolded protein in diverse organs (Soto et al. 2006). Several studies have demonstrated that the accumulation of misfolded protein in tissues causes injury and that this is a signature characteristic of these diseases (Soto et al. 2006). PMDs include a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA), Prion diseases (also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies), Huntington’s disease (HD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). PMDs also occur in many other non-brain related disorders, such as systemic amyloidosis and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) (Mukherjee et al. 2017), familial amyloid polyneuropathy, among others (Soto 2003), (Mukherjee et al. 2015) (Table 1).

The financial burden of these diseases has steadily increased due to the aging of the general population (Association 2019). Studies have shown that today, 5 million Americans suffer from AD (Association 2019); 1 million from PD (Marras et al. 2018); 30,000 from ALS (Petrov et al. 2017), and 30,000 from HD (Mullard 2019), and these numbers will continue to grow.

Studies have shown that environmental conditions (pH, temperature, and ionic strength), and protein concentration are the major factors triggering protein misfolding, which is accumulated in amyloid plaques in different diseases (Fink 1998). In general, the mechanism of protein misfolding is the transition of a normal protein ( which is mainly random coil or α-helical structures) into β-sheets by a seeding-nucleation model. This can be divided into two different kinetic phases. The first phase is called the lag phase. During this phase, misfolding of soluble monomeric species and formation of small β-structures called oligomers takes place. Once stable nuclei (oligomers) are formed, there is a second phase of elongation. β-structures interact with each other, mainly through hydrogen bonds, resulting in the rapid growth of oligomers into a very stable structure consisting of insoluble fibrils (Chiti and Dobson 2017). Amyloid plaques are depositions of misfolded insoluble material, which are disease-specific (Chiti and Dobson 2017). Of the amyloid proteins found in plaques, amyloid-β is found in AD and CAA, Alpha-Synuclein in PD, Huntingtin in HD, and PrP in Prion disease.

Compelling studies have demonstrated that cell dysfunction and death in PMDs is a consequence of the accumulation of misfolded proteins, with intermediate species, some as small as soluble oligomers, representing the most toxic conformation (Caughey and Lansbury 2003; Glabe 2006; Walsh and Selkoe 2007). It has been described that changes in membrane permeability, intracellular calcium levels, mitochondria dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagy impairment, among others, could be the mechanisms by which misfolded proteins produce toxicity and cell death (Soto 2003).

Alzheimer’s disease

Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most prevalent diseases that affects the elderly (Association 2019). Characterized by irreversible neurodegeneration, it accounts for up to 75% of dementia cases, although “mixed” pathology with vascular disease is common. AD can be due to genetic (also known as familial AD), or sporadic factors, which is the influence of many environmental factors and mutations. The clinical manifestation of familial AD starts at around 30–50 years of age, much earlier than sporadic cases, which peak at 85 years of age (Bateman et al. 2011). Sporadic AD accounts for ~70% of the total cases.

Some estimate that every 65-seconds a person develops Alzheimer’s, and one of every 2–3 people over 85 years of age will be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. 5.7 million people are currently living with Alzheimer’s in 2018, and it has been projected to increase to 13.8 million by 2050 (Association 2019). Also, it has been projected that the annual cost for health care for people with Alzheimer’s and other dementias will increase from $277 billion in 2018 to $1.1 trillion in 2050 (Sweeney et al. 2019). Alzheimer’s pathology is characterized by the deposition of amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that produce cognitive impairment and memory loss (Ballard et al. 2011).

Amyloid plaques are extracellular depositions of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) protein in the iso-cortex and subcortical structures, that can be 40 (Aβ−40) or 42 (Aβ−42) amino acids in length, depending on the cleavage of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by presenilin-1 (PSEN1) and presenilin-2 (PSEN2) (Hardy 2006). Alzheimer’s pathology is characterized by the overexpression of APP, leading to overproduction Aβ−40 or Aβ−42 isoforms, which will induce protein misfolding and formation of amyloid plaques (Miya Shaik et al. 2018). It has been demonstrated that genetic variation in APP promoter increases transcription of APP by 2–3 folds, increasing the risk to develop AD (C. G. Liu et al. 2014a). Another example that supports the critical role of APP overexpression in amyloid pathology is down syndrome (DS) patients. Nearly all individuals with DS develop typical AD neuropathology (Davidson et al. 2018). Triplication of chromosome 21, where gene coding APP is located, leads to APP overexpression (Wiseman et al. 2015) and development of AD pathology much earlier than in regular individuals (Lemere et al. 1996). The same effect has been observed in Tau neurofibrillary tangles (Adams et al. 2009).

Neurofibrillary tangles are an intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (Ballatore et al. 2007). Tau pathology starts in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus and propagates throughout the iso-cortex (Serrano-Pozo et al. 2011). Neuronal death and loss of synapses in the brain of AD patients are closely correlated with the formation and spreading of hyperphosphorylated Tau and with the clinical features and severity of AD (Serrano-Pozo et al. 2011).

Clinical features of AD mainly involve memory loss, and initially, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Borroni et al. 2006). Based on cognitive and functional impairment, the progression of AD pathology can be divided into four stages. Stage 1, or pre-dementia, is characterized by thoughtlessness, and problems with abstract judgment/semantic memory. Stage 2, or early-AD, is marked by problems in language, executive functions, and execution of fine movements. In Stage 3 or moderate-AD, the clinical progression of the disease is rapid with clear speech difficulties, and the patient becomes dependent on others for many routine activities of daily living. Finally, in stage 4 or advanced-AD, patients become severely impaired and dependent on caregivers and family members for all daily and routine activities (Backman et al. 2004; Forstl and Kurz 1999).

Currently, Alzheimer’s disease can be only and definitively diagnosed post-mortem (Jack et al. 2018). However, a probable diagnosis of AD is possible today. To assess whether individuals have cognitive impairment and dysfunction in daily or occupational activities, characteristic of Alzheimer’s, the patient and family members give a detailed patient history, which is assessed by a medical provider (Knudsen et al. 2001). Patients are divided into possible or probable AD-dementia.

In 2011, The National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) developed new guidelines for the diagnosis of symptomatic or clinical stages of AD, MCI, and AD-related dementia (McKhann et al. 2011; Albert et al. 2011). In addition, a classification of patients without AD-symptoms but of preclinical-AD was created (Sperling et al. 2011).

A clear definition for symptomatic stages of AD was updated to help in diagnostic decision-making and enrollment in clinical trials. Preclinical AD-stages were also defined to provide researchers with a common language, where patients were not presenting with symptoms of AD (no cognitive impairment), but with altered AD biomarkers (Sperling et al. 2011; Jack et al. 2011). Commonly used biomarkers for AD include cortical Aβ plaques using positron emission tomography (PET) ligand binding (Ikonomovic et al. 2008; Fleisher et al. 2011) and low levels of Aβ−42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Blennow et al. 2015). Biomarkers for Tau fibrillary tangles are cortical Tau tangles on PET (Villemagne et al. 2015; Brier et al. 2016; Chien et al. 2013), and high levels of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein in the CSF (Buerger et al. 2006). Biomarkers are also used to detect neurodegeneration or neuronal atrophy and include high levels of Tau in the CSF (Toledo et al. 2014; Knopman et al. 2013), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET hypometabolism (Wirth et al. 2013), and atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Prestia et al. 2013).

The utilization of imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers has become fundamental in the diagnosis of AD pathology. It has been estimated that 10–30% of individuals diagnosed clinically with AD (by an expert in AD-related dementia), with normal levels of Aβ−42 in CSF and normal amyloid-PET studies (Rowe et al. 2010; Rowe et al. 2007; Jack et al. 2008; Zwan et al. 2017), do not have AD-neuropathological changes in the brain on post-mortem analysis (P. T. Nelson et al. 2011). In others, AD-neuropathological changes occur without clinical symptoms. It has been demonstrated that 30–40% of cognitive unimpaired (CU) elderly individuals have AD-neuropathological changes on autopsy (Johnson et al. 2013; Rodrigue et al. 2012; Rabinovici et al. 2008; Bennett et al. 2006; Price et al. 1991), and a relatively similar percentage of cognitive unimpaired individuals present with abnormal biomarkers (Mormino et al. 2014; Rowe et al. 2010; Jack et al. 2008; Mintun et al. 2006; van Harten et al. 2013b). For this reason, biomarkers have been used to support the diagnosis of AD only in symptomatic individuals.

Alzheimer’s disease-biomarkers, although good indicators of neuropathological changes are independent of AD-clinical signs. However, several studies have shown that CU individuals with abnormal amyloid biomarkers have a more rapid progression of atrophy, hypometabolism, and appearance of cognitive decline, compared with individuals with normal amyloid markers (Villemagne et al. 2013; van Harten et al. 2013a; Visser et al. 2009; Rowe et al. 2013). A similar effect has been observed using amyloid-PET scans (Rowe et al. 2010).

Several studies have demonstrated that Aβ amyloid pathology is the first abnormality in AD-patients with genetic mutations (Cosin-Tomas et al. 2017). Although amyloid deposition alone is not able to produce full AD-pathology, it may contribute to downstream pathological changes characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease (Chabrier et al. 2012). For this reason, amyloid biomarkers are recognized as the earliest evidence of Alzheimer’s pathology in the brain (Bateman et al. 2012; Fleisher et al. 2015; Donohue et al. 2014; Young et al. 2014). However, the presence of Aβ and hyperphosphorylated Tau should be present to diagnose this disease. (Table 2).

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), specifically of the Aβ type, is a vascular centered neurological disease that is characterized by the deposition of aggregated β-Amyloid protein in the media and adventitia of small and mid-sized arteries of the cerebral cortex and the leptomeninges (Charidimou et al. 2017). CAA typically leads to cognitive impairment, white matter damage, cortical subarachnoid cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and often involves spontaneous cortical or subcortical intracerebral hemorrhages referred to as “lobar hemorrhages”. Recent studies have suggested as many as 74% of lobar hemorrhages can be ascribed to CAA pathology (Knudsen et al. 2001). As patients age, the prevalence of CAA increases from around 2.3% of 65–74-year-old individuals to as high as 12.1% of patients over 85 (Biffi and Greenberg 2011).

Much like AD, two forms of CAA exist; hereditary/familial and sporadic CAA. As a requirement of CAA diagnosis, both sporadic and hereditary CAA must have the characteristic amyloid aggregation in the vasculature. However, the distinction between these comes in the way that they present pathologically and the origin of Aβ misfolding. In hereditary CAA, much like AD the source of misfolded Aβ can be traced to several genetic mutations among which are those coding for APP, PS1 or PS2. Hereditary CAA has been shown to be almost always comorbid with parenchymal amyloid plaques as well as vascular plaques. Sporadic CAA, however, may be found with parenchymal plaques, but unlike hereditary CAA, the sporadic form can present with vascular pathology alone (Revesz et al. 2002). When comorbid, the cause (hereditary, spontaneous or AD-related) of the CAA becomes difficult to distinguish (Figure 1). As previously mentioned, CAA is often found in patients with AD, yet a growing number of studies have revealed that there are a significant number of patients that present with CAA that do not have AD. While current estimates of general CAA prevalence range from 10–50%, the rate of CAA increases to 80% in AD (Auriel and Greenberg 2012). A key distinguishing factor between CAA and AD is the isoform of Aβ that predominates in the disease. Specifically, the longer Aβ−42 protein is typically found in the plaques associated with AD, while Aβ−40 (two amino acids shorter) is the dominant form of the misfolded protein found in CAA (Zipfel et al. 2009). Some studies have found that the balance between Aβ 40/42 in the brain tends to determine the location of Aβ aggregation (parenchymal or vascular) in AD and CAA (Auriel and Greenberg 2012). However, the precise mechanism leading to CAA is not well understood. It remains unclear whether the Aβ proteins aggregating in CAA are neuronal, vascular or derived from the systemic circulation. The process by which Aβ−40 misfolds is thought to be consistent with the misfolding mechanism of the AD isoform, Aβ−42, which implies a potential for therapeutic overlap between CAA and AD. Current research focuses on the role of the brain’s clearance systems and its impairment that allows for Aβ accumulation.

The accumulation of Aβ around vessels is thought to significantly weaken the integrity of the microvasculature of the brain (Figure 2). This loss of vascular integrity is ultimately the B source of the characteristic subarachnoid CMBs and lobar hemorrhages, characteristic of the later stages of the disease. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), while less common, is typically more devastating than ischemic stroke and carries high mortality(Auriel and Greenberg 2012). It has been shown that CAA can also develop after an ischemic injury in which the vasculature is also compromised (Howe et al. 2018a). There are several potential targets that affect the accumulation of Aβ and hemorrhages that present potential therapeutic options, but are involved in complex pathways, therefore making the results contradictory. MMP-9, for example, is a protease that has been shown to be involved in the degradation of the basement proteins, increasing the likelihood of hemorrhage, yet has also been implicated in the degradation of the amyloid fibrils found in plaques associated with AD (Zipfel et al. 2009).

Previously, one of the biggest hurdles associated with CAA management was the difficulty of diagnosing CAA. The diagnostic criteria for CAA required vascular Aβ histological analysis postmortem. In fact, invasive procedures such as brain biopsy were the only diagnostic tools. In recent years, advances in neuroimaging, most notably MRI, have made it possible to identify CMBs in vivo, but improvements in diagnostic strategies are still needed. To diagnose CAA in patients, a combination of imaging, clinical presentation, and pathological data, the “Boston Criteria” are used (Table 3). There have been several other studies that have tried to identify more convenient and specificmethods for CAA diagnosis Among these, include MMP isoform concentrations, cytokine levels and APOE genes, which can bepotential biomarkers/risk factors for CAA. While studies have suggested additional diagnostic criteria, there are many alternative avenues of detection that need to be investigated (Howe et al. 2018b).

Animal models of CAA and AD

Transgenic animal models for AD and CAA have been developed by utilizing genetic mutations observed in familial cases of AD (FAD) and CAA. The genetic manipulations used to promote amyloid pathology are primarily those involved with the production of APP, Tau or PS1 (Elder et al. 2010). As mentioned previously, both CAA and AD have both a genetic and a sporadic form whose pathologies may differ from one another in important ways (Revesz et al. 2002).

Most of the animal models primarily present with parenchymal amyloid deposition. However, there are two particular models (APP23 and SwDI) that have prominent vascular amyloid deposition with less deposition of amyloid plaques in the parenchyma. Unfortunately, these two models, in addition to a typical FAD pathology, will often develop a vascular pathology as a result of late stages of the disease, therein, blurring the lines between an “AD” mouse model and a “CAA” model. Likewise, the genetic manipulations of CAA models are closely related to those of AD models.

In the past, animal models for CAA were difficult to translate because of insufficient visualization of the CMBs As these CMBs are the hallmark of CAA, visualizing these in the animal models is vital. Recent studies in our laboratory (unpublished data) have demonstrated the CMBs in SwDI mice on MRI brain, recapitulating human CAA pathology (Figure 3). Other groups are developing new models, such as the rat rTgDI so that our understanding of the subtle differences between CAA and AD might be expanded (Davis et al. 2018) (Table 4).

Therapeutic approaches in animal models have focused on controllingthe expression of APP (Hebert et al. 2009; Kumar et al. 2019; J. Li and Wang 2018), modulation of secretases responsible for Aβ−40, and Aβ−42 production (C. G. Liu et al. 2014a; Zhu et al. 2012), clearance of Aβ−40 and Aβ−42 proteins (Du et al. 2017; Y. Zhang et al. 2016a), imbalance between hyper-phosphorylation (kinases) (W. Liu et al. 2016) and de-phosphorylation (phosphatases) (C. D. Liu et al. 2016) processes of TAU (Sierksma et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2018), and inhibition of neurotoxicity (Zhao et al. 2018; Higaki et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2015) and synaptic loss (N. Xu et al. 2019; Hu et al. 2015) pathways.

MicroRNAs, a class of non-coding RNAs, are well-known regulators for post-translational gene expression of different proteins and critical in many fundamental biological events such as neurodegenerative processes (Huang et al. 2011; Hammond 2015). A very important characteristic of microRNAs is that one of them targets numerous protein genes, and one gene could be regulated by multiple microRNAs. These make microRNAs a potential tool to investigate multifactorial diseases, such as AD and CAA (Iqbal and Grundke-Iqbal 2010; Wolfe 2014).

MicroRNA and their involvement in AD and CAA

miRNA

MicroRNAs are complex molecules that have a wide variety of effects. Generally, our concept of protein creation is that DNA is transcribed, processed into mRNA and then the mRNA is translated into protein. However, only a fraction of the nucleotides that make up the human genome are actually used to code for proteins. In recent years, many of these unidentified nucleotide sequences have been identified as other variations of RNA molecules. Many of these do not code for proteins but regulate the translation of mRNA into protein. One form of non-coding RNA, microRNA (miRNA), has a primary role in regulating the translational activity of a cell. Within the genome, sequences coding for miRNA can be found in intergenic regions (52%), introns (40%) and exons (8%)(Hsu et al. 2006).

miRNAs are transcribed in the same way as other RNA molecules, but the specific sequences of miRNAs cause their structure and function to be different from mRNA. The specific sequences of the unprocessed pre-miRNA form a characteristic hairpin loop after complementary sequences produce auto-binding. After being exported into the cell cytoplasm, these pre-miRNA molecules are cleaved by a Dicer/TRBP complex that cuts the miRNA so that all that remains is a double-stranded short miRNA molecule (Mohr and Mott 2015). Once processed and cleaved, the miRNA is further processed by a complex of Argonaute family protein that separates the two stands and anneals the sequence of the miRNA strand to the complementary sequence of the target mRNA segment. Once bound to its target, the miRNA can affect the protein synthesis process in several ways that result in increased or decreased production of the target protein (Terrinoni et al. 2018) (Figure 4).

miRNA molecules are analogous to the throttle of target protein translation. Their activity has been shown to result in both increases and decreases in the levels of different proteins, but the level of effect ranges due to specific cellular pathways and complementarity to the target strand. It is currently believed that miRNAs control the production of about 30% of the known genes in protein synthesis (Filipowicz et al. 2008).

When miRNAs bind to their target mRNA sequences, the level of complementarity determines much of the mechanism and the method of regulation these molecules perform. When miRNA bind to mRNA molecules, often the miRNA molecules bind with incomplete complementarity and they repress the translation of mRNA sequences, as opposed to completely blocking their translation. When complementarity is perfect, the mRNA molecule cannot be translated, ultimately leading to mRNA degradation. However, if the miRNA is not perfectly bound to mRNAs, then three primary mechanisms repress the translation of the mRNA. One option is similar to the outcome of perfect complementarity in that the miRNA prevents the translation of the mRNA while recruiting deadenylases to degrade the mRNA poly-A tail, leading to a decrease in translation. Second, miRISC complexes can block the 5’ end of an mRNA from binding to the ribosomes necessary to translate the sequence, thus preventing the initiation of the translational process. Lastly, miRISC complexes can alter the structural nature of mRNA strands which can “knock off” the ribosomes after initiation and prevent the elongation of mRNA translation (Terrinoni et al. 2018).

miRNA transcripts are abundant within our body and control many cellular processes. miRNA and their role in diseases have been increasingly recognized. In various diseases, the processes that are faulty or overactive are often controlled, albeit indirectly, by these miRNAs. Individual miRNA can be both tissue-specific, as well as functionally specific in multiple tissues. However, the most significant advantage of using miRNA as a potential diagnostic or therapeutic tool is the ability to measure circulating miRNA (c-miRNA). Circulating miRNA are preferentially released when a cell is under stress such as occurs with injury, inflammation, necrosis or apoptosis (Terrinoni et al. 2018). In fact, in much the way certain miRNA molecules appear tissue-specific, some have shown that certain pathological conditions have an associated cellular release of specific c-miRNA that could potentially serve as biomarkers for disease(Chen et al. 2008).

MicroRNA, Diagnostics, and Therapy

Due to the relatively small size of miRNA, they have the ability to pass near seamlessly between cells, out of cells and into the peripheral circulatory system. When miRNA (as well as many pre-miRNA and pri-miRNA) enter the circulatory system, they do so via exosomes or insulated by RNA-binding proteins (Simpson et al. 2009). Unlike free-floating mRNAs, which are quickly degraded by RNases, these miRNAs are transported throughout the body with “insulation” allowing their half-life to be significantly longer (5 days or more, in some cases)(Gantier et al. 2011). This extended half-life along with the relatively high mobility of these molecules means they can be exploited for diagnosis of disease conditions.

miRNA, notably circulating miRNA (c-miRNA) molecules, are found in many bodily fluids including blood, urine, saliva, breast milk and CSF (Terrinoni et al. 2018). This suggests that miRNA level assessment in pathological conditions is cheap and relatively convenient. The stability of these molecules also allows the time between sample collection and analysis to be much longer.

Problematic analysis/ difficulty of specificity

miRNA while easy to obtain and process, pose several analytical hurdles to their use as diagnostic or therapeutic tools. Understanding the wide expanse of miRNA in the body can be complex for several reasons. For one, over 2500 different miRNA molecules have been identified, and there are likely many more. In addition, others have found examples of single miRNA molecules involved in multiple forms of cancer, but are upregulated in some and downregulated in others(Banzhaf-Strathmann and Edbauer 2014; Helwak et al. 2013). It is difficult to tie the individual effects of miRNA to specific outcomes. Likewise, due to the ability of miRNA to regulate a target molecule with imperfect binding to the transcript, identification of all the possible targets of each miRNA is a daunting task(Mohr and Mott 2015; Simonson and Das 2015). In effect, the wide-ranging effects of miRNA, the sheer number of them, and the difficulty of identifying the targets of these miRNAs with specificity make miRNA, as useful and informative as they are, a difficult source of scientific answers.

Theoretical therapies

Current research on the use of miRNA pathways as targets of therapy aims to inhibit the effects of miRNA that are presumed to be dysregulated in a healthy cell. There are three potential approaches to inhibit the regulatory effects of miRNA as therapies that have been studied: Expression vectors (sometimes referred to as miRNA sponges), anti-miRNA oligonucleotides, and small molecule inhibitors.

Expression vectors are mutated or synthetic segments of RNA that are mutated so they are unable to be translated, but still have the complementary sequences that attract and bind to miRNA, in turn, preventing them from affecting their target mRNA. If there was a miRNA that played a significant role in the process of a disease, then expression vectors provide a way to “distract” miRNA and intervene in the target cellular process(Hebert et al. 2010; Simonson and Das 2015). In effect, expression vectors prevent the binding of miRNAs by obstructing target mRNA binding sites.

Anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs) are another form of miRNA control that may be valuable as a therapeutic target. AMOs are designed segments of nucleotides that match the sequences of the miRNA they are targeting to suppress. In this mechanism, the AMO segments are complementary to the sequences of miRNA, and binding of AMOs to miRNA can have one of two effects. First, the AMO binding to the miRNA can block the sequence of miRNA that would ordinarily bind to the target mRNA, and thus AMO binding to miRNA will inhibit the ability of the miRNA to regulate mRNA. Alternatively, the binding of AMOs to miRNA can lead to the recruitment of RNases that degrade the miRNA before they are able to affect its target. Therefore, the complementary sequence of miRNA that match target mRNA molecules are already blocked, preventing them from ever binding and affecting the mRNA molecule (Lennox and Behlke 2010). In contrast to expression vectors, AMOs prevent binding of miRNAs by obstructing miRNA binding sites.

While effective and specific, expression vectors and AMOs are difficult and expensive to produce and administer. Small molecule inhibitors of miRNA (SMIR), on the other hand, represent a large group of potential molecules that play a role of miRNA in translational regulation. Many types of molecules can be considered SMIRs, but generally, they have some effect on the transcription of miRNAs. This can be the processing of pre-miRNA or the interactions between mRNAs, miRNAs and the protein complexes that bind them. In many cases, these small molecules have already been FDA approved and thus present a more expedient implementation process. However, these molecules have been shown to be less specific than other therapeutic approaches as they tend to act on general miRNA pathways rather than on individual miRNA sequences(Shan et al. 2008).

While a majority of research has been dedicated to finding methods of inhibiting miRNA, many miRNAs are beneficial or are down-regulated in pathological conditions. Recently, the focus has been directed at replacing the miRNA that is downregulated, to prevent or delay the effects of the disease. In many diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disease, the pathological phenotype is caused by a lack of inhibition that may be a result of the loss of regulatory miRNAs (Simonson and Das 2015). While replacement miRNA therapy is not well established, the theoretical ability to regain control over dysregulated pathological conditions is a highly promising area. However, the delivery of miRNA to an animal or patient remains challenging and methods to do so, while currently being attempted, have yet to be well established (Simonson and Das 2015).

MicroRNA and Neurodegenerative diseases

miRNAs play an important role in the brain (Ameres and Zamore 2013; Barry 2014; Bartel 2009; Londin et al. 2015). One of the first experiments performed to show the importance of miRNA in the brain used a mutated version of Dicer in zebrafish, which resulted in defects in brain structure and morphogenesis. However, when the normal miRNA was reintroduced, the phenotype was rescued (Giraldez et al. 2005).

The brain is a large source of miRNA, and it has been shown that miRNAs in the brain display a very particular expression pattern, which is fundamental for the regulation of important biological processes such as, neuronal plasticity, metabolism, neurogenesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and neuronal differentiation (Goodall et al. 2013; P. Nelson et al. 2003; Kosik and Krichevsky 2005). Also, it is important to highlight that a single miRNA has been correlated with hundreds of different mRNA, making them an important player in central nervous system (CNS) development (Lewis et al. 2005).

Several studies have shown dysregulation of miRNA expression patterns in the brain in several neurodegenerative diseases (P. T. Nelson and Keller 2007; Lukiw 2007; Lim et al. 2005). A correlation between different stages of neurodegenerative diseases and specific patterns of miRNA expression has become a powerful tool for diagnosis and treatment.

MicroRNA in Alzheimer’s disease and CAA

A critical challenge has been to identify molecular markers to diagnose AD at preclinical or early stages. Patients with AD-related mild cognitive impairment have the neuropathological characteristic of dementia-AD (Morris et al. 2001; Morris and Cummings 2005), and it has been demonstrated that 50% of MCI patients progress to AD-related dementia (ADRD) (Martinez and Peplow 2019).

ADRD progression includes the progressive loss of neurons, decreases in synapses, and reduction in volume and weight of the hippocampus. Studies have found a strong correlation between the loss of neurons and synapses with impairments in cognition and memory in AD patients (Reddy et al. 2012). Several groups have demonstrated changes in miRNA expression in MCI patients compared to normal control individuals (Kumar et al. 2017; Kayano et al. 2016). Studies have found dysregulation of miRNAs in AD, specifically in key genes related to AD pathology such as APP (Patel et al. 2008) and β-secretase 1 (BACE1) (L. B. Yang et al. 2003), which regulate the production of Aβ. Deficits in the clearance of Aβ peptide may be another important contributor to the formation of Aβ plaques in the brain (Millan 2017). (Hardy and Selkoe 2002). Several studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in Aβ clearance (Tiribuzi et al. 2014; Toyama et al. 2017). Specifically, it has been shown that miRNAs are able to control autophagic-lysosomal degradation of Aβ, one of the major mechanisms to eliminate Aβ (Nixon 2013; Rubinsztein et al. 2012; Bohm et al. 2015). Another important contributor to AD pathology is the direct neurotoxicity of Aβ. Several studies have shown that Aβ neurotoxicity can be reversed by miRNA (H. H. Li et al. 2016; He et al. 2017). Lastly, miRNAs have been closely related to the synaptic dysfunction induced by abnormal Aβ metabolism (Hu et al. 2015). Studies have shown that synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment caused by Aβ can be restored by manipulation of miRNAs, providing solid evidence that dysregulation in miRNA expression are critical in the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment observed in AD patients.

Tau protein can be found in phosphorylated or dephosphorylated forms, which allows Tau to be either associated or not with microtubules. This process is closely regulated by a large number of kinase or phosphatase enzymes (Ballatore et al. 2007; Absalon et al. 2013). Studies have shown that miRNAs regulate these kinases and phosphatases, which could lead to the production of hyperphosphorylated tangles (Smith et al. 2015; W. Liu et al. 2016). Changes in the pattern of miRNA expression have been associated with Tau hyperphosphorylation in the brains of AD patients(Smith et al. 2015; Singer et al. 2005). Several groups have observed the altered pattern of miRNAs expression not only in the brain, but in the blood, and CSF as well (Sierksma et al. 2018; Hebert et al. 2010; Cogswell et al. 2008) (Table 5 and 6).

Investigation of the role of miRNAs in CAA is limited. Only two miRNAs have been identified that have a specific association with CAA. Nicolas et al. examined the DNA sequence of patients with probable CAA. They focused on the APP 3’UTR and identified a mutated gene sequence that was associated with the development of CAA, even in patients without a family history. After analysis, they identified two miRNA molecules that matched the sequence of the CAA associated gene mutation, miR-582–3p and miR-892b. Their work identified that miR-892b downregulated the production of APP, but that the CAA associated mutation blocked its effects. In addition, they found that the identified mutation allowed miR-582–3p to bind to the sequence and increase the production of APP (Nicolas et al. 2016).

Conclusions

In this review, we have highlighted new research examining the potential role of miRNA in AD and CAA. We compiled the known miRNA literature that may be involved in the pathogenesis or progression of CAA and AD, however, the exact role of miRNA in neurodegenerative diseases remains to be determined. The similarity between CAA and AD, along with the vast amount of emerging research related to miRNA and AD, leads us to believe that previously identified miRNA molecules may represent an accessible avenue for research into possible CAA biomarkers. The value of miRNA, either as biomarkers or as therapeutic targets, will become clearer as we improve our understanding of miRNA regulation and function. Biomarkers for CAA and AD could be extremely valuable, especially early in the disease, when intervention is likely to be most effective. This is especially true in CAA, as a diagnosis before a large lobar hemorrhage could have implications for patient management, such as avoiding anticoagulants in these patients at risk.
