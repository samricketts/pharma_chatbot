SUMMARY

Protein phase separation by low complexity, intrinsically disordered domains generates membraneless organelles and links to neurodegeneration. Cellular prion protein (PrPC) contains such domains, causes spongiform degeneration and is a receptor for Alzheimer’s amyloid-β oligomers (Aβo). Here, we show that PrPC separates as a liquid phase, in which α-helical Thr become unfolded. At the cell surface, PrPC Lys residues interact with Aβo to create a hydrogel containing immobile Aβo and relatively mobile PrPC. The Aβo/PrP hydrogel has a well-defined stoichiometry, and dissociates with excess Aβo. NMR studies of hydrogel PrPC reveal a distinct α-helical conformation for natively unfolded amino-terminal Gly and Ala residues. Aβo/PrP hydrogel traps signal-transducing mGluR5 on the plasma membrane. Recombinant PrPC extracts endogenous Aβo from human Alzheimer’s soluble brain lysates into hydrogel, and a PrPC antagonist releases Aßo from endogenous brain hydr ogel. Thus, coupled phase and conformational transitions of PrPC are driven by Aβ species from Alzheimer’s disease.

ETOC

Kostylev et al. investigate phase states of cellular prion protein, identifying liquid-liquid phase separation with C-terminal conformation changes. In a complex with amyloid-ß oligomers from Alzheimer’s disease, prion protein forms a stoichiometric reversible hydrogel. In this cell surface hydrogel, there is extensive α-helical folding of the natively unstructured prion N-terminus.

Graphical Abstract


INTRODUCTION

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and low complexity domains (LCDs) can drive phase separation with formation of membraneless organelles (Chong and Forman-Kay, 2016; Hyman et al., 2014). Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) facilitates signal transduction for some receptors (Chong and Forman-Kay, 2016; Su et al., 2016). Prominent amongst LLPS proteins are those implicated in neurodegeneration (Ambadipudi et al., 2017; Mackenzie et al., 2017; Molliex et al., 2015; Murray et al., 2017; Patel et al., 2015).

Cellular Prion Protein (PrPC) is a surface glycoprotein causative for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) (Prusiner, 2013). The N-terminal IDR/LCD has two positively charged clusters flanking an octapeptide repeat. The α-helical C-terminal domain transitions to a β-sheet-rich fold during conversion to the scrapie state (PrPSc). A hydrophobic segment between the IDR and the C-terminal domain is implicated in toxicity (Aguzzi et al., 2008).

A role for PrPC in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is documented by high affinity interaction with amyloid-β oligomers (Aβo). Disease-specific Aβo are triggers for synaptic dysfunction, dendritic spine loss, inflammatory recruitment and memory dysfunction, as well as Tauopathy and cell loss (Hong et al., 2016; Lambert et al., 1998; Lesne et al., 2006; Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Shankar et al., 2008). Identified by expression screen for Aβo binding sites (Lauren et al., 2009), PrPC is unique in selectivity for oligomers as opposed to Aβ monomer or fibrils (Kostylev et al., 2015; Smith and Strittmatter, 2017). Aβo bind to PrPC via charged residues 95–110 and 23–51 (Chen et al., 2010; Haas et al., 2014; Lauren et al., 2009). PrPC is not essential for all preclinical AD deficits, but has a role in synapse loss and impaired plasticity, and in learning and memory deficits (Gimbel et al., 2010; Haas et al., 2016; Lauren et al., 2009; Purro et al., 2018; Salazar et al., 2017)). To disrupt neuronal function, the Aβo/PrP complex signals via mGluR5 to Fyn and Pyk2 (PTK2B) (Haas et al., 2017; Hamilton et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2014; Um et al., 2013).

The role of IDR/LCD-containing PrPC in neurodegeneration led us to explore its phase states. We find that PrPC undergoes LLPS, and with a conformation shift by NMR. With Aβo, PrPC enters a hydrogel. This occurs with a narrow stoichiometry, and is reversed by excess Aβo. Within the hydrogel, Aβo shows little mobility, whereas PrPC retains greater mobility. Solid state NMR (ssNMR) demonstrates helical conformations for the N-terminal IDR of hydrogel PrPC. Cellular Aβo/PrP hydrogel recruits mGluR5. The PrPC hydrogel can trap Aβo from AD autopsy brain. A potent PrPC antagonist disassembles endogenous Aβo/PrP condensates from AD brain. Thus, phase transitions of PrPC are coupled with conformational changes triggered by Alzheimer’s Aßo.

RESULTS

PrPC Undergoes Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation

We attempted to reconstitute Aβo/PrP complexes but encountered insolubility. Addition of PBS to PrPC at &gt;30 µM results in clouding. Microscopy of opaque PrPC suspensions by DIC and fluorescence of Alexa 568-tagged PrPC reveals phase transition with demixed spherical droplets (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1A), which dissolve upon dilution. PrPC droplets are dense, settling to form a viscous PrPC liquid layer (Fig. 1B–D). We calculate PrPC within this phase to be 20 mM (Fig. 1C), similar to FUS liquid (Burke et al., 2015). PrPC undergoes demixing at pH&gt;7, but not at acidic pH. Salt or crowding agent lowers the critical PrPC LLPS concentration to 2 µM PrPC (Fig. S1B, C). Total PrPC level in human brain is 440 nM (Fig. S1D). By local enrichment of PrPC, focal brain levels may reach the critical PrPC LLPS concentration.

The liquid nature of demixed PrPC was verified by several methods. FRAP demonstrated rapid recovery of PrP-Alexa568 fluorescence due to facile translational diffusion of PrPC (Fig. 1E). Time lapse imaging reveals that as PrPC droplets settle, they spread and relax within seconds, accumulating as flat pools. The PrPC layer grows thicker as PrPC droplets settle (Fig. 1F, Fig. S1E, Movie M1). Polystyrene beads of 1.05 g/ml float on the PrPC liquid (Fig. 1G).

Helix-α2 and α3 Thr Residues become Unstructured in PrPC Liquid Phase

Few structural studies of PrPC have been performed at pH&gt;7 (Abskharon et al., 2014; Zahn, 2003), and most assessed PrPC with deleted IDR (Biljan et al., 2012; Calzolai and Zahn, 2003). We performed solution and MAS NMR experiments on uniformly 13C,15N isotopically labeled PrPC as aqueous monomer and in liquid phase. 15N-1H HSQC spectra at 800 MHz 1H field for soluble monomer PrPC at pH 5.8 and pH 7.4 (Fig. S1G) confirmed previous chemical shifts (Fig. S1G). We compared 1D 13C spectra for aqueous monomer PrPC via single pulse excitation (SPE) solution NMR to LLPS PrPC via a SPE MAS NMR experiment. It is still clear that most chemical shifts are identical (Fig. 1H).

However, notable differences appear in two regions. Thr Cα and Cβ 13C resonances are separated by ~3 ppm more in random coil than α-helix. In the aqueous monomer spectrum, a broad peak is observed for the 3 random coil Thr (35, 97, 109), while the remaining 9 Thr of helices α2 and α3 have α-helical shifts (Fig 1I). Upon LLPS, the α-helical Cα and Cβ bands shift to random coil. Since 8 of the 9 α-helical Thr are located in helices α2 and α3 (Fig. 1J) (Calzolai and Zahn, 2003), this region shifts to random coil during LLPS. Melting of this Thr stretch has previously been associated with pH 4.6, but in LLPS it occurs at pH 7.4.

A peak not present for monomer appears in liquid phase at 108.1 ppm. This unusual 13C shift has been attributed to Trp Cγ (Ulrich et al., 2008). The integrated Trp Cγ intensity is consistent with 5 Trp residues in the N-terminus reorienting their sidechains. Such shifts can arise from χ1 sidechain torsion angles of 60° with γ-gauche effects (Fig 1H) (Sun and Oldfield, 2004). Trp χ1 are typically −60° (50.4%) or 180° (34.0%), while 60° (15.6%) is rare(Shapovalov and Dunbrack, 2011). A similar Trp conformation is detected for the octarepeat at pH 6.2 by NMR, and in a crystal of HGGGW with Cu2+ (Zahn, 2003). Consistent with Trp changes by NMR, altered Trp fluorescence lifetime is detected during LLPS (Fig. S1F).

Thus, for liquid PrPC, Thr of helix-α2 and -α3 become unstructured and octapeptide Trp sidechains are confined to an atypical torsion angle.

PrPC Complex with Aβo Yields a Reversible Hydrogel

We turned our attention to the Aβo/PrP complex. We utilized Aβo that is stable, homogeneous and can be produced from isotopically-labeled recombinant Aβ containing N-terminal Met (Yu et al., 2009). Upon addition of 50 µM (monomer equivalent, 4 µM oligomer) Aβo to PrPC (10 µM), clouding is observed. Stereomicroscopy reveals opaque material sequestering both labeled PrPC (Alexa 568) and Aβo-FAM (Fig. 2A). We term this demixed Aβo/PrP “hydrogel”, in accord with characteristics below. At 200 µM Aβo, the mixture is clear, indicating a stoichiometry-dependent phase (Fig. 2A).

To investigate the Aβo/PrP phase landscape, we sedimented the hydrogel and monitored fractions as a function of protein ratio (Fig. 2B, S2E). There is a prominent stoichiometry effect for PrPC and Aβo condensation (Fig. S2G, H). At &gt;10 Aβ monomers per PrPC, no protein is in hydrogel regardless of absolute concentrations. For Aβ:PrP ratios below 10:1, both proteins segregate into demixed hydrogel. At 6:1 Aβ:PrP (6:1 for Aβ monomer equivalents:PrP, or 1:2 for Aβo:PrP for 12-mer Aβo), half of PrPC and Aβo forms hydrogel, while near complete hydrogel segregation of PrPC and Aβo occurs below 5:1 Aβ:PrP. Below this critical Aβ:PrP ratio, Aβo acts as the limiting component for Aβo/PrP condensation and segregates entirely into hydrogel, regardless of PrPC excess (Fig. S2G). With substoichiometric Aβo, the hydrogel sequesters limited PrPC. At Aβ:PrP of 2:1 or below, hydrogel is saturated with PrPC and additional PrPC is soluble (Fig. S2H). The Aβo species here are 12-mers (Barghorn et al., 2005). Hydrogel at 6Aβ:1PrP implies 2 PrPC molecules per 12-mer Aβo. Each PrPC molecule contains 2 Aβo binding sites at AA23–51 and AA91–111 (Chen et al., 2010; Lauren et al., 2009).

We tested the necessity of dual Aβo sites on PrPC for hydrogel assembly. The AA23–111 fragment with both Aβo sites behaves similarly to full-length PrPC (Fig. S2F) while hydrogel is negligible with either AA91–230 or AA23–51 possessing one Aβo site (data not shown). Importantly, hydrogel forms at brain PrPC levels (400 nM) and Aβo levels (3 nM) observed in AD brain autopsy extracts (Kostylev et al., 2015) (Fig. 2C). Infectious PrPSc is resistant to PK digestion, but PK completely digests Aβo/PrP hydrogels (Fig. S2I).

Due to stoichiometry limits, we considered whether hydrogels might disassemble with Aβo excess. Mixing hydrogels with increasing Aβo progressively solubilizes all PrPC, with dissolution defined by 10,000 x g (Fig. 2D, E). Stringent ultracentrifugation reveals dissolution of 60% hydrogel PrPC (Fig. S2J).

We observed hydrogel assembly and disassembly by time-lapse imaging. Hydrogel condensation was imaged by mixing FAM-labeled Aβo with PrPC bearing Alexa Fluor 568 (Fig. 2F). Puncta containing PrPC and Aβo form rapidly upon Aβo-FAM addition, and settle to create a Aβo/PrP hydrogel mesh, which remains unchanged over hours (Fig. 2F and Movie M2). Preformed hydrogels exposed to excess Aβo show rapid dissolution (Fig. 2G).

Differential Mobility of Proteins in Aβo/PrP Hydrogels by NMR

We considered whether the hydrogel might provide a microcrystalline sample for ssNMR. Uniformly 13C, 15N enriched PrP 23–111 with natural abundance Aβo was studied by cross polarization (CP) MAS. At 21oC, 13C CPMAS signals are unexpectedly weak, while SPE spectra are intense (Fig. 3A). Significant CP signal enhancements are obtained below −20 oC, but the high spectral resolution of a crystalline sample is not.

The observation that CP spectra for PrP 23–111 become more intense while SPE spectra become weaker at lower temperature suggests high mobility. In a typical rigid solid, CP provides high sensitivity by transferring 1H magnetization to 13C nuclei via 13C-1H nuclear dipole-dipole coupling. When large amplitude segmental motion is present, dipole couplings are motionally averaged, approaching zero when motion is isotropic. No CP transfer is then possible and the CPMAS intensity diminishes as T increases. The same motions enhance T1 relaxation to polarize spins in SPE spectra, so SPE signals diminish at lower T. At +20oC, the high-resolution MAS spectrum indicates nearly isotropic rotational mobility for PrP 23–111 (Fig. 3A).

NMR spectra were also obtained for 13C Aβo with natural abundance PrP 23–111, and show that Aβo does not have high mobility. Aβo cross polarizes well, and slight temperature dependence is consistent with sidechain dynamics but no overall molecular reorientation. Thus, Aβo behave as a molecular solid. With full length PrPC, 13C NMR signals for the first ~100 N-terminal residues are again highly dynamic. The C-terminus in full length PrPC is not highly dynamic, and Aβo is immobilized in this complex as with PrP 23–111.

Backbone mobility is visualized by the intensity decrease of CPMAS signal MCP for carbonyl resonances. The MSPE/MCP plot compares relative mobility (Fig. 3B). Aβo data are independent of temperature, and near the rigid lattice limit of 0.42. The most dynamic is PrP 23–111. Full length PrPC lies between. Thus, by MAS NMR, Aβo is rigid while PrPC has high molecular mobility in the hydrogel.

Aβo/PrP Hydrogels are Dynamic Assemblies with Contrasting FRAP Kinetics

Macroscopically, Aßo/PrP hydrogel assembly is not perturbed by varying pH (6.0–8.75), chelating agents, NaCl, non-ionic detergents or other additives (Fig. S3A). However, the anionic detergents, SDS or deoxycholate, block hydrogel assembly at low levels.

Hydrogel NMR shows greater rotational mobility for PrPC than Aβo, suggesting possibly greater PrPC diffusivity, which we studied by FRAP. First, we photobleached both Aβo-FAM and PrP-Alexa 568, and observed a stark difference in fluorescence recovery. Aβo remains immobile with no recovery while PrP-Alexa 568 recovers modestly in 4:1 Aβ:PrP hydrogels with little free PrPC in the aqueous phase, and recovers in sec when excess PrPC is present at 1.25Aβ:1PrP (Fig. 3C). With single label FRAP, we confirmed this (Fig. 3D, Fig. S3D). The high mobility of hydrogel PrPC distinguishes it from PrPC immunoprecipitates (Fig. S3E). Crosslinking PrP-FAM with 2 distinct epitope antibodies creates a precipitate while maintaining excess aqueous PrPC. FRAP experiments with PrPC immunoprecipitates yield no recovery.

To further illustrate dynamic exchange of hydrogel PrPC, we added Alexa-568 tagged PrPC to hydrogels containing PrP-FAM or Aβo-FAM (Fig. S3B). Alexa-568 PrPC readily enters FAM-Aβo/PrP hydrogels, resulting in orange signal. For PrP-FAM hydrogels, PrP-Alexa-568 incorporation decreases FAM signal, while for Aβo-FAM hydrogels there is no change (Fig. S3C). Thus, FRAP shows high PrPC diffusivity within hydrogels. Both FRAP and ssNMR demonstrate that Aβo is held fixed in hydrogels, unable to either rotate or translate detectably.

Liquid PrPC Converts into Hydrogel via Aβo

We considered how Aβo/PrP hydrogels relate to LLPS of PrPC. We imaged PrPC liquid droplets in the presence of Aβo. Viscous PrPC droplets show a transition within sec of Aβo exposure. PrPC droplets falling in the presence of Aβo do not spread into a flat liquid but retain their shape (Fig. S3G, Movie M3). We also added Aβo-FAM to a thin PrPC liquid phase. Spherical puncta of Aβo-FAM immediately appear in the PrPC layer. Initial Aβo puncta relatively exclude PrPC from surrounding liquid. Aβo puncta fuse within sec, and deform to large round spots (Movie M3). The Aβo-rich/PrP-poor puncta cause the PrPC liquid layer to coalesce, bulging around Aβo-rich domains with infiltration by PrPC (Fig. S3F, Movie M3). Rapidly, PrPC and Aβo are colocalized to hydrogels indistinguishable from those formed by aqueous mixture. Thus, PrPC in demixed liquid phase, in PrP/Aβo hydrogel and as aqueous monomer can interconvert in a pairwise manner.

Aβo/PrP Hydrogel on the Cell Surface

We sought to assess cell surface Aβo/PrP hydrogel. We expressed SNAP-tag-PrPC in COS-7 cells for fluorescent labeling. We compared FRAP dynamics for cellular PrPC and Aβo with in vitro hydrogels. Only cells expressing SNAP-PrPC display Aβo-FAM binding (Fig. 3E). After photobleaching without Aßo, PrP C recovers quickly, at rates comparable to PrPC liquid, 50% in tens of sec. Addition of Aβo to SNAP-PrPC cells slows PrPC recovery (Fig. 3F, G), similar to the Aβo-dependent PrPC partial arrest for in vitro hydrogel. Virtually no recovery of cellular PrPC-bound Aβo-FAM occurs (Fig. 3G, H).

COS7 cells may accumulate of supraphysiological PrPC levels. Therefore, we imaged PrPC in CV1 cells. By immunoblot, PrPC in CV1 cells was 6-fold lower than in synaptosomes from human brain (Fig. S3H). We again observed reduced mobility of PrPC upon Aβo addition (Fig. S3I).

One difference of in vitro hydrogel and cellular Aβo/PrP hydrogel is the absence of dissolution with high Aβo. However, since the extent of focal PrPC enrichment is unknown, maximal Aβo may not reach an excess required to dissolve hydrogel. Alternatively, unidentified cellular constituents or PrPC glycosylation may stabilize cellular hydrogel. GPI-anchoring is not essential for hydrogel (Fig. S4J). Overall, cell surface Aβo/PrP complexes have properties resembling the isolated hydrogel.

Lysine Clusters of PrPC IDR are Required for Aβo Interaction

We explored PrPC sequence requirements for hydrogel formation with multiple PrPC constructs, confirming the contribution of Aßo sites AA23–51 and AA95–110 (Fig. S4A, S4B). We extended the analysis by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), comparing PrPC fragments with one Aβo site (PrP 23–51 and PrP 91–230) to PrP 23–111 with both sites. Proteins with one Aβo site show low µM affinities, while PrP 23–111 has a solution KD of 16 nM (Fig. S4C, Fig. S4D). PrP 23–111 is best fit by a two-site sequential model, with a first Aßo site K D of 588 nM and a second site KD of 3 nM.

To define AA for Aβo interaction, we assessed Ala substitutions within Lys clusters of PrP 23–111. Single Lys changes decrease Aβo affinity by up to 5-fold (Fig. S4G). Multiple Lys substitutions strongly reduce Aβo affinity, and PrP 23–111 with all 7 Lys mutated shows no Aβo binding (Fig. 3I). We also assessed interaction with Aßo from human AD brain and observed the same pattern as for recombinant ligand (Fig. S4I). We determined whether the same AA residues required for in vitro interactions determine Aβo regulation of cellular PrPC mobility. There is no Aβo-dependent immobilization of 7K mutant PrPC on the cell surface (Fig. 3J).

15N MAS NMR was used to investigate Aßo binding by PrPC Lys clusters. Lys were mutated to Ala singly with the expectation that an essential Lys might be identified. In all PrPC constructs, at least two peaks are observed for Lys, one intense line for a group of protonated Lys at 33 ppm and a weaker one for neutral Lys at 26 ppm (Kougentakis et al., 2018). A large negative NOE is observed for protonated Lys when the protons are transiently saturated, indicating fast motion on the NMR time scale as expected for a fully solvated sidechain amine (Gust et al., 1975). At the same time, 15N signals for the backbone amides and the neutral lysine peak are always positive, with negligible NOEs indicating slow motion (Fig. S4H). No neutral lysine 15N resonances are observed in liquid phase. These observations are most consistent with the neutral Lys 15N hydrogel phase signal being due to those Lys involved in Aßo binding. While chemical shift resolution is insufficient to assign the bound Lys resonance in any particular mutant to a particular Lys, the binding appears to be mediated by Lys not protonated in the hydrogel. Lack of Lys protonation when bound is remarkable, though not unprecedented (Kougentakis et al., 2018), given that the hydrogel pH is 7.5 by ratiometric fluorescent indicator (SNARF5F, data not shown).

Aβo Hydrogel Formation Induces PrPC Conformational Change

To investigate conformational changes in PrPC with Aβo, we collected 13C-13C MAS NMR correlation spectra of uniformly 13C,15N labeled PrPC liquid and hydrogel at 0°C. The viscous liquid pha se results in correlation times favorable for 13C-13C NOE correlated spectra (Bertini et al., 2004), and use of 300 ms of NOE mixing yields a liquid phase spectrum with many crosspeaks (Fig. 4A). For hydrogel, we acquired a RAD spectrum (Morcombe et al., 2004) with 30 ms of mixing (Fig. 4B). Although the crosspeak generating mechanisms are different for the spectra, the correlations observed are similar. Strong Ile and Thr crosspeaks derive from the C-terminal helices, while intense Gly and Ala resonances demonstrate that the N-terminal half is observed. Many crosspeaks are superimposable, indicating that the two phases share large elements of secondary structure.

Although AA repeats and AA clusters make PrPC resonance assignments challenging, it allows some conclusions without assignments. There are 43 Gly in PrPC, with 40 between 21–131, and 24 in the octapeptide-repeat (AA52–92). Gly 13C Cα and CO shifts are isolated and identifiable in 13C spectra (Fig 4C, D). In liquid phase PrPC spectrum, Gly Cα−Cα and Cα−CO peaks occur at shifts distinctive for random coil (Zhang et al., 2003). Slices through these peaks (Fig. 4C) are single Gaussian distributions about random coil Gly shifts. Thus, liquid AA 21–94 is random coil, as in aqueous monomer. The AA113–120 hydrophobic domain contains 6 of 8 Ala. Observation of Ala Cα-Cβ in random coil shift position (Fig. 4E) indicates that the N-terminal random coil extends from AA21 to AA120 for liquid phase.

Upon Aβo binding and hydrogel formation (Fig. 4B, 4D, 4F), both Gly and Ala spectral regions shift from random coil to α-helical secondary chemical shifts. For Ala, the Cα-Cβ peaks (Fig. 4E, 4F) shift entirely from random coil to α-helical, indicating that a domain including AA113–120 forms an α-helix upon Aßo binding. A similar shift is observed for most Gly resonances. This implies that the octapeptide-repeat region adopts a helical conformation upon Aßo binding.

As discussed, Thr shifts from α-helical in aqueous monomer to random coil in the liquid phase (Fig. 1H, 1I), and the 2D 13C spectrum confirms this (Fig. 4E). Upon Aβo binding, Thr is also in random coil, as shown by Thr Cα-Cβ shifts (Fig 4F).

These observations show that the PrPC N-terminus undergoes a large conformational rearrangement into one or several α-helices upon Aβo binding (summarized in Fig. 4G).

Aβo/PrP Hydrogels Engage and Immobilize mGluR5 Co-Receptor

We sought to determine if cell surface Aβo/PrP hydrogel recruits its synaptotoxic co-receptor, mGluR5. The mobility of PrPC and mGluR5 were studied by FRAP of CLIP-Surface 547-PrP and SNAP-Alexa 647-mGluR5. Following Aβo, there is parallel reduction of PrPC and mGluR5 mobility (Fig. 5A). Both PrPC and Aβo are necessary to slow mGluR5 mobility, as Aβo-treated cells expressing SNAP-mGluR5 alone or vehicle-treated cells expressing both SNAP-mGluR5 and CLIP-PrP do not repond (Fig. 5B, Fig. S5A). Moreover, mGluR5 recruitment is specific, since Aβo-treatment of cells co-expressing CLIP-PrP and GPI-anchored SNAP tag has no effect on SNAP-GPI mobility (Fig. 5C, 5D, Fig. S5B).

In parallel, we sought biochemical evidence for mGluR5 recruitment to Aβo/PrP hydrogels by a centrifugation-based condensation assay. To facilitate mGluR5 expression, we utilized a truncated form (mGluR5-∆ICD). We detected the assembly of Aβo/PrP hydrogels as a shift of PrPC and Aβo from supernatants into pellets (Fig. 5E, 5F). A substantial fraction of mGluR5-∆ICD segregates to hydrogel pellets together with PrPC and Aβo. Neither Aβo nor PrPC alone cause a shift for mGluR5. Moreover, the amount of mGluR5 in the hydrogel decreases with Aβo excess. Thus, Aβo/PrP hydrogel recruits mGluR5 protein and alters its cell surface mobility.

Recombinant PrPC Condenses Endogenous Aβo from AD Brain

Next, we assessed hydrogels in the milieu of whole brain lysate. The ultracentrifuged TBS-soluble AD brain extract contains Aβo, while most PrPC is confined to the pellet in membrane-anchored and/or hydrogel form (Zou et al., 2011). To the TBS-soluble Aβo, we added recombinant PrPC (Fig. 6A). PrP 91–230 is incapable of inducing Aβo hydrogels and served as control. An opaque pellet is visible for lysates with full-length PrPC (Fig. 6B). Exogenous PrPC-triggered condensation occurs for both control and AD extracts, indicating that Aβo is not the only biomolecule triggering PrPC condensation.

We assessed specificity and PrPC dose dependence for control and AD brain extracts by analysis of fractions for Aβo and total protein. Aβo immunoreactivity is detected in AD lysates as a high-molecular weight (HMW) smear (Esparza et al., 2016; Kostylev et al., 2015; Mc Donald et al., 2015). No HMW Aβo is detected in the pellets and the supernatant HMW Aβo signal remains unchanged by PrP 91–230 or buffer incubation. (Fig. 6C, E). In contrast, AD brain lysates incubated with full-length PrPC loose most soluble HMW Aβo and accumulate Aβo in the hydrogel pellet, even with sub-µM PrPC (Fig. 6C, D).

PrPC-dependent depletion of Aβo from AD lysate occurs even though the vast majority of total protein remains soluble (Fig. 6E, 6F). PrPC-induced hydrogels contain nearly all Aβo but remarkably few other proteins except PrPC itself (25 KDa). Enrichment of HMW Aβo demonstrates the specificity of PrPC-mediated hydrogel assembly (Fig. 6C). To test generalizability, we processed samples from 12 AD autopsies and 12 neurologically healthy controls. We also examined extraction of membrane proteins with 1%Triton X100 (TBSX). Initial lysates from AD, but not control, exhibit HMW Aβo in TBS (Fig. 6G, 6H, S6B) and TBSX extracts (Fig. S6C, S6D). Each lysate is capable of forming PrPC-induced hydrogels, and AD samples sequester nearly all soluble Aβo into hydrogel (TBS in Fig. 6G, 6I, S6B; TBSX in Fig. S6C, S6E). Moreover, PrPC hydrogels enrich oligomerized Aβ, but not full-length APP or its C99 fragment. Normalizing the HMW Aβo in PrPC hydrogel by the corresponding crude lysates to total non-PrPC protein shows several hundred-fold Aβo enrichment (TBS: Fig. 6J, 6K; TBSX: Fig. S6G, S6H). Each AD brain lysate shows this enrichment of Aβo (Fig. 6L, Fig. S6F).

Dissociation of Aßo from Insoluble PrP C Hydrogel of AD brain by PrPC Antagonist

To investigate endogenous Aβo/PrP hydrogels in human AD brain, we used a high affinity antagonist of PrPC, poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid), or PSCMA. Biolayer interferometry (BLI) shows that PSCMA binds to PrPC but has no affinity for Aβo-coated tips (Fig. 7A). The lack of PSCMA affinity for Aßo is not due to tip coating, since the same tips bind soluble PrPC (Fig. S7A).

Since PSCMA competitively antagonizes Aßo binding to PrPC, we considered whether PSCMA would disrupt hydrogels (Fig. 7B). PSCMA, but not Triton or 1M NaCl, disassembles purified hydrogels of Aβo/PrP (Fig. 7C, D) or Aßo/PrP 23–111 (Fig. S7D, S7E). Extraction of Aßo and PrP C from hydrogel by PSCMA is as effective as SDS denaturation. In distinct contrast, PSCMA fails to solubilize fibrillar Aβo aggregates (Fig. S7C, S7D).

Next, we incubated PSCMA with hydrogel formed from endogenous AD brain soluble Aßo and recombinant PrPC (Fig. 7B, E, G). Addition of PSCMA shifts Aßo from insoluble fractions to the supernatant on repeat centrifugation, while extractions with high salt or non-ionic detergent do not (Fig. 7E, G). Thus, PSCMA elutes Aßo from PrP C hydrogel formed with either recombinant or AD brain Aßo.

These methods allowed assessment of endogenous Aßo/PrP hydrogel in human AD brain. We exposed insoluble pellets obtained after ultracentrifugation of autopsy brain cortices homogenized in TBS to various extractions. Incubation of insoluble brain material with PSCMA solubilizes both endogenous PrPC and HMW Aβo (Fig. 7F, H). PSCMA also solubilizes endogenous PrPC from the insoluble pellet of control cortices, suggesting release from a condensate with ligands other than Aβo. Strikingly, total protein stains show that few other proteins extracted by PSCMA, as compared to extraction with Triton X100 or SDS. Release of Aβo by PSCMA is not the result of membrane disruption since neither NCAM nor Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit are solubilized by PSCMA, while they are released by detergent (Fig. S7F). A substantial fraction of Aβ is resistant to extraction with any of these buffers, including 1%SDS, and is only released by 8M Urea plus 4%SDS, which is consistent with fibrillar Aβ of amyloid plaques. PSCMA-sensitive Aßo is resistant to solubilization by non-denaturing detergents such that sequential homogenization of AD brain cortices in TBS, then Triton X100, then PSCMA results in similar solubilization of HMW Aβo by PSCMA (Fig. 7I, Fig. S7G).

DISCUSSION

The major finding of this study is that PrPC undergoes both hydrogel and liquid-liquid phase transitions. The Aβo/PrP hydrogel is stoichiometry-sensitive and reversed by excess Aβo. Conformational changes of PrPC occur with both liquid demixing and hydrogel formation. Unfolding of Thr in helix-α2 of monomer PrPC is common to both phases, while the induction of extensive α-helical Gly and Ala in the PrPC N-terminus occurs only for hydrogel. The Aβo/PrP hydrogel forms at concentrations equal to those in AD brain. Phase separation depends on PrPC residues implicated in Aβo-induced synaptic dysfunction, and the cellular hydrogel restricts PrPC mobility while trapping mGluR5. Soluble Aβo from AD brain separates into hydrogel with recombinant PrPC. Insoluble fractions of AD brain contain Aßo which is released by a PrP antagonist. This supports the hypothesis that Aβo induces coupled phase and conformational changes of PrPC in AD leading to synaptic dysfunction and loss.

In general, LLPS has not been associated with conformational changes. PrPC LLPS coincides with melting of the end of helices α2 and α3, and a rotomeric configuration of Trp residues in the octapeptide segment. At pH 4.5, monomeric PrP 23–230 is significantly relaxed at the C-terminal end of helix-α2 with random coil character for Thr between AA187–193, which has been attributed to interactions between the globular domain and the flexible tail (Zahn et al., 2000). This domain is more tightly helical in PrP 121–230 at pH 7.0, while shifts for the same 5 Thr detect destabilization at pH 4.5 (Calzolai and Zahn, 2003). Since the pH of liquid PrPC must reflect its basic pI, the unfolding of the distal portions of the C-terminal helices observed here, as well as the Trp conformation, are likely a reflection of intermolecular PrPC contacts during LLPS.

PrPC interaction is not unique to the 12-mer Aβo form used for many studies here. Previous work has documented equally high affinity with ~50-mer Aβo ADDLs (Kostylev et al., 2015; Lauren et al., 2009; Um et al., 2012) and ADDLs also create hydrogel with a 6:1 Aβ:PrP ratio (data not shown). Nearly all human brain Aβo is extracted into hydrogel by recombinant PrPC. A PrPC-selective antagonist releases endogenous Aßo from insoluble AD brain fractions. Therefore, Aβo/PrPC hydrogel formation includes AD-relevant Aβo species.

The critical ratio of peptides required for hydrogel assembly is 6:1, Aβ:PrP. This reflects 2 PrPC peptides per Aβo assembly, a 1:2 Aβo:PrP ratio and a 12:2 monomer equivalent Aβ:PrP ratio. The two well separated Lys clusters within PrPC required for Aβo binding suggest that PrPC functions as a bi-dentate ligand, linking two Aβo. In contrast to rigid Aβo lattice behavior, PrPC displays molecular mobility. Labeled PrPC molecules rapidly exchange into the hydrogel from solution, and the PrPC backbone displays rapid high amplitude conformational exchange by NMR.

The simplest hydrogel model is a pseudo-tetrahedral Aβo linked by bidentate PrPC ligands. This symmetry accounts for the stoichiometry and the dynamics. Hydrogel Aβo is restricted from reorienting until 3 of its PrPC linkages are broken. The N-terminus of PrPC requires only one binding site to dissociate for isotropic rotation. Therefore, PrPC displays more dynamic behavior than Aβo. PrP 23–111 and full length PrPC hydrogels with Aβo are similar, but for full length PrPC the globular domain occupies the interstitium of the Aβo lattice. This reduces solvent-occupied space in full length PrPC hydrogel, with less PrPC mobility. The model predicts that PrPC would display higher diffusivity than Aβo in the hydrogel, since half as many linkages need be broken to free PrPC monomer. Fast PrPC exchange is possible at the hydrogel-solution interface consistent with FRAP data. The plateau in FRAP recovery is expected due to slower diffusion within hydrogel than in solution, limiting the extent of recovery. The model also provides an explanation for excess Aβo solubilizing hydrogel while excess PrPC does not. Since hydrogel PrPC is so much more labile, it can be recruited into solution when exposed to excess soluble Aβo. Excess PrPC however cannot readily solubilize Aβo, since they are so much more tightly bound in the hydrogel lattice. Thus, once formed, there is a much greater kinetic barrier to solvating Aβo by excess PrPC than for the reverse.

Major secondary structure changes are observed for hydrogel PrPC. In monomeric PrPC, the 40 Gly of the N-terminus and the 6 Ala of the linker region (AA113–120) are unstructured. The vast majority of these residues exhibit α-helical character in the hydrogel. This conformational shift spans PrPC regions for mGluR5 and Aβo interaction (Haas et al., 2014; Lauren et al., 2009; Um et al., 2013). We propose that conformational change stabilizes Aβo interaction and drives mGluR5 signaling.

Aβo-induced hydrogel conformation of PrPC resembles an early intermediate of in vitro PrPC to PrPSc conversion (Zurawel et al., 2014). Thus, initial steps in TSE and AD may trigger similar toxicity, and mGluR5 is implicated in PrPSc toxicity (Goniotaki et al., 2017). However, Aβo-induced hydrogel remains PK sensitive.

Addition of recombinant PrPC to TBS extracts from AD brain causes hydrogel formation with segregation of Aβo. Few host proteins are recruited, yielding a 300-fold Aβo enrichment. Most endogenous PrPC and Aβ segregate to insoluble fractions of AD brain. This is likely due in part to PrPC in post-synaptic densities plus Aβ in amyloid fibrils. In addition, human AD brain insoluble fractions contain endogenous Aβo/PrP hydrogel. The PrPC antagonist, PSCMA, dissociates hydrogel and releases Aßo but few other proteins from insoluble fractions.

Selective Aßo extraction from insoluble AD brain f ractions is most consistent with disruption of endogenous PrPC hydrogel. However, PSCMA has high affinity for all forms of PrPC. Therefore, it remains possible that PSCMA disrupts an unknown state of Aßo/PrP complex. Since the in vitro results demonstrate a hydrogel, it is the most likely form for the disrupted complex. Regardless, the findings document a substantial Aßo fraction in hum an AD brain trapped by PrPC, and released by PSCMA.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that PrPC exists in multiple phases with extensive secondary structure rearrangement. PrPC can undergo LLPS at physiologic pH and salinity. Aβo induces a PrPC hydrogel, with folding of large stretches in the N-terminus IDR of PrPC to α-helix. Existence of a complex PrPC phase landscape fits with the broader recognition of biomolecular condensation and of self-propagation by prion-like conformations in physiology and pathology.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECTDETAILS

Human autopsy brain

Post-mortem de-identified human brain tissue (pre-frontal cortex) from AD subjects (n=12) and neurologically healthy individuals (n=12) was collected as approved by Institutional Review Board at Yale, frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C after a utopsy. Samples of brain tissue from each patient were microscopically examined for neuropathological histological features to confirm the clinical diagnosis of AD (Braak stage V and higher). Brains of all neurologically healthy control patients had none or minimal signs of AD-associated histopathology (Braak stage 0-II). Subject demographical data are provided in Fig. S6A.

Cell lines

COS-7 green monkey kidney cells (ATCC® CRL-1651) and CV1 cells (ATCC® CCL70) were passaged in high-glucose DMEM (ThermoFisher, 11965092) supplemented with sodium pyruvate, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and Pen/Strep antibiotic mix.

METHOD DETAILS

DNA Cloning and mutagenesis

All the constructs used in the bacterial recombinant protein production were in pRSET-A vector. PrPC Ala mutagenesis screening and deletion mutants were generated with Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB) using original full length 23–231 PrPC or PrP 23–111 expressing constructs. The generated mutant constructs are listed in Key Resource Table/Recombinant DNA. For recombinant Met-Aβ1–42 production, a DNA sequence corresponding to AA1–42 of Aβ peptide with an additional N-terminal methionine to initiate translation was cloned into PRSET A backbone devoid of the N-terminal 6His sequence and thrombin cleavage site thus allowing bacterial expression of untagged Met-Aβ1–42. Protein sequences for full length PrPC, PrP 23–111 and Met-Aβ1–42 are available in Key Resources Table. For mammalian expression of SNAP-tag and CLIP-tag fusion constructs, sequences corresponding to SNAP or CLIP were amplified from commercial vectors (pSNAPtag and pCLIPtag, NEB) and cloned in-frame as fusions downstream from N-terminal membrane localization signal peptides of rat mGluR5 or human PrPC in pcDNA3 backbone. The SNAP-GPI fusion was made by replacing sequence corresponding to AA23–231 of PrPC with SNAP tag sequence (thus fusing prion protein N-terminal membrane localization signal and C-terminal GPI-attachment signal to SNAP tag).

All the constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing using forward and reverse primers and the reading frame accuracy was confirmed by translating the sequences in SnapGene viewer software. Correct expression of the mammalian constructs was also confirmed by western blotting with anti-SNAP rabbit polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs).

General protein expression optimization

Expression constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli strain (Agilent #200131) and selected overnight on MDAG135 non-inducing agar plates with 100 µg/ml ampicillin. 12 colonies from each selection were then inoculated individually in 400 µl of MDAG135/Amp medium in 96-well deep-well blocks, sealed with AirPore gas-permeant adhesive seals and grown for 12 h at 37°C with 300 rpm shaking. 80 µl of resulting cultures was transferred into a fresh 96 well block, bacteria were pelleted by 2000 g. centrifugation, MDAG medium was removed and bacterial pellets were resuspended in LB5052 medium (LB medium supplemented with 1x Studier’s M salts (Zahn et al., 1997), 2 mM MgSO4 and 1X Studier’s 5052 auto-induction nutrient mix) and grown overnight at 37°C (PrP23–111 and related constructs) or for 24 h at room temperature (Aβ, PrPC and PrP 91–230). Meanwhile, the remaining 320 µl of the matched starter MDAG135 cultures was stored sealed in the original block at 4°C. The next day, 5 µl of resulting LB5052 growth was separated by SDS-PAGE, CBB stained and the colonies with the highest expression of protein of interest were identified. For these high expressers, matched non-inducing MDAG135 cultures were then expanded overnight to 30 ml, sequence identity confirmed by Sanger sequencing and the cultures were cryopreserved as glycerol stocks.

Purification of PrP proteins

Firstly, non-inducing medium (MDAG135) cultures were inoculated from frozen BL21(DE3) glycerol stocks. Overnight MDAG135 cultures were then diluted 1:100 into 500 ml of LB5052 medium and grown overnight in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks at 37° C (PrP 23–111 and related mutant constructs) or for 24 h. at 25°C (full length 23–231 PrP C, PrP 91–230) with 300 rpm shaking to achieve high-yield autoinduction of protein expression. 100 µg/ml ampicillin was present in growth medium at all steps. Bacterial pellets were collected by centrifugation of autoinduced cultures for 30 min at 4000 x g and then were either stored short-term at −20°C or were processed immediately. The pellets were resuspended 1:20 w/v in Buffer G (6M Guanidine HCl, 10 mM reduced glutathione, 100 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8), centrifuged for 1h. at 17.700 g. in JA10 rotor (Beckman Coulter). The resulting supernatants were incubated with HisPur Ni-NTA resin in batch format for 30 min, the beads were then pelleted by 200 x g centrifugation for 5 min, supernatants were removed and the resin was resuspended in Buffer G and loaded onto gravity flow chromatography columns (BioRad, #7374251). Oxidative on-column refolding was then performed in accordance with previously published methods: resin was washed twice with 4 resin volumes of Buffer G and then a 20–100% stepwise gradient of Buffer B (100 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM Imidazole, pH 8) in Buffer G was applied in 20% steps 4 resin volumes each. Beads were then washed with 50 mM imidazole in Buffer B to remove unspecifically bound proteins and the refolded His-fusion PrPC proteins were eluted with 10 mM Na2HPO4, 600 mM Imidazole, pH 5.8. Protein elution progress was monitored by performing Bradford assay on the eluting fractions. Repeated cycles of denaturation and folding were required to completely elute PrPC constructs containing C-terminal domain (PrPC and PrP 91–230). Refolding cycles were repeated when eluting Bradford assay activity was becoming negligible: resin was washed with buffer B followed by buffer G and stepwise refolding gradient was applied as described above. Imidazole-eluted proteins were concentrated using 3 KDa cutoff Amicon filters and dialyzed in 3.5KDa Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (ThermoFisher, 87723 or 87725) against 250-fold volume excess of 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 5.8 (2 times * 2 h and then once overnight) followed by another overnight round of dialysis against water. Typical yields were 30–40 mg of 95–99% purity protein per liter of culture. For all the structural studies the N-terminal 6HIS tag sequence was removed by overnight cleavage with thrombin (GE Healthcare, 27–0846-01) at 1 U/mg PrPC at room temperature in 5 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4. The tag-free PrPC constructs were then purified by cation exchange chromatography using AKTApurifier FPLC system: cleavage mix was loaded onto HR 16/10 Column (GE Healthcare, 19740301) packed with Source 15S medium (GE Healthcare, 17094401) and equilibrated with Buffer A1 (10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 6.5) and then eluted with 0–100% 20 CV gradient of Buffer B1 (1M NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 6.5) at 10 ml/min. The fractions corresponding to PrPC A280 peak were then pooled and dialyzed against DI water for 2 h. and then for the second time overnight in 3.5KDa Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes.

Of note, PrPC fails to elute normally from a cation exchange resin at pH 7.4 with a NaCl gradient resulting in increased column pressure and extreme peak broadening, even though elution succeeds at pH 6.5. While concentrations of PrPC &lt; 20 µM are soluble at neutral pH, substantial protein loss is observed during concentration.

Purification of recombinant Aβ protein

Selection and expansion of colonies of BL21(DE3) cells carrying pRSET-A vector with untagged Met-Aβ1–42 on MDAG135 medium and LB5052 auto-inducing growth at 25 °C was carried out similarly to full length 23–231 PrPC construct. Following centrifugation, LB5052 bacterial pellets were frozen at −20°C and then lysed in 1X TBS, pH 7.4 wi th 1% Triton X-100, 100 µg/ml lysozyme, 1 mM PMSF and Pierce universal nuclease (10 U/ml) at 4°C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 17,700 x g for 1 h. The resulting pellets were processed the same way for the second time. After the first 2 lysis steps the pellet washing/centrifugation cycle was repeated once again with TBS, 1% Triton X-100 without the aforementioned lysis enzymes and 3 more times with TBS alone to wash out the detergent. Pellets were then resuspended in 8M Urea, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, centrifuged for 1 h at 17,700 x g in JA10 rotor (Beckman Coulter) and supernatants were loaded onto self-packed Sepharose Q fast-flow gravity flow anion exchange column pre-equilibrated with the resuspension buffer. Columns were then washed with abovementioned Urea/Tris resuspension buffer supplemented with 5 mM NaCl until no visible Bradford assay activity was eluting from the column. Aβ peptide was then eluted with 8M Urea, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 40 mM NaCl and the resin was regenerated using 8M Urea, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 M NaCl followed by 6M Guanidine HCl, pH 6. Aβ eluted from the anion exchange resin was then immediately loaded onto HR 16/10 Column (GE Healthcare, 19740301) packed with 20 ml of Source 15RPC medium (GE Healthcare, 17072720) in Buffer A2 (0.1% NH4OH in water) and eluted with 0–60% 20CV linear gradient of Buffer B2 (0.1% NH4OH, 80% Acetonitrile) using AKTA FPLC system at 10 ml/min at room temperature, resulting in elution Met-Aβ1–42 peak at around 20% buffer B. Pooled fractions containing Met-Aβ1–42 peak were frozen in dry ice/methanol bath and lyophilized using FreeZone Plus 4.5 Liter Cascade Benchtop Freeze Dryer (Labconco). Although the eluting Aβ was highly pure, we noticed that ammonium Aβ salts do not produce high yields of oligomers for either globulomer or F12 methods, as compared to Aβ-TFA salts. Therefore, an additional reversed-phase chromatography step was employed; the lyophilized Met-Aβ1–42 NH4OH salt was resuspended in 6M Guanidine-HCl, pH 6 and loaded onto Zorbax prepHT 300SB-C18 column (Agilent, #895150–902) equilibrated with Buffer A3 (0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid, 10% acetonitrile) and thermostated in 80°C waterbath. Following Buffer A 3 wash, Aβ was eluted with 0–60% Buffer B3 (0.1% TFA, 80% ACN) 10 CV linear gradient. Pooled Aβ peak fractions were lyophilized, weighed in 50 ml Falcon tubes and resuspended in 1,1,1,3,3,3 hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) at 10 mg/ml, boiled for 1 h at 70°C, aliquoted in microcentrifuge tubes at 0.5 mg/tube and allowed to dry overnight at room temperature. The remaining trace amounts of HFIP were then removed by SpeedVac centrifugation for 1 h and the sealed tubes were then stored at ambient temperature until use. Typical yields were above 20 mg of &gt;99% purity protein per liter of culture.

Production of stable isotope-labeled proteins

For the production of PrPC and Aβ proteins uniformly labeled with 13C and 15N the frozen aliquots of MDAG135 glycerol stocks of BL21(DE3) cells carrying the appropriate expression vector were first grown in 500 ml of high sugar labeling medium (with modifications from (Studier, 2005): 50 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM 15NH4Cl, 5 mM Na2SO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 1:2000 trace metal mix (Teknova, T1001), 0.5% uniform 13C glucose, 100 µg/ml ampicillin) in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks at 37°C at 300 RPM until reaching OD600 of 1.5. The cu ltures were then diluted 1:10 in the labeling medium with lower sugar concentration (formulation as above, except 13C glucose was at 0.2%) and IPTG was added to induce protein expression to the following concentrations: 100 µM for PrPC, 500 µM for PrP 23–111, 50 µM for Aβ. PrPC and Aβ cultures were then grown at 25°C for 36 h and PrP 23–111 culture was grown for 24 h at 37°C. Bacteria were then pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 30 min and the further protein isolation and purification steps were performed as described in the previous sections.

Aβ preparations

Synthetic Aβ1–42 peptide was obtained as lyophilized powder from The ERI Amyloid Laboratory, LLC. Purification of recombinant Aβ1–42 with N-terminal methionine is described above. Synthetic Aβ1–42 and recombinant Met-Aβ1–42 behaved identically in all assays used for characterization and quality control of oligomeric Aβ preparations. Regular assays included migration patterns on size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. S2C), SDS-PAGE and PrPC binding assays. Therefore, due to the relative inexpensiveness and scalability of production we used the recombinant Met-Aβ1–42 in all experiments throughout the paper, unless stated otherwise. Aβ concentrations for all the preparations throughout the paper are Aβ monomer equivalents, unless specifically stated otherwise.

To prepare F12 Aβo, HFIP-treated Aβ peptide films (0.5 mg in microcentrifuge tubes) were thoroughly resuspended in 40 µl of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), split in two 20 µl aliquots and 1 ml of F12 medium was added to each aliquot resulting in 55 µM final Aβ concentration. The mixtures were then incubated overnight at room temperature, centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 x g to pellet the insoluble aggregates and the soluble oligomeric Aβ (supernatant) was either used immediately or aliquoted and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.

Standard Aβo “globulomer” preparations were generated according to the previously published protocol (Barghorn et al., 2005). HFIP-processed synthetic or recombinant Aβ peptide films were resuspended in DMSO at 5 mM (22 µl DMSO/0.5 mg Aβ). Then, 250 µl of 1X PBS, pH 7.4 was added to each tube immediately followed by 31 µl of 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The resulting mix was incubated in the sealed tubes at 37°C for 4–6 h and then diluted 4-fold with deionized water (resulting in 1.2 ml/tube final volume) and incubated at 37°C overnight to yield mature globulomer Aβo. The preparations were then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 x g and the supernatants were concentrated using 30 KDa cutoff Amicon filters. Concentrated Aβo (1 mM Aβ monomer) were then dialyzed against 1000-fold excess of PBS diluted 4-fold with water (0.25X PBS, pH 7.4) using 100 µl 20 KDa cutoff Slide-A-Lyzer mini cassettes. Dialysis buffer was changed 3 times over a course of 36 h. Dialyzed globulomer Aβo was then centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 h at 4°C and supernatants were aliquoted and flash-froze n in liquid nitrogen. Typically, 70% of initial Aβ (dried HFIP film) was converted into Aβo as determined by absorbance at 280 nm using ProtParam-derived extinction coefficient (1490 M−1 cm−1).

Consistent with the Aβ globulomer literature, these Aβo preparations from either recombinant or synthetic sources remain stable for weeks and are soluble at up to mM concentrations (Barghorn et al., 2005). They appear as homogeneous 3–5 nm diameter puncta by atomic force microscopy (Fig. S2A), bind avidly to PrPC in plate assays (Fig. S2B), migrate as a single peak at 80 KDa by native size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. S2C), and induce dendritic spine loss in primary neuronal culture assays (Fig. S2D).

To prepare Aβ fibrils, Aβ films were first dissolved in 20 µl of DMSO followed by the addition of 1X PBS, pH 7.4 resulting in a final Aβ concentration of 100 µM. The resulting mix was incubated overnight at room temperature yielding insoluble Aβ fibrillar aggregates which were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 x g. The supernatants were discarded and pelleted fibrillar Aβ was resuspended in PBS and used in binding assays immediately.

For primarily monomeric Aβ preparations, HFIP-treated Aβ was dissolved in 440 µl of 0.1 M NaOH, resulting in a 250 µM stock, and processed for size-exclusion chromatography or atomic force microscopy immediately.

Size-Exclusion Chromatography

SEC separations were performed on Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, 17517501) using AKTApurifier FPLC system. 0.25X PBS, pH7.4 was used as a mobile phase. 50 µM protein solutions consisting of recombinant or synthetic Aβo in PBSX0.25, F12 Aβo in Ham’s F12 medium or monomeric Aβ in NaOH were loaded through 500 µl sample loop and separated at 1 ml/min flow rate.

In-vitro fluorescent protein preparations

Fluorescent Aβ oligomers (Aβo-FAM) were prepared by mixing DMSO solutions of recombinant Met-Aβ1–42 and synthetic Aβ1–42 labeled with N-terminal fluorescein (The ERI Amyloid Laboratory, LLC) at 4:1 unlabeled/labeled Aβ molar ratio. This DMSO mix was then used to make Aβo “globulomer”, as described above. Resulting Aβo-FAM was aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°C until use. Fluorescent oligomers migrated simi larly to the unlabeled oligomers on SEC or SDS-PAGE and displayed similar PrPC binding in PrPC-expressing cells and in-vitro (data not shown).

Fluorescent PrPC was prepared by incubating 6His-tagged 20 µM PrP 23–231 with equimolar amount of Alexa Fluor 568 NHS ester or Fluorescein NHS ester (Thermofisher #A20003 or #46410) in PBS overnight at room temperature. Labeled PrPC was then captured by Ni-NTA resin, unreacted dye was removed by washing the resin with PBS and fluorescent PrPC was eluted with 10 mM Na2HPO4, 600 mM Imidazole, pH 5.8, dialyzed extensively against water, filtered through 0.2 µm low protein-binding syringe filter, aliquoted and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Although labeling efficiency of NHS ester fluorophores at such low concentrations without dye molar excess is limited to a 15–20% ratio, the procedure allows for labeling with no more than 1 fluorophore incorporated per PrPC molecule. Such care was taken because NHS ester derivatives react with primary amines and lysine residues within PrPC N-terminus, which are shown to be important for Aβo binding. Incorporation of a single mole equivalent of fluorophore, however, did not alter the PrPC affinity to Aβo in plate-based assays (data not shown).

PrPC Plate-Based binding assays

The assay principle and experimental protocol have been published (Kostylev et al., 2015; Um et al., 2012). White 384-well MaxiSorp polystyrene microplates (Thermofisher, 460372) were coated overnight with 20 µl/well of PrPC coating solution at 4°C. 250 nM PrP C in coating buffer (30 mM Na2CO3, 80 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6) was used routinely. A 2X dilution series of PrPC coating solutions (500 nM -&gt; 31 nM in coating buffer) was used to demonstrate the avidity effects in Aβo/PrP interaction (Fig. S4F). Purified PrP 23–111 constructs used in Ala mutagenesis screening were applied at 100 nM to ensure sensitive detection of affinity differences between individual mutants (Fig. S4G). Following the coating PLISA plates were washed with 3 dispensing/aspiration cycles of 100 µl/well of PBST (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) using ELx405 microplate washer (BioTek) and blocked with 100 µl/well of Protein-Free T20 PBS blocking buffer (ThermoFisher, 37573) for 4 h at room temperature and then washed with PBST as above. To investigate the relative Aβo binding affinities of different PrPC constructs, two-fold serial dilutions of Aβo in PBSTB (PBST + 0.5% BSA) were applied to the coated plates in triplicates at 20 µl/well. For human AD lysate binding assay (Fig. S4I), pooled human AD TBS lysates were serially 2X diluted in PBSTB with 50% Brain lysate / 50% PBSTB being the first dilution and applied to the PLISA plates in triplicates (20 µl/well). To investigate the plate coating variation between different PrPC constructs or PrPC coating solution dilutions triplicates of 2-fold serial dilutions of 6d11 anti- PrPC mouse monoclonal antibody (BioLegend, 808004) was applied at 20 µl/well. All dilution series (Aβo, human lysates, 6d11) were incubated overnight at 4°C and afterwards washed with PBST as described above. Aβo and human lysate plates were then incubated with D54D2 anti-Aβ rabbit monoclonal antibody (Epitope in N-terminus of Aβ peptide, Cell Signaling Technology, #8243) diluted 1:2000 in PBSTB overnight at 4°C. After PBST wash to remove the unbound primary antibody, 20 µl/well of 1:8000 dilution of Eu-N1 Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (Aβ and human lysate plates, Perkin-Elmer AD0105) or 1:2000 dilution of Eu-N1 Goat anti-Mouse IgG (6d11 plates, Perkin Elmer AD0124) in DELFIA assay buffer (Perkin Elmer 4002–0010) was applied for 2 h. Finally, for all the plates a final PBST wash was performed, 20 µl of DELFIA Enhancement Solution (Perkin Elmer 4001–0010) was added to each well, and time-resolved Europium fluorescence was measured using Victor 3V plate reader (Perkin Elmer).

For screening of multiple PrPC variants, we utilized an Aβo plate binding assay with PrPC constructs coated onto polystyrene that shows the same dependence on positive charge clusters of the PrPC IDR (Fig. S4E). Consistent with multi-site binding, when the amount of full-length PrPC coating decreases, we observe an avidity effect with a prominent drop in apparent Aβo binding affinity, but not anti-PrPC antibody (6d11) binding affinity. From the amount of plate-bound PrPC and the coated area we calculate that a distance &lt;20 nm between adjacent PrPC molecules is required for nM apparent affinity (Fig. S4F).

Preparation of Human Brain Extracts

Frontal cerebral cortex (3 g per brain) was cleaned from meninges, weighed and Dounce homogenized on ice with a loose pestle (20 strokes) in 3 volumes of 1X TBS, pH 7.4 (Fisher, BP24711) supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and PhosStop phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche 11873580001 and 04906837001). The lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 h at 4°C. Optionally, a small aliquot of cru de homogenate before centrifugation was saved for subsequent total brain protein analysis. TBS-soluble material (supernatants) was aliquoted at 500 µl in microcentrifuge tubes, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until assayed. The TBS-insoluble pe llets were resuspended in 3 volumes of TBS-X (TBS, 1.3% Triton X100, enzyme inhibitors as above) according to the initial tissue sample weight, incubated with gentle agitation for 1 h at 4°C and centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 h at 4°C. The pellets were discarded and TBS-X-soluble material was aliquoted, flash-frozen and stored at −80°C. For the measurements of the total brain PrPC concentration (Fig. S1D) the crude TBS homogenates were diluted 1:10 with 1x Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad 1610737) supplemented with 50 mM TCEP-HCl pH 8 (Hampton Research, HR2–801), boiled in 95°C heatblo ck for 5 min and triturated to shear the DNA and eliminate viscosity, yielding 1:40 w/v total brain protein extract.

Confocal imaging

All confocal imaging was performed on UltraVIEW VoX (Perkin Elmer) spinning disc confocal (SDC) microscope equipped with motorized XY stage and Nano Focusing Piezo Stage (NanoScanZ, Prior Scientific) as well as PhotoKinesis unit for Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP). Imaging was performed through 60x CFI Plan Apo VC, NA 1.4, oil objective (Nikon) using 14-bit Hamamatsu (C9100–50) EMCCD with 2x binning. All imaging experiments were performed at room temperature in 8-well chambered coverglass slides (ThermoFisher, 155411). All imaging experiments were performed at room temperature. To image the PrPC liquid-liquid phase separation (Fig. 1) 200 µl of PrP 23–231 solutions in water was applied to the coverslip wells in the presence of 500 nM PrP-FL labeled with Alexa 568 as a fluorescent tracer of PrPC phase. LLPS was induced by an addition of 10X PBS solution (1X PBS final). 120×120×50 µm volume (1 µm Z-step) was imaged 1 h following the PBS addition (Fig. 1C, 1D) or 120×120×20 µm volume was imaged continuously to demonstrate the dynamics of droplet deposition (Fig. 1F, Fig. S1E). To image of the beads floating on the surface of PrP liquid (Fig. 1G) 1 µl of 6 µm diameter cell sorting set-up fluorescent polystyrene bead suspension (ThermoFisher, C16506) was applied to the wells with 160 µM PrPC 1 h. after the PBS-induced LLPS and the beads then settled on top of the PrPC liquid layer by standard gravity. Aβo/PrP Hydrogels were formed by gentle addition of Aβo-FAM in PBS to the coverslip wells containing 20 or 10 µM solution of PrP-FL-Alexa568 in PBS. Hydrogel disassembly imaging in Fig. 2G was carried out by gentle addition of unlabeled Aβo (250 µM final concentration) to pre-formed 10 µM PrP-FL-Alexa568/40 µM Aβo-FAM hydrogels at a site outside the imaged area and by capturing a single confocal section image every minute for 30 sec. Maintaining laser power and exposures at minimally sufficient levels was important for direct imaging of hydrogel disassembly. High laser intensities irreversibly damaged the proteins and prevented the disassembly selectively within the imaged region, without affecting the surrounding unilluminated areas).

Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching

All FRAP experiments were performed on UltraVIEW VoX (Perkin Elmer) SDC microscope equipped with PhotoKinesis FRAP unit using 60x oil immersion objective. A few 2×2 µm square regions dispersed throughout the 120×120 µm imaging area were photobleached. Images were collected every second for 7 s. before bleaching to measure the baseline fluorescence. Following the bleaching cycle the imaging was performed with 1 s intervals for the first 30 seconds and with 4 s intervals for 220 additional sec. For CV1 cell imaging expressing low levels of SNAP-PrP imaging was performed with 12 second intervals to minimize unspecific photobleaching. The 488 nM laser was used for bleaching Aβo-FAM as well for double color photobleaching of Aβo-FAM together with PrP-Alexa568, the 640 nm laser line was used for selective photobleaching of SNAP-PrP, SNAP-PrP-7K and SNAP-PrP-TM conjugated with Alexa 647. The 561 nm laser was used for dual-color photobleaching of SNAP-mGluR5 or SNAP-GPI conjugated to Alexa 647 together with PrP-CLIP conjugated with CLIP-Surface 547. For FRAP experiments in living cells all the imaging was performed in the apical membrane of the cells and at least three 2×2 µm areas per cell were bleached to average the intrinsic variability in the protein mobility between the regions of the plasma membrane. FRAP analysis is described in Quantification and Statistic Analysis.

The apparent PrPC diffusion coefficient from FRAP recovery is 0.5 µm2·s−1, consistent with a viscous liquid. Such a diffusion constant is indicative of translational mobility comparable to plasma membrane cholera toxin B subunit (Kang et al., 2012), and for the condensed liquid phase of the germ-granule protein Ddx4 (Brady et al., 2017).

Human Brain Lysate PrPC Affinity Condensation Assay

Aliquots of TBS- or TBSX-soluble human brain extracts (AD and control) were thawed on ice and centrifuged for 1 h at 20,000 x g at 4°C to remove nonspecific aggregates triggered by the freeze-thaw cycle. In the meantime, PrPC solution was prepared by diluting recombinant full length PrPC in TBS or TBSX at 1.5X the final concentration to be used in the assay. 1.5X PrPC stocks were then added to the centrifuged brain lysates in respective buffers at 2:1 v/v. PrP 91–230 was substituted as a negative control where specified. Solutions were mixed gently, incubated overnight at 4°C without agitation to prevent nonspecific aggregation. PrPC-condensed hydrogels were then pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 x g. The final concentration PrPC was 1 µM, except when photographing the pelleted hydrogels (Fig. 6B) or determining the PrPC dose-response (Fig. 6C), as specified. A 1.2 ml volume of PrPC/Brain lysate mix was used in all experiments except for Fig. 6B where 15 ml of mix was used to generate a readily photographed pellet. Following centrifugation, the supernatants were carefully aspirated by manual pipette and saved. The pelleted PrPC hydrogels were resuspended in 1X Laemmli buffer supplemented with 50 mM TCEP and processed for SDS-PAGE. The 12 control and 12 AD samples were obtained from 24 separate individuals. For the titration studies (Fig. 6C), pools of several control (n=4) or AD (n=4) extracts were used.

PSCMA hydrogel disassembly experiments

For disassembly of hydrogels made from purified recombinant PrPC and Aβ, 1 µM PrP AA23–111 or 23–231 (FL) were mixed with 5 µM Aβo in globulomer buffer (GB, 0.25X PBS) and incubated for 1 h. at room temperature to allow hydrogel formation. Hydrogels were then pelleted by gentle centrifugation (2000 x g for 1 min) and the supernatants were discarded. The resulting hydrogel pellets were resuspended in a panel of buffers: GB, GB with 100 µM PSCMA, GB with 1% Triton X100, GB with 1M NaCl, GB with 1% SDS (all solutions were pH 7.4). Following 1 h. incubation the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 30 min and the supernatant and pellet fractions were diluted to the same volume in Laemmli buffer (1X final), heated for 5 min at 65 degrees and analyzed for the presence of PrP and Aβo by immunoblotting (Fig. 7E, G). The fraction of hydrogel material solubilized was calculated.

For disassembly of the hydrogels induced by recombinant PrPC mixed with TBS or TBSX human brain lysates, hydrogels were prepared as described in PrPC Affinity Condensation Assay methods section. Following 20,000 x g centrifugation, the pelleted material was incubated with aforementioned buffer panel for 1 h, ultracentrifuged at 100,000 x g for 30 min., the resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were heated in Laemmli buffer and analyzed for PrP and Aβ presence by immunoblotting.

For endogenous hydrogel experiments with human brain TBS-insoluble material (Fig. 7F,H; Fig. S7F), human cortices (~1 g) were homogenized in TBS (10:1 v/w) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors as described above and centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 30 min. The resulting supernatants were saved and the pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of TBS and centrifuged at 100,000 x g again to limit unspecific protein carryover in subsequent steps. The washed pellets were incubated with a buffer panel for 1 h at 4oC, centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 x g. The supernatants were saved and the pellets were resuspended in a harsh denaturing buffer (4% SDS, 8M Urea, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) to release the remaining insoluble proteins. Samples were than centrifuged at 20,000 x g at room temperature for 30 min. The supernatants from the buffer panel incubation and the subsequent denaturing buffer extraction were than separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting and CBB staining. Alternatively, TBS-insoluble brain material was incubated with extraction buffers sequentially: 10 v/w of TBSX followed by 100 µM PSCMA in GB and 1% SDS in GB (Fig. 7I, Fig. S7G). Each extraction buffer was supplemented with protease inhibitors and incubated with resuspended insoluble pellets for 1 h at 4oC. And centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 30 min. Supernatants were saved, and the pellets were then resuspended in subsequent extraction buffer.

SDS-PAGE, CBB staining and Western Blotting

All SDS-PAGE separations were performed using 26-well 4–20% acrylamide precast gradient gels (BioRad, #567–1095) at constant voltage (180V) in Tris-Glycine-SDS running buffer (BioRad, #1610732). All the samples were heated for 5 min at 65°C in the presence of 1X Laemmli buffer supplemented with 50 mM TCEP-HCl before separation. For Coomassie staining, the gels were washed 3X with distilled water for 5 minutes and stained with SimpleBlue CBB stain (ThermoFisher, LC6060) for 2 h at 23°C and the excess stain was wa shed with distilled water until clearing of the gel background. For the hydrogel stoichiometry investigation experiments (Fig. 2B, S2E–H), as well as for mGluR5 hydrogel co-segregation assay (Fig. 5E) the matched gels corresponding to the supernatant and to the hydrogel pellet fractions were processed identically in parallel during all steps (separation, washing, staining and imaging) to achieve matched staining quality and intensity in these sets. For immunoblotting of human brain lysates and PrPC-induced condensates of brain material the gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (ThermoFisher, IB301001) using iBlot semi-dry transfer system (ThermoFisher). After the transfer, the membranes were rinsed with water and then boiled by microwaving in PBS to unmask the Aβ epitopes. After cooling the membranes were blocked with fluorescent Western blocking buffer (Rockland, MB-070) and immunoblotted with 1:2,000 D54D2 anti-Aβ antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. The membranes were then washed 3X with TBS-T (TBS, 0.1% Tween 20) and the bound primary antibody was detected by IRDye 800CW-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000 in TBS-T), membranes were washed again and imaged with LiCor Odyssey near-infrared scanner.

Cell Cultures, transfections, fluorescent labeling and treatments

For all the imaging experiments, trypsinized cells were seeded in 8-well chambered sterile coverglass slides (ThermoFisher, 155411) at 10000 cells/well in 250 µl of complete growth medium and cultured overnight. The following day, the cells were transfected with a total of 200 ng DNA/well using Lipofectamine 3000 lipid transfection reagent (ThermoFisher, L3000015) according to manufacturer’s protocol. For double transfections (CLIP-PrP together with SNAP-mGluR5 or SNAP-GPI) 100 ng of each plasmid was used and empty pcDNA3 vector was used as negative control. Cells were cultured for 36 h following transfection to allow for adequate protein expression before further experimental procedures.

For fluorescent labeling, the cells expressing SNAP or CLIP fusion proteins were incubated with 500 nM SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor647 alone or together with 500 nM CLIP-Surface 547 in double-color frap experiments (Fig. 5, S5) in complete medium for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were washed twice with PBS supplemented with calcium and magnesium (Sigma, D8662) to remove the excess labeling fluorophores and then 250 µl of Aβo-FAM in PBSCa,Mg or PBSCa,Mg alone (vehicle) was added. Aβo was applied for 1 h at 37°C and was present throu ghout the imaging at room temperature.

Synaptic toxicity assay

Cultured hippocampal mouse neurons were transfected with GFP plasmid by calcium-phosphate method at DIV 14. For Aβo induced spine loss test, Aβo (1 µM) or Vehicle (PBS) were applied to the neurons at DIV 17 by replacing 50% of the culture medium with fresh Aβo or Veh-containing medium repeatedly every 24 h for 4 days. After treatment, neurons were fixed and imaged with a 40X objective oil lens on a Nikon Eclipse Ti Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope driven by Volocity software (PerkinElmer). Images were obtained as a 1 μm Z-stack with 0.5 μm spacing using a 488 laser. All imaging and analyses were completed by an observer unaware of the treatment group.

Analysis and quantification of data were performed with Volocity software after max intensity projection. The numbers of dendritic spines were counted manually to estimate the density of primary or secondary dendritic branch by observer unaware of drug or genotype. For each condition, at least 3 dendrites were measured from each neuron and 5–7 neurons were imaged per coverslip.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry

Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed on VP-ITC calorimeter (GE Healthcare). All titrations were done at 37°C in PBSX0.25 buffer . The 60 µM PrP91–230 or PrP 23–111 was titrated into 30 µM Aβo; 96 µM PrP 23–51 was titrated into 50 µM Aβo. Thermogram analysis is described in Quantification and Statistic Analysis.

Biolayer Interferometry

200 nM biotinylated Aßo or full-length human PrPC (biotinylated by incubation in 2-fold molar excess biotin-NHS (Thermo Scientific, 21329) for 2 hr in PBS at room temperature) were coated onto streptavidin Biosensors (ForteBio, 18–5019) and exposed to ligands in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma, P7949) and 0.1% BSA. Association curves were detected and analyzed using an Octet biolayer interferometer (ForteBio).

Characterization of PrPC LLPS Space

To study the effects of salt, pH and crowding agents (PEG8000) on the ability of PrPC to undergo LLPS a 0.75x dilution series of PrPC was made in 384 well plates. All wells had 250 nM PrP-Alexa568 present as a phase state tracer. PrPC solutions were then diluted 1:1 with various buffers and the plates were shaken for 1 min to allow complete mixing. The result was a matrix of dilutions of PrPC and buffers (Fig. S1B–C). 6 µm blue fluorescent beads (ThermoFisher) were also added together with aforementioned buffers to aid the high-throughput autofocusing on the well bottom. The plates were then imaged using ImageXpress Micro (Molecular Devices) with initial focusing on the blue beads using DAPI channel and with sequential Cy3-channel image (Alexa-568-PrP) in the same focal plane. Semi-quantitative LLPS analysis was then performed by analyzing the area occupied by demixed fluorescent puncta using particle analysis in FIJI using fixed fluorescence intensity threshold within an image set. Values were then plotted as greyscale heatmaps in Origin.

Imaging the Aβo/PrP Hydrogel formation in different buffers

For the Aβo/PrP hydrogel formation-permitting condition screening (Fig. S3A), 3X buffer solutions were added to Aβo-FAM in PBSX0.25 followed by the addition of unlabeled PrPC in water or water alone (negative control). Final concentrations of Aβo-FAM and PrPC were 50 and 10 µM, respectively. Blue calibration beads were used to aid autofocusing similarly to PrPC LLPS space characterization experiments, except fluorescein channel was used instead of Cy3 to detect Aβo-FAM fluorescence.

In-vitro hydrogel assays with purified proteins

For reciprocal titrations investigating the phase diagram of Aβo/PrP hydrogel formation (Fig. 2, S2), 40 µl of 20 µM PrPC or 40 µl of 100 µM Aβo was mixed with 40 µl of 0.75X serial dilutions of Aβo (250→1.4 µM) or PrPC (50→0.4 µM), respectively. All samples were in 0.25X PBS. After 1 h incubation, the mixtures were ultracentrifuged for 15 min at 100,000 x g, and the supernatants were carefully removed without disturbing the pelleted hydrogel phase. 1X Laemmli buffer was added to the hydrogel pellets and 2X Laemmli buffer was added to the matching supernatants, so the final volumes of all the samples were the same. After heating at 65° С for 5 min, the samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and CBB stained, as described above. For hydrogel disassembly centrifugation experiments, the pelleted hydrogels were thoroughly resuspended in Aβo solutions of increasing concentrations and incubated overnight. The fraction of hydrogel PrPC solubilized by Aβo excess as well as the fraction remaining in the demixed state was then measured after centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 x g (Fig. 2D, E) or at 100,000 x g (Fig. S2J). For proteinase K digestion assay, ultracentrifuge-pelleted hydrogels were resuspended in 0.25X PBS supplemented with PK at concentrations indicated in Fig. S2I for 4 h at 23°C and separated on SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining.

Purification of recombinant mGluR5∆ICD protein

HEK293T cells were cultured in cell media (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin) on 10 cm culture dishes. Upon verifying near complete confluency of the dishes, plasmids (mGluR5 1–835 AA (mGluR-∆ICD) in pcDNA3.1/myc-HisA) were incubated with lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) in OPTI-MEM at room temperature for 20 min before being applied to cell cultures. Following 3 h incubation at 37°C, HE K293T cells were re-submerged in cell media and allowed to incubate at 37°C for 48 h before prepari ng the membrane fraction.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, HEK293T cells were harvested using ice-cold PBS and sonicated in PBS supplemented with 5 mM EDTA and cOmplete™ MINI Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet (Roche) before ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g at 4°C for 30 min. Samples were then washed with PBS supplemented with 500 mM NaCl and cOmplete™ MINI Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet (Roche) by mechanical disruption of the pellet and a second round of ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant was carefully a spirated and the pellets (the membrane fraction) were stored in −80°C for later use.

The membrane fractions were thawed and resuspended by mechanical disruption in 8 mM iodoacetamide (SIGMA), 10% glycerol, 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, supplemented with cOmplete™ MINI Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet (Roche). After incubation at 4°C for 40 min, membrane was solubilized with 1.5% n-Dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) (ThermoSCIENTIFIC #89903) by sonication. Following incubation at 4°C for 1 h, samples underwent ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g at 4°C for 30 min. Anti-myc agarose beads (ThermoS CIENTIFIC #20168) were applied to the supernatant and left for incubation overnight at 4°C. After brief centrifugation at 300 x g, the supernatant was aspirated and beads were washed in spin columns using wash buffer (10% glycerol, 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 0.05% DDM). Following ten washes, pre-warmed (37°C) elution buffer (1.3 mg/mL c-myc peptide (ThermoFisher SCIENTIFIC #20170) in 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 0.05% DDM) was applied to beads and left for incubation at 37°C for 1 h. Spin columns were centrifuged at 500 xg for 15 s to collect eluate and elution buffer was applied again to beads. A total of three such elution steps were performed for each sample, every trial. The c-myc peptides were removed by repetitive filtrations with Amicon® 100K filter device.

Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) fluorescence lifetime

Solutions of purified PrPC were prepared as above in DI water and were brought to 1X PBS, pH 7.4, to make the LLPS or 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for the aqueous monomer. TCSPC lifetime measurements were acquired on a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog fluorimeter with a Horiba NanoLED-300 pulse source exciting at 297 nm and reading photon counts at 350 nm. TCSPC prompt and Trp lifetimes were measured on three separately prepared samples for each condition until a channel reached 10,000 counts. Data was fit to two decaying exponentials with a prompt deconvolution using Horiba DAS6 fluorescence decay analysis software.

NMR Spectroscopy and data processing

NMR experiments were conducted at 11.7 T (Agilent DD2 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer, OneNMR probe with auto-tune-and-match), 14.1 T (Agilent DD2 600 MHz NMR Spectrometer, C (H) cold probe with auto-tune-and-match), and 18.8 T (Agilent 800 MHz VNMRS NMR Spectrometer, custom built triple resonance 1H,13C,15N ssNMR probe). Magic angle spinning was applied by an Agilent MAS controller to 13,333 Hz, 15,000 Hz, 17,500 Hz, or 19,250 Hz with 2.5 mm rotor outer diameter (either 11 µL or 20 µL capacity) zirconia rotors (800 MHz 1H frequency). Typical pulse widths for ssNMR experiments were 2–2.5 µs for 1H, 3–3.5 µs for 13C, and 5 µs for 15N with 100–125 kHz two-pulse phase-modulated (TPPM) decoupling during evolution and acquisition periods on 1H. The experiments were run over a range of temperatures from −40°C to 23°C, which was controlled with room temperature air (23°C), a Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube cooler (−20°C to 20°C), or a custom-built liquid nitrogen counter-current heat exchanger (0°C to −40 °C). Chemical shift referencing was referenced to DSS from the D2O lock frequency for solution NMR experiments, and adamantane was used as an external chemical shift reference for the ssNMR experiments, with the downfield peak set to 40.48 ppm. 1D spectra were processed and analyzed in VNMRJ 3.2 with Gaussian apodization and zero filling prior to Fourier transformation and phasing. Multidimensional spectra were processed in NMRPipe with back linear predication with Lorentzian-to-Gaussian apodization, phase-shifted cosine bells, and zero-filling applied in each dimensions before Fourier Transformation and phasing, after which a polynomial baseline correction was applied to the direct dimension. Multidimensional spectra were analyzed in Sparky (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/).

Mobility Measurements by ssNMR

A quantitative measure for individual protein mobility in the Aβo/PrP hydrogel samples was calculated based on the following considerations. The backbone mobility of the components in these precipitates can be obtained by tracking the decrease in intensity of the CPMAS signal for the carbonyl resonances. These 13CO signals are particularly sensitive to protein backbone molecular mobility since the 1H responsible for magnetization transfer is typically the adjacent amide proton. Being so distant, this dipolar coupling is weak and more readily averaged to zero by molecular motion. To normalize the signal between different samples, the integral of the fully relaxed SPE spectrum at room temperature, Mo, was obtained for comparison to the CPMAS 13C signal MCP. In an isotopically enriched protein the CP enhancement depends on the ratio of the available 1H to the 13C MCPMSPE=γ1Hγ13C11+N13CN1H

For any of the protein components in the precipitate N13CN1H≈23, and since γ1Hγ13C:4 we expect in the rigid lattice limit thatMCPMSPE≈2.4. The inverse of this ratio is a measure of the increase in mobility, being ~ 0.42 for a rigid solid and then approaching ∞ as motion becomes fully isotropic and the CP enhancement goes to zero.

Atomic Force Microscopy

AFM samples were prepared by placing 10 µl of 0.25 mg/ml Aβo preparations on freshly cleaved mica and allowing it to adsorb for 2 min. The sample was washed 2X with 200 µl of Milli-Q water and dried carefully. Images where taken in a Bruker Dimension Fastscan AFM in a tapping mode using Silicon Nitride Cantilevers.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTIC ANALYSIS

Immunoblot and CBB staining quantitation

All CBB stained gels or immunoblots were scanned using LiCor Odyssey near-infrared scanner and the raw signal intensity from the scans was quantified using LiCor ImageStudio software. For hydrogel phase diagram construction, the fraction of Aβo and PrPC sequestered into the hydrogel pellets was obtained by dividing the quantified CBB staining of PrP and Aβ bands in the hydrogel pellets to the total staining of respective protein bands for each titration point (hydrogel fraction+supernatant fraction). The data for 2 reciprocal titrations was then plotted as 2D colorscale plot using Origin 2016 software. Statistical analysis on Aβo immunoblot signal intensity for human brain lysates and PrPC-induced hydrogels was performed by t-test in GraphPad Prism, all error bars are s.e.m., n is corresponding to the number of individual patient brain lysates used.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry

Signals from the raw ITC thermograms were integrated and analyzed using Affinimeter software. The single site association model (A+B ↔ AB) was fitted into the integrated heat data for all titrations (Aβo addition to PrP AA23–111, AA91–230 and AA23–51) to estimate the binding KD. Additionally, sequential binding site model (A+B ↔ AB +B ↔ AB2) was used to fit PrP 23–111 titration data due to the presence of dual Aβo binding sites in this PrPC fragment. The errors are ± s.d. of the parameters obtained by repeated model fitting.

Aβo Plate Binding Assays

To obtain the Aβo binding KD of individual PrP mutants, a one-site association model was used to fit the raw Aβo binding data for each PrPC construct coating using GraphPad Prism 6. The error bars are s.e.m. of replicates for n = 3 separate wells. For human AD brain lysate dilution series binding assay in Fig. S4I, the one-site association model with plateau constrained to the signal obtained for least diluted AD sample applied to PrPC-coated wells. The D50 for various coating constructs was defined as an AD brain dilution factor necessary to attain 50% of aforementioned plateau signal.

Fluorescent microscopy and FRAP

All quantitation of fluorescence intensities as well as 3D renderings of confocal Z-stacks were performed in Volocity software (PerkinElmer). For FRAP quantitation, each experiment was repeated 3 times with separate preparations of in-vitro assembled hydrogels and independently transfected live cell cultures. For cell imaging, &gt;10 cells were imaged per experiment and 3 regions of 2×2 µm were bleached per cell. The Volocity-quantified raw fluorescence intensity data was analyzed with GraphPad Prism software and recovery parameters were obtained by fitting a one-phase association model. The fm and t½ errors are 95% confidence intervals.

Error analysis of mobility measurements by ssNMR

To determine the error of the MSPEMCP ratio measured by ssNMR, the standard deviation of the noise, σnoise, was calculated from a region containing no signals (N=407 points, 261.43 ppm to 310.80 ppm) for each sample at each temperature (−40°C, −20°C, 0°C, 23°C). Then, the standard deviations of MSPE and MCP, σSPE and σCP, respectively, were calculated using the standard deviation of a sum: σSPE=∑n=1Nσnoise2and σCP=∑n=1Nσnoise2 for the carbonyl region used (N=214 points, 160.02 ppm to 185.98 ppm). This then allows for the calculation of the standard deviation of.MSPEMCP,σSPECP: σSPECP=MSPEMCP(MSPEσSPE)2+(MCPσCP)2.

The plotted error bars are ±2σSPECP from each sum.

Figure 1. PrPC Undergoes Liquid Phase Separation.

(A) DIC (top) and fluorescence (bottom) microscopy of 50 µM PrPC in water (red) and liquid droplets of 50 µM PrPC in PBS (blue). 500 nM Alexa-568-PrPC is added as tracer.

(B) Tubes with 500 µM PrPC in 5 mM Na2HPO4, pH 5.8 (left) or PBS (right). Liquid phase PrPC is denser than buffer and accumulates at bottom. 1.5 ml of 500 µM PrPC yields 40 µl of liquid PrPC (1 ml removed before image).

(C) 3D reconstructions of confocal imaging of LLPS in solutions of increasing PrPC 1 h after PBS addition (120*120*50 µm, x*y*z). Liquid layer thickness is proportional to the pre-LLPS PrPC levle allowing estimation of liquid concentration at 20 mM PrPC.

(D) 3D reconstructions and XY, XZ 2D slices through PrPC liquid layer (48 µM PrPC in PBS). Arrows indicate bulk liquid; *, PrPC droplets.

(E) FRAP demonstrates high PrPC mobility in liquid phase. Top shows images from bleach recovery of 2×2 µm area. FRAP data are quantified at bottom. Mean + sem, n= 5.

(F) Confocal imaging of PrPC liquid droplet spreading on surface. Time sequence of extended focus projections of 10×10×12 µm volume.

(G) Blue fluorescent polystyrene beads (6 µm diameter, density = 1.05) float at interface of buffer and PrPC liquid. Merge at left and channels at right.

(H) 1D 13C NMR Spectra of U-13C,15N PrPC acquired at 600 MHz 1H frequency aqueous monomer (black) and U-13C,15N liquid phase PrPC (red) acquired at 800 MHz 1H frequency at 17.5 kHz MAS rate. ssb is a spinning side band from MAS spinning.

(I) Expansion of 1D 13C spectra in (H) from 75 ppm to 65 ppm showing region that corresponds to Thr Cα and Cβ shifts. Regions for α-helical and random coil/β-sheet chemical shifts are labeled.

(J) Structure of pH 7.0 PrPC monomer (PDB: 1HJM) with Thr in red. 8 of 12 Thr are located at distal end of helices in C-terminus of PrPC.

Figure 2. Complex of PrPC with Aβo Induces Hydrogel Phase.

(A) Images of Aβo-containing tubes (top) and stereomicroscopy of green fluorescence (Aβ-FAM-containing Aβo), dark-field, bright-field and red fluorescence (PrP-Alexa 568). Aβo solutions are in absence or presence of 10 µM PrPC as indicated. Hydrogel appears with 50 µM Aβo plus PrPC (Aβ:PrP=5:1), but is absent in 200 µM Aβo/PrP mix (Aβ:PrP=20:1). Scale, 250 µm.

(B) Titration of PrPC and Aβo complexes. Dilutions of Aβo (1.4 → 250 µM) were incubated for 3 h with 10 µM PrPC. Following ultracentrifugation, pelleted hydrogels and supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE and CBB stained. Amount of PrPC and Aβo in different fractions was quantified. By SDS-PAGE, Aβo partially dissociates and migrates as a series of bands (40, 17 and 15 KDa, plus Aβ monomer at 5 KDa) while PrPC migrates at 25 KDa.

(C) Aβo/PrP hydrogel forms at PrPC and Aβo levels observed in human brain. Aβo at 3, 13 and 50 nM was incubated with 400 nM PrPC and hydrogel pelleted. Immunoblots demonstrate hydrogel sequestration of Aβo into hydrogel when PrPC is added.

(D) Aβo/PrP hydrogel phase is reversible. Preformed hydrogels (50 µM Aβo, 10 µM PrPC) were incubated with increasing Aβo for 24 h, centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 5 min. Resulting fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and CBB stained.

(E) Quantitation of hydrogel disassembly from (D).

(F) Confocal imaging of hydrogel assembly. FAM-labeled Aβo was mixed with 10 µM PrPC (4:1 Aβ/PrP) resulting in hydrogel accumulation. Scale bar, 20 µm. Supplementary movie M1.

(G) Imaging of hydrogel disassembly. 250 µM Aβo was added to preformed Aβo/PrP hydrogel (40 µM Aβo, 10 µM PrP mix). Scale, 20 µm. Movie M2.

Figure 3. Differential Mobility of Proteins in Aβo/PrP Hydrogel.

(A) ssNMR 13C CP and 13C SPE spectra of PrP 23–111 acquired at −30, 0, and 21 °C.

(B) Mobility plot of PrP 23–111 with Aβo, PrPC Liquid phase, PrPC with Aβo, Aβo with PrPC, and Aβo with PrP 23–111 from a temperature series of ssNMR spectra. Plotted are the integrated carbonyl intensities from CP spectra normalized to the high temperature DP spectrum. The dashed line represents the minimum expected mobility for a protein sample. Mean + 2 s.d.

(C) FRAP of hydrogels demonstrate difference in PrPC and Aβo mobility. A 2×2 µm area (white) was photobleached with 488 nm line, bleaching both FAM (Aβo) and Alexa 568 (PrP). No recovery is observed in Aβo-FAM channel. PrPC recovers partially with mobile fraction and recovery speed inversely proportional to Aβo/PrP ratio.

(D) Plot of hydrogel FRAP. For quantitative FRAP, either PrPC or Aβo was labeled with fluorescein and complexed with unlabeled counterpart (Fig. S3D). PrPC shows partial recovery with speed and mobile fraction decreasing with increasing Aβo/PrP ratio (left) while Aβo remains immobile (right). Mean + sem, n ≥ 15.

(E) Confocal images of COS7 expressing PrPC with N-terminal SNAP tag labeled with Alexa-647 and treated with 1.25 µM Aβo-FAM. Only cells with PrPC bind Aβo in this 90% confluent culture. 2×2 µm regions were photobleached to measure protein mobility (white 10×10 µm box in F).

(F) Images of fluorescence recovery in COS7 cells expressing Alexa647-SNAP-PrP selectively photobleached by 640 nm laser (2×2 µm region). Half of PrPC signal recovers quickly in PBS-treated cells (left). Aβo exposure slows PrPC photo-recovery (right).

(G) Quantified recovery of bleached Alexa647-SNAP-PrP (left) and Aβo-FAM (right). PrPC is progressively immobilized with increasing Aβo. Aβo is fully immobile with either 320 nM or 10 µM Aβo-FAM. Aβo: [Aβo] (µM); fm, mobile fraction (%); t½, recovery half-time (s). Mean + sem, n ≥ 20.

(H) Confocal imaging of FRAP (488 nm laser, 2×2 µm area in white) of COS7 cells treated with 320 nM Aβo-FAM. Virtually no fluorescence recovery is seen in Aβo-FAM channel.

(I) Mutating multiple Lys to Ala in PrP 23–111 results in a loss of Aβo binding in a dose-dependent manner, with PrP having more mutations showing less affinity. 4K/A protein has K101,104,106 and 109 mutations, while 7K/A version has all 7 Lys mutated.

(J) Mutating Lys in PrPC IDR eliminates Aβo-induced PrPC immobilization. Top graph: Quantitation of FRAP on COS7 cells expressing Alexa647-labeled SNAP-PrP7K→A treated with PBS or 1.25 µM Aβo (PBS: fm=61±1%, t½ =48±3 s.; 1.25 µM Aβo: fm=58±1%, t½ =43±2 s. Mean + sem, n ≥ 50). Bottom image: PrP7K→A fluorescence recovery in Aβo-treated cells.

Figure 4. PrPC Liquid Phase and Aβo/PrP Hydrogel Adopt Different Conformations.

(A) The 13C-13C correlation ssNMR spectrum with 300 ms NOE mixing acquired at 800 MHz 1H frequency on U-13C,15N PrPC Liquid phase with 13.333 kHz MAS spinning rate. Dashed lines are drawn through the largest peaks for the corresponding AA and are consistent with α-helical (red) or random coil (green) secondary chemical shifts.

(B) 13C-13C correlation spectrum with 30 ms RAD mixing acquired at 800 MHz 1H frequency on U-13C,15N PrPC hydrogel phase with natural abundance Aßo at 13.333 kHz MAS rate.

(C-F) Expansion of different regions of spectrum. Ellipsoids are expected regions of secondary chemical shifts for Gly in α-helix (red), β-sheet (blue) and random coil (green), ±1 sd from many proteins (Zhang et al., 2003).

(C) Gly Cα-CO and Cα-Cα expansion of spectrum (A) and 1D projection from 44–48.5 ppm (chosen to avoid signal from the diagonal peaks of Pro and Lys) with estimates of α-helical (red) and random coil (green) Gly to the projection. This confirms that liquid phase N-terminus is unstructured, as in monomers (Calzolai and Zahn, 2003; Zahn et al., 2000).

(D) Gly Cα-CO and Cα-Cα region of spectrum (B) and 1D projection from 44–48.5 ppm with estimates of Gly α-helical (red) and random coil (green) contributions, and the sum of the estimates (dashed purple). Upon hydrogel formation, the N-terminus undergoes rearrangement of Gly to α-helical secondary structure.

(E) Thr Cα-Cβ and Ala Cα-Cβ regions of spectrum (A) showing that Thr in liquid phase have random coil secondary structure.

(F) Thr Cα-Cβ and Ala Cα-Cβ regions of spectrum (B) show that in the hydrogel, Thr are in the same random coil secondary structure as for Liquid.

(G) 2D secondary structure models of NMR-observed features for PrPC in the Aqueous monomer phase (left) consisting of 3 α-helices and 2 short β-sheet segments with an extended and unstructured N-terminus, Liquid phase PrPC (middle) which has similar structure as monomer but melting of α-helical Thr into random coil, and the Hydrogel phase (right), which shows that the N-terminus and hydrophobic linker form α-helices upon Aßo interaction.

Figure 5. Aβo/PrP Hydrogel Specifically Recruits mGluR5.

(A) FRAP of COS7 cells co-expressing CLIP-Surface 547-PrPC and SNAP-Alexa647-mGluR5 treated with 1 µM Aβo-FAM. 2×2 µm area (white box) was illuminated with 568 nm laser, bleaching both PrPC and mGluR5-conjugated fluorophores.

(B) Quantitation of mGluR5 FRAP from (A). Most mGluR5 fluorescence recovers in cells expressing mGluR5 only (fm=63±1%, t½ =56±3 s). mGluR5 recovery is decreased with both PrPC and Aβo (fm=17±1%, t½ =83±18 s). Expression of PrPC and mGluR5 without Aßo (f m=64±1%, t½ =60±5 s) or Aβo treatment of mGluR5 alone (fm=63±2%, t½ =59±4 s) does not alter mGluR5 mobility. Additional images in Fig. S5. Mean + sem, n ≥ 40.

(C) FRAP of cells co-expressing CLIP-PrPC and GPI-anchored SNAP treated with 1 µM Aβo-FAM. Experiments in parallel with (A). No immobilization of SNAP-GPI is observed, while PrPC has restricted mobility.

(D) Quantitation of SNAP-GPI FRAP. No major changes in SNAP-GPI mobility are observed. SNAP-GPI only: fm=68±1%, t½ =17±1 s; SNAP-GPI + CLIP-PrP: fm=64±1%, t½ =18±2 s; SNAP-GPI + 1 µM Aβo: fm=65±1%, t½ =15±1 s; SNAP-GPI + CLIP-PrP + 1 µM Aβo: fm=60±1%, t½ =23±2 s. Additional images in Fig. S5. Mean + sem, n ≥ 40.

(E) CBB staining of supernatants and hydrogel pellets after centrifugation of purified mGluR5∆ICD (1 µM) incubated with PrPC (10 µM) and varying Aβo (100 µM → 4 µM). Right 3 lanes are PrPC alone, mGluR5 alone and mGluR5+Aßo without PrP C.

(F) Quantitation of CBB staining for PrPC (top) and mGluR5 (bottom).

Figure 6. Recombinant PrPC Forms Condensed Phase with AD Brain Extracts Enriching Aβo.

(A) Brain extracts were obtained by sequential homogenization and ultracentrifugation of human prefrontal cortices in TBS followed by TBS with Triton X-100 (TBS-X). Incubation with full length PrPC solution, but not with PrP(91–230) or TBS buffer results in a PrPC-rich condensed phase.

(B) Photographs of tubes showing hydrogel of AD TBS brain extract with 5 µM PrPC. No pellets are seen for extracts with 5 µM PrP 91–230 or TBS, or with 5 µM PrPC alone.

(C) Anti-Aβ immunoblots (D54D2, top) and CBB stained gels (bottom) of SDS-PAGE-separated hydrogel pellets (left) and supernatants (10% input, right) obtained from pooled control (C, n=4) or AD (A, n=4) brain TBS lysates incubated with PrPC constructs. Data here and in D-F from 1 of 4 experiments with similar results.

(D) Quantitation of HMW Aβo immunoreactivity in hydrogel pellets. Compared to AD extract before PrPC addition (Extr.), Aβo is concentrated in full length PrPC-induced AD extract pellets but not in PrP 91–230 or buffer (-PrP) co-incubated extract pellets. Control brain samples show negligible HMW Aβo. [PrPC], µM.

(E) Quantitation of HMW Aβo immunoreactivity in AD extract supernatant. Full length PrPC hydrogel depletes HMW Aβo from supernatants in PrPC dose-dependently, while PrP 91–230 has no effect.

(F) Quantitation of total non-PrPC CBB staining in PrPC-incubated AD extract supernatants. No change in total protein indicates that PrPC hydrogels sequester only a specific set of low-abundance protein.

(G) Anti-Aβ immunoblots (D54D2) of control (n=12) and AD (n=12) TBS brain extracts (top) and hydrogels after 24 h with 1 µM PrPC (bottom). HMW region is shown. For human demographics, and full blots, see Fig. S7.

(H) HMW Aβo in control and in AD TBS brain extracts.

(I) HMW Aβo in PrPC hydrogels generated with control or AD TBS brain extracts.

(J) Aβ immunoblots (HMW region, top) and CBB stain (bottom) of AD TBS extracts before PrPC addition, and in 1 µM PrPC hydrogels.

(K) Aβo enrichment in PrPC hydrogels. For each lysate or hydrogel, Aβo immunoreactivity was normalized to total non-PrPC CBB stain. Aβo was enriched 300-fold in hydrogels.

(L) Depletion of Aβo from AD TBS extracts by PrPC. AD TBS lysates before PrPC addition and supernatants from PrPC-exposed extracts are compared.

(A) PSCMA interactions by biolayer interferometry. PSCMA binds to PrPC-coated tips (KD, 0.5 nM) but not to Aβo tips.

(B) Schematic of PSCMA hydrogel disassembly. Hydrogels from purified recombinant Aβo and PrPC, hydrogels induced by recombinant PrPC plus brain TBS-soluble protein extracts or hydrogels formed by endogenous PrPC and HMW Aβo in AD brain are disassembled by PSCMA.

(C) Anti-Aβ (top) and -PrPC (bottom) immunoblots of supernatant (S) and pellet (P) obtained from hydrogels from purified full-length PrPC and Aβo and exposed to buffer (GB), 100 µM PSCMA, 1%Triton X100 (X100), 1M NaCl or 1%SDS.

(D) Quantitation of Aβ immunoblot in (C).

(E) Anti-Aβ (top) and -PrPC (bottom) immunoblots of supernatant and pellet fractions after incubation of TBS-soluble extracts from control (C) or AD (A) brains with 1 µM recombinant PrPC, and subsequently incubated with PSCMA or control buffers.

(F) Anti-Aβ immunoblot, anti-PrPC immunoblot and CBB stain of TBS-insoluble brain material from control (C) and AD (A) patients exposed to PSCMA or control buffers. PSCMA solubilizes PrPC and Aβo with minimal solubilization of other proteins. Pellet fractions were subsequently resuspended in 8M Urea, 4% SDS.
