Essential tremor (ET) is a common, progressive neurological disease characterized by an 8–12-Hz kinetic tremor. Despite its high prevalence, the patho-mechanisms of tremor in ET are not fully known. Through comprehensive studies in postmortem brains, we identified major morphological changes in the ET cerebellum that reflect cellular damage in Purkinje cells (PCs), suggesting that PC damage is central to ET pathogenesis. We previously performed a transcriptome analysis in ET cerebellar cortex, identifying candidate genes and several dysregulated pathways. To directly target PCs, we purified RNA from PCs isolated by laser capture microdissection and performed the first ever PC-specific RNA-sequencing analysis in ET versus controls. Frozen postmortem cerebellar cortex from 24 ETs and 16 controls underwent laser capture microdissection, obtaining ≥2000 PCs per sample. RNA transcriptome was analyzed via differential gene expression, principal component analysis (PCA), and gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA). We identified 36 differentially expressed genes, encompassing multiple cellular processes. Some ET (13/24) had greater dysregulation of these genes and segregated from most controls and remaining ETs in PCA. Characterization of genes/pathways enriched in this PCA and GSEA identified multiple pathway dysregulations in ET, including RNA processing/splicing, synapse organization/ion transport, and oxidative stress/inflammation. Furthermore, a different set of pathways characterized marked heterogeneity among ET patients. Our data indicate a range of possible mechanisms for the pathogenesis of ET. Significant heterogeneity among ET combined with dysregulation of multiple cellular processes supports the notion that ET is a family of disorders rather than one disease entity.

pmcIntroduction

Essential tremor (ET) is a highly prevalent neurological disease, affecting approximately 5% of adults over 40 and an estimated excess of 20% of adults over 90 [1]. The clinical hallmark of ET is a chronic and progressive 8–12-Hz kinetic tremor of the arms [2]. Family studies [3, 4], genome and exome studies [5–8], animal studies [9–11], clinical and biomarker studies [12–14], and postmortem studies [15–17] have all explored the underlying mechanisms for tremor in ET. Despite this progress, the pathogenesis of ET is still not fully understood. What has been repeatedly shown, however, is that the oscillatory network responsible for tremor centrally involves the cerebellum [18].

To facilitate the understanding of ET pathogenesis, our group established the Essential Tremor Centralized Brain Repository (ETCBR) in 2003 [19]. Over the past two decades, we have identified an array of morphological changes within the postmortem cerebellum that distinguishes ET cases from age-matched controls. These changes center on Purkinje cells (PCs) and neighboring neuronal connections, including alterations in PC axons (ovoid axonal swellings [torpedoes] [20–22], branching axons [23], recurrent axonal collaterals [23], thickened axonal profiles [23]), PC dendrites (dendritic swellings [24], regression of dendritic arbor, and dendritic spine loss [25]), the PC body (loss of PCs [26], heterotopic PCs [27], empty PC basket plexus [28]), and synaptic alterations (hypertrophic basket cell axonal processes [29], decreased climbing fiber synaptic density [30], and climbing fiber extension into parallel fiber territory [31]). Collectively, these pathological changes are likely to significantly alter cerebellar function and may lead to tremor generation in ET [32].

To identify potential molecular underpinnings for cerebellar dysfunction in ET, we recently performed RNA-sequencing from whole cerebellar cortex to evaluate cerebellar gene expression patterns. We compared 33 ET patients to 21 controls, identifying 231 candidate genes that regulate four main biological processes including (1) axon guidance, (2) microtubule motor activity, (3) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport, and (4) calcium signaling/synaptic transmission [33]. Significant heterogeneity was also observed in cerebellar gene expression profiles among ET patients, supporting the concept that ET may be better classified as the Essential Tremors, a family of related diseases [33].

Transcriptional profiles from entire brain tissue regions contain a heterogeneous mixture of cell types that may mask the expression of molecular changes that occur only in a small population of affected neurons, such as PCs in cerebellar cortex. Because PCs are important in ET pathogenesis, it is logical that attempts to further understand the molecular basis for ET should center on this cell population. To achieve this, we utilized laser capture microdissection (LCM) to specifically target PCs and elucidate how molecular dysfunction in ET PCs may contribute to disease pathogenesis [34]. We used LCM over single-nucleus sequencing (sn-SEQ) methods to obtain larger amounts of PC enriched RNA and cytoplasmic RNA, as the small amounts of starting material typically obtained from rare cell types in standard sn-SEQ protocols further exacerbates technical challenges of signal amplification and limits the number of genes identified. While there is a more sensitive method for transcriptomic analysis using antibody-based nuclear sorting that has identified rare PCs in rodent cerebellum (0.05% and 0.1% of nuclei in rat and mouse, respectively), it was not successful in human postmortem cerebellum as PCs are reportedly even more rare in human [35]. Therefore, we performed the first-ever laser capture RNA-seq PC experiment from fresh-frozen postmortem human ET cerebellum, comparing 24 ET patients to 16 age-matched controls. Overall, 36 significant genes were identified through differential gene expression analysis. Overlapping genes of importance from our prior cerebellar cortex-sequencing and the current PC-sequencing were SPTBN5, SRSF11, FUT9, and RyR1. Additional data analysis of principal components, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), hierarchical clustering, and curated database mining further reveal multiple dysregulated pathways as well as a heterogeneous pattern of gene expression in ET PCs.

Methods

Study Design and Human Sample Collection

Twenty-four ET brains were obtained from the ETCBR, a longstanding collaboration between investigators at UT Southwestern and Columbia University [35]. ET diagnoses were assigned by a senior movement disorders neurologist (EDL) using 3 sequential methods [19], as previously described [23]. ET patients lacked any history of traumatic brain injury, heavy ethanol use, or exposure to any medication known to cause cerebellar damage. In addition to their initial videotaped neurological assessment, patients were followed prospectively with structured telephone and as needed, additional in-person neurological assessments. As part of their videotaped neurological assessments, action tremor in each arm was rated by a senior movement disorders neurologist (EDL) during 12 tasks (ratings = 0–3), and a total tremor score [36] (range = 0–36) was assigned; parkinsonian features and other movement disorders (e.g., dystonic postures) were also assessed.

There were 16 control brains. Eight of the control brains were obtained from the New York Brain Bank at Columbia University. Individuals were prospectively followed at the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center or the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project at Columbia University. During serial neurological examinations, these individuals were clinically free of ET and other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), or progressive supranuclear palsy. One control brain was obtained from the National Institutes of Health NeuroBioBank at the University of Miami, Miami, FL. Seven control brains were obtained from the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center (RADC) at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago IL.

All ET and control patients agreed to and signed informed consent forms approved by the respective universities or institutional ethics boards.

Sample Selection

Samples selected underwent clinical and pathologic screening prior to inclusion. Demographic, clinical, and neuropathological information for all selected samples is provided in Supplemental Table 1. ET and control brains were chosen based on lack of widespread marked hypoxic-ischemic damage, concurrent Alzheimer’s-type changes that would meet criteria for high likelihood of AD (NIA-Reagan [37]), or evidence of other neurodegenerative disease pathology (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Lewy bodies, traumatic encephalopathy). ET patients that underwent deep brain stimulation or focused ultrasound surgery were excluded. A senior neuropathologist (PLF) examined stained cerebellar sections to determine adequate tissue morphology, including absence of autolytic changes in the granule cell layer. Ice crystal formation within a frozen tissue sample resulted in removal from the study, as ice crystal formation disrupts tissue morphology and PC identification is not possible [34]. Postmortem interval (PMI, the amount of time between patient death and brain sample freezing) was assessed for each patient but was not utilized as an exclusionary criteria for sample selection [38, 39].

Tissue Processing

All 24 ET and 8 of 16 control samples had a complete neuropathological assessment at the New York Brain Bank, as previously described [28] and further detailed [33]. Brains had Braak and Braak Alzheimer’s disease staging for neurofibrillary tangles [40, 41] as well as Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) ratings for neuritic plaques [42]. Cerebellar tissue from the remaining 8 control brains was harvested from the same region as those from the New York Brain Bank. All frozen cerebellar tissue blocks were obtained from a parasagittal slice located 1–1.5 cm from the cerebellar midline, containing anterior and posterior quadrangulate lobules, a region known to be involved in motor control and the same region we sequenced previously [33]. Sample blocks (1cm2) underwent initial RNA quality control assessment, as previously described [33], prior to inclusion in study; RNA integrity numbers (RINs) ≤ 8 were excluded.

Laser Capture Microdissection

A video and detailed protocol for tissue cutting, mounting, fixing, visualizing, and laser capturing is available from the author [34]. Briefly, samples were cut at 14μm on a cryostat and mounted on MembraneSlide NF 1.0 PEN (Zeiss CN#415190-9081-000) in triplicate. Slides were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 min, 45 s in ice-cold 95% ethanol, 2 min in 100% ethanol at room temperature, 3 dips in 100% xylene, and 5 min in fresh 100% xylene at room temperature. Slides were dried in a fume hood for at least 30 min–1h and then individually placed in a tightly sealed 50mL conical tube in −80°C freezer for no longer than 4 days prior to laser capture. Each sample required 2–3 days of 8-h collections to obtain at least 2000 PCs per patient. PCs were collected daily in a fresh Zeiss opaque adhesive cap (CN#415190-9201-000) and then digested in the cap twice using 50μL RLT buffer (100μL total; Qiagen RNeasy Micro Kit CN#74004) with β-mercaptoethanol (10μL per 1mL). Samples were spun down and placed in −80°C freezer until batched RNA extractions.

RNA Extraction and Quality Control

Following LCM, 200–300μL of total sample was combined for full RNA extraction for each patient. Samples underwent RNA extraction using a Qiagen RNeasy Micro Kit (CN#74004) following manufacturer’s guidelines with a double spin-column loading by repeating step 3. Samples were eluted in 16μL of RNA clean water with RNase inhibitors (SUPERaseIN ThermoFisher CN#AM2694; 1U/μL). RINs were evaluated using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 Pico Chip. Accepted RINs ranged from 6.4 to 10 (Supplemental Table 1). Overall, there were 57 potential control samples, and after the above assessments, 21 samples underwent LCM and RNA extraction, and 16 sample libraries were prepared, sequenced, and utilized in the transcriptome analysis. There were 61 potential ET samples, and after the above assessments, 31 samples underwent LCM and RNA extraction, and 24 sample libraries were prepared, sequenced, and utilized in the transcriptome analysis.

Library Preparation and RNA-Sequencing

All samples were prepared simultaneously to avoid batched library preparation bias. Library preparation was done using a SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 – Pico Input Mammalian – 96 rxns (Takara Bio CN#634413) according to manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, 5ng of total RNA for each sample was fragmented using a BioRad thermocycler for 4 min followed by first-strand synthesis for 100 min. Illumina adapters and unique barcode indexes were then added to each sample, followed by purification using AMPure RNAclean XP beads (Beckman Coulter CN#A63987). Samples underwent rRNA depletion with ZapR and R-probes, amplified using 13 PCR cycles and purified a final time using AMPure RNAclean XP beads. Samples were eluted in 15μL of 5-mM Tris buffer. cDNA quality was assessed by an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 High Sensitivity DNA assay and concentration determined using a Qubit (ThermoFisher CAT#Q32851). The libraries were pooled at equal concentrations and run 1×75 base-pair single-end, sequenced in quadruplicate on an Illumina NextSeq550 using 75-cycle High Output Kits (~40M reads per sample). Raw sequencing data and DEseq2 analysis for whole cerebellar cortex (GSE134878) [33] and laser-captured PCs (GSE197345) can be found at the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

RNA-Sequencing Analysis

Data were analyzed as previously published [33]. Briefly, we aligned the RNA-seq reads to the human genome and transcriptome annotation (GRCh38) using HISAT2 (HISAT2 v.2.1.0) [43] and quantified the reads that aligned uniquely to the transcriptome using the HTSeq package [44] in Python. Although a rRNA depletion was used in library preparation, filtering and removal of rRNA, duplicates, lncRNA, and junk reads were required, followed by removal of unmapped reads, supplementary alignment, and non-primary alignment; average number of mRNA reads passing these quality controls was 21.4M per control sample and 20.9M per ET sample. Mean mapping percentage was 92%. Differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2 [45]. We conducted principal component analysis (PCA) in R (v4.0.2) on regularized log transformed (rlog) data from DESeq2 and on normalized data using size factors. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using SPSS with Ward’s method and no threshold constraints.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

We used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA v2.1.0) [46, 47] to assess the enrichment of gene ontologies in every sample. For single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA), we first log-normalized the counts by the total number of reads in each sample and then computed z-scores for each gene. This list was used to input to GSEA in pre-ranked mode with C5 gene sets for gene ontology (GO Biological Process, GO Cellular Component, and GO Molecular Function).

Results

PC transcripts were analyzed across 16 controls and 24 ETs. Demographic, clinical, and neuropathological data on each sample are available in Supplemental Table 1. Differential gene expression analysis (DEseq2) across 18,123 genes comparing ET to control identifies 36 statistically significant genes (FDR&lt;0.05; Fig. 1, Table 1). Of these 36 genes, we previously reported 3/36 in our 231 top genes from whole cerebellar cortex RNA-sequencing: SPTBN5, SRSF11, and FUT9. The highest expressed gene in our PC sequencing across all samples is inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (ITPR1), which is well established to be specific for PCs in cerebellar cortex. The top 20 highest expressed genes across all samples sequenced are shown in Supplemental Table 2, demonstrating high PC specificity among these genes, with 5/20 (25%) specifically expressed in PCs and 8/20 (40%) enriched in PCs. DEseq2 analyzed differential expression levels for each significant gene in Fig. 1, showing predominantly upregulated genes (30/36) and a smaller number of downregulated genes (6/36) in ET versus control. In addition, there is a high degree of heterogeneity in the ET samples, as indicated by the heatmap. Overall, we saw moderate log2fold changes (−0.65 to 1.31) between ET and control (Table 1). On a functional level, 3/36 genes are type IV collagen genes, 7/36 genes are involved in RNA processing and splicing, and 2/36 genes are novel/uncharacterized; the remaining 24 genes are functionally unrelated proteins not connected via STRING networks (data not shown).

To further investigate sample heterogeneity, we employed a principal component analysis (PCA) from normalized transcript reads in control and ET. The PCA shows minimal clustering across ET and control groups (Fig. 2a), but a significant enrichment of 13/24 ET in principal component 2 (PC2, p=0.023; Fig. 2b), calculated by averaging PC2 values across ET versus control samples. Notably, ETs that are enriched in PC2+ have the highest gene expression differences in the DEseq2 heatmap (Fig. 1; rightmost samples “PC2+ ET Samples”), indicating these samples have marked dysregulation in a cluster of genes that are less prominent in the other ET patients. To determine what might be driving this PC2 enrichment, we examined a broad range of demographic, clinical, and neuropathological variables (see Supplemental Table 1) to determine whether there were any correlations. With the exception of diagnosis, none of these other variables were correlated with PC2 (Table 2), indicating that the PC2+ expression differences and enrichment of ET cases is driven by diagnosis.

Given the enrichment of ET cases in positive PC2 space, we further probed our DEseq2 data to identify 150 genes that have enriched expression in PC2+, with a correlation value &gt;0.7 (70%) as previously utilized in our RNA-sequencing analysis in whole cerebellar cortex of ET versus controls [33]. To visualize how these genes relate to biological processes and regulatory signaling pathways, we applied the String Network database [48] for a system-wide grasp of functional interactions between expressed genes. Among the 150 genes identified, 86/150 genes have significant clustering in pathways including axon guidance, Golgi/ER/vesicle trafficking, kinase signaling, calcium signaling/synapse organization, transcription regulation, endocytosis, RNA processing, and ubiquitination (Fig. 3). Notably, these pathways overlap with our previous whole cerebellar cortex dysregulated pathways of axon guidance, ER-Golgi transport, and calcium signaling/synaptic transmission. In addition, 2/86 of these PC2+ enriched genes were previously identified in our 231 top gene hits from whole cerebellar cortex sequencing: SPTBN5 and RyR1. Further STRING analysis of these 86 genes and their respective pathways identified multiple significant clusters in cellular processes related to voltage gated ion channels, synaptic membranes, protein binding, and other essential neuronal cell functions (Table 3).

The splay shown across the ET and control samples in the PCA (Fig. 2a) suggest a level of heterogeneity in the sample population tested. To investigate biological sources of variability across all samples and better understand the potential biological relevance of these data, we employed a single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and compared the gene ontology (GO) pathway enrichments of individual samples. All pathway scores (~4000 pathways) for each sample were analyzed using a hierarchical cluster analysis to identify the most significantly different pathways between ET and control (n=98 pathways). Notably, there was some discordance between this clustering and clinical diagnosis, as five ETs clustered with controls and one control clustered with ET (Fig. 4a top row showing ET [green] and control [blue]). Many of these pathways overlap with those identified in PC2+ enriched ET samples, including axon guidance, synapse organization, signaling, ion transport, ER-Golgi-vesicles, and RNA processing; other pathways of interest include autophagy, stress/inflammation, cytokines (IL-2, IL-6), and DNA damage and repair (Supplemental Table 3). Spearman correlation analysis shows highly correlated diagnostic samples across all significant GO pathways (Fig. 4b), with the exception of the same five ETs and one control not correlating with their clinical diagnostic groupings. This is further evidence of significant heterogeneity among sequenced PCs.

We previously identified two distinct ET clusters with inversely regulated pathways from our gene expression analysis in cerebellar cortex of ET [33]. To investigate the heterogeneity of our PC transcripts among ET patients, we performed a second hierarchical cluster analysis with ssGSEA pathways across ET samples only. ET samples were clustered into 8 groups from two main nodes (Fig. 5a), with the same five “control-like” ETs clustering together again (Fig. 5a, red line), four ET samples clustering near those five (Fig. 5a, green line), three samples clustering alone (Fig. 5a, gray, blue, yellow lines), two smaller groups of 2 samples (Fig. 5a, brown line) and 3 samples (Fig. 5a, pink line), and the largest grouping of 7 samples showing opposite regulation to the control-like ETs (Fig. 5a, purple line). A Spear-man’s correlation matrix, which is calculated coefficients (r values) between each ET sample, for the ssGSEA GO pathways, shows the five “control-like” ETs do not correlate with the others (Fig. 5b, red line) and these 8 groupings of ET have some degree of heterogeneity within the clusters (Fig. 5b). Pathways that significantly differ among ETs (50 pathways; Supplemental Table 4) only partially overlap (7 pathways) with those that distinguished ETs from controls (98 pathways; Supplemental Table 3), and include potassium ion transport, collagen fibril organization, regulation of toll-like receptor signaling pathway, regulation of interleukin 2 (IL-2) production, response to zinc ion, negative regulation of catecholamine secretion, and striatum development. These findings indicate that disease pathways potentially involved in the pathogenesis of ET differ from the pathways characterizing the heterogeneity of ET. We next analyzed these pathways in combination with principal components 1–5 from the normalized transcript reads PCA, expression levels from the differential gene expression analysis (FDR&lt;0.05), and clinical information (total tremor score and age of onset; Supplemental Table 1) for ETs only. Figure 5c is colorized to show the placement of each sample in the PCA corresponding to the hierarchical cluster analysis sub-groupings and Spearman correlation, demonstrating high degrees of heterogeneity among the ET samples. When these groupings are overlayed on the Spearman correlation matrix (Fig. 5b), it is clear there are five ETs that look distinctively different than all other ETs (Fig. 5c red circles; Fig. 5a/b red line) and marked heterogeneity among the remaining 19 samples.

Low fold changes and low RNA quantity from LCM meant that validation studies of this dataset are extremely challenging. As an alternative, we performed a cross-comparison analysis of our whole cerebellar cortex sequencing and PC enriched LCM sequencing (LCM-seq). We previously discussed that there are 4 overlapping genes from both sequencing analyses: SPTBN5, SFSR11, FUT9, and RyR1. When comparing the ssGSEA pathway analyses from both studies, only one overlapping pathway was found: endoplasmic reticulum organization (Supplemental Table 5/blue banner). We next examined the 36 statistically significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the LCM-seq and assessed which genes were present in the GO pathway sets from both whole cerebellar cortex sequencing and LCM-seq. We identified 25 pathways from the whole cortex sequencing ssGSEA pathway analysis that contained at least one of the 36 DEGs (Supplemental table 5/green banner). When examining the ssGSEA pathways comparing ET to controls, we identified 4 pathways that contained at least one of the 36 DEGs: hexose metabolic process, zymogen activation, RNA splicing via transesterification reactions, and response to oxidative stress (Supplemental Table 5/yellow banner). When examining the ssGSEA pathways comparing ET to ET, we found one pathway that contains at least one of the 36 DEGs: cellular response to amino acid stimulus (Supplemental Table 5/pink banner).

Discussion

We recently completed the largest postmortem cerebellar cortex RNA-sequencing [33] and now report the first ever laser capture enriched PC RNA-sequencing in postmortem ET versus controls. From these successive studies, we present detailed data on gene expression changes in the ET brain and, more specifically, in the brain region and cell population of greatest interest in this disease, the PC. From a hypothesis generation vantage point, these data will be of value in directly guiding targeted studies to explore selected pathways. In both studies, we have observed something similar — heterogeneity. Indeed, there is a broad and ever-growing literature demonstrating the diversity of clinical findings in ET, a richness of genetic etiologies as well as some heterogeneity of postmortem findings [17, 49–51]. The recent introduction of terminology to encapsulate aspects of this diversity further serves to highlight its presence [52]: ET is likely not one entity [53].

Ours is a transcriptome study. How do our results compare to those from prior genetic studies? Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have described LINGO1 [54, 55], STK32B [7], SLC1A2 [56] (also known as EAAT2 [57]), CTNNA3 [7], and PPARGC1A [58] variants related with ET. Exome/whole genome analyses in ET families have identified mutations in genes FUS [59, 60], TENM4 [61], SORT1 [62], HTRA2 [63], NOTCH2NLC [64], SCN11A [65], KCNS2 [4], NOS3 [4], USP46 [4], CACNA1G [3], HAPLN4 [4], MMP10 [6], GPR151 [6], SLIT3 [3], and CCDC183 [6, 51]. However, neither of these approaches has identified genes with broad applicability to ET, being predominantly found only in distinct populations or singular to small number of families [51], and none of these genes were differentially expressed in our cerebellar cortex or PC transcriptome studies. Liao et al. also performed a multi-omics ET case-control RNA-sequencing analysis in both cerebellar cortex and dentate nucleus, reporting differential expression of six genes in cerebellar cortex involved in functioning of kinase (PRKG1), mitosis (SAC3D1), apoptosis (TRAPPC11), protein trafficking (NELL2), and calcium channel (CACNA1A) [66]. Interestingly, within our two analyses of the cerebellar cortex, we find similar pathway dysregulations in kinase function, protein trafficking, and calcium channel function, but through alternative gene identifiers, indicating the possibility of multiple genetic or environmental avenues for dysregulation resulting in similar biological and cellular dysfunctions. Again, our data point to the presence of heterogeneity.

This data adds value in terms of systematically describing and cataloguing a wealth of transcriptomic changes in the ET brain. Furthermore, we were able to collapse the changes into larger biological categories, presented in Fig. 3 and Supplemental Tables 3 and 4, and we were able to tie our PC enriched sequencing to our cerebellar cortex sequencing in Supplemental Table 5. Based on the number of genes in each category and their a priori biological interest, we selectively highlight three areas for additional concentrated discussion.

RNA Processing/Splicing

RNA is implicated in numerous processes that maintain cellular homeostasis [67]. Alternative splicing of mRNA is a tightly regulated process, as mis-splice events can perturb protein function [68]. In neurodegenerative disorders, alterations in RNA metabolism and RNA binding proteins can modulate several processes including transcription, splicing, editing, exporting, stability, translation, and localization [68]. Whole exome sequencing of familial ET identified alterations in FUS (a DNA and RNA binding protein), which is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and the export of fully processed mRNA [51]. FUS alterations included missense mutations and aberrant alternative splicing events [59] and differed from those in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis but were found to be unique to those ET families in subsequent studies [60, 69, 70]. In addition, FUS knockout mice do not develop ET-like tremor [71]. The spliceosome functions as a generator of mature mRNA from pre-mRNA by the removal of introns [67]. Within our 36 differentially expressed genes from the DEseq2 analysis, 7/36 regulate some form of RNA processing/splicing, including 4 that are integral for the spliceosome complex (RBM25, PRPF38B, PNN, and SREK1) and 3 that function in RNA splicing and mRNA processing (CLASRP, CCAR1, and SRSF11). While studies on their encoding proteins are limited in cerebellum, available data suggests broad cerebellar expression for all these proteins except for possibly localized PC expression of PRPF38B [72]. SRSF11 was also noted in our whole cerebellar lysate sequencing [33], although the function of this protein is inferred based on sequence homologies and cellular localization. Large-scale attempts at classifying RNA splice sites within ET have been divergent, as one transcriptome study found no unique events [66] and most other research has focused on FUS, which is inconsistent from patient to patient [51, 60].

Synapse Organization/Ion Transport

Several studies in ET have examined ion channels and their role in PC excitability in the cerebellum as a potential source of tremor. T-type calcium channel CACNA1G (Cav3.1) has been identified in a GWAS study of ET families [29] and CACNA1A in a multi-omics transcriptome study in ET cerebellar cortex [66]. Notably, CACNA1G was one of the top 20 expressed genes in our PC enriched sequencing (Supplemental Table 2), indicating its localization and biological importance in PCs. Both this current transcriptome study in PCs and our prior RNA-sequencing in cerebellar cortex identified calcium signaling as a dysregulated pathway of interest in ET, as well as dysregulation of the gene encoding ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) [33]. RyR1 protein is a key ER-calcium-release-channel that is highly expressed in PCs within the cerebellum, and PCs rely heavily on ER calcium channels for their intrinsic pacemaking activity [73–75]. Our analysis of ssGSEA pathways also identified other modulating ions, such as potassium, when comparing ET to controls (Supplemental table 3) and in investigation of ET heterogeneity, including potassium ion transport and delayed rectifier potassium channel (Supplemental table 4). Notably, mutations in KCNS2, a potassium channel α-subunit that modulates activity of voltage gated potassium channels, was identified in an exome study of ET families [4]. In addition, our PC RNA-sequencing identified numerous genes correlating with PC2 that regulate pre- and postsynaptic density, the synaptic membrane, and the dendritic spine (Fig. 3, Table 3). As the PC is the only efferent neuron of the cerebellar cortex, alterations in synapse organization or ion transport could result in aberrant PC firing and/or neuronal excitability.

Oxidative Stress and Inflammation

Oxidative stress has been implicated as a factor mediating initiation and progression of many neurodegenerative diseases and is a pathway present in both of our RNA-sequencing studies. The human brain is a high energy consumer (~20% of the O2 in bodily circulation), and large neurons in particular, such as PCs, require high amounts oxygen, making them vulnerable to redox reactions [76]. While free radicals, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), are common and provide built-in antioxidant systems, imbalanced production as a byproduct of diet, environment, or genetics has shown direct linkage to neurodegenerative diseases [77]. The presence of increased blood levels of heavy metals such as lead and the tremorgenic β-carboline alkaloid harmane in blood of ET patients suggest that environmental exposures play a role in the pathogenesis of ET [78–80], and these compounds may exert their neurotoxicity through increased generation of ROS and other free radicals [81, 82]. Glutathione production is a major mechanism to combat excessive free radical generation and is incredibly important in brain disorders [83, 84]. Interestingly, GSS (glutathione synthetase) was found to have reduced expression in PCs from ET compared to controls, potentially indicating defective production of glutathione antioxidant within the ET cerebellum. Complementary to oxidative stress is neuroinflammation, a known factor in the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration [85]. The conversation around the classification of ET has shifted toward neurodegeneration, with significant evidence indicating that ET is the most common form of cerebellar degeneration [86]. When comparing ssGSEA pathways between controls and ET (Supplemental table 3), we see increased gene expression in pathways responsible for the regulation and biosynthesis of cytokines (IL-2 and IL-6) in ETs compared to controls. When comparing ET patients to one another (Supplemental table 4), expression levels of regulatory pathways for pro-inflammatory cytokines are mixed, with enrichment for increased cytokine generation predominantly in the ETs that differ most strongly from controls (i.e., enriched in PC2). This is intriguing, as an analysis of serum inflammatory markers in ET patients showed significantly higher IL-8 and IL-10 levels compared to controls, with higher IL-8 levels correlating with more severe tremor, and serum IL-6 levels higher in ET patients with cognitive impairment [87]. Altogether, it is plausible that oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines play a significant role in the pathogenesis of ET.

Overall, our transcriptome analysis has allowed us to catalogue and present detailed data on expression changes in a group of ET patients compared to controls. One limitation in the current study is the inability to assess for splice variants in the sequenced data, which saw differential expression levels in some RNA splicing and spliceosome genes. The combination of low-input, high amplification, and sequencing read lengths precluded this type of analysis. A second limitation is the low fold change differences seen between ET and control when performing DEseq2 differential gene expression analysis. Low log2fold changes (&lt;2) make validation studies with qPCR, Western blot, and other low sensitivity assays challenging. This discovery dataset provides an open door for further studies to build upon, as functional validation of mRNA transcripts to protein cannot be evaluated here. Even with these limitations, our study provides the first look at LCM PC enriched sequencing from postmortem ET and control cerebellum. It should also be noted that this sequencing was enriched with PC soma, excluding axons and dendrites where key mRNAs are likely to be transported and synthesized. Overall, the data did not identify a single overarching finding but rather identified several findings that correlate and contrast with other ET groups. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity across ET cases along with the multiple pathways that could be involved in disease pathogenesis still supports the evolving notion that ET is not a single entity. As such, it is likely that ET is a family of diseases [50, 88] that have multiple mechanisms of action with a similar outcome: negative effects on the PC and its axonal/dendrite/soma components resulting in aberrant firing and resulting tremor.
