Although women are at higher risk for Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this issue of Cell, Yan et al. show that aberrantly high activity of X-linked USP11 deubiquitinase in women impairs clearance of tau, the principal component of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease.


pmcAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Approximately 413 million individuals are on the AD continuum globally, of which 30 million have AD dementia (Gustavsson et al., 2022). It has long been known that women are disproportionally affected by AD, as well as other tauopathies, defined as diseases linked to aberrant function of the microtubule-associated protein known as tau. For example, in the US alone approximately two-thirds of AD patients are women. This is generally accepted to be due to a complex interplay of sex-specific genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors, and it has been established that hormones or longer lifespan of women are not solely responsible. Thus, the molecular basis of these vulnerabilities has remained obscure. In this issue of Cell, the neuropathology laboratories of David Kang and Alexa Woo report their discovery of a novel cellular pathway between tau protein and the X-linked deubiquitinase known as USP11, which renders women more likely to develop tau pathology (Yan et al., 2022).

Tau normally regulates microtubule stability, axon outgrowth, and neuronal transport (Limorenko and Lashuel, 2022). In AD, tau aberrantly clumps into toxic neurofibrillary tangles inside neurons. In addition, tau burden in female AD patients is significantly higher than male counterparts (Oveisgharan et al., 2018), and positron emission tomography imaging has revealed elevated tau accumulation in clinically normal women compared to men (Buckley et al., 2019). These factors indicate that women are at higher risk for AD and other tauopathies. Tau exists as six isoforms in neurons and undergoes several post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, sulfhydration, and glycosylation, among others, that modulate disease progression (Chang et al., 2021; Wesseling et al., 2020; Giovinazzo et al., 2021). Several of these post-translational modifications occur early and affect the microtubule binding properties of tau in ways that accelerate formation of pathological aggregates. For instance, acetylation of tau on lysine residues decreases microtubule binding and causes tau aggregation and mislocalization within neurons, leading to axonal degeneration (Shin et al., 2021). On the other hand, ubiquitination of tau on lysines is one of the last modifications to occur and acts as a signal for its proteasome-mediated degradation and clearance.

The magnitude of tau ubiquitination, and therefore tau degradation, is largely regulated by deubiquitinase (DUB) enzymes that enzymatically remove ubiquitin groups. One of these deubiquitinases, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase/ubiquitin specific protease 11 (USP11), happens to be encoded on the X chromosome and is especially enriched in the brain. Utilizing individual small interfering RNA (siRNA) for each of 22 deubiquitinases expressed in the brain, Yan et al. demonstrated that knocking down USP11 reduced tau levels in HeLa cells stably expressing wild-type tau. Additionally, overexpression of wild-type USP11, but not of a catalytically inactive variant (USP11C318S), markedly increased intra-cellular accumulation of insoluble, aggregated tau in HEK293 cells harboring the aggregation-prone mutant tauP301L. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, the authors identified 21 lysines on tau as targets of USP11. As both acetylation and ubiquitination occur on lysine residues and are mutually exclusive, Yan and colleagues tested the deubiquitinase activity of USP11 on tau mutants that mimic acetylation. In line with their hypothesis, USP11 did not decrease solubility or increase aggregation of acetylation mimics, implying that tau acetylation inhibits clearance of aggregated tau. They also determined that ubiquitination on lysine 281 was the most sensitive to USP11 activity.

As reported earlier by the Pieper and Gan laboratories (also co-authors on this study), pathological acetylation of tau at lysines 274 and 281 by the CREB-binding protein (CBP/p300) mediates neurode-generation after traumatic brain injury, which is the third greatest risk factor for AD, after genetics and aging (Shin et al., 2021). Here, Yan et al. show that knocking down USP11 prevents this pathological acetylation by increasing ubiquitination, which promotes tau clearance and physically prevents acerylation at the same site. Interestingly, USP11 knockdown also decreases phosphorylation of tau at serine 262, another pathological modification of tau in disease.

Importantly, Yan et al. validated their findings in mouse models of AD and postmortem human AD brain tissue, which showed increased levels of USP11 in females, confirming previous reports that USP11 evades complete X-inactivation and displays sexual dimorphism (Li et al., 2016). To definitively prove that elevated expression of USP11 is deleterious, and to test whether its depletion would be neuroprotective, the authors next crossed usp11 knockout mice with tauP301S (PS19) mice. Remarkably, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration-linked impairments in synaptic plasticity and cognition normally observed in PS19 mice were all significantly ameliorated when USP11 was depleted in female mice. Additionally, the increased acetylation of tau normally observed in AD was diminished, underscoring a central role for USP11 in modulation of tau pathology in female AD mice. In male mice, genetic deletion of USP11 resulted in compensatory upregulation of 17 of the characterized 21 ubiquitin-specific protease. In stark contrast, however, none of these were upregulated in females. These gene regulatory differences between the two sexes could also further contribute to the increased resilience of males to pathological tauopathy.

In summary, the authors identify a tau-linked homeostatic pathway that, when disrupted in females, leads to tauopathy (Figure 1). This exciting discovery raises new questions for future research and potential treatment for currently untreatable neurodegenerative conditions, including AD. Most notably, specific strategies to reduce USP11 expression or activity could provide a new neuroprotective therapy for AD or other forms of tauopathy in women. In the future, research could delve deeper into the metabolic-genetic basis of X-linked dimorphisms. In addition, as regulation of ubiquitin E3 ligases play important roles in proteostasis, studying additional regulators of these cellular events, such as those involving other post-translational modifications such as sulfhydration in AD and their interplay with other tau modifications, may yield additional insights (Giovinazzo et al., 2021). Lastly, analyzing the mechanisms underlying resilience conferred by the Y chromosome could also provide complementary insights.

Figure 1. Elevated expression of USP11 increases risk for Alzheimer’s disease in women

(A) Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase/ubiquitin specific protease 11 (USP11) is an X chromosome-linked deubiquitinase that removes ubiquitin moieties from proteins such as the microtubule-associated protein tau and targets them for degradation to maintain proteostasis.

(B) In females, incomplete X inactivation causes increased expression of USP11, which deubiquitnates tau. The lysine residues on tau targeted by ubiquitination now become available for acetylation of tau. Impaired ubiquitination and excess acetylation of tau decreases its proteosomal degradation, causes its aggregation, and leads to increased tauopathy and vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease.
