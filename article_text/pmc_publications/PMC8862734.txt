Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis-Frontotemporal Dementia (ALS-FTD) may present typical behavioral variant FTD symptoms. This study aims to determine whether profile and severity of cognitive-behavioral symptoms in ALS/ALS-FTD are predicted by regional cortical atrophy. The hypothesis is that executive dysfunction can be predicted by dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (dlPFC) atrophy, apathy by dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) and anterior cingulate cortical (ACC) atrophy, disinhibition by orbitofrontal cortical (OFC) atrophy. 3.0 Tesla MRI scans were acquired from 22 people with ALS or ALS-FTD. Quantitative cortical thickness analysis was performed with FreeSurfer. A priori-defined regions of interest (ROI) were used to measure cortical thickness in each participant and calculate magnitude of atrophy in comparison to 115 healthy controls. Spearman correlations were used to evaluate associations between frontal ROI cortical thickness and cognitive-behavioral symptoms, measured by Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. ALS-FTD participants exhibited variable degrees of apathy (NPI-Q/apathy: 1.6 ± 1.2), disinhibition (NPI-Q/disinhibition: 1.2 ± 1.2), executive dysfunction (CDR/judgment-problem solving: 1.7 ± 0.8). Within the ALS-FTD group, executive dysfunction correlated with dlPFC atrophy (ρ:−0.65;p &lt; 0.05); similar trends were seen for apathy with ACC (ρ:−0.53;p &lt; 0.10) and dmPFC (ρ:−0.47;p &lt; 0.10) atrophy, for disinhibition with OFC atrophy (ρ:−0.51;p &lt; 0.10). Compared to people with ALS, those with ALS-FTD showed more diffuse atrophy involving precentral gyrus, prefrontal, temporal regions. Profile and severity of cognitive-behavioral symptoms in ALS-FTD are predicted by regional prefrontal atrophy. These findings are consistent with established brain-behavior models and support the role of quantitative MRI in diagnosis, management, counseling, monitoring and prognostication for a neurodegenerative disorder with diverse phenotypes.

pmcIntroduction

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are progressive neurodegenerative conditions representing the extremes of a heterogeneous clinico-pathological continuum (Neumann et al. 2006). A variable combination of motor, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms may manifest during the course of these conditions, with some patients meeting diagnostic criteria for both disorders (ALS-FTD) (Strong et al. 2009; Elamin et al. 2017). In people with ALS and cognitive-behavioral symptoms, three of the most commonly reported symptoms are core features of behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) (Rascovsky et al. 2011): apathy, executive dysfunction, and disinhibition (Chio et al. 2010; Mioshi et al. 2013; Tsujimoto et al. 2011), each of which impact ALS prognosis (Hu et al. 2013; Elamin et al. 2011) and caregiver burden (Chio et al. 2010). More recently, considerable deficits in social cognition have also been highlighted in ALS (Burke et al. 2016a, b; Beeldman et al. 2016).

Cortical atrophy studies in ALS-FTD have largely focused on group comparisons with controls or ALS or FTD (Mioshi et al. 2013; Lillo et al. 2012; Leslie et al. 2014; Chang et al. 2005; Whitwell et al. 2006; Schuster et al. 2014; Rajagopalan and Pioro 2014; Omer et al. 2017). Few studies have investigated cortical atrophy correlates of specific cognitive-behavioral symptoms in ALS-FTD, typically using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and focusing on language deficits. In one study, semantic impairment correlated with atrophy in anterior temporal cortex (Leslie et al. 2014); in the other, phonemic fluency impairment correlated with atrophy in inferior frontal cortex (Chang et al. 2005). Apathy has been previously linked to nucleus accumbens atrophy in a prospective neuroimaging study of ALS (Machts et al. 2015) and phenotype-specific subcortical gray matter degeneration has also been described in ALS-FTD (Bede et al. 2018a). The cortical correlates of apathy, executive dysfunction, and disinhibition, however, remain poorly characterized in ALS-FTD.

This study was undertaken to refine the understanding of the neural basis of the heterogeneity of ALS-FTD symptoms and test whether cortical atrophy in specific frontal regions predicts the presence and severity of bvFTD-like manifestations in ALS-FTD. Based on functional and anatomical imaging studies in bvFTD (Seeley et al. 2009; Zamboni et al. 2008; Rosen et al. 2005) and focal lesion studies (Stuss and Alexander 2007), we hypothesized that bvFTD-like symptoms in ALS-FTD would be predicted by cortical atrophy in dorsomedial prefrontal and/or anterior cingulate cortices (apathy); dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (executive dysfunction); or orbitofrontal cortex (disinhibition).

Methods

Participants

The study sample included 22 participants along the ALS/ALS-FTD spectrum: 12 diagnosed with clinically “probable” or “definite” ALS according to modified El Escorial criteria (Brooks et al. 2000), and 10 with a combined diagnosis of ALS and FTD (Strong et al. 2009) along with 115 cognitively intact older adults as controls for the MRI analysis. Volunteers were recruited from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) ALS and FTD Units and the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) Longitudinal Cohort between September 2007 and March 2015. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled consecutively in the study after the diagnosis of ALS or ALS-FTD was established by experienced neuromuscular and/or behavioral neurologists affiliated with the MGH ALS and FTD Units. Additional inclusion criteria included 18–90 years of age, proficiency in English, vital capacity (VC) above 50% of predicted and ability to safely tolerate study procedures including MR imaging without sedation. Participants were also recruited based on the availability of a study partner able to provide an independent evaluation of functioning as well as informed consent if the participant lacked decisional capacity. Exclusion criteria included any contraindication for MRI, additional significant concomitant neurological or psychiatric diagnosis, poorly controlled or severe medical comorbidities, or pregnancy.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and participant consents

All participants provided written informed consent in accordance with guidelines from the Partners Human Research Committee at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Clinical assessment

All participants underwent a comprehensive evaluation including motor assessments and measures of cognitive-behavioral symptoms. This evaluation included independent structured interviews with the participants and informants, functional measures, clinical questionnaires, detailed neurological examination, quantitative strength and respiratory function assessment, and comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. ALS-specific measures included the ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R) (Cedarbaum et al. 1999) and percent of predicted VC.

The cognitive and behavioral assessment included the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (Morris 1997), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Folstein et al. 1975), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) (Cummings et al. 1994). For the purposes of the present analysis, in order to overcome the possible impact of motor deficits on neuropsychological testing, we used the NPI-Q apathy and disinhibition scores as well as CDR judgment and problem solving ratings to test the hypotheses stated above. The neuropsychological evaluation was conducted as per the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) protocol (Weintraub et al. 2009).

The controls also underwent a comprehensive structured clinical and neuropsychological evaluation and were determined to be cognitively intact and free of neurological or psychiatric illness.

MRI morphometric data acquisition and analysis

MRI data were acquired using a Siemens TIM Trio 3.0 Tesla scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlingan, Germany). Procedures for data collection included head movement restriction using expandable foam cushions and automated scout and shimming procedures. One 3D MPRAGE sequence was acquired (TR/TI/TE 2300/900/2.98 msec, FOV 256, FA 7°, 192 sagittal 1 mm thick slices, matrix: 240 × 256). A FLAIR sequence was visually inspected to rule out nondegenerative pathologies.

The MRI data analysis methods employed in this study were previously described in detail, including cortical thickness processing and spherical registration to align subjects’ cortical surfaces (Bakkour et al. 2009) (the FreeSurfer software is freely available at http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). First, a hypothesis-driven analysis was performed. Four ROIs were used to generate regional thickness measures for each subject—dorsomedial prefrontal (the mid portion of the medial superior frontal gyrus; dmPFC) and anterior cingulate (the caudal ACC) cortices, dorsolateral prefrontal (specifically, the caudal middle frontal gyrus) and orbitofrontal cortex (Desikan et al. 2006). We also measured the precentral gyrus to test the hypothesis that all patients with ALS or ALS-FTD would show thinner cortex in this region than controls. Raw values (in mm) were used in statistical analyses below. ROIs were derived from the Desikan-Killiany atlas with the only exception of the dmPFC, which was not included in the atlas cortical parcellation map. Boundaries for the dmPFC were obtained from previous clinico-anatomical relationship analyses.

In addition, an exploratory analysis was conducted to ascertain patterns of cortical thickness across the entire cortical mantle comparing each disease group with controls and the ALS-FTD group with the ALS group, using a threshold of p &lt; 0.01.

Because brain-behavior relationships analyses were strongly hypothesis-driven and predicted in a single direction, they were investigated using one-tailed Spearman correlation tests. ANOVA and pairwise non-parametric tests were performed to compare cortical thickness across the study groups. Non-parametric pairwise analysis and χ2–2 sided Fisher’s exact methods were applied for baseline characteristics and demographic comparisons across disease groups. Finally, discriminant function analysis (using Wilks’ lambda) was performed to determine how well the anatomic measures would discriminate between participants with or without executive dysfunction, the strongest brain-behavior relationship in our study. These statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and results were considered significant if p &lt; 0.05 and trends if p &lt; 0.1.

Results

Clinical characteristics

In participants with ALS-FTD the first symptoms were cognitive-behavioral in 70% and motor in 30%. In addition, most of the people with ALS-FTD developed onset of motor symptoms in the bulbar region (60%). The ALS-FTD group showed a variable degree of apathy (NPI-Q/apathy: 1.6 ± 1.2), disinhibition (NPI-Q/disinhibition: 1.2 ± 1.2), and executive dysfunction (CDR/judgment-problem solving: 1.7 ± 0.8). All ALS-FTD volunteers demonstrated global cognitive impairment (CDR ≥ 0.5; MMSE 20.7 ± 4.3). In contrast, by definition, participants with ALS included in this analysis did not exhibit any cognitive or behavioral symptoms. Additional details regarding demographics and clinical characteristics of the study populations are summarized in Table 1.

Brain-behavior hypothesis testing

In the ALS-FTD participant group, executive dysfunction correlated with right dlPFC atrophy (ρ:−0.65;p &lt; 0.05). Similar trends were observed for apathy with right cACC (ρ:−0.53;p &lt; 0.10;) and left dmPFC (ρ:−0.47;p &lt; 0.10) atrophy as well as for disinhibition with right (ρ:−0.51;p &lt; 0.10) and left (ρ:−0.48; p &lt; 0.10) OFC atrophy (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). In addition, several relationships were noted as trends that were not predicted, including apathy with left OFC atrophy (ρ:−0.53;p &lt; 0.10) as well as disinhibition (ρ:−0.48;p &lt; 0.10) and executive function (ρ:−0.51;p &lt; 0.10) with right cACC atrophy.

Group comparisons of mean cortical thickness within these ROIs were also performed. These revealed differences in bilateral dmPFC (right: p = 0.001; left: p &lt; 0.001), bilateral dlPFC (p &lt; 0.001), bilateral OFC (right: p = 0.007; left: p &lt; 0.001) and bilateral precentral gyri (p &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 2). These results remained significant at the Bonferroni-adjusted p &lt; 0.008 level. There was no statistically significant difference in bilateral cACC thickness (right: p = 0.462; left: p = 0.128) (Fig. 2). Post-hoc pair-wise non-parametric analysis revealed that all differences were driven by the ALS-FTD group, with intact thickness in the ALS group in all the frontal regions, the only exception being the right precentral gyrus (Fig. 2). The ALS group did not show either cognitive/behavioral symptoms or corresponding atrophy of the frontal cortex (Table 1 and Fig. 3).

Exploratory comparisons of thickness across the entire cortical mantle between the three groups highlighted the characteristic pattern of atrophy in ALS-FTD and the relative preservation of cortical anatomy in ALS (Fig. 3). Compared to controls, the ALS-FTD group showed prominent atrophy in lateral and medial prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices as well as in the anterior cingulate in a pattern similar to that seen in bvFTD. In addition, cortical atrophy extended caudally to include the precentral gyrus (Fig. 3a). The comparison of the ALS group to controls showed essentially no atrophy, with very small effects in the right precentral gyrus and the midcingulate cortex (Fig. 3b). The comparison between the ALS-FTD and ALS groups showed an atrophy pattern similar to that of ALS-FTD compared to controls (Fig. 3c).

Diagnostic classification

Using the strongest anatomic-behavioral relationship identified in this study — dlPFC and executive dysfunction — an exploratory assessment of the ability of the anatomic ROIs to discriminate individual subjects with executive dysfunction from those without executive dysfunction was performed. This analysis indicated that atrophy in dlPFC was able to classify participants with executive dysfunction with 95.5% accuracy (100% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity, χ2 = 25.9, p &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 1). For comparison, the mean cortical thickness across the whole cortical mantle was also examined and performed with 86.4% accuracy (90% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity, χ2 = 14.6, p &lt; 0.001). A cutoff of 2.26 mm in the dlPFC, which corresponded to one standard deviation below the mean of controls, was able to discriminate all but one participant with executive dysfunction from those without executive dysfunction.

Discussion and conclusions

It is well established that people with ALS-FTD have prominent frontotemporal cortical atrophy compared to those with ALS (Omer et al. 2017). However, there is considerable variability in both cognitive-behavioral symptoms and cortical atrophy between individual ALS-FTD patients. Here that variability was investigated, testing the hypothesis that atrophy in specific prefrontal cortical regions is associated with specific clinical symptoms. Indeed, evidence was found for specific brain-behavior relationships in ALS-FTD consistent with previous studies of people with focal brain lesions (Stuss and Alexander 2007). These findings do not address the important question of why certain prefrontal regions are more affected than others in individuals diagnosed with ALS-FTD, but do show that the types and severity of cognitive or behavioral symptoms in ALS-FTD are predictable based on the localization and magnitude of neurodegeneration within the prefrontal cortex as measured by cortical atrophy.

Numerous MRI investigations have reported cortical atrophy in ALS (Agosta et al. 2012; Bede et al. 2018b). Several studies have performed group comparisons of cortical atrophy in people with ALS with or without cognitive or behavioral symptoms, reporting the presence of greater prefrontal or anterior temporal atrophy in ALS associated with cognitive or behavioral symptoms or FTD (Mioshi et al. 2013; Lillo et al. 2012; Leslie et al. 2014; Chang et al. 2005; Whitwell et al. 2006; Schuster et al. 2014; Rajagopalan and Pioro 2014). Although the heterogeneity of cognitive or behavioral symptoms in ALS is substantial, only a few studies have investigated relationships between regional cortical atrophy and the types and severity of cognitive-behavioral symptoms in ALS or ALS-FTD. The cortical (Tsujimoto et al. 2011) and subcortical (Machts et al. 2015) correlates of apathy have been previously investigated and memory deficits have been linked to mesial temporal lobe degeneration (Christidi et al. 2019). Cognitive-behavioral symptoms are clinically relevant (Christidi et al. 2018) as they can significantly impact prognosis (Hu et al. 2013; Elamin et al. 2011) and caregiver burden (Chio et al. 2010).

Executive dysfunction is one of the most frequent cognitive changes in ALS, even when there is no concomitant dementia (Pettit et al. 2013), and it is associated with a poorer prognosis in ALS (Elamin et al. 2011; Burke et al. 2017). One group reported on the relationship of cortical atrophy to impairment in phonemic fluency, which is considered a measure of executive function by some investigators and separated into a distinct category by others (Beeldman et al. 2016). In a whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analysis of people diagnosed with ALS and ALS-FTD, impairment in phonemic fluency correlated with atrophy in inferior frontal cortex, although it is not clear if this relationship was present in the ALS-FTD group alone (Chang et al. 2005). Here the CDR Judgment and Problem Solving box score, a measure of executive dysfunction, was used and—as hypothesized—it was found that more prominent impairment on this measure was predicted by cortical atrophy in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The dlPFC is thought to be involved in working memory, task setting, and monitoring (Stuss and Alexander 2007), which are core processes necessary for the effective organization and execution of complex activities of daily living. Further support for the importance of the dlPFC in executive dysfunction in ALS comes from imaging studies of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) (Abrahams et al. 1996), MR spectroscopy (Quinn et al. 2012), white matter tract integrity (Pettit et al. 2013; Kasper et al. 2014; Sarro et al. 2011; Schuster et al. 2016a), as well as a pathological study demonstrating that microglial activation and TDP-43 pathology in the middle frontal gyrus correlated with executive impairment (Brettschneider et al. 2012).

Apathy is one of the most common behavioral symptoms in ALS (Chio et al. 2010; Raaphorst et al. 2012a). In 21 nondemented patients with ALS, a whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analysis identified an association between the severity of apathy (as measured by the Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale) and reduced gray matter volume in the bilateral OFC, right dlPFC and bilateral frontal pole (Tsujimoto et al. 2011). Here the NPI-Q Apathy score was utilized and trend-level relationships with cortical atrophy in the cACC and dmPFC were found. The ACC is thought to be involved in initiation, motivation, and response monitoring of goal-directed behaviors while also modulating autonomic activity and emotional responses, ultimately integrating cognitive and affective functions in the service of goal-directed action. The dmPFC also contributes to initiating and sustaining responses (Stuss and Alexander 2007) including the motivational and perspective-taking components of social cognition. Additional support for the key role of the ACC and dmPFC in apathy comes from diffusion tensor imaging in people with ALS, demonstrating relationships between apathy and reduced white matter integrity in the medial prefrontal region (Tsujimoto et al. 2011) and anterior cingulum bundle (Woolley et al. 2011). Furthermore, similar observations have been reported in studies of patients with FTD (Zamboni et al. 2008; Rosen et al. 2005; Massimo et al. 2009).

Disinhibition is another behavioral symptom shared between ALS (Tsujimoto et al. 2011; Raaphorst et al. 2012a) and FTD (Rascovsky et al. 2011). To our knowledge, there have been no prior studies of gray matter atrophy correlates of disinhibition in patients with ALS. A trend-level association between disinhibition and OFC atrophy was found. The OFC plays a central role in emotional processing, value-based learning and decision-making, and inhibitory control. Other concordant observations of the relationship of OFC atrophy to disinhibition have been reported from studies of FTD (Zamboni et al. 2008; Rosen et al. 2005).

In addition, we observed possible brain-behavior relationships that were not predicted, such as correlation of apathy with OFC atrophy as well as disinhibition and executive dysfunction with ACC atrophy. An association between apathy and OFC atrophy has been previously reported in both ALS (Tsujimoto et al. 2011) and FTD (Massimo et al. 2009), while disinhibition has been associated with ACC atrophy in FTD (Rosen et al. 2005). The regional hypotheses in the present study are simplifications of more complex network-based relationships, such as with the salience network, which may fractionate into a dorsal frontoparietal-dorsal ACC network subserving cognitive components of complex attention and executive function and a ventral insular-pregenual ACC-OFC network subserving affective components of arousal and emotional valence (Touroutoglou et al. 2012).

The brain-behavior relationships involving cACC and dlPFC were right lateralized. Some prior studies have suggested right lateralization for neuropsychiatric symptoms in FTD (Rosen et al. 2005). We believe our findings are more likely related to the right-lateralized nature of the frontoparietal-cingulate executive control network (Smith et al. 2009), rather than to lateralization of neurodegeneration since we did not see strong lateralization of atrophy. The topographic pattern of cortical atrophy instead reveals the typical bilateral fronto-temporal cortical atrophy seen by others in ALS-FTD (Lillo et al. 2012) with minimal cortical atrophy in ALS (Mioshi et al. 2013; Rajagopalan and Pioro 2014).

Gray matter measures can be meaningful interpreted at the individual subject level in ALS (Schuster et al. 2016b) and classification algorithms have been widely utilized (Welsh et al. 2013; Bede et al. 2017; Grollemund et al. 2019) in proposed diagnostic (Querin et al. 2018; Blasco et al. 2018) and prognostic (Schuster et al. 2017; Devos et al. 2019) applications. Therefore, our findings from the discriminant function analyses raise the possibility that — at the time of diagnosis — people with ALS could be screened using these measures to identify those likely to exhibit cognitive or behavioral symptoms, which can adversely affect prognosis (Hu et al. 2013; Elamin et al. 2011) and caregiver burden (Chio et al. 2010). Specifically, this analysis shows that executive dysfunction can be predicted at the individual subject level when people with ALS have dorsolateral prefrontal cortical atrophy. Executive dysfunction is not only a frequent cognitive symptom in ALS but it is also associated with worse prognosis, and has important implications for everyday life and medical decision-making. These imaging assessments complement the clinical evaluation, but may also be easier to ascertain than some cognitive measures especially in the setting of motor neuron disease (e.g., verbal fluency may not be possible to assess in individuals with bulbar symptoms) or without a reliable informant (Yunusova et al. 2019).

This study has solely focused on supratentorial cortical alterations and gray matter changes in the cerebellum and brainstem have not been evaluated. While the cerebellum has been implicated in a number of cognitive (Koziol et al. 2012) and behavioral (Strata et al. 2011) processes and cerebellar pathology is a recognized feature of ALS (Prell and Grosskreutz 2013; Bede et al. 2015; Abidi et al. 2020), the pipelines implemented in this study exclude the cerebellum (Fischl 2012). Another limitation of this study is that subcortical gray matter structures were not specifically evaluated despite their role in mediating important behavioral functions (Bonelli and Cummings 2007; O’Callaghan et al. 2013). Nucleus accumbens pathology for example has been consistently detected in ALS (Bede et al. 2016) and linked to apathy (Machts et al. 2015). While white matter degeneration is known to contribute to the heterogeneity of neuropsychological manifestations in ALS (Christidi et al. 2019; Christidi et al. 2020), the white matter correlates of behavioral impairment were not specifically evaluated in this study. A recent DTI study identified FA reductions in the superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi in association with apathy (Femiano et al. 2018). A potential clinical limitation of the study is the reliance on non-ALS specific neuropsychological instruments (Simon and Goldstein 2019) often used in longitudinal cohorts studying aging, such as the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center Longitudinal Cohort. Since the inception of the study, a number of ALS-specific cognitive and behavioral instruments have been developed and validated such as the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS) (Abrahams et al. 2014), the ALS Cognitive Behavioural Screen (ALS-CBS) (Murphy et al. 2016), the Motor Neuron Disease Behavioural Scale (MiND-B) (Mioshi et al. 2014), the Frontal Behavioural Inventory ALS Version (Murphy et al. 2015), The Beaumont Behavioural Inventory (BBI) (Elamin et al. 2017), The ALS Frontotemporal Dementia Questionnaire (ALS-FTD-Q) (Raaphorst et al. 2012b) and the Dimensional Apathy Scale (Radakovic et al. 2016). We also concede that a longitudinal study design may have provided additional insights regarding the chronology of motor, cingulate and orbitofrontal involvement (Chipika et al. 2019). Recent longitudinal studies in ALS suggest that frontotemporal and subcortical pathology is often an early feature of ALS (Agosta et al. 2010; Floeter et al. 2017; Westeneng et al. 2015; Bede and Hardiman 2018; Bede et al. 2019). Finally, the lack of comprehensive genetic evaluation is a shortcoming of our report. GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansions have been associated with marked frontotemporal involvement in ALS (Floeter and Gendron 2018; Floeter et al. 2016; Bede et al. 2013), but extra-motor degeneration is not unique to this genotype (Westeneng et al. 2016).

Despite these limitations, our hypothesis-driven approach enabled the observation that dlPFC atrophy predicts executive dysfunction. The statistical trends for the other hypothesized relationships were present for effects that may be confirmed with larger sample sizes. Therefore, mild atrophy of these brain regions in people with ALS could predict the development of symptoms referable to those brain areas, thus potentially offering the opportunity for clinical monitoring and intervention.

We ultimately hope that our findings can inform larger confirmatory studies supporting the clinical relevance of quantitative MRI-based biomarkers in diagnosis, counseling, monitoring and prognostication within clinical practice as well as in interpreting therapeutic efficacy of clinical trials.

Fig. 1 A priori-defined ROIs in the frontal cortex (a); Associations between the severity of cognitive-behavioral symptoms and regional cortical thickness (mm) (b). *p &lt; 0.10; **p &lt; 0.05; ***p ≤ 0.001. a The caudal anterior cingulate cortex (cACC) depicted in blue and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) in yellow are the putative frontal cortical regions associated with apathy, measured by the NPI-Q Apathy score. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (caudal middle frontal gyrus, cMFG) depicted in green is the putative frontal cortical region associated with executive dysfunction, measured by the CDR-Judgment/Problem solving score. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) depicted in red is the putative frontal cortical region associated with disinhibition, measured by the NPI-Q Disinhibition score. The precentral gyrus depicted in purple represents the primary motor cortex. b Correlations between apathy and right cACC (ρ:−0.53;p &lt; 0.10) and left dmPFC (ρ:−0.47;p &lt; 0.10) thickness; executive function and right dlPFC thickness (ρ:−0.65;p &lt; 0.05); disinhibition and right OFC thickness (ρ:−0.51;p &lt; 0.10). NPI-Q: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire; CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating; ROIs: Regions of Interest

Fig. 2 Group comparisons of mean cortical thickness in each ROI. Mean cortical thickness (mm) within the ROIs (right cACC, left dmPFC, right dlPFC, right OFC, bilateral precentral gyri) in each disease group and controls (*p &lt; 0.10; **p &lt; 0.05; ***p ≤ 0.001). Error bars: ± 1 Standard Error from the mean.

Fig. 3 Maps comparing cortical thickness between groups. ALS-FTD compared to healthy controls (a); ALS compared to healthy controls (b); ALS-FTD compared to ALS (c). The color scale at the bottom represents the p value of the effects using a threshold of p &lt; 0.01.

Fig. 4 Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of dlPFC atrophy for prediction of executive dysfunction at the individual level. Using a cutoff of 2.26 mm for dlPFC cortical thickness (one standard deviation below the mean thickness of this ROI in controls), ALS patients with (blue) or without (green) executive dysfunction can be discriminated with 95.5% accuracy (100% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity) (χ2 = 25.9, p &lt; 0.001).
