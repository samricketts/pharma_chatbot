Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a 299 residue, exchangeable apolipoprotein that has essential roles in cholesterol homeostasis and reverse cholesterol transport. It is a two-domain protein with the C-terminal (CT) domain mediating protein self-association via helix-helix interactions. In humans, the APOE gene is polymorphic with 3 common alleles, ε2 ε3 and ε4, occurring in frequencies of ~5, 77 and 18%, respectively. Heterozygotes expressing apoE3 and apoE4 isoforms, which differ in residue at position 112 in the N-terminal domain (C112 in apoE3 and R112 in apoE4), represent the highest population of ε4 carriers, an allele highly associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The objective of this study is to determine if apoE3 and apoE4 have the ability to hybridize to form a heteromer in lipid-free state. Refolding an equimolar mixture of His-apoE3 and FLAG-apoE4 (or vice versa) followed by pull-down and immunoblotting indicated formation of apoE3/apoE4 heteromers. Förster resonance energy transfer between donor fluorophore on one isoform and acceptor on the other, both located in the respective CT domains, revealed a distance of separation of ~ 40 Å between the donor/acceptor pair. Similarly, a quencher placed on one was able to mediate significant quenching of fluorescence emission on the other, indicative of spatial proximity within collisional distance between the two. ApoE3/apoE4 heteromer association was also noted in lipid-associated state in reconstituted lipoprotein particles. The possibility of heteromerization of apoE3/apoE4 bears implications in the potential mitigating role of apoE3 on the folding and physiological behavior of apoE4 and its role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis.

Graphical Abstract

In humans, the APOE gene is polymorphic. Heterozygotes expressing apoE3 and apoE4 isoforms represent the largest population of ε4 carriers, an allele highly associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, quenching and pull-down assays, we demonstrate that apoE3 and apoE4 can heteromerize via protein-protein interactions. This possibility bears implications for the potential mitigating role of apoE3 on the pathological behavior of apoE4.

Introduction

Apolipoprotein E3 (apoE) is a 34 kDa (299 residues) exchangeable protein that plays a critical role in plasma and brain cholesterol homeostasis [1–3]. It is an anti-atherogenic protein that regulates cholesterol and triglycerides metabolism by virtue of its ability to bind and internalize pro-atherogenic lipoprotein particles via the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLr) family of proteins [3]. It is mainly synthesized in the liver and the brain, and to a lesser extent by the spleen, kidney, macrophages, and endothelial cells [4]. In humans, the apoE protein is coded by a polymorphic gene located on chromosome 19 at a single locus [5] with three common alleles APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 coding for apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 isoforms, respectively. APOE3 is the most prevalent with allelic frequency 55–90 %, followed by APOE4 (5–35%), and APOE2 (1–5 %) (Table 1) [2,6]. APOE ε4 is associated with increased prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and disease onset at an earlier age, with epidemiological studies showing that individuals carrying the ε4 allele are more likely to develop AD and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [10]. The frequency of AD and mean age at clinical onset are 91% and 68 years in ε4 homozygotes, 47% and 76 years in ε4 heterozygotes, and 20% and 84 years in ε4 non-carriers. This indicates that APOE ε4 confers a higher risk of development of AD with an earlier age of onset in a gene dose-dependent manner [11], with ~50% of people with late-onset AD bearing this allele [11–14].

The isoforms apoE2, apoE3 and apoE4 differ in a single amino acid at 112 or 158 [15]: apoE2 bears Cys and apoE4 bears Arg at both positions while apoE3 bears a Cys at position 112 and Arg at position 158. APOE4 is considered the ancestral gene [16], with Arg112 being highly conserved [15], while apoE3 is considered the ‘meat-adaptive’ gene, conferring resistance to risk of disease such as CVD associated with meat consumption [17]. Humans can express six different combinations of these isoforms: apoE2/E2, apoE3/E3, apoE4/E4, apoE2/E3, apoE2/E4 and apoE3/E4, Table 1 [9]. Heterozygous ε3/ε4 carriers form a significantly large ε4 allele-carrying group, an observation that initiated our interest in examining the conformational features of apoE3/apoE4 mixtures.

At the structural level, apoE is a remarkably flexible protein and is comprised of two domains that are linked by a protease-sensitive loop: a 22 kDa N-terminal (NT) domain (residues 1–191) housing binding sites for the LDLr family of proteins and a 10 kDa C-terminal (CT) domain (residues 210–299) bearing high-affinity lipid binding sites [15,18]. In the absence of lipids, the CT domain mediates protein-protein interaction thereby promoting formation of apoE homodimers, tetramers and conferring stability. High resolution structural analysis of the isolated NT domain and intact protein reveals a series of amphipathic α-helices that are folded into a four-helix bundle [19–22]. LDLr binding is believed to occur via a stretch of conserved basic residues predominantly located on helix 4 and its vicinity in the NT domain [15,23]. The presence of Cys at 158 in apoE2 explains its functional behavior in terms of poor LDLr binding ability and association with CVD [24,25]. However, there appears to be no major difference in LDLr binding ability between apoE3 and apoE4. Despite the global structural similarity between the apoE3 and apoE4, the single amino acid difference at position 112 in the NT domain appears to make a significant difference in overall functional and physiological behavior between the two proteins with respect to plasma lipoprotein metabolism. While the two domains appears to be independently folded in the case of apoE3, it is believed that an interaction between the NT and CT domains in apoE4 plays a critical role in determining this isoform’s functional behavior [20,26]. Given that both isoforms bear identical sequence in their CT domain, the objective of this study was to determine if apoE3 and apoE4 can hybridize via their CT ends in the lipid-free state to form a heteromer. A key finding in the current study is that apoE3 and apoE4 undergo protein-protein interaction via their CT domains to form heteromers as noted by a combination of pull-down, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence quenching approaches.

Results

Mixtures of apoE3 and apoE4 form heteromers in lipid-free state

Recombinant His-apoE3 and FLAG-apoE4 were overexpressed in a bacterial expression system and purified by affinity chromatography. The α-helical content of His-apoE3, His-apoE4 and His-apoE3/His-apoE4 mixtures as determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was ~45% for all preparations, comparable to values reported previously [27,28]. The observed variations were within the range typically observed for these preparations. Guanidine-HCl (GdnHCl)-induced unfolding analysis was carried by monitoring changes in the molar ellipticity at 222 nm at varying GdnHCl concentration, Figure 1. As reported earlier for recombinant and native proteins [29,30] His-apoE3 undergoes a biphasic unfolding process, displaying a small plateau between the two phases; the midpoints of denaturation were ~ 0.8 and 2.5 M GdnHCl, for the first and second phase, respectively. His-apoE4 did not display the biphasic denaturation typically observed in apoE3, also as reported [29,30], with the first phase at lower GdnHCl concentrations distinctly absent, and a midpoint of denaturation ~ 1.8 M GdnHCl. The denaturation profile of His-apoE3/His-apoE4 mixture appeared be a hybrid of the two homomers (His-apoE3 alone and His-apoE4 alone).

Three independent experimental strategies were employed to determine heteromer formation of apoE3/apoE4 mixtures in lipid-free state:

(i) Pull-down of heteromeric His-apoE3/FLAG-apoE4

His-apoE3 and FLAG-apoE4 (~ 15 μM each) were mixed and unfolded in the presence of 4 M guanidine HCl (GdnHCl), a chemical denaturant, at 24 °C for 1 h and slowly re-folded by extensive dialysis against TBS, Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.4) for 2 days at 4 °C with 3 changes. In control reactions, His-apoE3 and FLAG-apoE4 were subjected to above treatment separately, without mixing. Following dialysis all samples were captured by anti-FLAG-antibody conjugated to agarose beads under non-denaturing conditions and subjected to Western blot (WB) analysis using HRP-anti-His antibody, Figure 2A. A ~36 kDa band was observed in His-apoE3/FLAG-apoE4 mixtures (Lane 3), but not in His-apoE3 or FLAG-apoE4 alone (Lanes 1 and 2, respectively). In parallel experiments, the samples captured by anti-FLAG beads were subjected to WB with anti-FLAG Ab, Figure 2B. As noted above, a band ~ 36 kDa was observed for the mixtures (Figure 2B, Lane 3), but not for His-apoE3 homomer (Figure 2B, Lane 1). As expected, FLAG-apoE4 homomer that was captured and probed by anti-FLAG antibody showed a distinct band (Figure 2B, Lane 2).

In a complementary approach, pull-down of His-apoE3/FLAG-apoE4 was performed with cobalt-conjugated Dynabeads (Co-Dynabeads) followed by detection with anti-His and anti-FLAG antibodies, Figure 2C and 2D, respectively. A robust 36 kDa band was detected in mixtures containing His-apoE3 and FLAG-apoE4, when probed with anti-His antibody (Figure 2C, Lane 3) or with anti-FLAG antibody (Figure 2D, Lane 3). Again, as expected, His-apoE3 homomer that was captured and probed by anti-His antibody showed a distinct band (Figure 2C, Lane 1). Together, the results from the pull-down assays are indicative of hybridization or heteromer formation between His-apoE3 and FLAG-apoE4.

ii) FRET between apoE3 and apoE4

In an independent approach, we sought spectroscopic evidence for heteromer formation with His-tagged apoE3 and apoE4 by FRET analysis. ApoE4 bearing a donor, 5-((((2-Iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS) at position 291 (A291C) (AEDANS-apoE4) was mixed with apoE3 bearing an acceptor, fluorescein-5-malemide also at position 291 (A291C) (F5M-apoE3) under denaturing conditions followed by renaturation as described above. To ensure protein/probe ratio of ~1 in the latter, the endogenous Cys112 in apoE3 was substituted with a Ser, a replacement that had minimal effect on the structure and function of this isoform [31]. Upon excitation of AEDANS-apoE4 (100 μg/ml) at 340 nm in the absence of F5M-apoE3, fluorescence emission of AEDANS was noted with the wavelength of maximal fluorescence emission (λmax) centered at 470 nm, Figure 3, Panel A. However, excitation of F5M-apoE3/AEDANS-apoE4 mixtures at 340 nm showed a large decrease in AEDANS emission intensity (~60%), which was accompanied by appearance of fluorescence emission at ~ 570 nm. The latter was attributed to sensitized emission of fluorescein on apoE3 following FRET from AEDANS on apoE4. To exclude the possibility of FRET between oligomers, FRET response was determined as a function of dilution and decreasing protein concentration. FRET response persisted upon dilution from 100 to 50 μg/ml (Figure 3, Panel C), the latter lying in the plasma concentration range reported for apoE isoforms. Below 50 μg/ml the signal to noise ratio was not reliable. FRET was also noted when donor and acceptor were switched between the two isoforms (in mixtures containing 100 μg/ml AEDANS-apoE3/F5M-apoE4), Figure 3, Panel B. A similar large decrease in AEDANS emission was noted (~50%), although the sensitized emission intensity of fluorescein on apoE4 was lower (likely due to lower labeling stoichiometry with F5M-apoE4 compared to F5M-apoE3). As noted for the donor/acceptor pair above, FRET response persisted upon dilution of AEDANS-apoE3/F5M-apoE4 mixtures from 100 to 50 μg/ml, Figure 3, Panel D. The FRET data are indicative of close proximity between fluorophores located at position 291, with a distance of separation of ~46 Å between the donor on one and the acceptor on the other isoform, and suggestive of heteromerization between apoE3 and apoE4. The persistence of FRET upon dilution is indicative of heteromerization of apoE3/apoE4 at physiologically relevant concentrations.

(iii) Fluorescence quenching in apoE3/apoE4 heteromers

Since FRET is a ‘through-space’ phenomenon, it is possible that the observed acceptor emission in both cases above could originate from a neighboring oligomeric assembly. To exclude this possibility, a quenching approach was employed, with the quencher methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) covalently attached to one isoform and fluorescein or AEDANS on the other. Figure 4, Left and Right panels, show fluorescence emission spectra of MTSL-apoE3/F5M-apoE4 and F5M-apoE3/MTSL-apoE4, respectively. In both cases the emission intensity of fluorescein on apoE4 or apoE3 was decreased by 55–60% due to the presence of spin label on apoE3 or apoE4. Similarly quenching of fluorescence by MTSL was noted when AEDANS was the fluorophore (Data not shown).

Oligomeric state of heteromeric apoE3/apoE4

To determine the oligomeric state of apoE3/apoE4 heteromers, His-apoE3/His-apoE4 mixtures (~10 mg/ml) were subjected to size exclusion chromatography by FPLC, Figure 5, using His-apoE4 as control. The elution profile of the heteromer was broadly similar to that of the control, showing 4 major peaks; based on their order of appearance compared to the standards, the peaks roughly correspond to monomeric, dimeric, tetrameric and oligomeric states; the 2 minor peaks, likely represent apoE3 and/or apoE4 degradation products (&lt;16 kDa).

ApoE3 and apoE4 accommodated on the same lipoprotein particle

To determine if apoE3 and apoE4 could be present on the same lipoprotein particle, reconstituted HDL (rHDL) was prepared with POPC and F5M-apoE3/AEDANS-apoE4 by cholate dialysis method [32] with modifications as described earlier [33]. The resulting discoidal complexes are comprised of a bilayer of phospholipids surrounded by 4–6 apoE molecules in an extended belt conformation with their helical axes perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer [34]. Figure 6 shows the fluorescence emission spectra of rHDL following excitation of AEDANS at 340 nm. The appearance of fluorescein emission peak at 520 nm in addition to AEDANS emission at 470 nm was attributed to FRET between neighboring lipid-associated apoE molecules (intra-disc), suggesting that F5M-apoE3/AEDANS-apoE4 are present on the same discoidal complex.

Discussion

The relevance of the current study pertains to the observation that heterozygous ε3/ε4 individuals are represented 20-fold higher in the general population (25%) compared to ε4/ε4 individuals (1 – 2%). Interestingly, the risk of AD in individuals expressing both apoE3 and apoE4 isoforms appears to differ to a large extent with many nonagenarians retaining normal cognition [35,36]. The encoded apoE is a protein component of plasma found associated with chylomicron remnants, VLDL, and a sub fraction of HDL. Despite the minor difference at the amino acid level, apoE3 appears to show a slight preference for HDL over the pro-atherogenic VLDL particles (60:40) in the plasma, while apoE4 seems to show a preference for VLDL over HDL (60:40) [20,26]. One of the main functional features of apoE3 and apoE4 is their ability to serve as a ligand for the LDLr family of proteins via a constellation of positively charged residues in the NT domain of the protein, thereby regulating plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Whereas both apoE3 and apoE4 serve as ligands for the receptor, apoE3 is generally considered anti-atherogenic while apoE4 is a risk factor for AD and CVD, the latter attributed to its association with high plasma LDL cholesterol and atherosclerosis [2]. Considering that the two isoforms differ in the chemical nature of only a single residue in the NT domain, it raises the question if they can undergo protein-protein interaction via their CT tails to form heterodimers that can lead to further dimerization or oligomerization.

ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein that exists in dynamic equilibrium between lipid-free, lipoprotein-bound and proteoglycan-bound states. Although a bulk of the plasma apoE is expected to be associated with lipoproteins and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, macrophages secrete lipid-free (and lipid-poor) apoE, which plays a critical role in promoting cholesterol efflux, HDL formation and reverse cholesterol efflux [37,38]. Further, apoE is able to bind VLDL receptors with high affinity in the absence of lipids [38] supporting the physiological relevance of studies involving lipid-free apoE.

The pathological association of apoE4 compared to apoE3 has further been ascribed to small/subtle differences between the two isoforms, including shorter half-life likely linked to increased susceptibility of the protease-sensitive loop, decreased expression levels, higher LDLr binding affinity, cooperativity of the NT and CT domains in the unfolding behavior of the former, differences in binding to amyloid β-peptide [39]. From a structural perspective, while the NT and the CT domains may be folded independently in the case of apoE3 as determined by unfolding studies [29], it is believed that an interaction between the two domains in apoE4 plays a critical role in determining this isoform’s pathological behavior [20,26]. High-resolution structural analysis of isolated NT domain suggests that the side chain of a highly conserved Arg61 is exposed for salt bridge interaction with Glu255 in the CT domain of apoE4, but not apoE3 [20]. A weak interaction between the two domains was reported in a monomeric, albeit functional, full length apoE3 variant [21]. The physiological behavior of apoE4 in terms of its binding preference to VLDL and, its amyloidogenic properties and association with AD have been attributed to this domain-domain interaction. While the lipoprotein binding preference of apoE4 bears less relevance in the central nervous system, which lacks large lipoproteins with TG core, its domain-domain interaction has been under intense scrutiny with the goal of identifying small molecular weight ‘structure correctors’ that could potentially disrupt the interaction [2,40]. Since Glu255 is also located in the protein oligomerization site, the primary sequence of which is identical in both isoforms, a critical question in this study is to determine if apoE4 is able to undergo protein-protein interaction with apoE3, which oligomerizes but shows little or weak domain-domain interaction.

The current study strongly indicates that apoE3 and apoE4 interact with each other and form heteromers in lipid-free state as demonstrated by pull-down, FRET and quenching assays (Figure 7). The assays were carried out at 250 μg/ml apoE concentration to ensure protein oligomerization, with earlier reports [41] suggesting that the protein may be monomeric at ~ 5 μg/ml. The concentrations used in this study were well above reported plasma levels of apoE, which ranges from ~50 mg/l for ε3/ ε3 to ~40 mg/l for ε4/ ε4 subjects [42]. ApoE4 levels are generally ~25% lower than those of apoE3 [44], which may be attributed to decreased production or an increased metabolism and fractional catabolic rate of apoE4 compared to that of apoE3 [44]. In heterozygous individuals the ratio of apoE4 to total apoE levels was 30–40% in plasma [36]. On the other hand, the ratio appears to be reversed in the cerebrospinal fluid, with apoE4 accounting for 60–70% of the total apoE, and the absolute levels appear to be ~ 5 μg/ml [45]. Nevertheless, the current study employed equimolar concentrations of each isoform and assumed that the two isoforms were present in 1:1 ratio.

The pull-down assays show that the heteromerization process was not affected by the nature of the affinity tags at the N-terminal end of the isoforms or the nature of the pull-down matrix. Further confirmation for isoform heteromerization was sought from FRET to determine spatial proximity between specified residues in the CT domain of the respective proteins, and to measure distance between these residues. Residue 291 was selected to ensure that the probed site was in the protein-protein interaction site (266–299) [3,46]. Although the two isoforms were mixed in equimolar amounts, it is likely that the FRET data reflect an average distance due to the possibility of formation of different combinations of donor and acceptor to form tetramers. Nonetheless, the calculated distance of 46 Å between the two fluorophores strongly indicates that positions 291 on apoE3 and apoE4 are sufficiently proximal to bring the 2 isoforms within inter molecular interaction distance of each other and promote hybrid formation. The persistence of FRET upon dilution from 200 (data not shown) to 100 to 50 μg/ml excludes signal contribution between oligomers. As shown in Figure 7, the C-terminal helix likely mediates heteromerization between the two isoforms; other studies have indicated that truncation of this helix in either isoforms destabilizes the protein structure and leads to decrease in cooperativity in unfolding between the NT and CT domains [47]. These authors also proposed that the CT domain of apoE4 is less structured with more exposed hydrophobic surface compared to that of apoE3, which likely leads to increased affinity for lipids and amyloid β peptide of apoE4 compared to apoE3 [48]. In this context, it is likely that two apoE molecules dimerize via their entire CT domain (210–299), and two dimers dimerize further to yield tetramers or higher state oligomers via the C-terminal helix, as proposed by us earlier [49]. However, the current data does not allow us to discriminate between possibilities such as apoE3/apoE3, apoE4/apoE4 or apoE3/apoE4 dimeric configurations. Nevertheless, the potential of heteromer formation between the isoforms would suggest that apoE3 may impose a mitigating effect on the biochemical, folding, and physiological behavior of apoE4.

To exclude the possibility that the observed FRET maybe reporting proximity between donor and acceptor on neighboring oligomers, we sought independent evidence from fluorescence quenching. In this case, a dynamic collision quenching involving contact between the fluorophore and MTSL is required for electron exchange between the excited state of the fluorophore and the nitroxide radical [50,51]. The significant quenching of F5M or AEDANS-labeled isoforms by MTSL labeled apoE counterparts strengthens the overall conclusion of protein-protein interaction between apoE3 and apoE4. Lastly, apoE3/apoE4 heteromers appear to exist as an equilibrium mixture containing monomers, dimers, tetramers and higher state oligomers, similar to that reported for apoE3 and apoE4 homomers [48].

We also tested the possibility that apoE3 and apoE4 would be present on the same particle by FRET analysis since it has been suggested that discoidal rHDL particles contain 4–6 apoE molecules wrapped around the periphery shielding the fatty acyl chain of the phospholipid bilayer. The data suggest that apoE3 and apoE4 are on the same particle in POPC/AEDANS-apoE4/F5M-apoE3 preparations. From the currently available data, it is not possible to deduce the orientation of the two isoforms (parallel or antiparallel) with respect to each other.

Heteromer formation has implications in the physiological behavior of the lipoprotein particles. An increased clearance of apoE4- compared to apoE3-containing VLDL was noted in plasma of transgenic mice [44]. One possible explanation for this is that the binding affinity to hepatic LDLr appears to be slightly higher for apoE4 than apoE3 [55], likely due to a net increase in the positive electrostatic potential in the microenvironment of the receptor binding region in apoE4, which includes R158. Increased internalization and catabolism of lipoproteins bearing apoE4 is expected to down-regulate LDLr expression, which in turn leads to increased plasma cholesterol levels. The isoform-specific associations between apoE and VLDLr and LRP are less understood since these receptors, unlike the LDLr, are unable to discriminate between the different isoforms and bind all 3 isoforms [38]. Interestingly, the VLDL receptor is able to recognize and bind lipid-free apoE [38]. These receptors are abundant in the CNS, and play diverse roles in neuronal and non-neuronal cells [56]. The ability of the isoforms to associate with one another to form apoE3/apoE4 heteromers is likely to have significant implications in the catabolism of these lipoproteins. Further, although the molecular basis of how apoE impacts the process of Aβ oligomerization responsible for AD onset is unclear, the phenomenon of increased Aβ oligomerization appears to be an isoform-dependent manner (apoE4&gt;apoE3) [57]. Overall, it is possible that the occurrence of apoE4 in APOE e3/e4 heterozygotes may have an aggravating effect in terms of increased Aβ oligomerization in the CNS as a consequence of higher ratio of apoE4 to total apoE, protein-protein association and heteromerization between the two isoforms. Conversely, apoE3 bears the potential to attenuate the Aβ oligomerization process; further studies are needed to assess the effect of apoE3/apoE4 heteromers on Aβ oligomerization and associated risks.

In conclusion, we have shown that apoE3 and apoE4 form stable protein-protein interactions in lipid-free state, and that they could be localized on the same lipoprotein particle. It is likely that apoE3 attenuates the folding and physiological behavior of apoE4 in apoE3/apoE4 heteromeric mixtures. The current study lays the groundwork for understanding protein-protein interactions for heterozygous individuals expressing the two isoforms of apoE and to determine how they would affect downstream biological events to help understand the molecular basis of apoE isoform-specific cardiovascular and neurological disorders.

Methods

Constructs and protein purification

A pET-20b(+) expression vector bearing ampicillin resistance and encoding the codon-optimized (Eurofins MWG Operon, Louisville, KY, USA) sequence of wild type (WT) apoE3 and apoE4 (1–299) that was generated in previous studies was used [58]. The construct bears a hexa-His tag that is linked to the N-terminal end of apoE via a TEV protease cleavage site. Constructs bearing a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) that is linked to the N-terminal end of WT apoE3 and apoE4 via a TEV protease cleavage site was generated in pET-20b(+) using the following primers:

Forward: 5’CTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGGATTACAAAGATGACGATGACAAAGAAAACCTGTACTTCCAAGGCG3’

Reverse: 5’CGCCTTGGAAGTACAGGTTTTCTTTGTCATCGTCATCTTTGTAATCCATATGTATATCTCCTTCTTAAAG3’

In addition, a single Cys was substituted towards the C-terminal end of hexa-His apoE3 and apoE4 (A291C) to facilitate attachment of thiol-reactive probes using the following primers: Forward: 5’GCCGTTGGTACCAGTTGCGCTCCAGTTCCCAGC3’

Reverse: 5’GCTGGGAACTGGAGCGCAACTGGTACCAACGGC3’

In case of apoE3, the single endogenous Cys at position 112 was substituted with Ser to generate apoE3(C112S/A291C). All mutations were introduced using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and verified by DNA sequencing (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ, USA). All proteins were over-expressed and isolated from BL21 Gold(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and His-tagged proteins were purified using a Ni-affinity column (G.E Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) as described previously [49].

FLAG-tagged apoE3 and apoE4 were purified using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The cell lysates were applied to anti-FLAG M2 gel column equilibrated with TBS and the column washed with ~ 20 mL of TBS. FLAG-tagged proteins were eluted using 5 mL of FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK, 100 µg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or 1M arginine-HCl, pH 3.5. The eluted proteins were unfolded using an equal volume of ultra-pure 8M GdnHCl (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA) at 24 °C for 1 h and refolded by extensive dialysis against TBS for 48 h. The purity of the protein samples was assessed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions using a 4 to 20% acrylamide gradient gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

ApoE3/apoE4 heteromer preparation

His- and FLAG-tagged hybrids were prepared by incubating equimolar amounts of apoE3 and apoE4 variants to a final concentration of ~ 8 μM in the presence of 4 M GdnHCl at 24 °C for 1 h. The mixture was dialyzed against TBS for 2 days at 4 °C with 3 changes. A similar approach was used to prepare donor- and acceptor-labeled hybrids or probe- and quencher-labeled hybrids (described below) for fluorescence measurements. The hybrids used in the current study are listed in Table 2.

Pull-down assay

His-apoE3/FLAG-apoE4 or FLAG-apoE3/His-apoE4 (20 µg protein) were incubated with 40 µl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads at 4 °C for 2 h in the presence of 5% BSA (GoldBio Technology, St. Louis, MO, USA). The beads were blocked with 5% BSA prior to incubation. The mixture was washed extensively with TBS containing 5% BSA, and the beads treated with reducing SDS-PAGE sample treatment buffer directly. The proteins were detected by WB using HRP-anti-His antibody (Ab) (1: 10,000) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or HRP-anti-FLAG Ab (1: 10,000) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). In a complementary approach, His-apoE3/FLAG-apoE4 or FLAG-apoE3/His-apoE4 hybrids were captured by Co-Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), eluted with 0.5 M imidazole and detected as above.

CD spectroscopy

CD measurements were performed on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD, USA) at 24 °C. The ellipticity of freshly re-folded samples (0.2 mg/ml protein in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.4) was measured in the far-UV range between 185 nm and 260 nm in a 0.1 cm path length cylindrical cuvette (Hellma Cells, Plainview, NY, USA). The proteins were treated with 2X molar excess of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), pH 7.4, at 24 °C for 16 h to reduce disulfide bonds. Far-UV profiles were the average of four independent scans, recorded wat a scan speed of 20 nm/min, with response time of 2 s and bandwidth of 1 nm. The molar ellipticity ([θ]) and the percent α-helix content were calculated as described previously [58].

GdnHCl-induced unfolding.

Unfolding of apoE was assessed by following changes in molar ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of increasing concentration of GdnHCl as described earlier [27]. The samples (0.2 mg/ml) were treated with 0–8 M GdnHCl in 10mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4 in the presence of 2x molar excess of TCEP for 16 h at 24 °C. The % maximal change was calculated from the ellipticity values at 222 nm as: % Maximal Change =[(θ0−θ)(θ0−θ6)]∗100

where θ0 is the molar ellipticity of the native protein without GdnHCl, θ is the molar ellipticity at different GdnHCl concentrations (0 – 6M), θ6 is the molar ellipticity of the fully denatured protein.

Labeling with probes

His-apoE3(C112S/A291C) and apoE4(A291C) were labeled with 5-((((2-Iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS) or fluorescein-5-malemide (F5M) (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Waltham, MA, USA), (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-∆3-pyrroline-3-methyl) or methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada) under reducing conditions in an unfolded state. About 1 mg single-Cys variants (in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.4) was incubated with 50-fold molar excess GdnHCl and 2-fold molar excess TCEP for 30 min at 24 °C, followed by treatment with 2–5-fold molar excess of IAEDANS (dissolved in TBS) or F5M (dissolved in DMSO) for 2 h at 37 °C. All labeled samples were refolded and excess probe removed by extensive dialysis against 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.4 for 48 h at 4 °C. In select cases the labeling was performed on a 1 ml Ni-affinity column with immobilized protein under similar conditions, followed by elution with 0.5 M imidazole and dialysis as described above. The stoichiometry of labeling was determined from molar extinction coefficient of IAEDANS (5,700 M−1 cm−1) at 340 nm, F5M (68,000 M−1 cm−1) at 490 nm and apoE (44,460 M−1 cm−1) at 280 nm. It was found to be ~1.0 for AEDANS-apoE and ~0.5 for F5M-apoE.

Fluorescence measurements

Fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer LS55B fluorimeter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) using the FLWinlab program. All measurements were carried out with 50–100 μg/ml labeled protein in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.4. For FRET measurements AEDANS (donor) fluorescence emission was monitored from 400 – 600 nm following excitation at 340 nm, F5M (acceptor) emission was monitored from 500 – 600 nm following excitation at 490 nm. In addition, the hybrid samples were subjected to direct excitation of acceptor at 490 nm. For quenching experiments, emission spectra of AEDANS- or F5M-apoE were recorded in the absence or presence of MTSL-labeled apoE in hybrid mixtures. An average of 4 scans were recorded at a scan rate of 100 nm/min, with the excitation and emission slit widths set at 4 nm.

The efficiency E, of energy transfer between AEDANS and F5M was calculated as: E=1−QDAQD

where, QD and QDA are the quantum yields of the donor in the absence and presence of acceptor, respectively. The distance of separation R, between the donor and acceptor was calculated as, R=R0(1E−1)16

where R0, the Förster radius, is the distance at which the transfer efficiency is 50% (calculated to 46 Å for IAEDANS/F5M pair).

FPLC-size exclusion chromatography

To determine the oligomeric state of the heteromeric mixtures, His-apoE3/His-apoE4 samples (~10 mg/ml) were subjected to FPLC size exclusion chromatography using Bio-Rad BioLogic DuoFlow™ (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (G.E. Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) that was equilibrated with PBS. FPLC was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 24 ºC and monitored at 280 nm. In control experiments, His-apoE4 was analyzed at similar concentrations. Horse heart myoglobin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), bovine serum albumin (GoldBio Technology, St. Louis, MO, USA) and bovine immunoglobulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) with molecular masses corresponding to ~16,950, 66,430 and 150,000 Da, respectively, were used as standards.

Preparation of rHDL

rHDL containing POPC/AEDANS-apoE4 or POPC/F5M-apoE3/AEDANS-apoE4 were prepared by the cholate dialysis method with slight modifications as described previously [33]. Lipid-bound protein was separated from lipid-free protein and protein-free lipid vesicles by KBr density gradient ultracentrifugation, fractionated and pooled as described [33].

Figure 7. Schematic model depicting apoE3/apoE4 heteromerization.

The schematic illustration is a hypothetical model of protein-protein interaction between the two isoforms forming apoE3/apoE4 heteromer. The NT domain helix bundle is based on X-ray structure of apoE3(1–191) (blue) (PDB ID# 1NFN) and apoE4(1–191) (red) (PDB ID# 1LE4). Segments that were unstructured due to high mobility are either not shown (residues 1–22) or schematically modeled (residues 165–191). The linker loop and the CT domain depictions (residues 192–299) are based on secondary structure predictions and other biophysical studies. The dashed line in apoE4 represents the proposed salt bridge between R61 and E255. The segments that likely mediate heteromerization between the two isoforms are indicated as helices with oval patches towards the C-terminal end.
