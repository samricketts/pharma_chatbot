INTRODUCTION:

We examined for associations between potentially modifiable risk factors across the adult life course and incident dementia.

METHODS:

Participants from the Framingham Heart Study were included (n = 4,015). Potential modifiable risk factors included education, alcohol intake, smoking, BMI, physical activity, social network, diabetes, and hypertension. Cox models were used to examine associations between each factor and incident dementia, stratified by early adult life (33–44 years), midlife (45–65 years), and late-life (66–80 years).

RESULTS:

Increased dementia risk was associated with diabetes (HR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.07 – 2.46) and physical inactivity (HR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.12 – 2.20) in midlife, and with obesity (HR = 1.76; 95% CI = 1.08 – 2.87) in late-life. Having multiple potential modifiable risk factors in midlife and late-life were associated with greater risk.

DISCUSSION:

Potential modifiable risk factors individually have limited impact in this population across the adult life course on dementia risk, though in combination may have a more synergistic effect.

pmc1. Introduction

The lack of effective treatments to slow down the disease process, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), that leads to dementia is a major obstacle in dementia prevention. Thus, there is an immense need to develop strategies to delay or potentially prevent the onset of dementia.[1–3] While much attention has been placed on identifying risk factors for dementia in older adults, there is greater recognition that chronic age-related conditions are thought to have social and physiologic antecedents earlier in life,[4] which may represent more amenable targets for interventions to reduce the risk of dementia. Furthermore, risk and protective factors for dementia can exert their influence at different times in the life course,[5] suggesting that it is never too late or too early in the life course for dementia prevention. With the development of dementia likely influenced by contributing factors over the life course,[6] longitudinal studies examining associations between different modifiable factors for dementia at various points across the life course will help to advance knowledge on critical questions, such as when prevention efforts should begin and at which life stages interventions would be most effective.

In 2020, the Lancet Commission report on dementia identified 12 potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia across the life course by conducting a systematic review of high-quality published studies.[7] Early life risk factors included less education. Midlife risk factors included hearing loss, hypertension, traumatic brain injury (TBI), excessive alcohol consumption, and obesity. Later life risk factors included smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, diabetes, and air pollution. A limitation of this report is that it did not explicitly evaluate whether these 12 factors overlapped between these life periods in that some of the factors may contribute to dementia risk at multiple periods during the entire life course. For example, dietary and mental activity patterns may moderate the risk of dementia from mid- to late-life.[8–14] Another limitation is that the report did not examine the impact of having multiple risk factors at each life period on future dementia risk. While individual risk factors may show insignificant or weak associations with dementia, an increased number of risk factors is associated with a greater risk for cognitive decline and dementia.[15–18] Moreover, the strongest evidence for reducing the risk of cognitive decline has come so far from multi-factorial clinical trials targeting multiple risk factors.[19]

The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) enrolled a large number of participants across the adult lifespan and has followed them for multiple decades to collect multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease and dementia risk.[20] Using the data collected by FHS, we aimed to investigate the association of eight potentially modifiable risk factors (less education, high alcohol intake, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, social isolation, diabetes, and hypertension) with the risk of incident all-cause dementia across the adult life course. Previous studies from FHS have examined associations between midlife and late-life cardiometabolic risk factors and incident dementia,[21,22] and our analysis expands on these findings by including additional potential modifiable risk factors, such as low education, high alcohol intake, physical inactivity, and social isolation, measured across the whole adult life course (early, mid, and late adulthood). We hypothesized that increased risk of all-cause dementia was associated with early adult life (18–44 years) exposure to less education; midlife (45–65 years) exposures to high alcohol intake, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, social isolation, diabetes, and hypertension; and late-life (&gt;65 years) exposures to high alcohol intake, smoking, physical inactivity, social isolation, diabetes, and hypertension. We also examined whether having a greater number of concurrent risk factors in early adult life, midlife, and late-life was associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants and procedures

Initiated in 1948, FHS is a population-based cohort with regular health exams.[20] The present study used data from the FHS Offspring (Gen 2) cohort, which began in 1971–1975 with 5,124 participants who were 5–70 years of age and had, on average, health exams every four to eight years.[23] To study the relationship between each potentially modifiable risk factor across the adult life course and dementia risk, analyses were based on 4,015 participants who (1) attended Exam 4 (1987–1991); (2) did not have dementia at Exam 4; and (3) were between age 33–80 years at Exam 4. We chose Exam 4 as the analytic study baseline (i.e., time zero) because it allowed for the most appropriate balance between the distribution of participants across the three age epochs (early adult life, midlife, and late-life) and length of follow-up time to observe incident dementia cases (Figure 1). Informed consent was obtained from all study participants, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Boston University Medical Campus.

2.2. Modifiable risk factors

Information on seven of the eight potentially modifiable risk factors of interest, which included hypertension, smoking, physical inactivity, high alcohol intake, obesity, social isolation, and diabetes was assessed at Exam 4 (Supplemental Data 1). Hypertension was defined as having systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥130/80 mmHg or the use of anti-hypertensive medication for treating high blood pressure.[24] Smoking was defined as a self-reported current smoker. Physical inactivity was defined as being at the lowest quintile on the Physical Activity Index, which is a composite score constructed by weighting each hour in a typical day based on activity level and summing the weighted hours over a 24 hours.[25] High alcohol intake was defined as binge drinking (e.g., ≥4 drinks on an occasion for women and ≥5 drinks on an occasion for men) or excessive drinking (e.g., ≥8 drinks/week for women and ≥15 drinks/week for men).[26] Obesity was defined as having a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kilograms/meter2.[27] Social isolation was defined as being at the lowest quintile of number of social ties (e.g., friends, siblings, spouse, and neighbors).[28] Diabetes was defined as having non-fasted blood glucose ≥200 milligrams/deciliter, fasted blood glucose ≥126 milligrams/deciliter, or the use of insulin or hypoglycemic medication to lower blood sugar.[29] Information on education level was not assessed at Exam 4; we used information on education level collected at Exam 2 to assess less education (e.g., &lt;12 years of education) as a potential modifiable risk factor at Exam 4. Among the 12 potentially modifiable risk factors examined in the 2020 Lancet Commission report,[7] four of them (e.g., hearing loss, TBI, depression, air pollution) were not included in this analysis as information on these potentially modifiable risk factors were not available at Exam 4.

2.3. Dementia ascertainment

Participants suspected of cognitive impairment are classified by expert consensus, including a team with at least one neurologist and one neuropsychologist, as to whether they have dementia.[30] For this study, we followed the study sample for the development of incident dementia over 32 years from the study baseline period. Diagnosis of all-cause dementia was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition.[31] Diagnosis of AD dementia was based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria.[32] Detailed procedures for the diagnosis of dementia within FHS are reported elsewhere.[30]

2.4. Covariates

Covariates were assessed at Exam 4 and included age (years), self-reported sex (female versus male), apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status (≥1 ε4 allele versus no ε4 allele), and history of cardiovascular events (yes versus no), including stroke and transient ischemic attacks, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and peripheral artery disease.

2.5. Statistical analysis

Participants in the analytic sample (n = 4,015, 52% female) were stratified into three age epochs, based on their age at Exam 4: early adult life (n = 1,079, age 33–44 years); midlife (n = 2,476, age 45–65 years); and late-life (n = 460, age 66–80 years). We provided descriptive statistics: mean and standard deviation for continuous variables, or count and percentage for binary variables. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the risk of time (years) to dementia associated with less education, hypertension, smoking, physical inactivity, diabetes, high alcohol intake, obesity, and social isolation within each age epoch. Separate models were developed for all-cause dementia and AD dementia as outcomes. All models were adjusted for age, sex, APOE ε4 status, and history of cardiovascular events.

We also examined associations between incident dementia and the number of concurrent potentially modifiable risk factors in each age epoch. The number of concurrent risk factors was modeled as a continuous measure (e.g., 1–8) and as a categorical measure (e.g., 1, 2, and &gt;2), with participants without any of the potentially modifiable risk factors of interest (e.g., 0) as the reference group. As of to date, there is no currently available algorithm to assess all eight potentially modifiable factors. Therefore, we considered a cumulative score by summing up the number of potential modifiable risk factors in early adult life, midlife, and late-life. We also conducted a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate how well the number of concurrent risk factors (e.g., 1, 2, and &gt;2 compared to 0) at each age epoch can distinguish individuals who did versus did not develop all-cause dementia based on area under the curve (AUC) values. All P-values reported in this study were two-sided with significance at P &lt;0.05. Analyses were conducted using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas) and R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna).

3. Results

3.1. Baseline characteristics of each age epoch

At baseline, the average age of the 4,015 participants (52% female) was 51.6 years, ranging from 33 years to 80 years. Of these, 1,079 were in early adult life (33–44 years), 2,476 were in midlife (45–65 years), and 460 were in late-life (66–80 years) at the study baseline (Table 1). On average, participants in the earlier age epochs were more likely to be female, currently smoke, and consume more alcohol, as well as have more years of education and higher levels of physical activity compared to those in the later age epochs. Participants in the later age epochs were, on average, more likely to have greater BMI and have hypertension, diabetes, and a history of cardiovascular events compared to those in the earlier age epochs (Table 1).

A total of 336 cases of all-cause dementia were observed over an average follow-up time of 20.9 years in the overall sample. Among participants in early adult life, 36 cases of all-cause dementia were observed over an average follow-up time of 24.0 years. Among participants in midlife, 176 cases of all-cause dementia were observed over an average follow-up time of 20.9 years. Among participants in late-life, 124 cases of all-cause dementia were observed over an average follow-up time of 13.9 years.

3.2. Associations between potentially modifiable risk factors in each age epoch with risk of dementia

Diabetes and physical inactivity in midlife were significantly associated with a 62% (HR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.07 – 2.46; p = 0.023) and 57% (HR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.12 – 2.20; p = 0.009) increased risk of all-cause dementia, respectively (Figure 2). Obesity in late-life was significantly associated with a 76% increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR = 1.76; 95% CI = 1.08 – 2.87; p = 0.024) (Figure 2). All other potentially modifiable risk factors examined were not significantly associated with the risk of all-cause dementia. The magnitude of association with all-cause dementia risk for each potentially modifiable risk factor varied by age epoch, with the strongest associations observed for high alcohol intake, smoking, social isolation, and physical inactivity in early adult life, diabetes in midlife, and less education, hypertension, and obesity in late-life. Associations between each potentially modifiable risk factor in each age epoch and risk of AD dementia were similar to what was observed for all-cause dementia risk (Supplemental Data 2), except that only obesity in late-life was significantly associated with increased risk of AD dementia (HR = 2.19; 95% CI = 1.27 – 3.77; p = 0.005). The magnitude of association with AD dementia risk for each potentially modifiable risk factor also varied by age epoch, with the strongest associations observed for diabetes, hypertension, high alcohol intake, smoking, social isolation, and physical inactivity in early adult life, and less education and obesity in late-life.

3.3. Number of potentially modifiable risk factors in early adult life, midlife, and late-life and associations with risk of dementia

With each increasing age epoch, the average number of potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia increased, with individuals in early adult life having 1.5 potential modifiable risk factors, individuals in midlife having 1.9 potential modifiable risk factors, and individuals in late-life having 2.1 potential modifiable risk factors (Table 2). As a continuous measure, each additional potentially modifiable risk factor in midlife was significantly associated with a 16% increased risk in all-cause dementia (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.04 – 1.29; p = 0.009). In particular, having more than two potentially modifiable risk factors in midlife was significantly associated with a 64% increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.01 – 2.66; p = 0.047). In late-life, having one potentially modifiable risk factor was significantly associated with a 2.8 times increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR = 2.78; 95% CI = 1.07 – 7.25; p = 0.037); having two potentially modifiable risk factors was significantly associated with a 2.6 times increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR = 2.64; 95% CI = 1.02 – 6.80; p = 0.044). However, no statistically significant dose-response relationship in the number of potentially modifiable risk factors in late-life (or early adult life) and risk of all-cause dementia was observed. Associations between the number of potentially modifiable risk factors, either as a continuous or categorical measure, in early adult life, midlife, and late-life and risk of AD dementia were not statistically significant (Supplemental Data 3). ROC analyses showed that having two potentially modifiable risk factors in early adult life and late-life yielded the best performance for classifying participants who developed all-cause dementia, with AUCs of 0.74 and 0.66, respectively (Supplemental Data 4-6). In midlife, having one or two potentially modifiable risk factors yielded a similar ability (AUC = 0.77) to distinguish between participants who developed versus did not develop all-cause dementia.

4. Discussion

In the present study, we found that diabetes and physical inactivity during midlife, and obesity in late-life, were significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia. Obesity in late-life was also significantly associated with an increased risk of AD dementia. This is one of the first studies to systematically include and examine multiple potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia across the adult lifespan, which has important implications for developing more effective and timely prevention strategies for dementia.

The 2020 Lancet Commission report identified diabetes and physical inactivity as late-life risk factors for dementia; however, in our study, we found that diabetes and physical inactivity in midlife were significantly associated with increased all-cause dementia risk. One possible explanation for the lack of significant associations with diabetes and physical activity in early adult life and late-life may be due to small sample sizes and insufficient statistical power. Prior studies have found associations between midlife diabetes and dementia risk, including a study in the United States among enrolled members of a health plan that showed a 46% increased risk in dementia associated with having diabetes in midlife.[33] Other studies have found similar findings that suggest having diabetes in midlife increases dementia risk later in life.[34,35] A recent study from FHS also found that higher glucose levels in middle adulthood, but not early or late adulthood, were significantly associated with increased AD risk.[36] Our findings that physical inactivity in midlife is associated with increased dementia risk are also consistent with previous studies indicating an association between midlife physical activity and incident dementia. One of the largest studies on the relationship between physical activity in midlife and dementia risk found that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in midlife was associated with a 19% decreased risk of dementia.[37] A study in middle-aged women found that high cardiovascular fitness was associated with a 88% decreased risk of all-cause dementia compared to medium cardiovascular fitness.[38] Other studies have also shown that in midlife, greater leisure-time physical activity, and light or regular exercise, are associated with lower odds of developing dementia, including AD dementia,[39,40] possibly by protecting against cerebrovascular sequelae later in life.[41] Taken together, these findings implicate diabetes and physical inactivity in midlife as potential modifiable risk factors for dementia, in addition to being potential late-life risk factors as indicated by the 2020 Lancet Commission report, and should be targeted for possible interventions earlier in life to delay or possibly prevent the onset of dementia.

We also found that obesity in late-life was significantly associated with increased risk for all-cause dementia, whereas obesity in midlife was identified as a potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia in the 2020 Lancet Commission report.[7] Though some studies have found that obesity or higher BMI in late-life is associated with increased dementia risk,[42–44] a meta-analysis did not support an association between late-life obesity and incident dementia.[45] Establishing obesity in late-life as a potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia is made more complicated by evidence that suggests higher BMI in late-life is associated with decreased risk of dementia,[46] though this is likely a reflection of reverse causation.[45] Despite the positive association we found between late-life obesity and incident dementia, whether obesity in late-life represents a causal risk factor for dementia remains inconclusive and requires further study.

We did not find that less education, high alcohol intake, smoking, social isolation, and hypertension were significantly associated with incident dementia, which could be due to the following reasons in our sample: (1) influence of survival bias among midlife participants, and particularly, late-life participants; and/or (2) having resilience or resistance to the impact of these potentially modifiable risk factors on the development of dementia. Insufficient power and imprecision in the measurement of the potentially modifiable risk factors may also have contributed to reducing or minimizing the impact of these factors on dementia risk. Given the complexities of a life course analysis, our findings should motivate further studies that examine and address these potential issues more in-depth. Nonetheless, our results suggest the influence of these factors may vary across the adult life course, especially in comparing the impact of obesity, physical inactivity, high alcohol intake, smoking, diabetes, and hypertension in midlife versus late-life. Other studies also support the notion that the impact (and role) of these factors in midlife and late-life differs in contributing to the development of dementia.[47–49] Even our findings in early adult life, which are limited by lack of precision due to the small number of incident dementia cases that developed over the follow-up period among participants in this age epoch, are intriguing as they potentially reflect early life as a critical time period in which factors, such as physical activity, alcohol intake, smoking, and social isolation, may exert a substantial impact on the development of dementia later in life. Potential biological mechanisms underpinning the role of these potentially modifiable risk factors across the life course on cognitive functioning include inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular risk factors,[6] as well as neurobiological mechanisms, such as neurotransmission processes, brain structure alterations, and neuroplasticity.[6,50] Despite the lack of significant associations among many of the potentially modifiable risk factors examined in our analysis, evidence from other published studies indicate the relevance of these factors on brain health and cognitive aging.

In addition to examining individual factors across the adult life course, we assessed the impact of having a higher number of potentially modifiable risk factors in early adult life, midlife, and late-life on dementia risk. Our findings, particularly in midlife, suggest that limiting exposure to risk factors, even when risk factors are present to prevent further accrual, may be a crucial component of dementia prevention strategies. Other studies have also found that a higher number of risk factors is associated with increased risk of dementia,[33,51] and a systematic review and meta-analysis found a dose-response relationship, such that one risk factor, two risk factors, and three or more risk factors were associated with a 20%, 70%, and 120% increased risk of dementia, respectively.[15] Even as studies show that having clustering or co-occurring of risk factors is the more likely scenario than having only a single risk factor,[52,53] there remains a lack of knowledge on the impact of risk factor burden on the development of dementia and whether particular combinations of risk factors confer greater risk than others.

Strengths of the study include the prospective design and the availability of multiple potential dementia risk factors measured at early adult life, midlife, and late-life at the same FHS core examination, which permits an examination of factors concurrently across the adult life course. Our study has some limitations, however. Our study focused on only the adult life course as data was limited or unavailable earlier in life, such as in childhood and adolescence. Future studies should examine these potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia across the entire life course. Despite the inclusion of potentially modifiable risk factors in early adult life, our results during this age epoch were not statistically significantly most likely due to insufficient power. We expect that the strong, but non-significant associations with increased risk of dementia that we observed in early adult life would be significant had there been greater sample size in early adult life and more follow-up time to observe additional incident cases of dementia. Also, there is potential measurement error inherent in the self-reported measures of education, smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity used in this study; however, given that random measurement error tends to bias toward null results, we have reason to believe that the associations observed in this study may actually be stronger than we reported. The lack of precision in the measurement of some of the potential modifiable risk factors, which includes lack of information on severity, may have also contributed to the wide confidence intervals and impacted our ability to observe significant associations. Future studies which incorporate a better algorithm to combine risk factors may increase power to yield significant results. Finally, participants in our study are primarily European American, which may limit generalizability of our findings to larger, more ethnically diverse populations. Further study is needed to confirm our findings in other, more diverse study samples.

5. Conclusion

These findings suggest that potential modifiable risk factors for dementia have differential impacts across the adult lifespan. Another important implication is that individual risk factors alone may not substantially contribute to dementia risk, but that the combination of multiple factors together may have greater impact on dementia risk. Based on the unique contributions of these findings to our understanding of modifiable risk factors for dementia across the life course, our results should motivate further research into investigating the cumulative impact of exposure to potentially modifiable dementia risk factors across the life course, in addition to informing precision-based interventions based on an individual’s genetic and lifestyle profile that will provide policymakers with more specific information in which to base dementia prevention guidelines and recommendations. With greater recognition of AD as a life course disease, more precise and effective prevention strategies are needed that emphasize the importance of tailoring interventions to the right person at the right time to promote brain health and delay or even potentially prevent the onset of dementia.

Diabetes and physical inactivity in midlife associated with increased dementia risk

Obesity in late-life associated with increased dementia risk

Having more potential modifiable risk factors in midlife and late-life associated with greater dementia risk

Systematic review:

The 2020 Lancet Commission report identified 12 potential modifiable risk factors across the life course, including less education in early life; hearing loss, hypertension, traumatic brain injury, excessive alcohol consumption, and obesity in midlife; and smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, diabetes, and air pollution in late-life. Whether these factors contribute to dementia risk only at one point or at multiple points over the life course is unknown.

Interpretation:

Increased dementia risk was associated with diabetes and physical inactivity in midlife, and with obesity in late-life. Having multiple potential modifiable risk factors in midlife and late-life were associated with greater risk.

Future directions:

Potential modifiable risk factors individually have limited impact across the adult life course on dementia risk, though in combination may have a more synergistic effect. Additional studies to examine the cumulative impact of exposure to potentially modifiable dementia risk factors across the life course are needed.
