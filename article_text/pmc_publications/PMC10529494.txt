Background:

Adaptor protein complex 4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (AP-4-HSP) is caused by pathogenic biallelic variants in AP4B1, AP4M1, AP4E1, and AP4S1.

Objective:

The aim was to explore blood markers of neuroaxonal damage in AP-4-HSP.

Methods:

Plasma neurofilament light chain (pNfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels were measured in samples from patients and age- and sex-matched controls (NfL: n = 46 vs. n = 46; GFAP: n = 14 vs. n = 21) using single-molecule array assays. Patients’ phenotypes were systematically assessed using the AP-4-HSP natural history study questionnaires, the Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale, and the SPATAX disability score.

Results:

pNfL levels increased in AP-4-HSP patients, allowing differentiation from controls (Mann-Whitney U test: P = 3.0e-10; area under the curve = 0.87 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.80–0.94). Phenotypic cluster analyses revealed a subgroup of individuals with severe generalized-onset seizures and developmental stagnation, who showed differentially higher pNfL levels (Mann-Whitney U test between two identified clusters: P = 2.5e-6). Plasma GFAP levels were unchanged in patients with AP-4-HSP.

Conclusions:

pNfL is a potential disease marker in AP-4-HSP and can help differentiate between phenotypic subgroups.

pmcAdaptor protein complex 4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (AP-4-HSP) consists of four forms of childhood-onset HSP with a shared phenotype, caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants in the genes that encode the subunits of the AP-4 (AP4B1, AP4M1, AP4E1, and AP4S1, also referred to as SPG47, SPG50, SPG51, and SPG52).1 AP-4-HSP has emerged as an important mimic of cerebral palsy and a prototypical form of complex HSP in children, presenting with features of a neurodevelopmental disorder (ie, global developmental delay, microcephaly, and early-onset seizures) and a progressive neurodegenerative disease (ie, progressive spasticity with loss of ambulation, extrapyramidal movement disorders, and bulbar dysfunction).2–5 Although we have previously shown that cell-based functional assays, that is, in patient-derived fibroblasts, can establish AP-4 function and thus aid a diagnosis of AP-4-HSP, to date no readily available disease marker has been established.6 With a growing number of potential treatment approaches in the development pipeline, including gene replacement therapy, blood biomarkers would present a significant step toward clinical trial readiness.7

Development of advanced ultrasensitive detection methods such as single-molecule array (SiMoA) has allowed for the reliable quantification of neuronal and glial proteins such as neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in blood.8–10 Both NfL and GFAP have emerged as potential biomarkers of neuroaxonal damage and neurodegeneration and have been validated for a variety of neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and adult-onset HSP.11–15

Here, we investigate plasma NfL (pNfL) and GFAP (pGFAP) as potential markers of neuroaxonal damage in AP-4-HSP using a well-characterized cohort of 46 mostly pediatric patients enrolled in an ongoing natural history study (NCT04712812), paired with 46 age- and sex-matched controls.

Patients and Methods

Detailed information is available in the Supplementary Material.

Study Design and Participants

This study was approved by the Boston Children’s Hospital (IRB-P00033016), and written consent was obtained from all participants. Patients were recruited from the AP-4-HSP International Registry (NCT04712812). Clinical information was collected using the AP-4-HSP Natural History Study Questionnaire, the Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS), and the SPATAX disability score (SPATAX).16–18 Plasma samples from age- and sex-matched controls with no history of neurological disease (Table S1) were acquired from the Boston Children’s Hospital PrecisionLink Biobank.19 Demographic, genetic, and clinical information is provided in Table 1.

SiMoA Measurements

Plasma was stored at −80°C and not thawed until measurements were performed. pNfL and pGFAP measurements were performed in duplicates on the Simoa HD-X analyzer using the GFAP Discovery and NF-Light Advantage kits (Quanterix, Billerica, MA). pNfL levels were measured in 46 patient and 46 control samples, and pGFAP levels were measured in 14 patient and 21 control samples. Forty patient and 45 control samples (for pNfL), as well as all 12 patient and 20 control samples (for pGFAP), were included in the final analysis after quality control filtering. Details on outlier removal are available in the Supplementary Material. The following median intra-assay percentage coefficients of variation (CV) were observed: 3.59% (IQR [interquartile range] = 3.46) for patient and 4.73% (IQR = 6.15) for control samples when measuring pNfL and 3.62% (IQR = 3.56) for patient and 3.29% (IQR = 4.45) for control samples when measuring pGFAP.

Statistical Analyses

Normality of distributions was assessed using Shapiro–Wilk test and graphical methods. Medians and IQRs are reported for continuous variables. Differences between groups were evaluated using Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal–Wallis test. Fisher’s exact test was used for evaluating dependence between categorical variables. P-values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.20 Classification performance based on pNfL was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and multivariate linear regression analyses adjusted for age and sex were used to evaluate associations between pNfL and functional scores. To assess associations between pNfL and dichotomous clinical findings, a multivariate linear regression adjusted for age and sex was performed. Unsupervised clustering based on clinical data was conducted using Gower’s distance and the partitioning around medoids (PAM) algorithm.21,22 All statistical tests were two sided, and P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed in R (v4.2.2) and RStudio (v2022.12.03, RStudio, Inc., Boston, MA).

Results

Demographic, molecular, and clinical data of the cohort of 46 AP-4-HSP patients are summarized in Table 1. Core clinical manifestations were delayed motor development (100.0%, n = 45), intellectual disability (100.0%, n = 30), lower-limb spasticity (91.3%, n = 46), and a positive Babinski sign (85.0%, n = 20). Patients had a median SPRS score of 31 (IQR = 12.25), a median SPRS spasticity subscore of 5 (IQR = 6.75), and a median SPATAX score of 5 (IQR = 3). Patients with AP-4-HSP had significantly higher median pNfL levels compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls (6.26 pg/mL [IQR = 3.62 pg/mL, n = 40] vs. 3.48 pg/mL [IQR = 1.40 pg/mL, n = 45], Mann-Whitney U test, P = 3.0e-10; Fig. 1A). No significant differences in pNfL levels were observed when patients were stratified for affected gene or coding impact (Fig. S1). Interestingly, pNfL levels showed a weak inverse correlation with age in patients (ρ= 0.36, P = 0.024) but not in controls (P = 0.45; Fig. S1). To assess the potential value of pNfL as a diagnostic disease marker, we performed an ROC analysis, which revealed moderate performance in differentiating patients and controls (AUC = 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80–0.94; Fig. 1B). Maximizing the Youden index yielded a cutoff value of &gt;4.51 pg/mL to distinguish between groups (sensitivity = 82.2%, specificity = 80.0%, positive likelihood ratio = 4.5; Fig. 1B). In contrast to pNfL, pGFAP levels were not significantly different between patients and controls (97.7 pg/mL [IQR = 112.8 pg/mL, n = 12] vs. 136.1 pg/mL [IQR = 90.8 pg/mL, n = 20], Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.55; Fig. 1C).

Next, we sought to explore the associations between pNfL levels and clinical manifestations and disease severity. Given the well-characterized positive correlation of clinical scores, such as the SPRS and SPATAX with age in AP-4-HSP patients,2,14 and the significant association between NfL levels and sex and age that have been previously reported,12,23,24 we decided to adjust subsequent analyses for age and sex. Although no significant associations between pNfL levels and absolute SPRS or SPATAX scores were observed when adjusting the models for age and sex (Table 1), we found a significant association with three clinical symptoms. Presence of “unsupported walking never achieved” (Padj = 0.009, β = 0.17 [95% CI = 0.04–0.29], Radj2 = 0.23), “generalized-onset seizures” (Padj = 0.024, β = 0.13 [95% CI = 0.02–0.23], Radj2 = 0.19), and “history of status epilepticus” (Padj = 0.036, β = 0.12 [95% CI = 0.01–0.24], Radj2 = 0.17) resulted in an increase of 46.8%, 33.7%, and 32.7% pNfL levels, respectively (using log10-backtransformed β; Fig. 1D). To account for potential additive effects not captured by our regression models, we additionally examined pNfL levels in patients who presented with two or more of the three aforementioned phenotypes. This revealed a trend towards higher pNfL concentrations in patients with two or three of these manifestations (eg, median: 10.0 pg/mL [IQR = 3.0, n = 7] in patients with all three symptoms vs. 6.3 pg/mL [IQR = 3.6, n = 40] in the entire patient cohort; Fig. 1E).

Considering the potential presence of latent phenotypic subgroups, which might significantly differ in pNfL levels, we decided to employ PAM, an unsupervised clustering algorithm suitable for use with mixed-type data sets. Phenotypic clustering uncovered two distinct subgroups (cluster 1, n = 27; cluster 2, n = 19). Whereas cluster 1 mainly included older patients with signs of advanced corticospinal tract dysfunction (median age: 10.0 years [IQR = 7.5]), reflected by higher frequencies of secondary musculoskeletal manifestations, that is, contractures (85.2%, OR [odds ratio] = 27.3 [95% CI = 5.0–220.1], Padj = 1.3e-4), foot deformities (71.4%, OR = 17.0 [95% CI = 2.7–198.0], Padj = 5.8e-3), and hyperreflexia (91.7%, OR = 13.7 [95% CI = 2.0–161.9], Padj = 0.02), patients assigned to cluster 2 were on average younger (median age: 3.6 years [IQR = 2.8]) and presented with a severe phenotype, characterized by profound motor delay in the form of “unsupported walking never achieved” (84.2%, OR = 17.1 [95% CI = 3.4–123.5], Padj = 1.5e-3) and a history of status epilepticus (79.0%, OR = 10.1 [95% CI = 2.3–56.9], Padj = 0.01; Fig. 1F; Fig. S2). The difference in age distributions suggests that the defining symptoms of cluster 2 are indeed absent from cluster 1 and not merely representative of natural disease progression. Median pNfL levels were significantly lower in cluster 1 compared to cluster 2 patients (4.82 pg/mL [IQR = 2.01 pg/mL, n = 23] vs. 9.27 pg/mL [IQR = 4.89 pg/mL, n = 17], Mann-Whitney U test, P = 2.5e-6; Fig. 1G). To control for the differences in age and sex distributions between clusters, a multivariate regression adjusting for the two covariates was performed. This confirmed a significant positive association between assignment to cluster 2 and pNfL levels (P = 2.3e-5, β = 0.25 [95% CI = 0.15–0.36], Radj2 = 0.44), translating to 78% higher pNfL levels in cluster 2 compared to cluster 1 patients.

Discussion

In this study, we examined plasma NfL and GFAP levels as potential disease markers in AP-4-HSP patients. We report increased pNfL levels in patients compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Although no correlation between pNfL levels and established measures of disease severity and function (SPRS, SPRS spasticity subscore, and SPATAX score) was observed, pNfL was associated with certain clinical findings, indicative of developmental stagnation and generalizedonset seizures. Unsupervised clustering identified a subgroup of individuals of young age with a severe seizure phenotype and inability to walk, who had differentially higher pNfL levels.

The present study identifies pNfL as a potential disease marker in patients with AP-4-HSP. pGFAP levels, although measured only in a relatively small number of patients, were found to be unchanged, providing further evidence that AP-4-HSP is a disease driven by axonal injury rather than progressive demyelination.

Our study has several limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small, particularly when accounting for the relatively large age range, which limits predictive strength, in particular, in older individuals (&gt;15 years of age). Second, a longitudinal assessment of pNfL levels, including samples collected prior to the onset of significant spasticity, is needed to confirm our cross-sectional data. Third, despite the availability of age-matched controls in our study, the age-dependent reference range in larger and more diverse populations of healthy children remains to be established.

Our findings highlight the important role of comprehensive phenotyping when evaluating potential biomarkers and the need to include matched controls, particularly in the pediatric age group. The former is particularly relevant for neurological disorders with profound phenotypic pleiotropy, such as HSP.25–28 Our study provides a data set that adds to the few available data for pNfL in neurologically healthy children.29–33 In summary, by establishing a baseline of elevated pNfL levels in patients with AP-4-HSP, this first cross-sectional study provides the basis for future longitudinal measurement of pNfL, which will help determine whether pNfL is a prognostic biomarker sensitive to disease progression and disease modifying intervention. This step towards clinical trial readiness is important as it might inform the therapeutic window, disease stratification, and outcome measures in safety monitoring emerging gene replacement therapies for AP-4-related HSP.34
