There is growing literature on applications of biodemographic models, including stochastic process models (SPM), to studying regularities of age dynamics of biological variables in relation to aging and disease development. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is especially good candidate for SPM applications because age is a major risk factor for this heterogeneous complex trait. However, such applications are largely lacking. This paper starts filling this gap and applies SPM to data on onset of AD and longitudinal trajectories of body mass index (BMI) constructed from the Health and Retirement Study surveys and Medicare-linked data. We found that APOE e4 carriers are less robust to deviations of trajectories of BMI from the optimal levels compared to non-carriers. We also observed age-related decline in adaptive response (resilience) related to deviations of BMI from optimal levels as well as APOE- and age-dependence in other components related to variability of BMI around the mean allostatic values and accumulation of allostatic load. SPM applications thus allow revealing novel connections between age, genetic factors and longitudinal trajectories of risk factors in the context of AD and aging creating new opportunities for understanding AD development, forecasting trends in AD incidence and prevalence in populations, and studying disparities in those.

pmc1. Introduction

Stochastic component (or “chance”) is considered an important characteristic of the process of aging (Finch and Kirkwood, 2000). Aging is a primary risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Hou et al., 2019). There is literature suggesting that stochastic processes might be fundamental in the development of sporadic adult onset neurodegenerative disorders (Panegyres, 2022) and stochastic modelling is recognized as “a useful tool for increasing understanding of the processes underlying complex systems-affecting disorders such as AD” (Proctor et al., 2012). A range of publications applied stochastic models to tackle different aspects of the process of neurodegeneration and development of related diseases, e.g., simulation modelling of amyloid-beta turnover (Proctor et al., 2012), stochastic model of evolution of beta-amyloid and calcium (Zhang and Wang, 2020), stochastic models to estimate the expected time to reach different clinical disease states (Hadjichrysanthou et al., 2020), stochastic model to simulate the development and progression of AD (Hadjichrysanthou et al., 2018), models for transitions between cognitive states (Peters et al., 2010) and transitions in deficits accumulation (Mitnitski et al., 2006) that are known to be predictive of the risk of AD and dementia (Song et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the potential of applications of stochastic models in this research area is still not fully utilized, especially in the context of aging.

A significant body of literature on aging-related concepts and mechanisms such as decline in stress resistance (Strehler and Mildvan, 1960), adaptive capacity (Hall et al., 2000), and biological resilience (Ukraintseva et al., 2021), allostasis and allostatic load (McEwen and Wingfield, 2003), has already been accumulated. The stochastic process model (SPM) (Yashin et al., 2007a; Yashin et al., 2012a) was designed specifically in the context of research on aging and it incorporates several aging-related concepts and mechanisms that can be indirectly evaluated from longitudinal measurements of relevant variables analyzed jointly with time-to-event outcomes. This allows the study of the dynamics of explanatory variables of interest in relation to the ongoing process of aging, onset of disease, and death. Furthermore, the SPM can be used to evaluate the associations of genetic and non-genetic factors with aging-related characteristics embedded in this model. Such types of inference cannot be made using traditional regression analyses in the absence of specific relevant biomarkers related to such characteristics. This highlights an important advantage of the SPM in the context of research on aging (Arbeev et al., 2016; Yashin et al., 2016b).

AD is a complex heterogeneous trait associated with high personal and social costs (Alzheimer's Association, 2016). However, although its characteristics (e.g., age is its most important non-genetic risk factor; well-documented high-impact genetic risk factors; a wide range of known risk-related phenotypes) make it a prime candidate for use with the SPM, such applications are lacking. In this study, we begin to address this gap by using genetic and phenotypic data (including morbidity-related traits derived from Medicare administrative claims) from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to: 1) determine whether the longitudinal dynamics of a selected risk-related variable is informative for building predictive models of AD onset; and 2) identify how known relationships between genetic risk factors and AD onset can be decomposed into associations with aging-related characteristics (such as stress resistance and adaptive capacity) represented by the model’s components and evaluated indirectly from the data. The model was applied to the onset of a clinical diagnosis of probable/possible AD and the longitudinal measurements of body mass index (BMI) – a biomarker for which age trajectories were shown to be related with aging traits, mortality (Arbeev et al., 2011; Yashin et al., 2012b) and AD risk among older adults (Kang et al., 2021), and for which there is evidence that it partially mediates the association of the known genetic risk factor (APOE polymorphism) with AD (Loika et al., 2022).

2. Material and methods

2.1 Data

This analysis used survey data drawn from the HRS as well as linked genetic information, and Medicare administrative claims data available for a subset of survey respondents. The HRS is an ongoing national longitudinal dataset that has been fielded every other year since 1992. It collects data on a battery of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics as well as health status and a number of behavioral factors. Originally, the HRS surveyed individuals aged 51-61 and their spouses/partners of any age. In 1998, the Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest-Old (AHEAD) study was combined with the HRS. The AHEAD is an overlapping survey of individuals age 70+ that was conducted in 1993 and 1995. Once an HRS respondent becomes Medicare eligible (age 65 for the majority of the population) and provides permission, Medicare administrative claims records for that individual can be linked to HRS questionnaire data. The HRS Medicare data provide information on medical services paid for by either Medicare Part A (facility-based services, e.g., hospitals) or Medicare Part B (professional services, e.g., physician practices), as well as demographic and enrollment information for the beneficiaries.

In this paper, we used Medicare data for the 1991-2015 period which correspond to waves 1 (1992) to 12 (2014) of the survey. The 2015 end point was chosen as this is the last year for which Medicare-linked data were available at the time of computations for this paper. From these data, onset dates for AD, our primary outcome, was constructed using previously validated algorithms (Akushevich et al., 2012; Akushevich et al., 2018) based on the presence/absence of disease-specific International Classification of Disease (ICD-9) codes (331.0 for AD). From this information, we constructed indicators of disease presence at time points aligned with each respective HRS wave. Since there is no cure for AD, we fixed the age of AD onset at the earliest date of the first two distinct claims with a primary or secondary diagnosis of AD within 730 days of each other (Thunell et al., 2019).

We used BMI as the longitudinal outcome in SPM. This information as well as other necessary variables such as sex and age were derived from the HRS questionnaires. For SPM analyses, observed values of BMI were transformed using the Box-Cox transformation and standardized (to have a zero mean and a unit variance).

The analyses also involved information on APOE polymorphism (carriers and non-carriers of the e4 allele). The APOE e4 allele carrier status was determined from the respective variants (rs7412, rs429358) which are available in the imputed HRS genetic data provided by the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP; dbGaP Study Accession: phs000428.v2.p2).

The analytic file used in SPM computations included genotyped white HRS participants for whom we have Medicare data to determine onset of AD. Individuals with AD onset preceding age at first measurement of the longitudinal variable (BMI) were dropped. The analyzed sample contained 6,834 genotyped participants with at least one observation of BMI. Altogether, the analyzed sample contained 308 incident AD cases and 37,302 observations of BMI. Table 1 presents characteristics of the sample used in the applications of the SPM to the onset of AD in the HRS. Supplementary Figures S1-S2 show distributions of the number of observations of BMI per individual (illustrating that we have sufficient time series for running SPM) and distribution of BMI in the analyzed sample.

2.2 SPM: Specifications, main concepts in the context of aging and AD

In our applications, we used the discrete-time implementation of a one-dimensional SPM with time-dependent components (Yashin et al., 2007a) as outlined in Yashin et al. (2007b). A non-technical description of the model and its components was presented in the review paper (Arbeev et al., 2016). Here we briefly outline technical details of the model and describe the model components in the context of aging and AD. Details on the estimation procedure are given in Supplementary Material.

The SPM consists of two equations (Yashin et al., 2012a). The first represents the dynamics of a repeatedly measured variable (Y(t, c), where t is age and c denotes covariate(s)) as the stochastic process with the following equation: (1) dY(t,c)=a(t,c)(Y(t,c)−f1(t,c))dt+b(t,c)dW(t),

with initial condition Y(t0, c). In our applications, this equation models age trajectories of BMI. Note that trajectories of Y and values of t0 are individual-specific but we omitted the respective indices in the formulas for brevity of notation. Note also that we reserve the term “variable” to denote the longitudinally measured quantities modelled by Y (i.e., BMI) and the term “covariate” to represent the risk factors (denoted by “c” in the formulas) that can affect dynamics of the longitudinal variables Y and risks of events (AD onset) through respective model’s components. This equation (1) represents several concepts relevant in the context of aging:

Stochasticity. The stochastic (Wiener) process W(t) (assumed to be independent of Y(t0, c)) defines random paths of the variable Y(t, c) and it accounts for the stochastic component of aging (or chance) in the model; b(t, c) is the diffusion coefficient which controls the variability of the process Y(t, c) (which can change with age t and depend on covariates c).

Homeostatic regulation. The specific mean-reverting property of the stochastic process used in the SPM (which means that, as time passes, the process drifts towards its state of equilibrium or its long-term mean) allows embedding homeostatic regulation in the structure of the model which is essential for modelling living organisms.

Allostasis and allostatic state. The structure of the SPM includes the mean allostatic state that features the effect of allostatic adaptation. As postulated by the theory of allostasis (McEwen and Wingfield, 2003), this is the state of an organism which is forced by regulatory systems functioning at non-optimal (i.e., reduced or elevated) levels. This is the long-term mean of the stochastic process, f1(t, c). This state can change with age (t) and can have different levels depending on the values of covariates c.

Adaptive response (adaptive capacity). This equation has the negative feedback coefficient (a(t, c)) which also has interpretation relevant to aging. This coefficient regulates how fast the trajectory of the stochastic process Y(t, c) returns to the mean f1(t, c) if it deviates from it. This models the rate of the organism’s adaptive response to stressors or any other factors causing the trajectories of the process to deviate from this equilibrium state f1(t, c). The rate of adaptive response can change with age (t) and be affected by various covariates (c).

The second equation in the SPM gives the expression of the hazard rate (i.e., onset of AD in our application) as a function of age (t), the vector of covariates (c) and the value of the stochastic process Y(t, c): (2) μ(t,c,Y(t,c))=μ0(t,c)+Q(t,c)(Y(t,c)−f0(t,c))2,

which embeds other concepts relevant in the context of aging:

5) Quadratic hazard. Although it is usually not a subject for discussion and the multiplicative form of the hazard is taken for granted due to the common use of the Cox regression model, specification of the shape of the hazard rate as a function of risk factors is an important consideration for analyses because it affects conclusions and interpretations. The SPM adopts the quadratic form of the hazard (as a function of the dynamic variable modelled by the process Y(t, c)), which is grounded on numerous epidemiological observations that the hazard rate as a function of various risk factors has a U- or J-shape (see, e.g., van Uffelen et al., 2010).

6) Physiological or biological norms. The quadratic hazard used in the SPM also has a natural interpretation that deviations (to smaller or larger values) from the optimal values of the process result in an increased hazard rate (e.g., an increased risk of onset of AD in our applications). This introduces the notion of physiological or biological norms, that is, the values of the process corresponding to the minimal hazard rate at a given age (t) and for a given values of covariates (c), as represented by a function f0(t, c).

7) Stress resistance. Specification of the quadratic shape of the hazard in the SPM allows characterization of the robustness component of stress resistance. The width of a U- (or a J-) shape of the hazard is regulated by the multiplier Q(t, c) in the quadratic part of the hazard. If the values of this multiplier increase (with age t or for values of covariates c) then, respectively, the U-shape narrows, which means that an organism becomes more vulnerable (or less robust) to deviations of the respective risk factor (modelled by the process Y(t, c)) from the optimal values f0(t, c). That is, for a narrower U-shape, the same deviation from values f0(t, c) leads to a larger increase in the risk of the event (e.g., onset of AD).

In theory, any relevant functional form for the model parameters can be used in eqs. (1)-(2). For practical implementations in this study, we used the following simple (yet flexible) parameterizations (here c is APOE e4 carrier status): a(t, c) = aY + bY(t − tmin) + βYc, where aY &lt; 0, bY ≥ 0 and tmin = 65 (age of Medicare eligibility); b(t, c) = σ1; ln μ0(t, c) = ln aμ0 + bμ0(t − tmin) + βμ0 c; Q(t, c) = aQ + bQt + βQc; and Y(t0,c)∼N(f1(t0,c),σ02). To reduce the number of estimated parameters and the number of models evaluated in the model selection procedure (see below), we fitted the coefficients for the mean allostatic trajectories f1(t, c) = af1 + bf1(t − tmin) using age-specific average values of BMI in female and male carriers and non-carriers of APOE e4 allele (see Supplementary Figure S3). In an attempt to make the analyses more feasible and further reduce the number of evaluated models, we tested whether the optimal values f0(t, c) depend on c fitting the unrestricted (depending on c) and restricted (independent of c) models and using the likelihood ratio test. It turned out that the data did not support dependence of f0(t, c) on c (p-values: p = 0.15 for females and p = 1 for males) so that we used f0(t, c) = f0(t) = af0 + bf0(t − tmin) in subsequent analyses. Note also that the diffusion component b(t, c) is assumed age-independent in the models because our simulation studies revealed that the accuracy of parameter estimates was not sufficiently good in the model with age-dependent diffusion coefficients. All analyses were done separately for females and males because earlier studies (Arbeev et al., 2011; Yashin et al., 2006) revealed that BMI trajectories have different shapes in females and males so that combined analyses of females and males or using sex as a covariate could be problematic.

We used the following specifications of the models in the model selection procedure:

SPM0: all components do not depend on c;

SPM1: μ0(t, c) depends on c, all other components do not depend on c;

SPM2: Q(t, c) depends on c, all other components do not depend on c;

SPM3: a(t, c) depends on c, all other components do not depend on c;

SPM4: b(t, c) depends on c, all other components do not depend on c;

SPM5: μ0(t, c) and Q(t, c) depend on c, all other components do not depend on c;

SPM6: μ0(t, c) and a(t, c) depend on c, all other components do not depend on c;

SPM7: Q(t, c) and a(t, c) depend on c, all other components do not depend on c;

SPM8: μ0(t, c), Q(t, c) and a(t, c) depend on c, all other components do not depend on c;

SPM9: μ0(t, c), Q(t, c), a(t, c) and b(t, c) depend on c, all other components do not depend on c.

We fitted the models SPM0-SPM9 to data on trajectories of BMI and onset of AD separately in females and males and computed the Akaike Information Criterion (Akaike, 1974) for model selection. Analyses involving SPM were performed using in-house Matlab codes (ran in Matlab version R2022a).

2.3 Sensitivity analyses

We must acknowledge that our applications of SPM in this work share common pitfalls of modelling the onset of AD and, more broadly, analyses of Medicare data. Previous applications of this model involved better validated outcomes such as mortality or other diseases that are measured with much less uncertainty compared to the onset of AD. There could be multiple problems with this outcome which are inherent to the disease itself and the data source. AD may confound multiple pathologies and it can be hard to definitively diagnose clinically and distinguish from other dementias. Development of AD is a gradual process and clinical manifestations appear slowly so that the exact moment of onset is difficult to determine. There could be various factors (e.g., education level, geographical and socio-demographic disparities, comorbidities, etc.) which may systematically affect diagnosis and the age at onset determination.

Although it’s not possible to address all these challenges in the paper, it is important to conduct sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of findings to different aspects related to construction of the outcome. First, administrative records are not corrected retrospectively. Therefore, a tentative or incorrect diagnosis (especially relevant to the case of AD vis-à-vis, say, a broken hip) is possible. To address this issue, we required a second distinct (i.e., not a part of the original episode of care) confirmatory diagnosis within 730 days (2 years) of each other, as indicated in section 2.1. In sensitivity analyses, we also tried using 365 days of verification and no verification (identifies the maximum possible number of people with a clinical AD diagnosis, but also with a potentially larger number of false positives). We denote those analyses sens la and senslb, respectively, throughout the text. Second, the code for AD is not used consistently over the study time period. Furthermore, other dementias can coexist with and conceal AD symptoms. To address this issue, we re-estimated our results using a wider range of ICD-9 codes rather than limiting the analysis to AD only. These included the codes from Table 1 in Matthews et al. (2019) which they used to define Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (331.0, 331.11, 331.19, 331.2, 331.7, 797, 290.0, 290.10, 290.11, 290.12, 290.13, 290.20, 290.21, 290.3, 290.40, 290.41, 290.42, 290.43, 294.0, 294.10, 294.11, 294.2, 294.21, 294.8) and the same codes excluding the AD code (331.0). Respective sensitivity analyses are denoted sens2a and sens2b in the text below.

3. Results

Table 2 presents results of comparison of models SPM0-SPM9 fitted to female and male data. As it shows, the model SPM9 has the best fit among all models for both females and males. Figures 1-2 display estimates of the model’s components for carriers and non-carriers of the APOE e4 allele in females and males, respectively. They illustrate how the overall relationships between age, the genetic risk factor (APOE), and the longitudinal observations of BMI with onset of AD are decomposed into several aging-related characteristics represented by the model’s components described in section 2.2, as discussed in more detail below. Supplementary Figure S4 shows empirical (Kaplan-Meier) estimates of survival curves for female and male carriers and non-carriers of the APOE e4 allele along with the modelled curves evaluated at BMI values equal to the mean allostatic trajectories f1(t, c). Supplementary Table S1 contains estimates of parameters in models SPM0-SPM9. Results of sensitivity analyses (see section 2.3) are shown in Supplementary Tables S2-S3. As they show, the model SPM9 had the best fit in all sensitivity analyses (Table S2). As seen from the parameter estimates in Table S3, sensitivity analyses revealed that the main results are mostly not sensitive to changes in the variable construction algorithm and disease definition (some exceptions are described below).

3.1 APOE in relation to increase in the baseline risk of AD onset

As positive values of the coefficient βμ0 for the APOE variable in the baseline hazard μ0(t, c) indicate (Table S1), the baseline hazard for carriers of the APOE e4 allele is higher than that for non-carriers of this allele. Figures 1a and 2a visualize age trajectories of baseline hazards for carriers and non-carriers of the APOE e4 allele in females and males respectively. These observations are confirmed in sensitivity analyses (Table S3).

We note that the observed changes in the baseline hazard (from the perspective of the risk remaining after considering the longitudinal variable, i.e., BMI) due to the APOE e4 allele carrier status propagate to the overall risk of AD onset in a complex way. This is because the SPM involves the quadratic term in the hazard plus the equation for the longitudinal trajectories of BMI so that the resulting influence of APOE on the overall risk of AD onset depends on the dynamic interplay between different components of SPM discussed below.

3.2 APOE in the context of stress resistance

As positive values of the coefficient βQ in the quadratic hazard term (Q(t,c), interpreted in the context of stress resistance, see section 2.2) indicate (Table S1), the U-shape of the hazard (as the function of the dynamic variable, i.e., BMI here) for carriers of the APOE e4 allele is narrower than that for non-carriers of this allele. See also Figures 1b and 2b which show respective age trajectories of Q(t, c) for carriers and non-carriers of the APOE e4 allele. This results holds in all sensitivity analyses except sens2b where the coefficient βQ becomes slightly negative. This indicates that the relation between BMI trajectories and the outcome may be different in this respect for other dementias (to remind, in sens2b, the definition of the outcome excludes the ICD-9 code for AD).

Figures 1b and 2b also reveal differences in age patterns of Q(t, c) between females and males (e.g., larger values for male APOE e4 carriers vs. female carriers, a faster increase with age in males vs. females) which can formally be assessed for significance in future implementations of SPM (see section 4.5). Also increasing age patterns of Q(t, c) observed in all cases correspond to narrowing U-shapes of the risk (as a function of BMI) with age which translates into a larger increase in the risk of AD due to deviations from optimal BMI at older ages compared to the same deviation at younger ages. Future analyses can explore interactions between age and different factors (genetic and non-genetic) to get a more comprehensive picture of changes in U-shapes of the risk with age (see section 4.5).

3.3 APOE in relation to adaptive capacity, variability, and other SPM components

The coefficient βY in the adaptive capacity component (i.e., the negative feedback coefficient a(t, c)) is positive but very small (Table S1) so that the trajectories of that component differ very little between carriers and non-carriers of the APOE e4 allele (Figures 1c and 2c). This observation is confirmed in all sensitivity analyses except males in sens2a (Table S3). In that case (which corresponds to a broader definition of the outcome), the respective coefficient became negative.

Note that the parameter bY is consistently positive in the main and sensitivity analyses (Tables S1, S3). This corresponds to the age-related decline in the adaptive capacity in the context of BMI and AD risk. Figures 1c and 2c illustrate this finding showing age trajectories of the absolute value of a(t, c). Such a decline was earlier observed in applications of SPM to BMI and onset of unhealthy life (which does not include AD) (Arbeev et al., 2011) as well as in applications to APOE, cholesterol and mortality (Arbeev et al., 2012; Yashin et al., 2016a).

The coefficient βW in the diffusion component b(t, c) is positive in both main and sensitivity analyses (Tables S1, S3). As Figures 1d and 2d show, the APOE e4 carriers have substantially higher variability of BMI around the mean allostatic levels (f1(t, c)) which are shown on Figures 1e and 2e (also see Supplementary Figure S3). There is also a gap between the mean allostatic and optimal levels which widens with age resulting in an increasing AL (Figures 1f and 2f) contributing to the increase in the AD risk with age. Further studies can help elucidate factors related to such an increase (see section 4.5).

4. Discussion

4.1 Disentangling relationship between the development of AD and longitudinal trajectories of risk factors into aging-related characteristics

In this study, we applied the SPM to data on the onset of AD and longitudinal observations of BMI in a sample of genotyped Medicare beneficiaries from the HRS to explore how biodemographic models of health and aging can be used to provide new perspectives for research on aging-related diseases such as AD. This paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first one in the literature on SPM which applied this model to onset of AD using such data. This model was originally developed for applications to aging research. Age is a well-known risk factor for AD, and both aging and AD are heterogeneous complex traits, so that various pathways can contribute to each trait and some of those can be shared. Therefore, common aging-related characteristics entrenched in the structure of SPM can simultaneously represent relevant mechanisms that can be related to the risk of development of AD, so that such models can provide the analytic framework for understanding AD in the context of aging. SPM disentangles the relationship between the development of AD and longitudinal trajectories of risk factors into several aging-related characteristics, which are estimated indirectly from the data using this model. Note that these characteristics cannot be evaluated directly using traditional approaches (e.g., Cox regression or joint models) due to the lack of specific relevant biomarkers in many human longitudinal studies.

4.2 Robustness component of stress resistance in the context of AD

We found (see section 3.2) that the component of the SPM associated with the robustness component of stress resistance (which characterizes vulnerability to increases in the risk of AD due to deviations of risk factors from their optimal levels, see section 2.2) differs in carriers and non-carriers of the APOE e4 in both females and males. We observed that APOE e4 carriers are less robust to deviations of trajectories of BMI from the optimal levels compared to non-carriers of that allele. This confirms earlier observations on the overall defectiveness of APOE4 in its response to stressors as discussed in the literature (Dose et al., 2016). The observations on sex differences in age-patterns of the term in the quadratic hazard add to the literature on sex differences in the architecture of AD risks (Dumitrescu et al., 2019). Multiple factors can contribute to the observed sex disparity in AD ranging from purely biological factors (Koran et al., 2017; Snyder et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2021) to sex differences in impact of lifestyle factors on cognitive decline with age (Fallah et al., 2009). Our results warrant further research on possible reasons of such sex-specific relations with resistance to stresses. There is extensive literature on connections between stresses and AD development (see, e.g., recent reviews in Bisht et al., 2018; Canet et al., 2019; Caruso et al., 2018; Escher et al., 2019; Lyons and Bartolomucci, 2020). Our findings are thus in line with this literature and present additional evidence on the role that resistance to stresses can play in the development of AD. We note that SPM provides a different perspective about the relationship between the genetic and other factors and stress resistance in the context of AD, compared with traditional regression models, due to the way this is implemented in the model. Therefore, its application can potentially reveal novel signals which are missed in the traditional analyses, and this can be a promising direction for research, in addition to investigating genetic interactions between relevant genes (Yashin et al., 2021).

4.3 Decline in adaptive capacity (resilience) in the context of AD

The rate of adaptive response of the organism to stressful events leading to deviations of the trajectories of the variables from their optimal levels (which is represented in the SPM structure) can be associated with the biological resilience of the whole organism. This type of resilience can be measured in different ways (Arbeev et al., 2019; Colón-Emeric et al., 2020; Whitson et al., 2016) and the decline in biological resilience can be considered as a key manifestation of aging (Ukraintseva et al., 2021). This study confirmed (see section 3.3) earlier observations of age-related decline in adaptive capacity in both females and males. The model provides a tool to search for genetic and non-genetic determinants of the rate of adaptive response or biological resilience in applications to longitudinal observations of different relevant variables. Inclusion of relevant socio-economic indicators or other variables in specification of respective SPM components presents an approach for studying the relationship of these factors with robustness and resilience as determined from the estimates of respective components in the model. Although all such analyses are beyond the scope of this paper, our earlier research (Arbeev et al., 2019) provides an example of analysis of robustness and resilience in the framework of SPM. The approach presented in that paper is based on the novel measure of physiological dysregulation, which is shown to be a useful preclinical indicator of diseases. This methodology can also be explored in applications to data on onset of AD as a potential tool for determining preclinical risk profiles for future development of AD.

4.4 Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we used simple functional representations of SPM components (e.g., linear functions of age and covariates). More advanced specifications such as non-linear components, non-symmetric U-shapes of the risk function, and interaction terms (e.g., covariates by age) can provide more detailed perspectives on the analyzed relationships. Second, the codes used in these analyses implement only one additional covariate (e.g., a genetic risk factor) in specifications of the SPM components because of technical limitations with tractability of constraints in the optimization algorithm. Even though stratified analyses (e.g., by sex as we did in this application) is the way to circumvent this limitation, further extensions which would allow using multiple covariates can be helpful for applications to small datasets with limited sample sizes. Third, we used a one-dimensional SPM analyzing one longitudinal variable (BMI) in the model. Multi-dimensional models that simultaneously take into account dynamics of several longitudinal variables in their relation to the risk of disease onset can help reveal additional relationships between the variables that are hidden in such one-dimensional analyses.

There are also several challenges related to the outcome (AD) and the data source (Medicare data) which we outlined in section 2.3. Even though our sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of most of our findings to particular aspects of the computational procedures, there are still many other aspects that can play essential roles and affect the results (such as geographical and other disparities in diagnoses of AD) which we are extensively investigating in our ongoing research projects.

4.5 Further perspectives

The SPM modification introduced in Yashin et al. (2012a) and used in this study allows for including covariates in specifications of the model’s components. This creates extensive opportunities for investigating how different risk factors can alter respective aging-related characteristics and through this affect the risk of development of AD in individuals having different levels or values of the factors. For example, one can use socio-demographic indicators to study disparities in aging and health (including AD), or use environmental, behavioral and other lifestyle variables to study how they can accelerate/postpone aging changes in relation to the risk of AD, or use various genetic markers to search for genetic underpinnings of links between AD and aging. Our analyses reported in this paper provide examples of such applications of SPM to the research on AD as discussed above. One potentially very important extension of the approach could be implementation of interaction terms (both genetic and non-genetic) and analyses of several risk factors simultaneously. Such models would allow addressing a broader set of research questions than we touched in this work, e.g., whether age-related changes in U-shapes of the risk differ by sex, whether genetic factors affect the rate of change in adaptive capacity with age, or about the factors influencing the rate of accumulation of AL with age, in their relations to the risk of AD.

Dynamic models like SPM can be applied to estimate time trends (by calendar years or birth cohorts) in relevant time-varying characteristics in relation to the disease onset (e.g., AD as in these applications). Therefore, such models can be used for forecasting future trends in incidence and prevalence of diseases (such as AD) that can take into account dynamic relationships between trajectories of relevant repeatedly measured characteristics and the risk of the disease. Applications of SPM to age at onset of AD and longitudinal measurements of BMI in a sample from HRS linked to Medicare service use files revealed that the longitudinal dynamics of the respective outcome is important to consider in relation to the observed patterns of the incidence of AD in the HRS sample. We found that age and genetic factors such as APOE4 play important roles in shaping the dynamics of the longitudinal outcome and its relationship to the risk of onset of AD (through their impact on the model’s components as discussed above) and that this can differ in females and males. Therefore, all these factors need to be included in analyses of trends in incidence and prevalence of AD using the models that can jointly analyze longitudinal dynamics of the variables and the time-to-event outcome such as the SPM used in this paper. Application of such models to forecasting future trends and comparison with existing forecasting approaches is a subject of our ongoing research.
