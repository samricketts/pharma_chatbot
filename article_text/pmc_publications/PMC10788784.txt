Recent findings ranging from genetics to structural biology, together with studies in human neurons, animal models and patient brains, implicate the retromer-dependent endosomal recycling pathway as both causal and common in Alzheimer’s disease.


pmcIdentifying causative genes, even if rare, is useful in understanding the temporal primacy of a biological pathway in complex disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, even genes that are generally acknowledged as ‘causal’ can have variable penetrance as well as pleiotropic effects. When attempting to validate a causal conclusion, it is therefore important to show that an implicated pathway can trigger and readily explain the integrative biology of a disease — that is, its interwoven molecular, cellular and anatomical biologies1.

The receptor encoded by the AD-associated gene SORL1 was originally linked to the retromer-trafficking complex in a gene expression study performed in vulnerable brain regions of patients with the common late-onset form of AD2. Because SORL1 (also known as SORLA) is a VPS10p domain-containing receptor, the finding was supported by previous yeast studies in which retromer was first discovered, and in which VPS10 and retromer are functionally associated2. Guided in part by this gene expression study, SORL1 was first genetically linked to AD in an association analysis3 that probed for genes encoding proteins of the retromer complex SORL1, and other VPS10p domain-containing receptors. Since then, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) studies have established that SORL1 is one of the top genes associated with the common late-onset form of AD4.

More important for mechanistic inference, SORL1 was added as the fourth causative gene to the ‘gold standard’ list of APP, PSEN1 and PSEN25. This highlights the importance of biological investigation, as model systems in which animals were genetically engineered to express these gene mutations provide functional support for causal conclusions. This logic is particularly apt for SORL1, for which not all loss-of-function variants have the same genetic effects. As reviewed here, however, when biologically investigated in model systems, they are shown, in the context of disrupting retromer-dependent endosomal recycling, to act as disease triggers.

Since first proposed2, many studies have shown that SORL1 interacts with the multiprotein assembly retromer, the heterotrimeric core of which is composed of VPS26–VPS35–VPS29. Here we review recent insight that clarifies the molecular biology of this interaction, which immediately assigns SORL1 a more fundamental role in retromer-dependent endosomal recycling. We show that loss of this SORL1 function can explain the cellular and anatomical bases of AD.

SORL1–VPS26 and endosomal recycling tubules

Retromer regulates two retrieval pathways out of endosomes — the recycling pathway that transports cargo back to the cell surface, and the retrograde pathway that transports cargo back to the trans-Golgi network (Fig. 1, middle). Compared with other membrane-trafficking pathways, retromer-dependent pathways are distinct in relying on elongated tubules for cargo transport. These tubules are unstable and highly dynamic, which helps explain a reformulation of retromer’s function. It is now known that the retromer heterotrimer is not just a ‘cargo recognition complex’, as originally thought. Instead, because the core dimerizes to form arches above tubular membranes, and then polymerizes around the tubule6, retromer also coats the cytosolic surface of tubules, thereby probably functioning in their formation and stabilization (Fig. 1, left)

In a related manner, structural biology studies have expanded the role of SORL1 in retromer-dependent trafficking7. SORL1 is a type I integral membrane protein that is primarily located inside endosomal tubules, and its small cytosolic domain interacts with VPS26 at the base of the retromer arches (Fig. 1, left). The intratubular domains of SORL1 in cortical neurons interact with endosomal cargo, including amyloid precursor protein (APP) and glutamate receptors8. SORL1 was originally thought to be an intermediary that connects the cargo recognition core of retromer to its endosomal cargo2. Although this role in endosomal trafficking still holds, a recent study showed that SORL1 dimerizes in endosomes and that, by binding retromer arches, dimerized SORL1 stabilizes retromer and increases its recycling function. The study identified two self-association sites that were predicted by a model of its intratubular domain to be oriented in such a way that suggests how SORL1 dimers may polymerize and decorate the inner surface of endosomal tubules7 (Fig. 1, left).

Together, a structural–functional picture emerges in which polymerized dimeric retromer arches function as a coat at the external surface of tubules, and SORL1 functions at their inner surface to brace and stabilize the coat. The binding of SORL1 to VPS26 through the tubular membrane is proposed to be the crux of an endosomal tubule scaffold required for tubular formation and stabilization, and therefore fundamental to the overall trafficking function of retromer.

Retromer-dependent endosomal recycling and AD cell biology

Cortical neurons heavily depend on their endosomal recycling pathway for synaptic and neuronal health. This might help explain why studies have shown that cortical neurons are endowed with two distinct retromer trimers organized around the two VPS26 paralogues — the ubiquitously expressed VPS26a and the neuronal enriched VPS26b9. In neurons, VPS26b retromer is differentially dedicated to the retromer recycling pathway, whereas VPS26a retromer is dedicated more to the retromer retrograde pathway. SORL1 is highly expressed in neurons10 where it interacts with VPS26b9 and differentially contributes to the endosomal recycling pathway8. SORL1–VPS26b can thus be considered a fundamental functional unit that regulates a specific retromer-dependent endosomal recycling pathway in cortical neurons (Fig. 1, middle).

If SORL1–VPS26b is the crux of a scaffold that is crucial for this specific retromer-dependent endosomal recycling pathway, then depletion of SORL1 or VPS26b, but not VPS26a, is predicted to phenocopy each other. Relying primarily on VPS35 depletion, which causes a deficiency in both VPS26b retromer and VPS26a retromer, previous studies have linked retromer dysfunction to the early stages of AD neuronal pathologies. VPS35 depletion leads to synaptic loss by impairing the recycling of glutamate receptors, representing an early stage of the AD neurodegenerative pathology, and impairs the recycling of APP, which leads to accelerated amyloid-β secretion and represents an early step of the AD amyloid pathology. VPS35 depletion also accelerates tau misprocessing inside neurons and results in accelerated tau secretion11, both representing early steps in the AD tau pathology. Although tau is a cytosolic protein, it is also observed within the endolysosomal system, gaining access to it either by microautophagy or via ESCRT12.

Recent studies in animal models9, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons8 and rodent neurons9 have shown that depleting SORL1 or VPS26b, but not VPS26a, largely phenocopy each other across AD-associated neuronal pathologies (Fig. 1, middle).

Molecular and morphological alterations in microglia can be considered the fourth cellular hallmark of AD, and microglia have been shown to act as risk modifiers of the disease. These alterations might be triggered by factors released by dysfunctional neurons in AD, including amyloid-β or tau, which can be secreted from the endolysosomal system (Fig. 1, middle). Retromer can regulate endolysosomal secretion13, which might explain how the abnormal secretion induced by knocking out neuronal Vps35 in mice11 triggers AD-associated morphological alterations in neighbouring microglia10. Future studies are required to confirm these findings when SORL1 or VPS26b is specifically depleted, but it is plausible that once microglia are affected, they crosstalk with neurons, worsening neuronal dysfunction and accelerating the neurodegenerative process (Fig. 1, middle).

Retromer-dependent endosomal recycling and AD anatomy

Superficial neurons of the trans-entorhinal cortex, the gateway to hippocampal formation, represent a class of cortical neurons that are vulnerable to AD. Although their vulnerability has been known for decades, the anatomical biology that can explain it has remained one of the field’s most vexing questions.

A unique property of this class of neurons is that they act as a central hub of incoming cortical stimulation (Fig. 1) and receive dense synaptic input from across the cortex14. As endosomal recycling is vital for synaptic health upon stimulation-induced endocytosis of glutamate receptors, this unique network property has led to a hypothesis that these neurons may differentially depend on endosomal recycling15. This has been validated in a study that compared VPS26b-depleted and VPS26a-depleted mice9. Only VPS26b depletion led to profound synaptic dysfunction mediated by glutamate receptor loss, precisely in the superficial neurons of the trans-entorhinal cortex, and dysfunction was rescued after VPS26b repletion with viral vectors. Furthermore, VPS26b depletion led to a reduction in SORL1 (Fig. 1, right).

Extending this conclusion to people9, VPS26b was found enriched in neurons of the trans-entorhinal cortex in healthy brains, supporting the model that this region is differentially engaged in high rates of recycling. Furthermore, in the brains of patients with AD, the trans-entorhinal cortex shows a reduction in both VPS26b and SORL1, but not VPS26a (Fig. 1, right).

Collectively, these findings support the conclusion that the recycling pathway regulated by SORL1–VPS26b is disrupted in some of the most vulnerable neurons in AD, which may mechanistically explain the anatomical biology of neurodegeneration (Fig. 1, right).

Retromer-dependent endosomal recycling and other AD causal genes

Genetic investigations into the rare early-onset form of AD have isolated APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 as three causal genes. Mutations in these genes accelerate amyloidogenic processing — a biochemical pathway defined by the sequential enzymatic steps that liberate amyloid-β peptides from APP.

As APP is a transmembrane protein, this biochemical pathway occurs in neuronal membranes. Amyloidogenic processing was originally thought to occur at the plasma membrane at the surface of neurons. This has turned out to be wrong, with the pathway occurring predominately at the membranes of neuronal endosomes, after APP is endocytosed2. Amyloid-β and other APP fragments first accumulate within the lumen of endosomes16, and it is from the endosomal compartment that amyloid-β is secreted (Fig. 1, middle).

Whether from the cell surface of the neuron or from intraneuronal endosomes, this reformulation does not change the fact that, once amyloid-β is secreted, it will ultimately lead to the formation of amyloid plaques in the extracellular space. Nonetheless, a correct view of the cell biology of amyloidogenesis, placing it inside neurons and specifically in neuronal endosomes, is pathogenically clarifying. According to the original misconception, nearly all the pathway’s increased production of amyloid-β would end up outside of neurons. The corrected view, placing the amyloidogenic pathway internally at endosomal membranes, explains why amyloid-β peptides accumulate inside neuronal endosomes before they are secreted. Unsurprisingly, the accumulation of amyloid-β and other APP-derived peptides inside neurons poisons the endosome and causes widespread neuronal dysfunction. These toxic species cause defects such as endosomal swelling17, a ‘traffic jam’ phenotype that is an early hallmark of AD, and loss of cell-surface glutamate receptors18.

What is particularly interesting is how the two causal pathways, amyloidogenesis and endosomal recycling, can interact inside neurons to create a vicious cycle. By disrupting the recycling pathway, a loss of either VPS26b or SORL1 increases the resident time of APP at endosomal membranes, thereby accelerating the amyloidogenic pathway8,9. This feedforward loop can be closed because studies are beginning to show that products of the amyloidogenic pathway will secondarily cause retromer deficiency accelerating recycling disruptions as evidenced by a decrease in glutamate receptors18.

Summary

After decades of accumulative observations, evidence generated in the past couple of years and spanning many biological levels has reached a tipping point, indicating that the retromer-dependent endosomal recycling pathway has a causal role in AD pathogenesis.

Besides its causality, the studies support the conclusion that this recycling pathway is commonly impaired in AD. It was in the late-onset common form of AD (historically called its ‘sporadic’ form) that retromer and SORL1 were first implicated in an unbiased molecular screen2, and it is in this form that the more recent studies established that SORL1–VPS26b is selectively deficient9. Genetically, SORL1 is a causal gene that is notable for being strongly linked to the late-onset, common form4. Although AD-associated mutations in VPS26b have not been found, a handful of other retromer-related genes have been linked to late-onset AD19. Interestingly, common co-morbid conditions, such as obesity and type II diabetes, increase the risk of late-onset AD, and studies in animal models have shown how these conditions can lead to retromer deficiency20. Finally, it is only with the availability of a newly developed cerebrospinal biomarker of retromer-dependent endosomal trafficking11 that it is possible to estimate the prevalence of retromer impairments more precisely. This biomarker was first developed based on a cerebrospinal proteomic screen in mouse models, finding that a co-elevation of secreted tau and APLP1 reliably reports on retromer dysfunction in cortical neurons. Although the precise prevalence awaits studies in larger samples, when the biomarker was applied to a small-scale cohort of patients with common late-onset AD, approximately 75% were found to be biomarker positive11.

All of the AD causal genes — APP, the PSEN genes, and now SORL1 — cause a similar endosomal traffic jam phenotype inside neurons17, and they also coax neurons to secrete intraneuronal amyloid-β into the extracellular space, where amyloid is ultimately deposited as plaques. Recent clinical trials have validated a long-held assumption that extracellular amyloid plaques are deleterious, showing that a near complete plaque clearance confers an approximately 30% slowing in cognitive decline21. Whether this represents the maximum effect of extracellular plaque clearance, or whether clearing them earlier and for longer periods will improve this relatively modest benefit, remains to be determined. Nevertheless, AD is a disease that begins inside neurons. As we seek to maximize the therapeutic benefits for patients and aspire to one day prevent the disease, it is plausible to conclude that interventions should move beyond what is found outside of neurons to targeting what first goes wrong inside of them.

Synaptic dysfunction is the proximal cause of the disease’s defining memory loss symptoms. Compared with neuronal death, the synaptic dysfunction stage of neurodegeneration is therapeutically more amenable. It is potentially even reversable, as shown in adult VPS26b-depleted mice, whose profound synaptic dysfunction and memory loss was remarkably rescued by normalizing VPS26b levels in adulthood9. Initiating treatments that can normalize the observed deficiencies of either VPS26b or SORL1, designed to correct the disruptions to intraneuronal pathways at early disease stages, may confer meaningful benefits to patients afflicted with one of the most dreaded and common disorders of the brain.

Fig. 1 | Retromer-dependent endosomal recycling and the integrative biology of AD.

Left, endosomal recycling tubules need molecular scaffolds for their formation and stabilization. Polymerized arches of retromer dimers coat the external surface of tubules, and multimers of SORL1 dimers decorate their internal surface. The cytosolic domain of SORL1 interacts with VPS26b at the base of the retromer arches, and functions to stabilize retromer and increase retromer-dependent endosomal recycling. The binding of SORL1 to VPS26b through the tubular membrane may represent the crux of an endosomal tubule scaffold in the service of tubular formation and stabilization, an aspect that is fundamental to retromer’s endosomal recycling function. Middle, reflecting their synaptic biology, neurons heavily depend on the endosomal recycling pathway for their health. Disrupting the pathway by depleting SORL1 or VPS26b triggers and can explain the hallmark cellular pathobiology of AD: for example, glutamate receptor loss and synaptic dysfunction; endosomal swelling; accelerated amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau processing and secretion. In addition, neuronal secretion from the endolysosomal system can provoke neighbouring microglia, which in turn can feed back onto neurons, accelerating the neurodegenerative process. Right, neurons in the trans-entorhinal cortex (indicated in red in the human and mouse brain) have distinct network properties, which may explain why they are found differentially reliant on retromer-dependent endosomal recycling. In the brains of patients with the common late-onset form of AD, VPS26b and SORL1 are found selectively co-deficient in these neurons, a finding phenocopied in Vps26b-knockout mice, which can anatomically explain why synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration begins in part in these neurons.
