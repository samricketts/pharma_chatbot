Anatomists have long expressed interest in neurons of the white matter, which is by definition supposed to be free of neurons. Hypotheses regarding their biochemical signature and physiological function are mainly derived from animal models. Here, we investigate fifteen whole-brain human postmortem specimens, including cognitively-normal cases and those with pathologic Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to investigate differences in neuronal size and density, and the relationship between neuronal processes and vasculature. Double-staining was used to evaluate co-localization of neurochemicals. Two topographically distinct populations of neurons emerged: one appearing to arise from developmental subplate neurons and the other embedded within deep, subcortical white matter. Both populations appeared to be neurochemically heterogeneous, showing positive reactivity to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) but not choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), neuronal nuclei (NeuN), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d), microtubule associated protein (MAP-2), somatostatin (SOM), non-phosphorylated neurofilament protein (SMI-32), and calcium-binding proteins calbindin-D28K, calretinin, and parvalbumin (PV). PV was more richly expressed in superficial as opposed to the deep white matter neurons; subplate neurons were also significantly larger than their deeper counterparts. NADPH-d, a surrogate for nitric oxide synthase, allowed for the striking morphological visualization of subcortical white matter neurons. NADPH-d-positive subcortical neurons tended to embrace the outer walls of microvessels, suggesting a functional role in vasodilation. The presence of AChE positivity in these neurons, but not ChAT, suggests that they are cholinoceptive but non-cholinergic. WMNs were also significantly smaller in AD compared to control cases. These observations provide a landscape for future systematic investigations.

pmcINTRODUCTION.

White matter neurons (WMNs) were first examined in 1867 by Theodor Meynert through accidental discovery (Meynert, 1867). Santiago Ramon y Cajal in 1900 studied the general morphology of what he originally called “interstitial” neurons using primarily Nissl and Golgi-stained specimens (Kostovic &amp; Rakic, 1980). A century later, modern-day anatomists continued to carry-out extensive and systematic analyses of neurons in white matter (Figure 1), which is by definition supposed to be free of neurons. Interest in these oddly placed neurons resulted in hypotheses regarding their developmental origin, biochemical signature, physiological function, and putative role in disease states, mainly derived from animal studies (Barbaresi et al., 2014; Mortazavi et al., 2017; Mortazavi et al., 2016; Rockland &amp; Nayyar, 2012; Suarez-Sola et al., 2009). As a result, two distinct and topographically separate populations in the human cortex have been proposed: one arising from what is speculated to be remnants of fetal subplate neurons, and the other from the subventricular/intermediate zones in the fetus—developing into subcortical neurons of the adult, embedded deep within central white matter (Judaš et al., 2010). We chose to use the terms “subplate” versus “subcortical deep” white matter neurons (WMNs) to uphold this important distinction. Although no definable boundary between “subplate” and “deep” white matter exists, several distinctive features have been ascribed to each class of WMNs. First, these classes differ in anatomic density; subplate WMNs are believed to exist in higher density, whereas fewer WMNs in the deep white matter have been described (Meyer et al., 1992). These classes also differ in appearance, where some report sublate WMNs as indistinguishable from layer VI cells of the cortex (Meyer et al., 1992), while deep subcortical WMNs show more heterogenous morphologies (Garcia-Marin et al., 2010).

The neurochemical signature of subplate WMNs has received more attention than that of deeper cells. Several groups classify subplate neurons as “interneurons,” further characterizing them according to their status as GABA-ergic or glutaminergic (Ascoli et al., 2008; Gonchar et al., 2007; Judaš et al.,2010; Meyer et al., 1992; Suarez-Sola et al.,2009). Populations of subplate neurons have been shown to express not only GABA and glutamate but also calbindin (CB), calretinin (CRT), reelin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), somatostatin (SOM), and nitric oxide (NO) synthase (Chun &amp; Shatz, 1989; Garcia-Marin et al., 2010; Judas et al., 1999; Kostovic &amp; Rakic, 1980; Kostović et al., 1991; Meyer et al., 1992). The expression patterns of these neurochemicals is poorly understood, where NPY and SOM have been reportedly expressed in differing levels due to age (Cebada-Sánchez et al., 2018) and disease state (Kowall &amp; Beal, 1988). The expression of NO synthase (NOS) is particularly intriguing given its role as a gaseous signaling molecule that acts as a potent vasodilator (Barbaresi et al., 2014; Estrada et al., 1993). Neuronal NOS is activated in nitrergic neurons through an influx of calcium ions and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) acts as a co-substrate, thus allowing these neurons to be visualized by NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry (Blottner et al., 1995). In the rat brain as well as in the macaque, intensely stained NADPH-d+ neurons were found within the corpus callosum, and some within the ependymal region of the lateral ventricle, where they may be in contact with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These observations led to the possibility that these neurons are a major source of NOS during neural activity, assisting blood vessel relaxation, and monitoring composition, pH, and osmolarity changes of nearby CSF (Barbaresi et al., 2014; Rockland &amp; Nayyar, 2012). In previous studies, we demonstrated that subcortical deep WMNs were neurochemically diverse and subpopulations exhibit reactivity to NADPH-d, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (Smiley et al., 1998) and non-phosphorylated neurofilament (SMI-32) (Bu et al., 2003). WMNs in human tissue that are AChE-rich have been labeled cholinoceptive due to the high colabeling percentage (~70%) of the muscarinic m-2 receptor, a post-synaptic component of the cholinergic pathway. These overlapping targets suggest cholinergic involvement in the release of NOS from WMNs (Smiley et al., 1998). It has also been shown that AChE-positive WMNs display a significant age-related decrease in neocortex by ~50% per region, prompting questions about their vulnerability to age-related neurodegenerative disease pathology, like Alzheimer’s Disease, which can occur, albeit in limited density and distribution, in cognitively unimpaired older adults (Balasubramanian et al., 2012; Bu et al., 2003).

The morphological, regional, and neurochemical signatures of white matter neurons, particularly those in the deep white matter, have not been comprehensively characterized in the adult human brain. Additionally, the possibility of co-localization of neurochemicals has not been explored in depth. In this study, we attempted to define these features with a focus on deep WMNs in 15 whole-hemisphere human postmortem specimens, ranging from age 27 to 92, stained for distinct markers of cortical neurons and analyzed with digital methods. Qualitative observations explored the relationship between the processes of these neurons and blood vessels of the white matter. We also examined a subset of cases with Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic change to determine if this cell population is vulnerable in the disease state.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.

Participant Characteristics and Demographic Information

Autopsied brains from 15 participants originally obtained from the Laboratory of M.-Marsel Mesulam, MD at Harvard University, with the exception of Cases 7-8 and 13-14 which were identified from the Northwestern University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) Brain Bank. Written informed consents were obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board and in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration (www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/). All cases received extensive postmortem neuropathologic analyses. Two groups of cases were included: cases with Alzheimer’s Disease neuropathologic change as the primary neuropathologic diagnosis (AD, N=5), and cases that were cognitively-normal (CN=9) based on extensive chart review. AD cases carried an antemortem clinical diagnosis of Dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (DAT), with the exception of one case that presented clinically with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), a language-based dementia syndrome (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011; Mesulam, 2003). All AD cases met criteria for Braak neurofibrillary tangle staging II or III (Braak &amp; Braak, 1995) and intermediate or high AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) according to the National Institute on Aging / Alzheimer’s Association guidelines (Montine et al., 2012). See Table 1 for case characteristics at the individual level.

Neuropathologic Evaluation and Tissue Preparation

Following autopsy, the cerebral hemispheres were separated in the midsagittal plane, cut into 3-4 cm coronal slabs, fixed in formalin for 2 weeks or 4% paraformaldehyde for 36 hours, taken through sucrose gradients (10%–40%) for cryoprotection, and stored in 40% sucrose with 0.02% sodium azide at 4°C. Pathologic diagnoses of AD participants were rendered using criteria set by Montine et al., (2012). AD brains contained secondary and/or tertiary pathologies that included for example periventricular leukomalacia (Case #4) and white matter infarction in the striatum (Case #14); in these cases, analyses were restricted to regions that appeared unaffected. For all cases, fixed frozen coronal slabs were cut into 40 μm-thick sections.

Histochemistry

Various histochemical and immunohistochemical stains were performed. Nissl staining was performed using 1.0 % cresyl violet (CV), and a neuronal marker was used to visualize cell bodies (NeuN, Millipore; MAB377; RRID: AB_2298772). Cholinergic function was assessed through choline acetyltransferase staining (ChAT, human polyclonal antibody) as well as acetylcholinesterase histochemistry (AChE) according to previous methods (Geula et al., 1998; Mesulam &amp; Geula, 1988). Calcium binding proteins (CBPs), parvalbumin (PV, mouse monoclonal; Swant 235; RRID; AB_10000343; 1/1000), calbindin (CB, mouse monoclonal; Swant 300; RRID: AB_10000347 1/1000), and calretinin (CRT, rabbit polyclonal; Swant 7697; RRID: AB_2721226; 1/1000) were also stained according to previously published methods (Geula et al., 1998; Lamerand et al., 2020). Non-phosphorylated neurofilament (SMI-32; Sternberger-Meyer Immunochemicals 801701) staining was performed according to methods from Mesulam and Geula, (1991). Microtubule associated protein (MAP-2) was stained using the Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibody (SC20172; RRID: AB_2250101) and somatostatin (SOM) was stained using methods described in (Selden et al., 1994). AD neuropathology was visualized with 1% Thioflavin-S (Thio-S) in addition to two phosphorylated tau markers (Alz-50; P. Davies Albert Einstein College of Medicine; New York; USA Cat# Alz50, RRID:AB_2313937) and (PHF-1) according to Mesulam et al., (Augustinack et al., 2002; Mesulam et al., 2004). NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) staining allowed visualization of neurons expressing nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the white matter according to methods from Geula et al., (1993). Extensive double-staining procedures were performed to determine the possibility of co-localization (e.g., SMI-AChE, NADPH-d-SOM, MAP-2-NADPH-d, etc.). Finally, in a novel approach, a subset of sections was stained immunohistochemically with an anti-human smooth muscle actin (αSMA; mouse monoclonal; Dako M0851; RRID: AB_2223500; 1/1000) to visualize vasculature in the white matter, and then double-stained with NADPH-d. See Table 1.

Digital Image Acquisition and Analysis

A total of 6 cases (AD N=3; Cases 10-12, and Control N=3; Cases 1,5, and 9) stained for NADPH-d were analyzed quantitatively for neuronal size and density. A single slide from a whole-hemisphere frontal, temporal, and occipital region from each case was scanned at 20X magnification using the Olympus V200 slide scanner system (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Whole slide images were uploaded into QuPath v.0.3.0, an open-source software used for Quantitative Pathology and Bioimage Analysis (Bankhead et al., 2017). First, the white matter region of each slide was annotated manually using the polygon tool and based on the junction between the white matter and cerebral gray matter. This area was then further divided into regions labeled “subplate” and “deep.” We adapted methods used by (Sedmak &amp; Judaš, 2021), where we defined subplate neurons as those found in the gyral/sulcal white matter, up to 2mm below the cortical gray matter; this distinct area has been shown to correspond to the fetal subplate compartment and eventual remnant throughout development. Neurons labeled as ‘deep’ were those found below the 2mm range. Each annotation layer was then analyzed using an artificial intelligence object classifier that was trained to detect NADPH-d positive neurons and ultimately calculate 1) soma size and 2) estimated density. Neuronal density was calculated by quantifying the number of WMNs detected in each annotation layer and dividing by total (subplate + deep) white matter area to compute a number with units of counts/mm2. Ancillary analyses measured the intensity of NADPH-d histochemical positivity, the frequency of morphological cell types, and number of processes between subplate and subcortical deep WMNs.

Statistical Analysis

Student t-tests were used to compare neuronal size in AD vs normal controls (between and within groups) and utilized in ancillary analyses described above. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare neuronal density in deep and superficial white matter across regions (frontal, temporal, and occipital). All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Significance level was set to p≤0.05.

RESULTS.

WMNs have a heterogenous histochemical signature

In accordance with prior work, two topographically distinct populations of neurons emerged in cognitively-normal cases: one between cortical layer VI and superficial white matter, the other in deep subcortical white matter. Both populations were neurochemically heterogeneous (see Table 1). Markers of these neurons included MAP-2, AChE, SOM, SMI-32, NADPH-d, PV, CB, and CRT, with varying patterns of overlap among these markers. PV staining was done only in Case #7, where it was found that PV-positive neurons were more frequent in superficial white matter compared to deep white matter (Figure 2 a–b). NADPH-d allowed morphological visualization of subcortical white matter neurons (see Figures 2g, 3, &amp; 6). Some of these neurons tended to extend processes in the direction of micro vessels, supporting the speculation of a functional role in vasodilation and regulation of blood flow. In Cases #1 &amp; 15, double-staining showed that very few NADPH-d-positive WMNs were also MAP-2-positive (&lt;1%) (Figure 2c–h). SOM-AChE double-staining (Case #1) revealed that roughly three-fourths of SOM-positive neurons are also AChE-positive. NADPH-d and SOM double-staining (Cases #2 &amp; #3) showed that nearly all observable SOM-positive neurons are also NADPH-d-positive. Positivity of AChE staining (Cases #1 and #5) and a lack of ChAT staining (Case #7) suggested that AChE-rich WMNs are cholinoceptive but non-cholinergic. In the subcortical deep white matter of Case #6, only ~10% of SMI-positive neurons were AChE-positive. Neurons immunopositive for calretinin (CRT) and calbindin (CB) were encountered occasionally in the white matter. In Case #1 and Case #4, double-staining with CB and AChE suggested almost no overlap between the two stains; the same was true in double-staining with CB and NADPH-d (Case #2). Case #1 also showed that roughly two-thirds of AChE-positive WMNs were also positive for MAP-2. Subcortical deep white matter neurons were challenging to detect in cresyl violet stained sections because of background interference with strongly staining astrocytic glial nuclei; visualization with the neuronal nuclear protein NeuN (Case #8) allowed for better resolution. Of note, the results here do not represent the outcome of a systematic investigation based on all possible marker combinations in all available cases. Rather, the results above provide a descriptive landscape to be better characterized by future systematic approaches.

Morphological features of NADPH-d-positive WMNs

Inspection of dendritic, axonal, and somatic features led to the classification of three groups of NADPH-d-positive WMNs: 1) unipolar; 2) bipolar; 3) multipolar, which include isodendritic and stellate subtypes. These cell types were found in both subplate and deep subcortical WMNs. Unipolar neurons were defined as those with a round soma and only one process extending from the cell body at least within the plane of section. Bipolar neurons harbored a longer, narrower cell body, with a prominent apical dendrite and one elongated process extended by distances of 100+ microns (Figure 2h). The multipolar group was comprised in part by isodendritic cells, with large, triangular cell bodies and at least 3 processes extending from the soma (Figure 2g), as well as stellate neurons, which had rounder, smaller cell bodies and many processes that contained a branching dendritic tree. In all types, there were dendrites that occasionally bore spines visible by light microscopy. Across frontal, temporal, and occipital regions, multipolar neurons were found to be most ubiquitous, comprising at least half of all neurons inspected, concordant with morphological studies in the macaque (Rockland &amp; Nayyar, 2012). Analysis of a single case (Case #9) revealed no significant differences in the frequency of morphological cell types between subplate and subcortical deep WMNs. For example, of the subcortical deep or subplate WMNs analyzed, multipolar neurons comprised approximately 61% of the total population found in frontal cortex.

Differences in size and density between subplate vs subcortical deep WMNs

NADPH-d-positive subplate WMNs were significantly larger than deep subcortical neurons (Figure 3) across frontal, temporal, and occipital regions (p&lt;0.0001). By observation, subplate WMNs tended to show longer, more frequent, and darker histochemical reactions in the cell body compared to neurons in subcortical deeper white matter, though there was no significant difference found in an analysis of optical density completed in the cognitively-normal group (N=3). Additional quantitation of a sample of WMNs (~100-120 per group) from the frontal section of Case #9 revealed no significant differences between the number of processes extending from the soma of subplate (M = 2.82 processes) versus subcortical deep WMNs (M = 2.97 processes). There were no statistically significant differences in estimated density across regions in these control cases, (Figure 4) although WMN density of both groups appeared higher in occipital compared to frontal white matter. Subplate WMNs showed mean densities of 299.06 counts/mm2, 413.81 counts/mm2, and 462.49 counts/mm2 across frontal, temporal, and occipital regions, respectively, where subcortical deep WMNs showed means of 508.21 counts/mm2, 617.20 counts/mm2, and 673.01 counts/mm2 across frontal, temporal, and occipital regions, respectively.

Comparison of NADPH-d-positive WMNs in Normal Control versus AD cases

The WMNs did not have neurofibrillary tangles in PHF-1/ALZ-50 or thioflavin-S preparations. Comparison of AD cases (N=3; Cases 10, 11, and 12) to age-matched cognitively-normal control cases (N=3; Cases 1, 5, 9) showed significantly larger NADPH-d subcortical deep white matter soma size in controls (M=130.20 μm2; SD=57.86) compared to AD cases (M=123.48 μm2; SD=55.33) (Figure 5; p&lt;0.0001). Differences were most apparent in temporal regions by an average difference of 14.15 μm2 between groups. Though one study did show reduced NADPH-d+ WMN densities in AD specimens (Kowall &amp; Beal, 1988), we found no statistically significant differences in estimated density between control and AD cases in our small sample.

NADPH-d-positive WMNs and adjacent vasculature

Prior work in the corpus callosum of the rat showed that characteristics of nitric oxide (NO)-producing neurons (NOS-immunopositive) were identical to that of NADPH-d+ neurons (Barbaresi et al., 2014). Similar to results reported in other animal models, NADPH-d+ deep white matter neurons in the corpus callosum and superior corona radiata displayed processes abutting vasculature as shown in control Case #6 (Figure 6). We employed a double-staining procedure of NADPH-d and αSMA, a marker of smooth muscle cells in vessel walls necessary for contractile function (DeRuiter et al., 1997). In normal-control specimens, we were able to visualize what appear to be soma in proximity of vessels and dendritic, and axonal processes extending toward vessels, with frequent contact (Figure 7). We observed from close inspection of NADPH-d single staining in frontal and occipital sections of a normal control specimen (Case #9) what appeared to be punctate boutons rich in NADPH-d on the outer walls of blood vessels, even in the absence of neuronal cell bodies in the immediate neighborhood (Figure 8). Similar patterns of neuron-vessel proximity were observed in AD specimens (Figure 7). This WMN-vessel proximity was observed in several but not all cases and warrants further study considering the relevance of NO for vasodilation.

DISCUSSION.

In this study, we add to the characterization of morphological, regional, and neurochemical signatures of white matter neurons, particularly those in central deep white matter, in the adult human brain. We attempt to do so through novel immunostaining that provides an initial exploration of the co-localization of neuronal markers. Fifteen whole-hemisphere postmortem specimens, spanning seven decades of age were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. We chose to focus our attention on WMNs in the subcortical deep white matter because they are so conspicuous and because they defy the strict interpretation of the distinction between grey and white matter.

We observed that subcortical WMNs display heterogenous chemical and morphological signatures, as reflected in reactivity for MAP-2, AChE, SMI-32, parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, somatostatin, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (Bu et al., 2003; Gonchar et al., 2007; Kostovic &amp; Rakic, 1980; Kostović et al., 1991; Tao et al., 1999). The most extensively studied markers were MAP-2 and NADPH-d, which were surprisingly found to be dissociated from each other. These two groups may turn out to have distinct functionalities related to blood flow and perhaps the monitoring of activity along white matter bundles, within which the WMN are embedded. Indeed, NADPH-d-positive neurons express NOS, and thus presumably release NO, which is a gaseous messenger molecule. A good number of SOM-positive WMN were also positive for NADPH-d and AChE. AChE-rich neurons were found to be negative for CHAT and thus are believed to be cholinoceptive rather than cholinergic. AChE-positivity implies innervation by the nucleus basalis of Meynert, due high instance of co-labeling of m2 receptors, implicating the cholinergic system in the regulation of NOS in NADPH-d-positive WMN (Smiley et al., 1998). We found that only very few NADPH-d-positive neurons were also MAP-2 positive, concordant with previous results (Meyer et al., 1992). The total number of WMN should therefore be calculated based on the addition of neurons positive for each of these two markers. Staining of calcium binding proteins revealed no overlap with AChE or NADPH-d. PV-positive neurons were more frequent in the superficial white matter, though this was based on a small number of cases processed for PV immunohistochemistry.

In cognitively-normal control specimens stained with NADPH-d (see Figures 2g, 3 and 6), three morphological subtypes emerged: unipolar, bipolar, and multipolar (isodendritic and stellate) (Figure 2g). Multipolar forms (typically isodendritic) were most prevalent in gyral crowns, consistent with prior observations in both the rhesus monkey (Mortazavi et al., 2017) and human brains (Sedmak &amp; Judaš, 2019) and they were more frequently observed in posterior cortical areas, with multipolar neurons comprising ~90% of all cells examined. Density of NADPH-d-positive WMNs appeared higher in occipital white matter, diverging from the literature that has shown decreased densities of m2-positive WMN in visual cortex (Smiley et al., 1998), though this finding was not significant.

The principal differences we observed in the ADNC specimens at Braak stages V-VI were that the soma sizes of NADPH-d+ subcortical and subplate WMNs were significantly smaller in AD brains (N=3; Cases 10, 11, and 12) compared to their cognitively-healthy, age-matched peers (N=3; Cases 1, 5, 9). Perikaryal atrophy was previously reported in human brains at Braak stages of 0-4 of ADNC (Nassif et al., 2022) and in cases of frontotemporal degeneration with TDP-43 proteinopathy (Kim et al., 2018). NADPH-d+ neurons in our study were devoid of tau tangle pathology, concordant with previous work on NADPH-d+ cortical neurons in humans (Kowall &amp; Beal, 1988). In all cases regardless of cognitive or pathological status, we observed proximity of WMN to blood vessels in subcortical structures (Figure 6). NO is known to be a potent vasodilator, and has been shown to interact with the vasculature in the corpus callosum of the rat (Barbaresi et al., 2014). The literature has previously highlighted this neuron-vessel relationship in subplate WMNs in humans (Estrada &amp; DeFelipe, 1998). Our findings suggest that such relationships exist in subcortical deep white matter as well. The double-staining with NADPH-d and αSMA visualized WMN neuronal processes extending toward vascular profiles as if establishing contact. Additionally, NADPH-d-positive puncta were aligned with blood vessels, although the exact nature of the puncta remains to be clarified (Figure 8). NO has a specific activation range, impacting nearby vessel up to distances of 100-200 microns through volume conduction (Barbaresi et al., 2015; Estrada &amp; DeFelipe, 1998; Smiley et al., 1998; Wood &amp; Garthwaite, 1994), making our findings particularly relevant to the possible role of WMN in the modulation of blood flow within white matter tracts.

Findings were derived from a small sample, given the limited availability of whole-hemisphere tissue, thus more cases are needed for extensive quantitative analysis. Well-validated histological methods were utilized, although more work using newer methods such as single cell transcriptomics may address questions of function and origin. Future studies on the pathophysiological involvement of NOS in cortical and white matter neurons will be fruitful for our understanding of circuitry function in the human.

These stains allowed for the identification of several WMN morphological features, including isodendritic (f &amp; g) and bipolar (h) neurons. Note, images a &amp; b were acquired from Case #7, a 45-year-old male; c-e from Case #1, a 55-year-old female; and f-h from Case #15, a 75-year-old male. Images a &amp; b were taken at 20X, c at 10X, d at 40X, e &amp; f at 10X, g at 100X, and h at 40X.

Figure 3. Photomicrograph of NADPH-d-positive subplate white matter neuron (a) in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) vs subcortical deep white matter neuron (b) in the orbito-frontal region from Case #9, a 27- year-old cognitively-normal male. By observation, superficial subplate white matter neurons appeared larger than those found in deep white matter. Images taken at 10X.

Figure 4. Density (counts/ mm2) of NADPH-d-positive white matter subplate neurons compared to subcortical deep neurons by region in cognitively-normal cases (N=3). Both classes of neurons show the lowest density of WMN in frontal sections and highest density in occipital regions. These differences did not reach statistical significance but suggest a regional trend. Error bars indicate SD.

Figure 5. (a) Mean subcortical deep white matter soma size (per um2) in cognitively-normal cases vs AD groups (N=3, per group) where dots represent individual cases. Photomicrograph of NADPH-d-positive subcortical deep white matter neuron in an occipital section from (b) Case #5, a 43- year-old cognitively-normal female and (c) an occipital section from Case #11, a 79-year-old female with amnestic dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. Images taken at 10X. Error bars indicate SD; **** = p&lt;0.0001.

Figure 6. NADPH-d histochemistry in a whole hemisphere orbitofrontal section from the Case #9, a 27-year-old cognitively-normal male. The image highlights the proximity of subcortical deep WMN cell bodies and their processes to neighboring blood vessels, as seen in the corpus callosum (a) and the superior corona radiata (b). Inset images captured at 20X. MFG=middle frontal gyrus; CG=cingulate Gyrus; gCC=genu of corpus callosum; rCC=rostrum of corpus callosum; CdM=medial caudate nucleus; IP=insular pole; IFG= inferior frontal gyrus; MOrG= medial orbital gyrus.

Figure 7. Double-staining of NADPH-d and αSMA highlighting the relationship between subplate neurons and blood vessels in the white matter in frontal (a &amp; b) and temporal (c) regions from Case #13, an 88- year-old cognitively-normal male. The same double-staining in the frontal region (d) from Case #14, a 61-year-old male with an aphasic dementia syndrome (PPA) due to Alzheimer’s disease, shows that this neuron-vessel relationship persists in the disease state. Images taken at 20X.

Figure 8. NADPH-d single staining in frontal (a &amp; b) and occipital sections (c &amp; d) from Case #9, a 27-year-old cognitively-normal male, shows an affinity of NADPH-d-positive punctate boutons to the outer walls of blood vessels, even in the absence of neuronal cell bodies. This phenomenon is not well understood, though it suggests a contribution to vascular function and vasodilation-hemodynamic responses. Images a and c taken at 10X; images b and d taken at 40X.

Table 1. Case Characteristics.

The following stains were completed on 15 adult human brains: cresyl violet (CV), microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d), calbindin-D28K (CB), calretinin (CRT), somatostatin (SOM), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), non-phosphorylated neurofilament protein (SMI-32), parvalbumin (PV), a neuronal nuclei stain (NeuN), and alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA). Double-staining is noted with a “-” (e.g., NADPH-d-SOM). PMI = post-mortem interval.
