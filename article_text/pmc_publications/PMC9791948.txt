Background:

A role for neutrophils in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is emerging. We previously showed that the neutrophil granule proteins cationic antimicrobial protein of 37 kDa (CAP37), cathepsin G (CG), and neutrophil elastase (NE) directly bind the amyloid-beta peptide Aβ1–42, a central player in AD pathogenesis. CAP37, CG, and NE are serine proteases that can cleave Aβ1–42 at different sites and with different catalytic activities.

Objective:

In this study, we compared the effects of these three proteins on Aβ1–42 fibrillation and neurotoxicity.

Methods:

Using mass spectrometry and in vitro aggregation assay, we found that NE and CG efficiently cleave Aβ1–42. This cleavage correlates well with the inhibition of Aβ1–42 aggregation into fibrils. In contrast, CAP37 did not efficiently cleave Aβ1–42, but was still able to inhibit its fibrillation, most likely through a quenching effect. Inhibition of Aβ1–42 aggregation by NE and CG neutralized its toxicity measured in cultured neurons. In contrast, inhibition of Aβ1–42 aggregation by CAP37 did not inhibit its neurotoxicity.

Results:

We found that a peptide derived from CAP37 could mimic the quenching and inhibition of Aβ1–42 aggregation effects of the full-length protein. Additionally, this peptide was able to inhibit the neurotoxicity of the most toxic Aβ1–42 aggregate, an effect that was not found with the full-length CAP37.

Conclusion:

These results shed light on the mechanisms of action of neutrophil granule proteins with regard to inhibition of Aβ1–42 aggregation and neurotoxicity and open up a possible strategy for the discovery of new disease-modifying drugs for AD.

pmc1. INTRODUCTION

Neutrophils and microglia are immune cells of myeloid origins [1]. Neutrophils circulate in the blood and migrate into damaged tissues, where their primary function is bactericidal to ensure the host’s defense against invading pathogens [2]. Microglia reside exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) [3], and whereas they have certain functions such as phagocytosis and host defense that are similar to that of neutrophils, they have a number of additional functions that are unique due to their location within the CNS [2].

Both types of cells are important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease [2, 4–6]. Microglia contribute to the clearance of toxic amyloid β peptides (Aβ) that accumulate in the brains of patients with AD [7]. Aβ binds to specific membrane receptors at the surface of microglial cells [8, 9], which promotes the phagocytosis and degradation of Aβ by these cells [10, 11], and activates intracellular signaling pathways that lead to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species [9, 10]. Membrane receptors that recognize Aβ belong to the group of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), and include receptors from the immunoglobulin superfamily, such as the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), the toll-like receptors TLR2 and TLR4, and the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) [9, 12]. These PRRs recognize a diverse group of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including Aβ [12]. Chronic activation of microglia and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines is associated with AD and, over time, leads to defects in phagocytosis and intracellular degradation of Aβ and other DAMPs [4, 6, 8, 10]. This, in turn, leads to microglial proliferation and shift to a disease-associated phenotype, characterized by the downregulation of homeostatic genes and the upregulation of inflammatory genes in microglial cells [8].

AD was traditionally viewed as a neurodegenerative disease affecting only the CNS, but evidence of associated peripheral inflammation and for a role of neutrophils in AD is emerging [5]. A recent study showed that the number of neutrophils in brain parenchyma was increased by more than 10-fold in patients with AD, compared to healthy age-matched controls, and these cells were found in close proximity to amyloid plaques [13]. Similar findings were reported in AD mouse models [13, 14]. In addition, the increased number and the phenotype of neutrophils in patients with AD revealed a chronic peripheral inflammation in these patients [5, 15–21].

We previously identified a possible role for CAP37, cathepsin G (CG), and neutrophil elastase (NE) proteins in AD pathogenesis [22]. These three proteins are abundantly expressed in neutrophils, where they are pre-packaged in azurophil and secretory granules that are readily available for release upon activation of the neutrophil [2]. These neutrophil proteins and/or corresponding mRNAs were also found in microglia [2, 23–25]. We found that CAP37 protein is additionally expressed in neurons and is upregulated in the brains of patients with AD [23]. CAP37, CG, and NE directly interact with the most toxic Aβ peptide, Aβ1–42, and with RAGE, and can disrupt the interaction between Aβ1–42 and RAGE [22]. This interaction is important in AD pathogenesis [2] because RAGE is the transporter that mediates the influx of peripheral Aβ1–42, through the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) into the brain [26]. As discussed above, the binding of Aβ1–42 to RAGE and other PRRs mediates the chronic pro-inflammatory effects of Aβ1–42 on microglia [27, 28]. RAGE and other PRRs can also mediate direct neurotoxic effects of Aβ1–42 on neurons, such as oxidative stress and pathogenic tau-aggregation [27, 29]. Therefore, by disrupting the Aβ1–42 – RAGE interaction, CAP37, CG, and NE could slow down AD progression [2].

Accumulation of Aβ1–42 in the brain favors spontaneous aggregation into fibrils and oligomers, which are the main toxic forms of Aβ1–42 [30, 31]. These soluble aggregates eventually precipitate and form the extracellular insoluble amyloid plaques [30, 31]. In this study, we focused on the role of CAP37, CG, and NE on the formation and neurotoxicity of Aβ1–42 fibrils and oligomers. We show that the three proteins inhibit the fibrillation of Aβ1–42 through different mechanisms, and that CG and NE can also inhibit the neurotoxicity of Aβ1–42.fibrils and oligomers. Finally, we discuss how these effects could impact the progression of AD, and propose a novel strategy for the development of drugs for AD.

2.2. Aβ1–42 Fibrillation Assay

The Thioflavin T aggregation kit was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions with some modifications. Thioflavin T dye was diluted to 250 μM in fibrillation buffer and kept in the dark until use. The HFIP-treated Aβ1–42 from the kit was suspended at 250 μg/ml (55 μM) in fibrillation buffer as instructed and stored at 4°C until use. Neutrophil proteins were diluted in water to 20X the desired final concentration. Neutrophil proteins were tested in the absence and presence of protease inhibitors. We first tested a cocktail of protease inhibitors and leupeptin, PMSF, and chymostatin individually to select the most efficient one for each enzyme. PMSF was selected and used at 1 mM final concentration in reactions with CAP37 and NE. Chymostatin was selected and used at 125 μM final concentration in reactions with CG.

Reactions were set up in non-binding black plates. In low light, 10 μl Thioflavin T dye was first added to all wells. Then, 85 μl Aβ1–42 (diluted in fibrillation buffer to obtain a final concentration of 10 μM in the assay) with or without protease inhibitor, and 5 μl water, neutrophil protein, or CAP37 peptide were added. Reactions were pipetted up and down twice in the wells with a multichannel pipette to ensure mixing. Fluorescence (λEx = 440 nm, λEm = 485 nm) was read every 5 minutes for 3 hours at 37°C on a BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader with Gen 5 software. The sensitivity was set at 65. Each sample had a 15-second medium-intensity shake step before it was read.

2.3. Enzyme Activity Assay and Mass Spectrometry

Aβ1–42 was prepared in DMSO at 5 mM and then diluted to 100 μM in PBS. Reactions were set up in PBS at a final concentration of 10 μM Aβ1–42, with or without protease inhibitor, and increasing concentrations of CAP37, CG or NE enzymes. The enzyme was added last, and reactions were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Reactions were stopped at 1 h by the addition of acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to final concentrations of 7.5% and 0.5%, respectively. Internal standard Aβ40–1, dissolved in 10% acetic acid, was then added to each reaction at a final concentration of 8 μg/ml. A 10-μl aliquot of each reaction was desalted on a C18 OMIX tip. First, the C18 resin was rinsed with 2X 10 μl of 50% methanol. Then, it was rinsed with 2X 10 μl of equilibration buffer (5% acetonitrile 0.5% TFA). The sample was then applied to the resin by pipetting 10 times. Then, the resin was washed twice with equilibration buffer and eluted with 75% acetonitrile 0.1% TFA.

Desalted samples were analyzed by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry using a Bruker Ultraflex II instrument and Flex Control Software (Billerica, MA). One μl desalted sample was spotted onto a 384-spot ground steel target plate with 1 μl of the α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix in 30% acetonitrile 0.1% TFA. Each sample was spotted in triplicate. The plate was dried in a vacuum desiccator. Each chromatograph was the average of 5 X 200 shots at 28% laser power in Linear Positive Mode. Chromatographs were analyzed with Flex Analysis software. The chromatographs had a peak at 4,330 m/z corresponding to the Aβ40–1 internal standard and a peak at 4,515 m/z corresponding to the Aβ1–42 substrate. The peak intensity of Aβ1–42 was normalized to the internal standard peak intensity for each spot. Three such spots were then averaged to determine the percent of uncleaved Aβ1–42 substrate remaining after 1 h of the enzymatic reaction, relative to Aβ1–42 in reactions with no enzyme, defined as 100%. Error bars represent the mean ± SEM of 2-to-4 enzymatic reactions.

2.4. Binding Assay

Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) were performed as described previously [22] with some modifications. Aβ1–42 from Bachem was reconstituted in 1 mM NaOH, aliquoted, and frozen. Each aliquot was used once, and any unused sample was discarded. Maxisorp plates were coated with 100 μl neutrophil protein prepared at 185 nM (approximately 5 μg/ml) in PBS with or without 1 mM PMSF (for CAP37, NE, and BSA) or 125 μM chymostatin (for CG and BSA), or coated with CAP37 peptide prepared at 1.25 μM (approximately 5 μg/ml). Plates were washed three times in PBST, then blocked with 3% BSA in PBST for 1 hour at room temperature with shaking. Plates were washed again, and 100 or 150 nM Aβ1–42 in 0.1 % BSA in PBST was added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 70 minutes at 37°C. Plates were then washed and mouse anti-amyloid beta antibody was added at a 1:500 dilution in 1% BSA in PBST, and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with shaking. After four washes, plates were incubated with donkey anti mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody diluted at 1:10,000 in PBST. Plates were incubated 1 hour at room temperature with shaking and washed 4 times in PBST. Then, substrate buffer (49 mM citric acid; 102 mM sodium phosphate; brought to pH 5.0 with HCl, with 7.5 mM o-phenylenediamine, and 0.024 % (v/v) H2O2 freshly added) was added to the plates and incubated for 30 minutes in the dark. Sulfuric acid (5N) was added to each well to stop the reaction, and the absorbance at 492 nm was read on a Biotek Synergy II plate reader.

2.5. Monomer, Fibril, and Oligomer Preparations of Aβ1–42

Monomeric HFIP-treated Aβ1–42 from Bachem was reconstituted at 5 mM in anhydrous DMSO, vortexed vigorously for 30 seconds, sonicated for 10 minutes in a water bath sonicator at room temperature, and stored at −80°C until use. Untreated Aβ1–42 from CS Bio was also used after treatment with HFIP. Ten mg Aβ1–42 was first treated with 2 ml of HFIP 1 mM, incubated 30 min at room temperature, and left open to dry in the fume hood overnight. It was then vacuum desiccated for 1 hour at room temperature. Dry films of Aβ1–42 were stored at −20°C to keep them in a monomeric form. It was reconstituted in anhydrous DMSO at 5 mM before use.

Aβ1–42 monomers were prepared by diluting HFIP-treated Aβ1–42 in the cell culture medium MEM α at a final concentration of 18 μM. This mixture was immediately used to conduct electron microscopy and toxicity experiments. To prepare fibrils, HFIP-treated Aβ1–42 was added to fibrillation buffer at a concentration of 100 μM, incubated at 37°C for 24 hours, and diluted in MEM α to a final concentration of 18 μM. This mixture was immediately used to conduct electron microscopy and toxicity experiments. To form oligomers, HFIP-treated Aβ1–42 was added to MEM α at a concentration of 100 μM, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and then diluted in MEM α to a final concentration of 18 μM. This mixture was immediately used to conduct electron microscopy and toxicity experiments. In some experiments, the fibrils and oligomers were prepared in the presence of a neutrophil protein or CAP37 peptide. In this case, the inhibitor (protein or peptide) was added to the 100 μM solution of Aβ1–42, at the start of the incubation time. The concentration of each inhibitor was determined by using its IC50, previously determined with 10 μM Aβ1–42, and multiplied by 10 (equivalent IC50) to retain the stoichiometry of this reaction in the presence of 100 μM Aβ1–42.

2.6. Transmission Electron Microscopy

Images were obtained with negative-staining transmission electron microscopy. A droplet of monomer, fibril, or oligomer preparation was allowed to settle onto 300 mesh Cu carbon-stabilized, Formvar-coated grid for 30 min in a humidity chamber. Grids were air-dried for 2 h and stained for 2 min with a 4% uranyl acetate, wicked, and re-stained for 2 min. Grids were rinsed with Nanopure H2O for about 10 sec and air-dried for 1 min before being placed in a grid storage box before viewing. Images were captured at 10,000X at 80KV on a Hitachi H7600 TEM equipped with an AMT 4K x4K digital camera.

2.7. Cell Culture and Aβ Neurotoxicity Assay

The mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro-2a was used for these experiments. Cells were grown and seeded in 96 well plates at 20,000 cells per well in MEM α with nucleosides and without phenol red, complemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. At 24 hours after seeding, cells were washed with warmed MEM α, and then incubated in 90 μl MEM α + N2 Supplement + 20 μl of Aβ1–42 monomer, fibril or oligomer preparation, prepared in the absence or presence of protein or peptide inhibitor. The final concentration of Aβ1–42 on the cells was 18 μM. For the water and Triton X-100 controls, 20 μl water or Triton X-100 (0.1% final) were added to 90 μl MEM α + N2 Supplement, instead of the Aβ1–42 preparation. Cells were incubated with Aβ1–42 treatments for 24 hours at 37°C, and incubated with Triton X-100 and water control for 5 min, prior to harvesting. Cells were detached from the plate by pipetting up and down, mixed with trypan blue (0.2% final), and immediately counted in a BioRad TC20 cell counter. The percent dead cells was recorded for each well.

2.8. Quantification of Aβ Oligomers

Aβ1–42 oligomers, formed in the absence and presence of protein or peptide inhibitors, were quantified using the Oligomeric Amyloid-β (o-Aβ) ELISA Kit. Oligomers were formed as described in the absence and presence of inhibitors at 2 X their respective IC50. These preparations were then diluted (1/225,000 dilution) so that the concentration of monomeric Aβ equivalent falls within the linear range of detection of the kit. ELISAs were then performed as recommended by the manufacturer, and absorbance was read at 450 nm.

3. RESULTS

3.1. CAP37, CG, and NE Inhibit Aβ1–42 Fibrillation

A previous study in our lab showed that the neutrophil proteins CAP37, CG, and NE bind and cleave Aβ1–42 [22]. Here, we investigated whether these neutrophil proteins could inhibit the aggregation of Aβ1–42. We used Thioflavin T, a dye that fluoresces in the presence of Aβ1–42 fibrils, but not in the presence of Aβ1–42 monomers [32]. A typical fibrillation kinetic is shown in supplemental Fig. (S1). It starts with a lag phase during which formation of small oligomers of Aβ1–42 (nucleation) is taking place. It is followed by the elongation phase during which fibrils are formed and elongated and the equilibrium phase during which at least one of the components of the reaction becomes limiting and an equilibrium is reached between monomers attaching and detaching from fibrils. In the absence of neutrophil proteins, the elongation phase of Aβ1–42 fibrillation started after approximately 30 min of lag time, and lasted for approximately 70 min, after which the equilibrium was reached (Fig. 1A, black diamonds, positive control). This kinetic was modified in the presence of 1 μM CAP37 (Fig. 1A, gray circles), 10 nM CG (Fig. 1A, dark gray inverted triangles), and 10 nM NE (light gray triangles). We analyzed these modifications by comparing the lag time, elongation slope, and maximum fibrillation (measured as described in Fig. S1), in the absence and presence of neutrophil proteins. Results are reported in Table 1 as percent values of the untreated control. We observed that CAP37 and NE mainly inhibited the elongation phase and that CG mainly inhibited the nucleation phase during the Aβ1–42 fibrillation process. These results show that all three neutrophil proteins inhibit the fibrillation process and suggest that they do so with different efficiencies and mechanisms of action.

To determine the efficiencies of CAP37, CG, and NE in inhibiting Aβ1–42 fibrillation, we performed a dose-response experiment with each protein, testing concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 5 μM. CAP37 had a calculated IC50 of 0.9 μM (Fig. 1B, gray circles). CG was ~235-fold more efficient than CAP37, with an IC50 of 3.8 nM (Fig. 1B, dark gray inverted triangles). NE was ~375-fold more efficient than CAP37, with an IC50 of 2.4 nM (Fig. 1B, light gray triangles). BSA was used as a negative control and did not inhibit fibrillation of Aβ1–42 (Fig. 1B, white squares).

To determine whether inhibition of fibrillation was due to the cleavage of Aβ1–42 by these neutrophil proteins, we repeated the dose-response experiments in the presence of protease inhibitors. In the presence of PMSF (Fig. 2A, white circles), the IC50 of CAP37 increased from 0.9 μM to 2.9 μM (a 3.2-fold increase). In the presence of chymostatin (Fig. 2B, white inverted triangles), the IC50 of CG increased from 3.8 nM to 65 nM (a 17-fold increase). In the presence of PMSF (Fig. 2C, white triangles), the IC50 of NE increased from 2.4 nM to 87 nM (a 36-fold increase). These results suggest that the protease activities of these neutrophil proteins are, at least partly, mediating the inhibition of Aβ1–42 fibrillation.

To confirm a correlation between cleavage of Aβ1–42 and inhibition of Aβ1–42 fibrillation, we quantified the proportion of cleaved and uncleaved Aβ1–42 in similar dose-response experiments, using mass spectrometry. Reactions were set up with 10 μM Aβ1–42 and increasing concentrations of neutrophil proteins, and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. At the end of the reaction, the remaining uncleaved Aβ1–42 substrate was quantified by MALDI-TOF spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S2). Results are plotted as % remaining Aβ1–42 in the presence of increasing concentrations of enzyme. In Fig. (3A), the effects of increasing concentrations of NE on Aβ1–42 fibrillation and cleavage are plotted on the same graph. This allows the visualization of a correlation between the two outcomes. In the presence of PMSF, the cleavage curve is shifted to the right (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that PMSF effectively inhibits the protease activity of NE. The fibrillation curve is similarly shifted to the right, showing a correlation between cleavage of Aβ1–42 and inhibition of fibrillation, by NE. Similar results were found with CG, with a correlation between the two outcomes, in the absence and presence of protease inhibitor (Fig. 3C and 3D). As shown before [22], CAP37 has a much lower protease activity than does NE and CG. As a result, the Aβ1–42 substrate was not significantly cleaved under any of the tested CAP37 concentrations in this experiment (not shown). Therefore, in the case of CAP37, there is no apparent correlation between the two outcomes, suggesting that this neutrophil protein is able to inhibit Aβ1–42 fibrillation, even in the absence of significant cleavage. We hypothesize that CAP37 could inhibit Aβ1–42 fibrillation through a binding/quenching effect. This could explain why the IC50 of CAP37 is much higher than that of CG and NE, as more protein would be needed to quench Aβ1–42 than for an active enzyme (like CG or NE) to cleave it. However, it must be noted that in Fig. (2A), we showed that the protease inhibitor PMSF inhibited the effect of CAP37 on Aβ1–42 fibrillation. To reconcile this result with the hypothesis of a quenching effect of CAP37 on Aβ1–42, one possibility could be that PMSF inhibits the physical interaction between CAP37 and Aβ1–42, and thus inhibits the quenching effect of CAP37.

To test this possibility, in the next experiment, an ELISA assay was performed to quantify the binding of Aβ1–42 to CAP37, CG, and NE, in the absence and presence of protease inhibitors. Aβ1–42 bound CAP37, both in the absence and presence of PMSF (Fig. 4A). A ~25% lower binding was found in the presence of PMSF, but the difference between CAP37 with and without PMSF was not statistically significant in this experiment. Aβ1–42 bound similarly to CG, in the absence and presence of chymostatin (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, Aβ1–42 did not appear to bind NE in the absence of PMSF, but in the presence of PMSF, the binding was detectable (Fig. 4A). This could be due to the strong protease activity of NE, which could persist even while NE is bound to the ELISA plate, quickly cleaving Aβ1–42 and preventing its immunodetection. This experiment provided the concept that the binding of Aβ1–42 to CAP37 could be negatively affected by PMSF.

A dose-response of CAP37 in the absence and presence of PMSF was then performed (Fig. 4B) and showed a significant decrease of Aβ1–42 binding to CAP37 in the presence of PMSF. These results indicate that PMSF can partly inhibit the binding of CAP37 to Aβ1–42, explaining why in the presence of PMSF, the anti-aggregation effect of CAP37 was inhibited.

3.2. CG and NE Inhibit Aβ1–42 Fibril and Oligomer Neurotoxicity

Because the three neutrophil proteins can inhibit Aβ1–42 aggregation, we next investigated whether they could protect cultured mouse neurons against the toxicity of Aβ1–42 aggregates. In Fig. (5A), we show the % neuronal death, induced by three different preparations of Aβ1–42 respectively enriched in monomers, fibrils, or oligomers, as previously described [33]. The Aβ1–42 preparation enriched in monomers induced 16.2% cell death, which was not significantly different from the corresponding vehicle control (background) inducing 5.9% cell death. After background subtraction, the monomer-enriched Aβ1–42 preparation induced 10.3% cell death. The fibril-enriched Aβ1–42 preparation induced 33.1% cell death after background subtraction of the corresponding vehicle control, and the oligomer-enriched Aβ1–42 preparation induced 63.5% cell death after corresponding background subtraction. Both fibril and oligomer preparations induced significant cell death, compared with their respective background controls. Electron micrographs of these preparations are shown in Fig. (5B). Few fibrils and no oligomers were found in the monomer preparation; an abundance of fibrils and no oligomers were found in the fibril-enriched preparation; and both fibrils and oligomers were found in the oligomer-enriched preparation. As shown before, the oligomer-enriched preparation induced more neurotoxicity than did the fibril-enriched preparation [33]. Since these preparations are not purely monomers, fibrils or oligomers, the measured neurotoxicity outcome is the net effect of each enriched preparation, including any mutual disturbance between the three forms of Aβ.

In the next series of experiments, we investigated the neurotoxicity of fibril and oligomer preparations, generated in the presence of neutrophil proteins. Fig. (6) shows that CAP37, used at IC50 equivalent concentration, was not able to decrease the toxicity of Aβ1–42 fibrils. Fibril formation is expected to be decreased by 50% in the presence of this amount of CAP37, most likely through quenching of Aβ1–42 by CAP37, but the resulting product of this reaction appears to be as toxic to the cells as the undisturbed fibrils. In contrast, NE and CG led to the expected 50% decrease in Aβ1–42 neurotoxicity, when used at their respective IC50 equivalent concentrations that are expected to decrease by 50% the amount of fibrils formed. The inhibitions of fibril toxicity by NE and CG were statistically significant.

Since Aβ1–42 oligomers are more toxic than are the fibrils, we next tested increasing concentrations of neutrophil proteins on the toxicity of oligomer-enriched preparations (Fig. 7). Similarly to the previous experiment, CAP37 did not decrease the toxicity of Aβ1–42, even when the concentration of CAP37 was increased to 2-fold its equivalent IC50 (Fig. 7A). This suggests that, under experimental conditions favoring the formation of oligomers, the interaction between CAP37 and Aβ1–42 could either fail to inhibit the formation of Aβ1–42 oligomers, or that the formed complexes between CAP37 and Aβ1–42 are as toxic to the cells as are the undisturbed oligomers. To distinguish between the two possibilities, we quantified the Aβ1–42 oligomers formed in the absence and presence of CAP37. Results, shown in Fig. (7A insert) favor the second possibility as CAP37 significantly decreased the amount of oligomers formed. CG was able to significantly decrease the neurotoxicity of Aβ1–42 oligomer-enriched preparations, by more than 50%, even at 0.5-fold its equivalent IC50 (Fig. 7B) and significantly decreased the amount of oligomers formed (Fig. 7B insert). This finding suggests that, under experimental conditions favoring the formation of oligomers, the cleavage of Aβ1–42 by CG could efficiently inhibit the formation of Aβ1–42 oligomers, and thus inhibit their neurotoxicity. Finally, NE also inhibited the neurotoxicity of Aβ1–42 oligomer-enriched preparations and the amount of oligomers formed, but not as efficiently as did CG (Fig. 7C). Only ~30% neurotoxicity was significantly inhibited by NE at a concentration of 2-fold its equivalent IC50. This finding suggests that the cleavage of Aβ1–42 by CG could more efficiently inhibit the formation of toxic Aβ1–42 oligomers than could the cleavage by NE.

3.3. A peptide Derived from CAP37 Inhibits Aβ1–42 Fibrillation and Neurotoxicity

CAP37-derived peptides have previously been generated as described [34, 35], and were tested here to determine whether any of them could mediate the effect of the full-length CAP37. We first tested the interaction of the various CAP37 peptides with Aβ1–42. Fig. (8A) shows the binding of Aβ1–42 to peptide 120–146 QR, derived from the native sequence of CAP37 located between residues 120 and 146. We also tested the binding of Aβ1–42 to three modified peptides (120–146 WR, QH, and WH) that have substitutions of Q to W and R to H in positions 131 and 132, respectively [34]. Aβ1–42 bound significantly more to peptides 120–146 QR, WR, and QH, than to peptide 120–146 WH. Peptide 95–122, another peptide derived from the native sequence of CAP37 located between residues 95 and 122, did not bind Aβ1–42 and was subsequently used as a negative control. Aβ1–42 bound similarly to CAP37 as it did with peptides 120–146 QR, WR, and QH.

We next tested whether any of the 120–146 peptide variants could inhibit Aβ1–42 aggregation. As shown in Fig. (8B), all four peptides had an effect on Aβ1–42 fibrillation. The R residue in position 132 seemed to favor inhibition of fibrillation, and the substitution of Q by W in position 131 enhanced this inhibition. Peptide 120–146 WR was the most protective against Aβ1–42 fibrillation. As shown in Fig. (8C), peptide 120–146 WR can fully inhibit Aβ1–42 fibrillation with an IC50 of 1.6 μM (1,600 nM), which is close to the IC50 of the full-length CAP37 (0.9 μM). As expected, peptide 95–122 did not inhibit fibrillation of Aβ1–42 at any concentration, up to 50 μM.

In the next experiment, we tested whether peptide 120–146 WR could inhibit the Aβ1–42 neurotoxicity mediated by fibrils and oligomers. As shown in Fig. (9A), this peptide did not inhibit fibril neurotoxicity when used at equivalent IC50. Neuronal cell death was slightly increased in the presence of this peptide, but this increase was not statistically significant. This result is similar to what we observed in the presence of full-length CAP37 (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. (9B), peptide 120–146 WR inhibited the neurotoxicity of Aβ1–42 oligomer-enriched preparations. About 40% of the neurotoxicity of oligomers was inhibited by peptide 120–146 WR at a concentration of 2-fold its equivalent IC50. This finding is in contrast with the absence of a protective effect observed with the full-length CAP37 (Fig. 7A). It suggests that, under experimental conditions favoring the formation of oligomers, the binding of Aβ1–42 by peptide 120–146 WR could efficiently inhibit the formation of Aβ1–42 oligomers, and thus inhibit their neurotoxicity. Indeed, this peptide appears to fully inhibit the formation of Aβ1–42 oligomers (Fig. 9B). This also indicates that the complex formed between the peptide and Aβ1–42 could retain some neurotoxicity, which is not as high as the neurotoxicity of undisturbed oligomers. Taken together, these results show that it is possible to use a CAP37-derived peptide to quench Aβ1–42 and decrease its aggregation and neurotoxicity.

4. DISCUSSION

In the present study, we showed that CG and NE are efficient Aβ-degrading enzymes that inhibit the aggregation and neurotoxicity of Aβ1–42. In contrast, CAP37 had a negligible enzymatic activity on Aβ1–42, but could inhibit its fibrillation by a quenching mechanism. However, the quenching of Aβ1–42 by CAP37 did not neutralize its neurotoxicity.

A surprising observation is that even though NE was more efficient than CG in cleaving Aβ1–42 and inhibiting its fibrillation, toxicity experiments suggest that CG was more efficient than NE in inhibiting the oligomerization of Aβ1–42. This finding could be due to differences in substrate specificities between the two enzymes. As we previously showed, NE first cleaves Aβ1–42 in positions 31 and 32 (during the first few minutes) and releases the N-terminal fragments, which are then further cleaved by NE in position 24 (during the following 10 minutes) [22]. CG, on the other hand, first cleaves Aβ1–42 in positions 21 and 22 (during the first 15 min) and releases the C-terminal fragments [22]. In our MALDI-TOF experiments, we could only visualize the N-terminal products of Aβ1–42 upon cleavage with NE, and could only visualize the C-terminal products when Aβ1–42 was cleaved with CG [22]. This finding could indicate that only the N- or C-terminal part is cleaved and released by NE and CG, respectively, while the rest remains attached to the enzyme.

This possibility is also supported by our ELISA experiments shown in Fig. (4). The monoclonal antibody used for detection of Aβ1–42 was raised against the N-terminal portion of Aβ1–42. This antibody did not detect Aβ1–42 bound to NE, most likely because the N-terminal fragment was cleaved off and washed away before detection. In contrast, this antibody detected Aβ1–42 bound to CG, possibly because the recognized N-terminal portion of Aβ1–42 remained bound to the enzyme, while the C-terminal portion was cleaved off and washed away. Therefore, the two enzymes, by cleaving Aβ1–42 at different sites and releasing different fragments, could preferentially inhibit the formation of fibrils or oligomers.

In view of these results, it appears that CG and NE belong to the functional group of Aβ-degrading enzymes (ADE), contributing to the clearance of Aβ [36]. The slow accumulation of Aβ in the brain, long before the first clinical symptoms of AD, is caused by a dysregulation of the Aβ metabolism (increased production and/or decreased clearance and/or increased influx/decreased efflux through the BBB) [37, 38]. A defective clearance of Aβ by ADE could accelerate the progression of the disease. Therefore, the activation of Aβ clearance by ADE is expected to slow down the progression of the disease. Utilization of activators of ADE has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for AD [36, 39]. However, CG and NE enzymatic activities have been associated with autoimmune and other serious disease states [40, 41]. Therefore, the possibility of harmful off-target effects is too high to propose activation of CG and/or NE as a strategy for the discovery of new AD drugs.

An alternative strategy is to generate peptides derived from CAP37, CG, or NE that could mimic the beneficial effects of the full-length proteins without having the potentially harmful enzymatic activities. We took advantage of an existing collection of CAP37-derived peptides that had previously been generated in the lab [34, 35], and screened them for binding to Aβ1–42 and for inhibition of Aβ1–42 fibrillation (Fig. 8). We identified one CAP37-derived peptide that had both effects. Similarly to the full-length protein, this peptide did not decrease the neurotoxicity of Aβ1–42 fibrils, when used at equivalent IC50. Surprisingly, however, this peptide could significantly decrease the neurotoxicity of Aβ1–42 oligomers, in contrast to the full-length CAP37 protein (Fig. 9). These results support the strategy consisting of generating peptides that can mimic beneficial effects of neutrophil granule proteins, to discover disease-modifying new drugs for AD. Our goal is to generate a peptide that binds Aβ1–42, inhibits its aggregation into toxic oligomers and fibrils, and inhibits the Aβ1–42 - RAGE interaction (thus inhibiting influx of Aβ1–42 into the brain, direct neurotoxicity of Aβ1–42, and the pro-inflammatory effects of Aβ1–42 on microglia). We believe that such a multifunctional peptide would be an innovative and efficient strategy to slow down the progression of AD. In future in vivo experiments, it will be important to determine if such peptide interferes with the function of these endogenous neutrophil proteins.

CAP37, CG, and NE have similar 3D structures, but their primary structures are more divergent, with only 32% to 45% identity [42–45]. In view of the results shown here, we hypothesize that a CG-derived peptide could be more efficient than NE- or CAP37-derived peptides in mediating protective effects because CG is the most efficient of the three proteins to inhibit oligomer neurotoxicity (Fig. 7). In addition, binding of CG to Aβ1–42 is similar to that of CAP37 (the best of the three proteins, Fig. 4); CG’s inhibition of Aβ1–42 fibrillation and fibril neurotoxicity is similar to that of NE (the best of the three proteins, Figs. 1 and 6); and, as shown in our previous study, the binding of CG to RAGE was similar to that of CAP37 (the best of the three proteins) [22].

CONCLUSION

In summary, the present study allowed us to compare the effects of three neutrophil granule proteins, and to shed light on their mechanisms of actions with regard to inhibition of Aβ1–42 aggregation and neurotoxicity. Our next goal is to develop a multifunctional bioactive peptide, derived from a neutrophil granule protein with anti-Aβ and anti-inflammatory effects to slow down the progression of AD.

Thioflavin T dye, Aβ1–42 (at 10 μM), and neutrophil proteins (at increasing concentrations) were incubated at 37°C in aggregation buffer. Fluorescence was read every 5 min for 3 hrs. (A). A representative plot showing the kinetics of aggregation in the absence and presence of CAP37 (circles), CG (inverted triangles), and NE (triangles) is shown. The time point corresponding to the beginning of the plateau for control Aβ1–42 aggregation was selected (shown by the dotted line), and the % aggregation was calculated at this time point in treated samples, relative to that of the untreated/positive control Aβ1–42, set at 100%. (B). Dose-responses showing percent of aggregation in the presence of increasing concentrations of CAP37, NE, CG, and BSA (used as a negative control) are shown. Each data point represents the mean ± SEM of 3 experiments, each done in duplicate. A best-fit non-linear regression dose-response-inhibition curve was generated and the IC50 was calculated for each protein, using GraphPad Prism.
