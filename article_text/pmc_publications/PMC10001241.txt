Objective:

The study evaluated the effects of care consultation delivered through the Alzheimer’s Association National Helpline - a free resource in which master’s-level clinicians offer confidential support. In addition, the study compared the effectiveness of the Helpline “Care Consultation” and “Care Consultation Plus” conditions on caller outcomes.

Methods:

Four hundred and forty-five non-crisis callers were randomly assigned to the traditional Helpline “Care Consultation” or a “Care Consultation Plus” condition that included one additional booster call.

Results:

While no differences were found between the two conditions, the study found that callers reported significantly improved caregiver mental health scores (27% net improvement over baseline) and ability to manage emotions (29% net improvement) at one week (p=.006). By one week, 70% of callers had put action steps in place and by 1 month 80% of callers had put action steps into place. Over 80% of callers reported action steps were “helpful”.

Conclusion:

A single call provided a measurable benefit to caregivers’mental health, ability to manage emotions and ability to engage in action planning and accessing resources.

Practice Implications:

This pilot study demonstrated that the support provided via the Helpline can be effective at improving caregiver mental health and improving the ability of callers to “take action”.

pmc1. Introduction

Family caregivers often find themselves isolated, stressed and overwhelmed as they manage the care for family members with dementia [1]. Telephone support can be a useful delivery modality and can come in the form of emotional and informational support [2,3] and has many advantages for dementia caregivers [4]. Because of visual privacy the telephone can make conversations less stressful for caregivers who may be reluctant to discuss particular issues in person. Providing support by telephone also places minimal burden on caregivers. It is well suited to individuals who may be homebound with limited time and energy to seek formal supportive services. Additionally, the availability of a 24/7 Helpline means caregivers can access support at the time of need. As a result, telephone support can provide a buffer against burden and stress for caregivers by increasing the perception that resources are available to handle stress [5].

Previous studies have examined the benefits of telephone support in dementia care. Some of these benefits included improved caregiver quality of life decreased caregiver depression, reduced burden, and reduced emergency department visits [2, 6] Mixed results have been reported with regard to caregiver stress and ability to manage behavioral symptoms in person with dementia [4]. In previous clinical trials, telephone support has been provided by care team navigators and dementia expert providers [6], therapists [7], and social workers [2]. The format, length of contact and frequency of telephone have varied widely. Telephone support may be a feasible option for caregivers unable to leave their home. Little is known about the benefits of an already-established telephone support Helpline, the contact information of which is often provided to caregivers when their loved one is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.

A crucial part of helping family caregivers is linking them with the Alzheimer’s Association and other community-based organizations to provide information, emotional support, practical advice, support groups, and training programs [8]. The Alzheimer’s Association Helpline (referred to as the Helpline in this paper) is an easily accessible and free resource available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, where callers can speak to master’s degree-level care consultants who offer confidential emotional support, valuable and actionable information and referrals to additional resources in the local community. Yearly, the Helpline receives between 290,000 and 300,000 calls, which averages to about 800 calls per day.

The purpose of the present study was twofold. First, it evaluated the effects of the Helpline “Care Consultation” on dementia caregiver’s physical and emotional health, ability to manage emotions, implement plan of action and access services. Second, it compared the effectiveness of the Helpline “Care Consultation” and “Care Consultation Plus” on caller outcomes.

2. Methods

Procedure and participants

The study was conducted over a 10-month period between January and October 2018. Sequential, non crisis (no threat to self or others expressed on screening), English speaking, adult (over age 18) callers to the Helpline were asked to participate in an anonymous evaluation survey at the end of their call, at 1 week and 1 month after the call. Those who provided assent by responding to the evaluation survey were randomly assigned to either the traditional Helpline “Care Consultation” or a “Care Consultation Plus” condition that included one additional booster call from the care consultant following the initial Care Consultation call, in which they already participated. The study was approved by the University of Pennsylvania IRB and all the participants gave verbal assent.

Randomization

A random sequence was generated by the first author and concealed from the Helpline staff. Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into Care Consultation arms. Immediately after the telephone consult, callers were redirected to blinded data collectors who conducted the independent telephone survey.

Measures

Telephone survey items consisted of basic demographic questions (age, race, sex, years of education) collected at baseline only. In addition, the main outcome measures were asked at each follow up (baseline, 1 week, 1 month) and included PROMIS measures of health &amp; wellbeing (global physical and mental health), ability to manage emotions, and self reported ability to implement plan of action and access services. The PROMIS Global Health is a 10-item questionnaire that evaluates the patient’s physical, mental, and social aspects of health [9]. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale [0=excellent; 5=poor]. There is no overall PROMIS Global Health score, rather the questionnaire is scored into the Global Physical Health (GPH) and Global Mental Health (GMH). The GPH scale comprises items on physical health, physical functioning, pain intensity, and fatigue (range 4–20). The GMH scale includes items on overall quality of life, mental health, satisfaction with social activities and relationships, and emotional problems (range:4–20). Lower scores indicate better health. The Cronbach alphas for the GPH and GMH for the study sample were 0.79 and 0.89, respectively.

The PROMIS Self‐Efficacy for Emotions was derived from the Self Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease (SEMCD) questionnaire that measures confidence in one’s ability to manage fatigue, pain, emotional distress, and other symptoms using self‐management techniques [10]. The four item Self Efficacy for Managing Emotion scale has a Cronbach’s α = .88 in the study sample. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy (range: 8–40). Callers were also asked whether they planned to implement the “action plan” on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating greater intent (range1–5). In addition, callers were asked whether they had implemented the “action plan” (Yes/No) and whether they had accessed any support services recommended in the Action Plan.

Helpline Program

Care Consultation Condition

Callers assigned to the Care Consultation Condition group received the care consultation service at the time of their call. Care consultation begins with an assessment of the caller’s situation and provides in-depth education about the disease and problem solving that result in the development of an action plan. Interventions may include active listening, empathy, validation and normalization, emotional containment, referrals to community programs and crisis assessment. The caller’s needs, identified through the assessment, determine the type of intervention that is appropriate. Care consultation is provided by staff that possess a master’s degree in social work, counseling or related field who complete four weeks of training and one week of shadowing other care consultants. Training includes Helpline call flow process and documentation, crisis assessment, brief counseling, and services and resources for referral.

Care Consultation Plus Condition

The Care Consultation Plus group received a care consultation as described above and also received an additional follow up call from the same care consultant to reinforce specific action steps and identify barriers to following through on the action steps. The care consultant reviewed notes from the initial care consultation to understand what was discussed.

Statistical Analysis

All data were entered into an online deidentified survey website, SurveyMonkey, from which data were downloaded for analysis. Demographics characteristics of the callers were compared for the two group assignments. For each intervention group, we calculated the net improvement by calculating the percentage of individuals who improved by at least 0.5 SD from baseline to follow up and subtracting the percentage of individuals who worsened by at least 0.5 SD. The analysis used the “intention-to-treat” principle with multiple imputations to account for missing data. A P value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Main outcomes displayed skewed distributions and therefore nonparametric tests of group differences were used (e.g. Chi-square tests for categorical measures and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous measures.). We also compared baseline demographic characteristics between “completers” and “noncompleters”, and between “improvers” and “non improvers”. We labeled a participant as an improver if his/her PROMIS score for managing emotions increased from baseline to week one at least 0.5 points. We counted a participant as a non improver if his/her PROMIS score for managing emotions decreased or stayed the same from baseline to week one. We considered a participant as a completer if his/her PROMIS scores for managing emotions were available at baseline and week one. A non completer was somebody who had missing PROMIS scores for managing emotions at week one. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).

3. Results

Sample Characteristics

As shown in Table 1, the mean age of 445 Helpline callers was 60.1 years (SD: 12.7; range: 18–95); 75% (n=313) were white, 13.0% (n=54) were Black, and 80% (n=338) were women, suggesting that most who called in were either spouses or daughters. Twenty-three percent (n=94) have reported completing a college degree. There were no differences in demographic characteristics across the groups. Out of 445 initial Helpline callers, 50% (n=223) had completed a 1-week call, compared to 40% who completed the 1-month call.

Overall Improvements in Caregiver Health

Net improvements were noted from baseline to one week in PROMIS mental health scores (27% net improvement) and ability to manage emotions (29% net improvement) across the combined Care Consultation and Care Consultation Plus groups. No net improvements were noted in PROMIS physical health scores.

Tables 2a-2c display the results of the group differences over time. We found no group differences between the Care Consultation or Care Consultation Plus Conditions across PROMIS physical or mental health scores. As noted in Table 2a and 2b, no statistically significant improvement on PROMIS physical or mental health measures. Physical health scores declined by only 0.16 points at one week. (p=0.49) and increased by .016 points at one month (p=.37). Mental health scores changed only by 0.02 points (p=0.57) at week one and 0.09 points at one month (p=0.95). However statisically significant improvements were noted in the Self Efficacy of Managing Emotion scale overall at 1 week (Table 2c). Mean (SD) scores improved 0.11 points (p=.006). No significant changes were noted at 1 month (p=0.27). Given these small increments of change, a comparison of net improvements was conducted. Net improvements were noted from baseline to one week in PROMIS mental health scores (27% net improvement) and ability to manage emotions (29% net improvement) across the combined Care Consultation and Care Consultation Plus groups. No net improvements were noted in PROMIS physical health scores.

Action Steps and Access to Services

At one week, 70% of all callers had put action steps in place. At one month, 80% of callers had put action steps into place. In addition, greater than 80% of all callers reported action steps were “helpful” and 65% reported that they had accessed additional dementia support services as a result of the call.

Noncompleters and nonimprovers

Statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics were found between those who completed follow up vs. those who did not in that younger caregivers were less likely to complete follow up (Table 3a). No statistically significant differences in demographic characteristic were found between those who had improvements in outcomes vs. those who did not (Table 3b).

4. Discussion and Conclusion

4.1 Discussion

In this study we found a small but significant improvement in callers’ self efficacy of managing emotion scale overall at 1 week and overall net improvements in caregiver mental health scores and self efficacy to manage emotions across the Care Consultant and Care Consultant Plus groups. However, when comparing caregiver outcomes based on their group assignment, we found no differences. When asked to rate the helpfulness of action steps, more than 80% of all callers reported action steps to be helpful. Furthermore, 70% of all callers had reported putting action steps in place at one week following the baseline consultation.

The Alzheimer’s Association Helpline is an important source for addressing emotional and information needs of thousands of dementia caregivers. This study provided the preliminary evidence of the impact that resources like the Alzheimer’s Association Helpline can improve the ability of callers to ‘take action’.

The caregiver benefits reported in this study are similar to benefits reported in other studies. For example, 61 adult children of frail older adults who participated in a 12 weekly, 90-minute telephone support group reported reduced burden, depression, stress and increased awareness of available support services [2]. Similarly, in an RCT of 250 dementia caregivers who received 16 telephone contacts over 6 months, the benefits included improved caregiver depression [7]. A 2017 systematic review reported that even though telephone counseling is largely acceptable by the caregivers of persons with dementia, the benefits of such programs remain mixed [4]. The main difference between our study and previous work is in the number of telephone sessions.

In our study, all caregivers participated in the initial baseline call. Caregivers who were randomized to the Care Consultation Plus group received two additional contacts from the care consultant. We found no differences between the intervention groups, suggesting caregivers have benefited from participating in either group. This can be explained by several factors. First, it is possible that some caregivers benefit most from the original phone call, where care consultants provide an in-depth education about the disease and problem solve with caregivers which results in the development of an action plan. These caregivers may be ready to implement the action plan from the first contact with the care consultant and may not benefit as much for the follow up call. Some caregivers may not need to participate in several follow up calls to benefit from the program. Caregivers may have already implemented some of the action items from the original phone call, thus alleviating some of the burden associated with caring for person with dementia. One to three contacts may be enough. The follow up calls, however, need to be tailored to individual needs as well as based on notes from previous discussion(s). Second, the Care Consultation Plus condition may not have been intense enough to see the differences in physical and mental health among the caregivers who participated in the Care Consultation Plus. During the follow up call, care consultants identified barriers to following through on the action steps. Additional time spent exploring additional supports and services tailored to the individual may have additional positive benefit on caregivers’ health. Future research should identify the minimum number of telephone support calls necessary to improve the well-being of caregivers as well as those distressed caregivers who may need an additional follow up.

In this study, more than 80% of callers identified action steps to be helpful, which points to the importance of identifying concrete actionable steps for caregivers. Furthermore, one week following baseline call 70% of all callers had reported putting action steps in place. The willingness to put these action steps in place indicates addressing emotional concerns of caregivers as well as providing them with tailored action steps are both necessary to improve caregiver mental health and ability to manage emotions. Caregivers who are given concrete action steps may feel less burden by following these practical steps and identifying small ways to address caregiving challenges.

Increasing caregiver knowledge regarding available dementia support services remains an important goal in caregiver interventions. Caregivers for persons with dementia who do not use community report being more depressed and receive less social support [11]. In our study, 65% of callers reported that they had accessed additional dementia support services as a result of the call. Increasing the use of dementia support services has the ability to improve outcomes for caregivers of persons with dementia. The access to over 200 proven support programs for caregivers for persons with dementia remains extremely limited [8]. Strategies to improve access to these programs are urgently needed. The Helpline has the potential to not only increase access to these support services, but also disseminate knowledge regarding their effectiveness.

There are several limitations to our study. It is worth noting that callers were randomly assigned to the Care Consultation conditions, rather than based on caregiver needs. It is possible that many caregiver issues were able to be resolved within one week. For callers with higher levels of need, for example, the Care Consultation Plus group may have been a more appropriate choice. However, for this current study, caregivers were not able to self-identify if they wanted one or two calls. Furthermore, some caregivers may have given socially desirable answers if they felt that their feedback was linked to the Helpline. In addition, while fidelity checks were conducted with 20% of all calls, variability in the delivery style of care consultations was a common observation. Future work to establish the fidelity across care consultations is needed. Additional research is needed to identify the long-term benefit of the Helpline. Being able to connect with the care consultant may provide short-term benefits to the caregivers. Future studies with a qualitative approach may help identify long-term caregiver benefits of the Helpline.

4.2 Conclusion

The present study examined the combined benefits of the Alzheimer’s Association Helpline on caregiver outcomes, as well as compared the effects of the Helpline “Care Consultation” and “Care Consultation Plus” on physical and emotional health, ability to manage emotions, plan of action implementation and access to services among dementia caregivers. Regardless of group assignment we found improvements in caregivers’ self reported ability to manage emotions.

The results of this study indicated that the Helpline provides some health benefits for dementia caregivers. There was no evidence of a group differences between the Care Consultation and Care Consultation Plus conditions suggesting that a single call provided a measurable benefit to caregivers’ mental health, their ability to manage emotions and their ability to engage in action planning and accessing resources. While it is not yet known how long the benefit will remain in effect, the Helpline is available whenever the caller might need additional support.

4.3 Practice Implications

The cost of providing care for people with dementia in the United States in 2019 was estimated at $290 billion, according to the Alzheimer’s Association 2019 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts &amp; Figures report. While methods are needed to manage costs through public policy, expanded training, and health systems optimization, free and easily accessible options such as the Helpline offer opportunities in the short-term to reduce the burden faced by caregivers while simultaneously expanding access to support services and educational materials.
