Purpose:

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarker testing is now common in research and approaching clinical translation. Disclosure protocols must be informed by diverse participants’ perspectives on if/how the information would be useful.

Methods:

This study utilized semi-structured interviews assessing interest in receiving positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid and tau results, as well as perceived risks and benefits of hypothetical PET disclosure as a function of race and participant diagnosis.

Patients:

Participants (39% Black; 61% White; Mage=74.28 [5.98]) included 57 adults diagnosed as either cognitively healthy (58%) or with mild cognitive impairment (42%), and their respective care partners (33% Black; 67% White; Mage=66.93 [10.92]).

Results:

Most dyads endorsed strong interest in PET results (82.5% of both participants and partners) regardless of race or diagnosis. Black care partners were less interested in receiving the participant’s results than White care partners (χ2(4)=8.31, p=.047). Reasons for disclosure were diverse and highly personalized, including access to treatments or clinical trials (23.2% participants, 29.8% partners), advance planning (14.3% participants; 17.5% partners) and improved health knowledge (12.5% participants; 15.8% partners). In contrast, over 80% of respondents denied any risks of disclosure.

Discussion:

Results suggest that pre-disclosure education and decisional capacity assessment and a flexible disclosure approach are needed.

pmcI. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias are increasingly prevalent, with 6.7 million Americans over the age of 65 being diagnosed with Dementia-Alzheimer’s Type (DAT) in 2022 and a projected 13.8 million diagnosed by 20601. Given this prevalence, considerable research has focused on earlier detection of individuals at-risk for or with AD and development of treatments targeting the disease and its sequelae. Validation of AD biomarkers has advanced both objectives; however, rapid implementation of biomarker testing has presented an important ethical dilemma to researchers: whether and how to share biomarker results with participants with and without symptoms.

Investigators’ reticence to disclose biomarker results may arise from concerns about potential risks to the study or participant. If inconsistent, disclosure could bias participant experience or outcomes. Furthermore, a requirement to learn one’s biomarker results could hinder recruitment if those results are unwanted, though recent studies have demonstrated that required disclosure does not impact willingness to engage in AD research2,3, and may actually incentivize participation4. While biomarker disclosure does not appear to result in significant adverse psychiatric events such as suicidal ideation or new-onset depression or anxiety disorders5,6, individuals learning of amyloid positivity may experience heightened distress and concern about prognosis post-feedback7. Biomarker disclosure also presents a theoretical risk of medicolegal discrimination8 (e.g., diminished eligibility or increased cost of health- or long-term care insurance based on biomarker positivity), particularly as disclosure to younger, cognitively asymptomatic individuals who are not Medicare-eligible becomes more common9.

Conversely, there is significant rationale for disclosing biomarker results. Returning research results to participants may promote respect for autonomy and transparency10, which may be particularly critical for building trust with communities underrepresented in and historically violated through clinical research11. Learning one’s biomarker status may also catalyze health behavior change, treatment and clinical trial engagement, caregiver preparation, and advance planning12. Translation from the lab to the clinic is forthcoming; while more consideration is needed before biomarker testing is implemented in primary care13, specialists report that biomarker testing is useful for diagnostic clarification14,15, impacts clinical management16, and does not negatively impact patient mental health or patient-provider rapport15.

Despite the growing evidence in support of disclosure, the development of practice standards or protocols for returning AD biomarker results has lagged behind implementation of biomarker testing. While workgroups such as the Advisory Group on Risk Evidence Education in Dementia (AGREED)17 have formed, and some protocols and guidelines have been published6,7,18–20, more information is needed before widespread research or clinical implementation can occur. Among the outstanding gaps in disclosure research is the question of how diverse individuals decide whether to engage in biomarker testing and feedback. Public knowledge of AD is lower among racial-ethnic minorities21. The belief that AD is a normal part of aging may also be more common among certain racial-ethnic or cultural groups11,22–24, and is likely to guide willingness to engage in biomarker testing.

The questions of whether participants wish to engage in disclosure, and why or why not, are central to developing biomarker disclosure protocols that balance feasibility and culturally informed tailoring. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to assess perspectives of Black and White older adults diagnosed as cognitively healthy or with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and their respective care partners, regarding disclosure of research-based positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid and tau imaging. Specifically, we evaluated (a) whether interest in learning one’s PET imaging results differed from interest in learning other research-based results, including neuropsychological testing and research diagnosis, genetic results, and structural neuroimaging results; and (b) how dyads balanced risks and benefits in deciding whether to learn their biomarker results.

II. Methods

Participants

Participants included 57 older adults (n=22 Black; n=35 White; Mage=74.28±5.98, Medu=16.33±2.75) and their respective care partners (n=19 Black; n=38 White; Mage=66.93±10.92, Medu=16.18±2.49). Participants were recruited from ‘parent’ studies at the Research Program on Cognition and Neuromodulation Based Interventions or the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, in which they were eligible to complete or had already completed PET amyloid and tau imaging. Of note, this study focused primarily on perspectives about PET imaging biomarkers, as opposed to other available biomarker tests or modalities (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid, plasma biomarkers), as only PET scan testing was available to the participants through the parent studies. Parent study protocols did not allow for disclosure of PET results to participants, meaning that participants had no expectation of receiving their amyloid and tau status when they enrolled in this study. Participants had therefore not received pre-disclosure education about the potential meaning of PET imaging results, nor risks or benefits of learning this information. As part of parent studies, participants completed neurological and neuropsychological assessment using the Uniform Data Set-Version 325 within the prior 18 months. Participants were diagnosed using the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center criteria for cognitively “normal” older adults (performance within one standard deviation of age-matched controls across all cognitive domains) or with mild cognitive impairment.26 Participants selected care partners (their caregiver, or the individual who would serve in this role if needed). Additional criteria included age (participants: 65+; partners: 18+), English-fluency, and no history of significant neurological disorder or injury, severe psychiatric disorder, or substance use disorder.

Measures

Disclosure Preferences Questionnaire.

Respondents completed a questionnaire regarding their perspectives on learning individual research results. Specifically, respondents were asked to rate their interest in the participant receiving four types of results: (1) neuropsychological performance and research diagnosis; (2) structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (3) apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype; and (4) PET amyloid and tau imaging. Care partners rated their interest in receiving the participant’s results. Likert-style response options ranged from “No Interest – I would decline this information if available” (= 0), to “Neutral” (=2), to “Strong Interest – I would request this information if available” (= 4). Additionally, respondents were asked to provide a ‘yes/no’ response to indicate whether they would elect to receive each result (e.g., “If you had to make the decision now, would you request to receive feedback about your/the participant’s personal risk for DAT based on standard clinical results?”).

Disclosure Needs Assessment Interview.

Each dyad member completed a semi-structured interview to evaluate perceived risks and benefits of engaging in PET amyloid and tau disclosure. Respondents were first provided with a list of potential benefits gathered from the literature (Table 1) and asked to select all reasons why they would wish to receive their personal PET results, with the option to describe any additional unlisted benefits. Participants then selected the primary benefit for wanting disclosure information from the list of previously identified items. A similar approach was used for potential risks of biomarker disclosure.

Procedures

The Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan Medical School approved all procedures. Dyads were consented for the study using an informed consent document and a consent capacity assessment. Participants unable to demonstrate consent capacity provided assent; their care partners provided consent on their behalf. Participants and care partners completed all procedures independently to minimize reciprocal influences on answers. We counter-balanced the order of the questionnaire and interview to minimize ordering effects.

III. Results

Participant and Care Partner Demographic Characteristics (Table 2)

Participants did not differ in age or education based on race or diagnosis (p&gt;.05). While the proportion of male and female participants did not differ based on race, there were more women in the cognitively healthy participant group (69.7% female) and more men in the aMCI group (62.5% male; χ2=5.50, p=.030). White participants had statistically (t(55)=−2.33, p=.023) but not clinically significantly (mean difference = 1 point) higher depressive symptoms at baseline, and anxiety was similar in both groups. Average age of care partners did not differ by race; however, White care partners had higher education than Black care partners (t(55) = −2.52, p=.015). There were no differences in employment status, last-year-working or current household income, health insurance coverage, access to providers, or unmet medical needs among participants or care partners based on race or diagnosis.

Disclosure Preferences

Most participants indicated strong interest in disclosure of all research results, with no significant difference in interest level based on race. Overall, 56 (98.2%) would elect to receive cognitive results and research diagnosis, 54 (94.7%) would receive structural MRI results, 55 (96.5%) would receive their APOE genotype, and 56 (98.2%) would receive PET amyloid and tau results. The proportion of participants who indicated a choice to receive results did not differ by race or diagnosis. A summary of participant disclosure preferences by race is available in Table 3.

Although most care partners demonstrated a similar interest in their respective participant’s research results (Table 3), notable race differences were observed. Though 53 (94.7%) of care partners would elect to receive the participant’s cognitive results and research diagnosis, Black care partners reported significantly lower interest in these results compared to White care partners (χ2 = 7.59, p=.040). Similarly, 51 (89.5%) of care partners would elect to receive the participant’s PET results; however, Black care partners reported significantly lower interest in these results compared to White care partners (χ2 = 8.31, p=.047). Though not statistically significant, similar trends were observed for MRI results (93.0% interest; Black&lt;White interest: χ2 = 8.27, p=.053) and APOE genotype (89.5% interest; Black&lt;White interest: χ2 = 8.04, p=.066).

Disclosure Benefits and Risks

Perceived benefits and risks of AD biomarker disclosure are summarized in Table 4. Most popular benefits included the opportunity to engage in new treatments or clinical trials (96.5% of both participants and care partners), to learn more about one’s personal health (89.5% participants; 94.7% care partners), to modify health behaviors and lifestyle (82.5% participants; 78.9% care partners) and to inform long-term care plans (77.2% participants; 78.9% care partners). Chi-squared tests revealed no significant differences by race on these outcomes.

Primary benefits of disclosure (Figure 1) were notably varied, with the most common response being engagement in treatments or clinical trials (22.8% participants; 29.8% care partners). Although Fisher’s Exact tests revealed no significant difference in primary benefit selection by race, several trends emerged. Black participants more commonly endorsed ‘modifying health behaviors’ (22.7% Black; 5.7% White), while White participants were more likely to cite ‘general curiosity’ (0% Black; 11.4% White) and ‘to inform marital, relationship, or reproductive choices’ (4.5% Black; 14.30% White). Black care partners were more likely to cite ‘modifying health behaviors and lifestyle’ (15.8% Black; 5.26% White) and ‘to diminish anxiety and worry’ (21.0% Black; 7.90% White) as the primary benefit. Conversely, White care partners were more likely to cite treatments and clinical trial engagement (21.1% Black; 34.2% White) and ‘to inform long-term care plans’ (5.3% Black; 23.7% White).

In contrast, respondents endorsed few risks of disclosure, with only ‘increased anxiety’ (10.5% participants; 12.3% care partners) endorsed by &gt;10% of respondents. The majority of respondents (75.4% of participants and care partners) chose not to endorse any risks. Similarly, most participants (77.3% Black; 82.9% White) and care partners (79.0% Black; 81.6% White) denied any primary risks. Fisher’s Exact tests revealed no significant differences in risk endorsement by race.

Exploratory Analyses by Diagnosis

Analyses comparing responses by participant diagnosis (cognitively healthy versus MCI) found no significant differences in participant or care partner interest in or perceived benefits of PET disclosure. Perceived risks of disclosure were also similar between the diagnostic groups with one exception: none of the cognitively healthy participants (n=33) endorsed concerns about a lack of available treatments, as compared to 5 (20.8%) of those with MCI (χ2=7.54, p=.01).

IV. Discussion

This study evaluated the perspectives of Black and White older adults who were either cognitively healthy or diagnosed with MCI, and their respective care partners, regarding learning individual AD research results. We found that participants and care partners were highly motivated to receive all types of results, including cognitive test results and research diagnosis, structural MRI findings, APOE genotype, and the more experimental PET amyloid and tau imaging results. These findings are consistent with prior research demonstrating that both cognitively asymptomatic27,28 and symptomatic12 individuals strongly desire findings from genetic or biomarker testing for AD. Interest in research results was consistent for participants, regardless of race or diagnosis. In contrast, while White care partners firmly desired their loved one’s research results, Black care partners showed slightly less interest overall. Though not statistically significant in this small sample, 20% more Black care partners endorsed ‘general curiosity’ as a reason for disclosure, potentially indicating a less specific purpose or less pressing ‘need’ for the biomarker information. Furthermore, Black care partners trended towards more frequent concerns about participant distress and relationship change secondary to receiving results, as well as an inability to act on any knowledge of increased risk for DAT. Therefore, this finding may represent an unclear sense of the utility of the information balanced with more prominent concerns about negative consequences.

Findings also demonstrate that individuals have varied reasons for wanting an early AD diagnosis, even in the absence of symptoms. The most commonly endorsed benefits mirrored those cited in prior studies of genetic or biomarker disclosure27,28: using the information to inform health behavior change, treatment planning or research engagement, or advance planning, or simply to augment personal health knowledge. They also mirror actual benefits reported post-disclosure12,29. For instance, a study of 38 individuals with MCI who underwent PET amyloid imaging and disclosure found that participants reported better post-disclosure understanding of their health status and used their result to make practical arrangements, adjust medications, and participate more in life and relationships12. Our findings also confirm that, irrespective of race or diagnosis, participants see biomarker disclosure as a critical stepping-stone to accessing new treatments or clinical trials2,30,31.

With few exceptions, participants and care partners rarely endorsed concerns about deleterious effects of learning the participant’s PET amyloid and tau status. Over three-quarters of respondents endorsed perceiving no risk that would inhibit them from wanting this information. This finding replicates the conclusion of a 2018 study by Lingler and colleagues29 of individuals who had undergone amyloid imaging within an AD trial; few participants or care partners offered concerns about disclosure risks, suggesting a disproportionate weighting of benefits. While disclosure appears to be ‘safe’ in that it rarely drives a clinically significant exacerbation of mental health symptoms or suicidal ideation, it is not without potential negative psychological effects, including decreased subjective memory performance32, test-related distress7, and ambiguous future time perspective33. There are also practical risks to consider, including medicolegal and other forms of discrimination based on dissemination of the results9.

These findings have important implications for clinical research. First, our study supports an ardent desire for AD health information among older adults and their families. Particularly as blood-based biomarker development accelerates translation into the clinic (and a looming likelihood of direct-to-consumer biomarker testing), we must establish appropriate use criteria. Our finding of near-universal interest in receiving research results also necessitates empirically supported protocols for disclosure within clinical trials. Not only is this step important for ethical reasons, it may also enhance recruitment, particularly among underrepresented groups. With that said, the broad range of motivations for disclosure among diverse older adults creates a distinct challenge for AD researchers utilizing biomarker testing. Frameworks or ‘toolkits’ for disclosure may be particularly useful for balancing the protocolization needed for feasibility and trial design with the flexibility needed to tailor to these diverse disclosure motivations. Our findings suggest that participants may expect or need certain resources following disclosure, including access to specialty care and advance planning supports. Given limitations present in research settings, study disclosure teams should communicate parameters (e.g., inability to place referrals), as part of the consent process and facilitate pathways to obtaining needed resources outside of the study. The finding that both participants and care partners may not know or de-emphasize risks of disclosure highlights the importance of thorough pre-disclosure education of both benefits and risks. Specifically, disclosure protocols should emphasize both the potential positive and negative implications on psychological health, treatment, and advance planning. Additionally, we did not find that cognitively healthy older adults were more likely to consider or weigh risks compared to those with MCI. This finding emphasizes the need for careful assessment of decisional capacity for disclosure, regardless of whether the audience has cognitive impairment.

There are several limitations of this study. First, it is critical to note that race is a social construct and a proxy for the cumulative effects of social and environmental factors. While the patterns of differences noted for Black care partners in this study are important to note, future studies should focus on the pathways through which differences in disclosure preferences – and eventually reactions – arise. Although we planned to explore the impact of social factors on disclosure preferences in this study, there was insufficient variability within our sample, wherein most participants reported high education and socioeconomic status, secure insurance coverage (Medicare), and strong social support. As pandemic-related restrictions continue to lift, we are increasing community-engaged research strategies to ensure that future samples will be more representative of the broader community, and the social, environmental and health influences they experience. Prior research, including this study, has also predominantly recruited individuals who have participated in other Alzheimer’s disease research – those who tend to be more medically and psychiatrically stable, have a personal or family concern about AD, and are highly health literate. Future studies should focus on how broader communities consider, experience, and react to disclosure. Given sampling biases described above, our findings do not necessarily represent how older adults and their care partners may make actual biomarker testing decisions once they receive appropriate pre-disclosure education. Finally, a significant innovation of this study is that we focused primarily on individuals who had already completed or were scheduled to complete PET scans for amyloid and tau (as opposed to those considering hypothetical disclosure), as we felt this sample would provide insight on how dyads make weigh biomarker disclosure decisions in the context of their real, current life and health as opposed to a hypothetical time in the future. While this sample selection allowed us to better understand perspectives on PET testing and disclosure specifically, findings may not translate to other biomarkers like cerebrospinal fluid or plasma-based amyloid and tau. While we suspect that the perceived benefits and risks of learning other biomarker information are likely similar, these alternate biomarker tests come with different procedures, public familiarity and acceptance, and validity. Future studies must investigate perceptions of different biomarker tests, particularly as plasma-based biomarker testing is quickly being made available in specialty care, primary care, and even direct-to-consumer settings. The AGREED group is also addressing the need for public education about the broad strengths, limitations, risks and benefits of multi-modal AD biomarker testing through the development of universal decision guides and decisional support tools (see https://www.agreedementia.org/education/).

Despite these limitations, the study represents one of few efforts to understand whether, how, and why older adults might want biomarker testing and other research results. This question is essential to preparing for greater implementation of biomarker testing in AD clinical trials, as well as the imminent translation into clinical practice. Additionally, our paper is one of few to take the more ecologically relevant approach of incorporating both participant and care partner responses. We rarely make important health decisions in isolation; therefore, having information about how patients and trusted others think about the utility of biomarker testing is crucial. Finally, to our knowledge, ours is the first paper to evaluate this question from the perspective of racial differences. Future studies will continue to build on this preliminary work to better understand how cultural norms, religious or spiritual beliefs, communication styles, and other factors may inform person-centered biomarker disclosure.
