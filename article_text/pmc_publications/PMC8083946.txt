Background:

Coherent 40 Hz (gamma) neural oscillation indicates healthy brain activity and is known to be disrupted in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. 40 Hz entrainment by flickering light is known to significantly attenuate AD pathology in mice.

Objective:

To demonstrate the feasibility of using a lighting intervention to promote coherent 40 Hz neural oscillation, improved working memory performance, and reduced subjective sleepiness among a population of healthy young adults. If successful, the intervention could be extended to address cognitive impairment associated with mild cognitive impairment and AD.

Methods:

Nine healthy participants (median age 22 years, five females) were exposed to one of two lighting conditions per session in a within-subjects counterbalanced manner. The study’s two sessions were separated by 1 week. Custom-built light masks provided either a 40Hz flickering red light (FRL) intervention or a dark control condition (i.e., total darkness, light mask not energized) at participants’ eyes. Data were collected four times per session: pre-exposure, after 25-min exposure, after 50-min exposure, and post-exposure. Each data collection period included a Karolinska Sleepiness Scale report, an electroencephalogram, and working memory (n-back) auditory performance testing.

Results:

The FRL intervention induced a significant increase in 40 Hz power and a modest increase in low gamma power. The intervention had no significant impact on working memory performance and subjective sleepiness compared to the control. However, increases in 40 Hz power were significantly correlated with reduced subjective sleepiness.

Conclusion:

The results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of using a flickering light to increase 40 Hz power.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects approximately 5.8 million Americans and is currently listed as the fifth leading cause of death among people aged 65 years and older in the United States [1]. A neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by pervasive and progressive cognitive and functional impairments, AD has been associated with abnormal aggregation of the proteins amyloid β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau accompanied by brain inflammation in the form of microglial activation [2].

Although they are effective for temporarily alleviating the symptoms of AD, pharmacological agents do not presently avail a cure for the disease [3, 4]. Recent years have seen a growing interest in non-pharmacological treatments for AD and its related symptoms, particularly those involving the modulation of neural oscillations [5, 6], which have been shown to regulate Aβ concentrations [7, 8].

Neural oscillations are observed in all animals and are thought to reflect rhythmic activity of large populations of neurons. This rhythmic firing causes fluctuations in cortical local field potentials that can be measured via electroencephalography (EEG). Gamma (30–100 Hz) oscillations, particularly at 40 Hz, have been shown to be related to many sensory and cognitive functions [9]. Research indicates that coherent 40 Hz neural oscillation is a fundamental frequency of healthy brain activity [10] and is believed to play a role in attentional selection and memory operations [11]. Conversely, the power of gamma activity is known to be disrupted in AD patients [12] and transgenic animal models [13].

Intrinsic neural oscillations not only modulate responses to stimuli, but also synchronize with the rhythm of exogenous coercive signals like light, sound [14], and transcranial electric stimulation [15]. The fact that the frequency and timing of ongoing oscillations can be entrained by external rhythmic stimuli [16] holds great promise for functionally meaningful interventions that may provide therapeutic benefits for populations such as AD patients [12].

Another important feature of oscillatory activity, apart from power, is neuronal coherence between frequency bands that leads to cross-frequency coupling. As a critical component of healthy cognitive functioning [17], cross-frequency coupling between the phase of theta (4–8 Hz) and the amplitude of gamma (30–55 Hz) correlates with working memory processes [18]. Tort, et al. [19] showed that the strength of theta–gamma coupling is directly correlated with an increase in performance accuracy during learning sessions in a rat model. In humans, Goodman, et al. [20] assessed theta-gamma coupling in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. They found that AD participants had the lowest level of coupling (followed by MCI and then control participants) during a 2-back visual performance task, suggesting a relationship between working memory deficits and altered coupling in individuals with AD and MCI [20].

A recent study by Iaccarino, et al. [21] demonstrated that 40 Hz flickering light effectively decreased amyloid levels as well as plaque pathology in the visual cortex of a 6-month-old AD transgenic mouse model. Importantly, that study also showed that increasing gamma oscillations using 40 Hz optogenetic or visual stimulation induced gene expression changes and morphological transformation of microglia [21], with a significant increase in microglia cell body diameter. They showed that 40 Hz flickering light promoted microglia–Aβ interactions, resulting in less Aβ plaque accumulation. To date, however, none of the findings in this line of inquiry have proven to be translatable to humans. Ismail, et al. [22], for example, attempted to replicate the positive effect of a 40 Hz entrainment in humans by exposing six Aβ-positive AD patients to a daily, 2-h of dose of 40 Hz flickering light for 10 days, but found no effect on Aβ load in the participants’ primary visual cortex or any other brain region [22].

Encouraged by the findings of Iaccarino, et al. [21], the present study explored the use of a non-invasive light stimulus to promote coherent 40 Hz neural oscillation and cross-frequency coupling during the afternoon. Narrowband long-wavelength (red) light was selected for the intervention because our previous research has demonstrated that red light provides an alerting effect in the afternoon [23] and has a minimal effect on human circadian rhythms [24–26]. This study explored three hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that the red light intervention would increase power at 40 Hz and in the gamma range (30–55 Hz), and that theta-gamma coupling would be greater after the intervention compared to the dark experimental control. Second, we hypothesized that the intervention would improve performance in n-back working memory tasks and reduce subjective sleepiness, compared to a dark control. Third, we hypothesized that the intervention would be most effective for stimulating the parietal and occipital lobes of the brain, where the visual cortex is located.

The present research is primarily intended to demonstrate the feasibility of using light to promote coherent 40 Hz neural oscillation and cross-frequency coupling among a population of cognitively intact, healthy young adults. If effective in this population, it would not be unreasonable to expect that the intervention could be extended to addressing cognitive impairment associated with MCI and AD.

MATERIALS AND METHOD

Participants

Eleven participants who met the following inclusion criteria completed the study: (1) no color blindness, as determined by the Ishihara color vision test [27]; (2) no reports of head injury, neurological disease (e.g., epilepsy, seizures, and migraine), or any form of psychological disorder; (3) no reports of eye disease, previous eye surgery, or a history of eye injury or trauma; (4) no daily use of any type of medication; (5) neither an extremely late (i.e., score of 6) nor an extremely early (i.e., score of zero) chronotype according to the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) [28]; and (6) no experience of shift work or travel between time zones for 1 month prior to or during the experiment.

Participants were asked to abstain from alcohol and caffeine for 12 h before the start of the experimental sessions. They were also asked to maintain a regular sleep-wake schedule throughout the experiment, requiring bedtimes by 23:00 and wake times by 07:00, and refrain from napping on the day of the experiment. To verify compliance, the participants wore an actigraph (Actiwatch Spectrum Plus, Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA) on their non-dominant wrist and maintained a sleep log beginning 1 week prior to their first session and continuing through to the end of the experiment.

The data for two participants who failed to comply with the experimental procedure were excluded from the analyses. Thus, results are reported for nine (five females) participants (age range = 19–26 years, median age = 22 years). The participants’ mean MCTQ score was 4.1 (SD 0.8), indicating a slightly late chronotype.

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [29] and was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. There was minimal risk of harm to the participants, as no known safety risks are associated with the devices used in the study and all comply with federal regulations regarding electromagnetic and radio interference.

Lighting conditions

Two lighting conditions were employed in a within-subjects counterbalanced manner: (1) flickering red light (FRL) intervention and (2) dark (D) experimental control. The FRL intervention was delivered to participants using a light mask housing 60 red LEDs (peak wavelength = 628 nm, full width at half maximum = 13 nm), with 30 LEDs directed at each eye (Fig. 1). The masks provided 270 photopic lux, on average, at participants’ open eyes. The flicker frequency of the light mask was 40 Hz, and the light was presented in successive on and off modes for 10-s durations with a 50 % duty cycle (i.e., 12.5 ms light-on and 12.5 ms light-off) during the intervention. For the D condition, participants wore the light mask during the entire session but it was not energized. In both conditions, participants’ eyes were completely covered by the light masks. To minimize any possible light leakage from the experimental room’s ambient illumination during the data collection periods, the room’s light levels were adjusted to provide &lt; 1 lux at the participants’ eye level (i.e., on the vertical plane, 1.2 m above the floor).

EEG

Electroencephalographic recordings were taken four times per experimental session using a BioSemi ActiveTwo system (BioSemi, Amsterdam, NL). Prior to each session, electrodes were applied to the participants’ scalps according to the international 10–20 system [30]. Four electrodes were placed along the midline of participants’ crania at locations Fz (frontal), Cz (central), Pz (parietal), and Oz (occipital). Reference electrodes were placed on the earlobes at locations A1 and A2. The common mode sense and driven right leg electrodes were placed on participants’ foreheads, forming a feedback loop that drove the average potential of the participant (common mode voltage) as close as possible to the analog-to-digital reference voltage in the analog-digital-box. To record blinking, an electrode was placed under each participant’s right eye for electrooculographic (EOG) measurements.

Auditory working memory tasks (n-back)

To provide assessments of working memory while experiencing the lighting conditions, participants underwent a series of 8-min auditory n-back performance testing blocks comprised two levels of difficulty (i.e., 2-back and 3-back), each presented in two separate 4-min trials. Each n-back trial presented a continuous auditory stream of eight English consonants (C, D, G, K, P, Q, T, V), differentially sequenced and spoken by a female voice, for 4 min. Participants were instructed to respond whenever the current consonant (i.e., the target) was the same as a target presented n (i.e., two or three) positions back in the sequence, depending on which trial was being presented. Each consonant was presented for 500 ms, separated by an interstimulus interval of 4 s, over the course of the entire trial. All trials included a matched number of targets (30%) and non-targets (70%), as well as distractors (e.g., 2-back targets in a 3-back trial). The 2-back and 3-back trials in the testing blocks were counterbalanced between participants. Examples of the experiment’s n-back trial types are provided in Fig. 2.

Participants were instructed to respond to the targets as quickly and accurately as possible by clicking the right mouse button with their right index finger. (All participants were right-handed.) Responses were not required for non-targets. Correct responses were scored as hits, and incorrect responses were scored as false alarms. Five participants started the experiment with the 2-back and then completed the 3-back task. The remaining four participants performed tasks in the reverse order.

Subjective sleepiness

Participants were asked to verbally report a Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) [31] score four times per experimental session (see Procedure). The KSS outcome prompts participants to rate how sleepy or alert they are feeling on a scale ranging from 1 to 9, where 1 = “very alert,” 3= “rather alert,” 5= “neither alert nor sleepy,” 7= “sleepy, but no difficulty remaining awake,” and 9 = “very sleepy, fighting sleep, an effort to remain awake.”

Procedure

Participants attended an orientation session at the Lighting Research Center (LRC) laboratory 1 week prior to their first experimental session. They were provided with a consent form, and the experimenters explained the EEG preparation procedure and experimental protocol. Participants experienced one of two experimental conditions during each experimental session. The sessions were separated by 1 week and counterbalanced across participants to avoid order effects, but due to subjects removals, the final data set had six participants experiencing the FRL intervention first, and three participants experiencing the D condition first.

On the day of each session, participants arrived at the LRC laboratory at 13:00 for verification of their regular sleep schedules and EEG preparation. After electrode placement, each participant was seated in an office chair at a computer desk furnished with a chinrest. Participants were instructed to adjust the chinrest’s height to a comfortable position and provided with a dedicated light mask to be worn throughout the experimental session. Participants wore a dedicated pair of earphones (MC5 Noise-Isolating in-Ear Stereo Headphones, Etymotic Research, Elk Grove Village, IL) during the entire session to receive auditory prompts.

Sessions started at 14:00 with staggered, 4-min intervals between participants’ start times. Participants were asked to remain awake and keep their eyes open during the entire session. They were also asked to refrain from body movement and excessive blinking during EEG recordings to avoid the occurrence of EOG artifacts in the EEG data. Each experimental session was broken up into five segments: (1) first adaptation (10 min), (2) pre-exposure (15 min), (3) intervention/control (65 min), (4) second adaptation (10 min), and (5) post-exposure (15 min). The experimental protocol is shown in Fig. 3.

All participants were kept in darkness (i.e., the light masks were not energized) during the first adaptation, followed by a data collection period (non-overlapping verbal report of KSS score, 3-min EEG recording, and 8-min performance testing block), designated T1, that occurred during the pre-exposure. During the intervention/control, participants experienced either the FRL intervention or the D control and underwent two additional data collection periods beginning 25 (T2) and 50 (T3) min after initiation of the intervention/control. Participants then experienced the second adaptation, followed by the post-exposure and final data collection period (T4).

Data analyses

All EEG data analyses were performed using MATLAB (version 2019a, MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Values from two reference channels were averaged together and subtracted from all four channels positioned on the z line (i.e., Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz). A 0.3–100 Hz bandpass filter was used to remove signals outside of the relevant frequency band.

Data were then grouped into 2-s epochs with a 1-s overlap between each epoch (e.g., epoch 1 is 0–2 s, epoch 2 is 1–3 s, etc.). Any epochs with fluctuations exceeding ±100 μV on the Fz, Pz, Cz, or Oz channels or 40 μV on the EOG channel were removed from the analysis. A 10% cosine window followed by a fast Fourier transform was then applied to each epoch. This process yielded spectral power distributions from 0.3 to 100 Hz in 0.5 Hz intervals. The power spectra from each epoch were then averaged together to yield average power spectra at the 40 Hz, 4–8 Hz (theta), and 30–55 Hz (low gamma) frequency ranges at each electrode position for each trial. Entrainment to the 40 Hz rhythmic stimulation was assessed in terms of increases in power at 40 Hz.

Theta-gamma coupling was assessed using the modulation index (MI), wherein each phase of theta (0–360° interval) was binned into eighteen 20° intervals. The standard Hilbert transform was applied to obtain time series of theta phases and amplitude envelope of low gamma. The composite time series was then constructed, which yielded the amplitude of low gamma oscillation at each phase of the theta rhythm. The average amplitude of gamma at each theta bin was calculated and normalized by dividing each bin value by the sum over the bins, resulting in the phase-amplitude distribution function. The MI of gamma amplitude by theta phase was then calculated by measuring the divergence of the observed amplitude distribution from a uniform distribution following Equation 1 [19]. (1) MI=logN-HP/logN

where N is the number of phase bins, log(N) represents the maximal possible entropy value, and P is the relative amplitude distribution.

H(P) is the entropy of the P distribution that is calculated using the formula shown in Equation 2.

(2) HP= -∑j=1NPjlogPj

If averaged amplitude is uniformly distributed over the phases, then MI = 0.

Decrease in entropy H(P) results in higher MI, for which the maximum value is 1.

Performance outcomes included mean reaction times (for hits only) and accuracy (Pr, proportion of hits minus false alarms [32]) serving as dependent variables. Pr was calculated using the formula shown in Equation 3. (3) Pr=H-FA

where H, the hit rate, is the conditional probability of responding correctly to target stimuli (i.e., the ratio of hits/number of target stimuli) and FA, the false alarm rate, is the conditional probability of responding to non-target stimuli (i.e., the ratio of responses to non-target stimuli/number of non-target stimuli).

Statistical analyses

For all EEG measures, data were first normalized to the power obtained during at T1 (see Fig. 3) to obtain the relative change over time within each condition. A two (condition) × four (electrode position) × three (data collection period) repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) was then performed using the normalized data. For the KSS and performance outcomes, data collected during intervention/control (T2, T3) and post-exposure (T4) were normalized to T1, and a two (condition) × three (data collection period) ANOVA was performed. Two-tailed paired Student’s t-tests were performed when the ANOVA revealed significant effects due to main factors (i.e., condition, data collection period, electrode position) and/or their interactions. Further analyses were not performed, however, for electrode position × data collection period interactions because they lay outside the study’s focus. Given that the number of comparisons performed were fewer in number than those that were allowable, no multiple-comparison corrections were made. Mauchly's Test of Sphericity was used to verify the assumption of sphericity in the ANOVA results. Greenhouse–Geisser corrections [33] were applied to all repeated measures effects and the corresponding degrees of freedom were provided, where assumption of sphericity had been violated (i.e., Mauchly's Test of Sphericity was significant at p &lt; 0.05). Partial eta squared (ηp2) and Cohen’s d are reported as measures of effect size for significant differences.

RESULTS

EEG

Power spectral density (PSD)

The PSDs for the intervention/control in the 10–90 Hz range at each electrode position are shown in Fig. 4. While no peaks appear at 40 Hz during the pre- (T1) and post-exposure (T4) data collection periods, significant 40 Hz activity during T2 and T3 demonstrates that the FRL induced a clear 40 Hz modulation response. As hypothesized, the highest amplitude 40 Hz peaks were observed at electrode positions Pz and Oz. The 60 Hz peak shown at all electrode positions was generated by electrical line interference, which had no effect in our analyses since the study focused on the low gamma frequency range (i.e., 30–55 Hz).

40 Hz power

The ANOVA showed a statistically significant three-way interaction of condition × data collection period × electrode position (F1.63,13.07 = 5.514, p = 0.023, ηp2 = 0.408). Since the result of Mauchly’s test was statistically significant (χ220 = 91.950, p = &lt; 0.001, ε = 0.270), the degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity. Pairwise comparisons indicated that normalized 40 Hz power was significantly greater in the FRL intervention compared to the D condition during T2 and T3 at each electrode position (Fig. 5). Paired comparisons did not show significant differences between the FRL intervention and D condition during T4 at any electrode position, suggesting that power in FRL intervention decreased to that in the D condition after removal of the stimulus. Table 1 shows the pairwise comparisons between the FRL intervention and D condition for each electrode position by data collection period.

Low gamma and theta power

The ANOVA for low gamma power showed a statistically significant three-way interaction of condition × data collection period × electrode position (F6,48= 2.539, p = 0.032, ηp2 = 0.241). The result of Mauchly’s test was statistically significant (χ220 = 51.650, p &lt; 0.001, ε = 0.310), but the Greenhouse-Geisser correction indicated that the interaction was not statistically significant (p = 0.116). Post hoc comparisons, however, revealed that the normalized low gamma power was significantly greater in the FRL intervention than in the D condition during T2 (t8= 2.321, p = 0.049, d = 0.747) and T3 (t8= 2.562, p = 0.034, d = 0.854) for the Oz electrodes.

The ANOVA for theta power showed a significant two-way interaction of data collection period × electrode position (F2, 20 = 5.460, p = 0.009, ηp2 = 0.406); the degrees of freedom were adjusted due to sphericity violation (χ220 = 35.87, p = 0.028, ε = 0.420).

The modulation index for theta-gamma coupling showed neither significant main effects nor interactions between the variables.

Auditory working memory tasks (n-back)

The ANOVA for normalized mean reaction times in the working memory tasks revealed no significant main effects or interactions. A significant two-way condition × data collection period interaction was revealed for the 2-back accuracy (F2,16 = 4.794, p = 0.023, ηp2 = 0.375) but not for the 3-back accuracy. Paired comparisons did not reveal significant differences in accuracy between the FRL intervention and D condition for any data collection period.

Subjective sleepiness (KSS)

The ANOVA for subjective sleepiness identified a statistically significant two-way interaction of condition × data collection period (F2,16 = 4.992, p = 0.021, ηp2 = 0.384). Although the normalized KSS scores were lower (indicating less sleepiness) during exposure to the FRL intervention compared to the D condition, none of the post hoc comparisons reached statistical significance.

Statistically significant correlations between normalized KSS and normalized 40 Hz power were identified at each electrode position (Fig. 6). Normalized KSS scores were highly correlated with FRL-induced 40 Hz entrainment for Pz at T2; Fz and Oz at T3; and Cz at both T2 and T3. No statistically significant correlations were identified for any electrode positions at T4 (Table 2).

DISCUSSION

The present results demonstrated that 40 Hz flickering light delivered to healthy young adult participants’ eyes can induce a significant increase in 40 Hz power, as measured by EEG. A more modest increase in low gamma power was also observed. As hypothesized, the largest entrainment effects were measured at the Oz and Pz electrode positions, which recorded responses close to the primary visual cortex. Though less pronounced, the entrainment effect observed at the remaining electrode positions, including Fz, suggested a spread in this effect that extended to frontal brain activity.

A recent study by Jones, et al. [34] showed that a ring of 10 white-light LEDs flickering at 40 Hz was effective for modulating 40 Hz brain activity in healthy participants. The authors also demonstrated that entrainment to the 40 Hz stimuli was greater at the higher of the study’s two light levels and, consistent with the present results, the entrainment response was most pronounced in the primary visual cortex. The Jones, et al. [34] study, however, was limited by a very small sample size (three healthy participants) and intra-individual differences in responses to the stimuli. Indeed, two discrete applications of the same stimuli on the same individual showed variations in entrainment between the first and second runs. Moreover, Jones and colleagues applied the stimulus for 30 seconds while in our study, the stimulus was applied for 50 minutes with no evidence of adaptation to the stimulus, which was one of the concerns Jones and colleagues raised concerning their own study.

The present results may be of considerable significance for MCI and AD patients, given that 40 Hz oscillations have been associated with decreased Aβ levels and plaque pathology in the visual cortex of a 6-month-old AD transgenic mouse model [21]. Since these findings have not been translated from animal models to humans, further examination of this line of evidence should certainly be an important next step in this research area.

The present study is novel in its use of red light and, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has shown the effectiveness of red light on 40 Hz entrainment. Previous studies conducted by our laboratory showed an acute alerting effect of constant red light during both day and night, but no effect on 40 Hz activity was observed [23, 24, 35, 36]. The main reason for not achieving a 40 Hz entrainment with constant red light might be that the stimulus’s frequency should match the frequency of the targeted brain oscillation. In the present study, therefore, we didn’t see any benefit in adding a constant red light condition to the experimental protocol.

Another advantage proffered by the use of red light, apart from its acute alerting effect, is that the human circadian system is less sensitive to red light compared to other visible light spectra, as measured by nocturnal melatonin suppression. Considering the sleep/wake irregularities and circadian disruption documented in AD patients [37], should its effectiveness be proven, 40 Hz flickering red light could prove to be an effective nighttime lighting intervention that does not affect the circadian system.

The present study revealed an interesting significant negative correlation between power at 40 Hz and subjective sleepiness, wherein an increase in 40 Hz power reduced subjective sleepiness. The observed negative correlation between gamma power and subjective sleepiness might be explained by the interaction of gamma oscillation and adenosine levels. Adenosine is a naturally occurring nucleoside that builds up during periods of activity. In a mouse model, it was shown that adenosine levels powerfully modulated the strength of hippocampal gamma oscillations, and that an increase in gamma oscillations might contribute to the increased alertness and cognitive benefits reported with caffeine consumption [38]. It is important to note, however, that our study was conducted at a time (i.e., during the post-lunch dip) when red light has been shown to be effective for reducing subjective sleepiness [23], and the FRL intervention itself may have mediated these effects. In view of studies that have documented excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with mild and advanced AD [39], future studies should therefore investigate whether the positive effects of flickering red light on measures of daytime sleepiness can be translated to patients with AD. Such studies might also better explain the mechanisms behind the association between gamma oscillation and subjective sleepiness. In that case, it will be important to compare the constant red light and the FRL intervention because it would be impossible to determine which condition elicited the KSS response observed in the present study.

Contrary to our expectations, the FRL intervention had no impact on the study’s working memory (n-back) tasks, perhaps because the participants were well-rested (i.e., not sleep-deprived), healthy young adults. In view of a potential ceiling effect in this population, it would be interesting to repeat the study in a population of older adults with MCI, where there is greater room for improvement in cognitive performance. Nor did the induced 40 Hz entrainment lead to an improvement in theta-gamma coupling. Since it known that theta-gamma coupling is impaired in AD and MCI patients compared to healthy individuals, future studies should also examine the effects of 40 Hz entrainment on theta-gamma coupling in a cognitively impaired population.

The present study has several noteworthy limitations, the foremost being its small sample size. The study’s results warrant replication in a larger population. Second, as noted above, the study’s population was composed of healthy, young adults. It is important that these findings be replicated in a sample of older adults with MCI and AD. Third, apart from continuously monitored EOG recordings and observed participant behaviors such as their readily discernible, immediate responses to the study’s auditory prompts, the participants’ eyes being covered with the light mask did not allow us to confirm that the stimuli were delivered to open eyes, despite periodic auditory reminders for participants to keep their eyes open. Given the strong increase in power in the 40 Hz observed among the participants, however, it is reasonable to assume that their eyes remained open throughout the entire session. To avoid this ambiguity, future studies should explore alternative methods for delivering the flickering light to participants’ eyes.

The present results nonetheless constitute an important initial step in this new area of research. The feasibility of using a flickering light to increase 40 Hz power has been clearly demonstrated. Future studies should employ patients with MCI and AD to further investigate whether the results of animal studies can be successfully translated to humans.
