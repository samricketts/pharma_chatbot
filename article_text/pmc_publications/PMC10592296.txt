INTRODUCTION:

Among older adults, total and hospitalized infection may be associated with incidence of all-cause and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementias, with variation by cardiovascular health.

METHODS:

We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine relationships between ICD-10-specific viral and bacterial infectious agents and incident all-cause and AD dementia among 355,046 UK Biobank participants ≥ 50 years at baseline. Life’s Essential 8 (LE8) index reflected cardiovascular health .

RESULTS:

In both sexes, total infection burden (yes vs. no) was associated with all-cause dementia, with significant interactions by LE8 tertiles, whereby this relationship was significant only in the lowest LE8 tertile. Hospital-treated infection burden (yes vs. no) was significantly related to all-cause and AD dementia, with no significant interaction with LE8 tertile. Age group patterns were detected.

DISCUSSION:

AD and all-cause dementia were related to hospital-treated infections, while cardiovascular health modifies the relationship of total infection burden with all-cause dementia.

pmc1. BACKGROUND

Although dementia is among the leading causes of disability and death in older adults, especially in developed countries, its etiology remains elusive and appears to be multifactorial in nature[1-3]. There is growing evidence that exposure to viral and bacterial infections such as herpesviruses, gastrointestinal microorganisms, oral bacterial species, Chlamydia pneumonia, and spirochetes, may be associated with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD)[1]. Whereas pathophysiological mechanisms linking these infectious agents to AD-related dementia necessitate further elucidation, it is hypothesized that host immune response to these infectious agents may trigger or accelerate AD processes, which include the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ), pathogenic tau protein, and neuroinflammation[1]. Infectious agents and their associated molecules may penetrate leaky blood-brain barriers, accelerate Aβ deposition, thereby inducing neurotoxic activation of microglia, and leading to a vicious cycle of neurodegeneration that is induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), especially in brain areas with AD pathology[2]. Past research has simultaneously implicated infectious disease and inflammation as potential culprits since genes linked to inflammatory processes were also linked to dementia, systemic inflammation was related to cognitive decline and infection was associated with new-onset dementia[4]. Although evidence exists from animal models that specific viruses (e.g. herpes simplex virus type 1, 14 and 15) can cause AD pathologies, driving accumulation of plaques and tangles, based on the germ hypothesis, evidence in human studies remains limited and inconsistent[4]. Alternative explanations include the antimicrobial protection model of AD which suggests that Aβ accumulates in response to these infectious agents and the inflammation hypothesis whereby systemic inflammation contributed to the development of AD and related dementias[4]. These two alternative explanations are supported by sepsis and delirium being acutely related to cognitive decline and infectious diseases (e.g., pneumonia, osteomyelitis, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, and herpes virus infections) being linked to later onset of dementia[4]. The burden of infectious disease has been explored in a handful of studies in relation to all-cause and AD-specific dementias. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether lifestyle and biological aspects that reflect cardiovascular health and that have been shown to be protective against dementia by reducing inflammation can modify the impact of infectious diseases on dementias. In fact, many of the modifiable factors identified by the Lancet commission as explaining 40% of dementia risk were cardiovascular health-related factors including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, physical inactivity, and smoking[5]. Several of those risk modifiers were shown to impact dementia occurrence at mid-life to a greater extent than in later life or vice versa. Moreover, our previous studies indicated that some infections including Helicobacter pylori and periodontal infections were associated with dementia risk differentially by both sex and age groups[6-8]. Diabetes and hypertension might threaten blood-brain barrier integrity, consequently allowing the entry of neurotoxins and potentially parts of the infectious agent into the brain [9]. Moreover, specific bacterial infections have been related to damaging of the blood-brain barrier [9]. Moreover, and as stated earlier, a compromised blood-brain barrier increases dementia risk [10]. This is coupled by some evidence that certain infectious agents can trigger early cardiovascular disease [11]. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether infection burden is associated to dementia risk across levels of cardiovascular health and whether such heterogeneity pertains more to men vs. women or at mid-life vs. in older age.

In this analysis of cohort data from the UK Biobank, we examined infection burden in relation to the incidence of all-cause and AD dementias, before and after stratifying according to cardiovascular health, and examining heterogeneity in those associations across age and sex groups. Investigating the interaction of severe infections among others with underlying cardiovascular health or lifestyle factors in relation to dementia risk, could potentially help both to elucidate mechanisms and identify groups most at risk for targeted prevention. In addition, preventing infection-related dementias caused by severe infections occurring many years prior to dementia occurrence during early adulthood years, could be aided by improving cardiovascular health status in mid-life.

2. METHODS

2.1. Database

The UK Biobank is a prospective study of &gt;500,000 adults aged 37-73 y at baseline residing in the UK, who were recruited between 2006 and 2010[12]. Study rationale and design are detailed elsewhere[13]. Participants attended the nearest of 22 assessment centers in England, Scotland, or Wales, in which they completed a questionnaire and a face-to-face interview[14]. Trained staff examined participants taking a series of phenotypic measurements and biological samples[14]. During the assessment center visit, the questionnaire was administered sequentially as a touch-screen self-completed questionnaire followed by a computer-assisted personal interview which was interviewer administered as needed. After review of questionnaires used in observational studies, clinical trials and population surveys, the UK Biobank questionnaire identified quantifiable exposures in a wide range of areas with consultation of international experts[15]. The questionnaire can be categorized into the following areas of interest: socio-demographics and occupation; lifestyle exposures (including smoking, alcohol, physical activity and diet); early life exposures; psychological state; cognitive function; family history of illness; and medical history and general health[15]. The study was approved by the Northwest Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee. This analysis was approved by the UK biobank access management team, as part of application #77963 and the project was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Institutes of Health.

2.2. Study sample selection

Of the initial 502,389 UK biobank participants, we excluded individuals aged &lt;50y, which resulted in 384,619 target participants with complete data on basic socio-demographics, mainly age and sex (Figure S1). Of those participants, 29,386 had missing data on various covariates of interest, including measures of cardiovascular health, AD polygenic risk scores, and other variables that were included in our main models. The resulting sample of 355,233 participants was further restricted to individuals who did not have prevalent dementia. After excluding 187 participants with prevalent dementia or dementia that occurred prior to baseline assessment, the final analytic sample consisted of 355,046 participants of whom incident AD and all-cause dementia over the follow-up period up to October 31st , 2021 was observed for 2,665 and 6,335, respectively.

2.3. Dementia outcomes

Focusing on algorithmically derived dementia outcomes (fields 42018 and 42020), we excluded participants whose age of occurrence was less than baseline age[16]. The algorithm used included ICD-10 codes F00 or G30 for incident diagnosis for AD, whereas several codes were used for all-cause dementia, including vascular dementia (F01, I67.3), namely A81.0, F00, F01, F02, F03, F05, G30, G31.0, G31.1, G31.8, and I67.3. Date of earliest occurrence of all-cause dementia was defined using the minimum of several date variables/fields that were available for each of the two outcomes[16]. In a sensitivity analysis, further exclusions of participants were made for follow-up times &lt; 3 years.

2.4. Infection burden

Linked hospital admission records were used to identify a primary or secondary diagnosis of infection. The following ICD-10 codes were used to identify central nervous system (CNS) infections (A17, A80-A81, A85-A89, B00.3-B00.4, B01.0-B01.1, B02.0-B02.2, B05.0-B05.1, B06.0, B2.61-B26.2, G00-G01, G02.0, G03, G04.2, G05.0-G05.1, e.g., meningitis, viral encephalitis), gastrointestinal infections (A00-A05, A08, e.g., salmonella, shigellosis), liver infections (B15-B19, e.g., hepatitis A), respiratory infections (A15-A16, A36-A38, J00-J06, J09-J18, J20-J22, e.g., pneumonia, laryngitis), sepsis (A40-A41, e.g., streptococcal sepsis), skin infections (A46, B00-B09, L00-L05, L08, e.g., cellulitis, measles), urogenital infections (N30.0, N39.0, N41.0–41.1,N71-N72, e.g., cystitis, prostatitis), and other infections (A18-A19, A31-A32, A39, A42-A44, A48-A49, B25-B27, B30, B33-B34, B95-B98, H62.0-H62.1, H67.0-H67.1, M00, M01.0-M01.5, N61, e.g., bone infection, mastitis)[17]. Diagnoses were looked at altogether (‘any infection’), using the earliest date of occurrence (OSM 1, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for a detailed list of infection types).

Total infection burden is the count of distinct infection types using the list of earliest dates of illnesses and selecting only ICD-10 codes corresponding to infections. The UKB fields for these distinct infections are provided by the UK biobank showcase (UKB showcase: https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/search.cgi) along with the source of information. When the source of any of these infections is from hospitalization, a count for hospital-treated infection is added for this specific participant, as long as the date of earliest occurrence was before baseline assessment date. All other participants could then fall into two categories: no infections or only non-hospital treated prevalent infections, whereby one or more infection ICD-10 codes appears prior to baseline assessment and has a source that is not in the hospitalization category (e.g. mainly primary care or self-report or a combination). The two main exposures of interest were IBtotal (1=yes vs. 0=no for total prevalent infections); and IBhosp (1=yes vs. 0=no for hospital-treated prevalent infections). Another three-level exposure variable was defined as 0= No infections; 1=non-hospital-treated only; 2=hospital-treated.

2.5. Life’s essential 8

In 2010, the American Heart Association (AHA) widened its scope of interest by prioritizing wellness over illness, by defining a new measure of cardiovascular health (CVH) aiming at individual and population-level health promotion[18, 19]. CVH was defined with 7 potentially modifiable biological and lifestyle factors, that when at optimal levels, would result in greater cardiovascular disease (CVD)-free survival, longevity, and better quality of life. This measure of CVH was labelled “Life’s Simple 7” (LS7), with its 7 components including indicators of diet quality, greater physical activity, reduced cigarette smoking, lower body mass index, total cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, and optimal blood pressure levels. Using clinical thresholds that were accepted for both children and adults, each metric was categorized as poor (0), intermediate (1), or ideal (2). The overall summary score of LS7 could range from 0 (all metrics at poor levels) to 14 (all 7 metrics at ideal levels)[18, 19]. Since 2010 AHA statement was published, CVH was re-evaluated and an AHA Presidential Advisory proposed an enhanced version of CVH, reflecting advances made over a decade of research, while LS7’s methodological limitation have been remedied[19, 20]. This new measure was labeled “Life’s Essential 8” (LE8), retaining all 7 components of LS7 with major modifications to definitions and scales (described below). Sleep health was added to generate life’s essential 8 (LE8) given its known influence on CVH across the life span[19, 20], (OSM 2, Supplementary Tables 3-5, for detailed algorithm used to generate LE8 total score and description of the dietary component). Moreover, proration was applied to both components and the overall score of LE8, whereby participants with more than half of the components missing were considered to have a missing score, while those with less than half of the components missing had a prorated score applied. This method following previous guidelines applied to larger samples [21], allowed us to preserve the largest possible sample without having to resort to the computationally intensive and arbitrary character of multiple imputation. This resulted in &lt;10% missingness overall in the LE8 total and sub-scores (lifestyle and biological).

2.6. Covariates

Socio-demographic potential confounders included age, sex, race/ethnicity (White, Black, South Asian and Others) and household size. Three separate measures of socio-economic status were used: educational attainment, household income and Townsend deprivation index (TDI). A touch-screen questionnaire to elicit baseline information on educational attainment which was re-grouped based on a previous study[22] as: 0=Low, combining “None”, “CSEs/Equivalent”, “NVQ/HND/HNC/Equivalent” and “Other professional qual”; 1=Intermediate, combining “O Levels/GCSEs/Equivalent” and “A/AS Levels Equivalent”; 2=Higher level or “College/University.” Total household income before tax was categorized into 1=“&lt; £18,000”, 2=“£18,000–£29,999”, 3=“£30,000–£51,999”, 4=“£52,000–£100,000” and 5= “&gt;£100,000”. TDI scores were generated based on national census data, reflecting residential postcode-level car ownership, household overcrowding, owner occupation, and unemployment. TDI score reflects higher socioeconomic deprivation with higher TDI scores[23]. Originally coded to reflect higher socioeconomic deprivation with higher TDI scores[23], it was multiplied by −1 to reflect higher SES and combined with z-scores of education and income into one SES summary score. Proration was used for SES z-score in a similar fashion as for LE8 total score, following the 50% cutoff criteria for missingness[21].

2.7. Statistical methods

All analyses were conducted using Stata 17.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). We stratified descriptive analyses by sex. Comparison across groups were made using linear, logistic, and multinomial logit models, comparing means and proportions of variables. We defined time-to-event (in years) from age at entry ≥ 50y (i.e. delayed entry) until age of exit when event of interest or censoring (death or end of follow-up, estimated to be October 31st, 2021) occurred. Kaplan-Meier survival rates for dementia and AD-free survival across age, were estimated and compared across exposures combining total and hospital-treated infection burden: 0=None, 1=non-hospital treated only, 2=hospital treated among infections. Cox proportional hazards models were also conducted with this primary exposure of interest. A sensitivity analysis was subsequently conducted whereby deaths over the period of follow-up were excluded from the analyses using Cox proportional hazards models comparing the two levels of infection burden to the “None” referent category.

In the main analyses, we constructed Cox proportional hazards (PH) models, to test associations of infection burden (total and hospital-treated) with two dementia outcomes (all-cause and AD dementia), including only main effects, and adjusting for baseline age, sex, race/ethnicity, household size, and SES z-score. LE8 total score was adjusted in overall analyses. Interaction between each exposure and LE8 total score tertiles was tested, by including 2-way interaction terms. Stratified analyses across LE8 tertiles were carried out for each individual exposure. As a secondary analysis, stratification by LE8 tertiles and assessment of interactions were carried out among men and women, separately. The same type of analysis was carried out for the LE8 sub-scores (i.e. lifestyle and biological), which were also converted into tertiles. Age group (above and below median) was considered as another effect modifier in addition to sex and a similar approach was applied to test its effect modification of the main associations. A sensitivity analysis was carried out whereby participants with follow-up time &lt;3 years were excluded from the analysis and findings were compared to those of the main analysis. Days elapsed between infections and baseline assessment are presented as histogram and mean±SD years since infection till baseline were estimated.

Finally, we conducted an additional analysis in which we ran a series of age and sex-adjusted logistic regression models to compare the probabilities of hospital-treated vs. non-hospital-treated infections for diseases that were common to both groups. Using R software version 4.2.2 (https://www.r-project.org/), the odds ratios of having a hospital source for each infection UKB code (yes vs. no) are shown as a volcano plot, along with their accompanying p-values. The prevalence of each form of infection was also evaluated within each of the two main sources.

3. RESULTS

As shown in Supplementary Figure 1, the sample had 355,046 UK Biobank participants aged ≥ 50 years at baseline with complete data on covariates of interest and no prevalent dementia at baseline (2006-2010), who were followed up until October 31st, 2021, yielding 2,665 cases of incident AD and 6,335 cases of incident all-cause dementia. Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the study sample, overall, and by sex. Nearly 54% were female and 96% were of white race/ethnicity, with mean (±standard error) baseline age of 60.4 (±0.01) years. Whereas the mean (±standard error) household size and Townsend index were 2.2 (±0.002) and −1.517 (±0.005), respectively, ~39% were labeled as highly educated and 96% reported an income of ≤ £100,000. The mean (±standard error) burden of total and hospital-treated infections was 0.75 (±0.002) and 0.26 (±0.001), respectively. IBtotal and IBhosp prevalence proportions were 35% and 12%, respectively. There was no sex difference in hospital-treated infection (yes vs. no) unlike total infection burden which was more prevalent among females (36% vs. 33%), largely driven by higher prevalence of non-hospital treated infections (24% vs. 21%).

Similarly, total, lifestyle, and biological scores for life’s essential 8 were 501.5, 255.4 and 245.8, on average, and cumulative incidence rates of all-cause and AD dementias were estimated at 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively. Statistically significant sex differences were observed for all socio-demographic characteristics, as well as the total infection burden (more elevated among women), life’s essential 8 scores (more elevated among women), and cumulative incidence rates of all-cause and AD dementias (more elevated among men).

Kaplan-Meier curves for all-cause dementia are displayed in Figure 1 according to three-level infection burden. The log-rank test suggests significant differences in dementia-free proportion, whereby subjects with hospitalized infections had greater risk dementia, followed by non-hospitalized infections no infections. Comparable findings were observed before and after excluding deaths at follow-up. In fact, in the total sample (N=355,046), hazard ratio [HR]=1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] (1.83-2.06) for hospital-treated vs. none category; and HR=0.50, 95%CI(0.46-0.54) for non-hospital treated infections vs. none. In the sample excluding deaths at follow-up (N= 323,860), those estimates were HR=1.93, 95% CI (1.78-2.10) and HR=0.58, 95% CI(0.53-0.65). Those models adjusted for baseline age, sex, race (Non-White vs. White), household size and SES z-score.

Table 2 presents the relationship of total infection burden with dementia outcomes, overall, and after stratifying by Life’s essential 8 tertiles (total, lifestyle and biological). In both sexes combined, total infection burden was associated with all-cause dementia (HR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.13), with significant interaction effects by LE8 total score tertiles (P=0.043), whereby this relationship was statistically significant only in the lowest LE8 tertile (HR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.24). This interaction was detected in both the lifestyle and biological components of LE8 total score. Nevertheless, this stronger effect in the lower LE8 total score tertile was observed among men only, driven mainly by the LE8 biological sub-score. By contrast to all-cause dementia, total infection burden was not significantly related to AD dementia among men, women or both sexes combined. Table S6 shows findings from similar models with total infection burden (yes vs. no) stratified by age group (below vs. above median of ~60.8 y). Results indicated that in the younger group, only the lifestyle component of LE8 interacted with infection burden whereby participants with lower lifestyle-related CVH experienced an increased risk for all-cause dementia with any infection. In contrast, in the older group, this interaction was significant for both the lifestyle and biological LE8, pointing to a similar pattern of association. More notably, this pattern of association among the younger group indicated a greater risk for AD dementia with any infection when the biological sub-score of LE8 was reduced indicative of poorer CVH (HR=1.53, 95% CI: 1.06-2.17, P=0.021, P&lt;0.10 for 2-way interaction between IBtotal and LE8BIOLOGICAL).

Table 3 presents the relationship of hospital-treated infection burden with dementia outcomes, overall, and after stratifying by life’s essential 8 tertiles. Unlike total infection burden, hospital-treated infection burden was significantly related to both all-cause and AD dementia among men, women, and both sexes combined. There was no statistically significant interaction effect of LE8 tertiles on these relationships, whether with respect to the total, lifestyle or biological scores. Based on the magnitude of the HR point estimate, the risk of all-cause and AD dementia was nearly twice as high among individuals with hospital-treated infections as opposed to those without hospital-treated infections, controlling for baseline socio-demographic characteristics. Nevertheless, based on Table S7, LE8BIOLOGICAL interacted with hospital-treated infections only in the older group, whereby individuals with reduced CVH experienced a greater increase in dementia risk with exposure to such infections than individuals with better CVH. These patterns were not observed for the AD outcome in any of the age groups.

Based on Figure 2, there were significantly higher septicemia, staphylococcal and streptococcal infections, as well as “other bacterial infections” among others in the hospital-treated group vs. non-hospital treated group (Figure 2 and OSM 3). Conversely, infection types more prevalent in the non-hospital treated group included vaccine-preventable infections, most notably measles, mumps, rubella, and chicken pox (varicella), as well as other infections such as acute lower respiratory infection, acute tonsilitis, and infections of skin and subcutaneous tissue (Figure 2 and OSM 3).

In a sensitivity analysis, participants whose follow-up time was &lt;3 years were excluded. Our findings within that sub-sample (N=351,337; incident dementia cases n=6,129 ; and AD cases n=2,595) were comparable to the main analyses. Most notably, the HR for total infection burden and all-cause dementia incidence was 1.07 with 95% CI:1.02-1.13, P=0.010. This association was stronger in the lowest LE8 tertile (HR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.05-1.24, P=0.002), with a marginally significant interaction between IBtotal and LE8 tertile in the unstratified model (P&lt;0.10). Similarly, for hospital-treated infections, overall, the HR for all-cause dementia was 2.18, with 95% CI: 2.06-2.31, P&lt;0.001. In both the main sensitivity analyses, the mean number of years between IBtotal and baseline assessment dates was approximately 14 years. The detailed distribution of time elapsed from infection until baseline assessment for the main sample (N=355,046) is provided in supplementary Figure 2.

We provide all supplementary datasheets, detailed code and related result datasets used to generate the Figures in GitHub repository: (https://github.com/baydounm/UKB-paper3-supplementarydata). A summary of the study design with respect of timing of exposures, covariates and outcomes among others is provided in Figure 3.

4. DISCUSSION

We examined total and hospitalized infection burden in relation to the incidence of all-cause and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementias, before and after stratifying according to LE8, a measure of cardiovascular health. In both sexes, total infection burden was associated with all-cause dementia, with significant interaction effects by LE8 tertiles, whereby this relationship was statistically significant only in the lowest LE8 tertile. These relationships were also observed among men, but not among women. By contrast, total infection burden was not significantly related to AD dementia among men, women or both sexes combined. Hospital-treated infections, on the other hand, was significantly related to all-cause and AD dementia among men, women, and both sexes combined, with no significant interaction effect by LE8 tertile. Age group patterns were also detected.

The finding that infection burden affects dementia incidence only among individuals in the lowest tertile of LE8, suggests that having biological and lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease may increase susceptibility to infection or predispose them to detrimental effects of infectious diseases, including dementia. Optimal (high) LS7 has been shown to be associated with better cognitive function[24, 25], slower cognitive decline[25, 26], and reduced risk for dementia[27, 28] These associations, however, appear to vary by age. Specifically, high LS7 total scores in older adults (≥ 60 years of age) have been shown to be related to better global cognition, processing speed, executive function at baseline[24, 26]. High LS7 total scores have also been shown to be associated with slower decline in episodic memory and global cognition in older adults, but particularly within young-old adults (60-72 years of age)[26]. Specific metrics that comprise the LS7 appear to be particularly relevant to cognitive decline[25]. For example, poor diet was associated with perceptual speed decline, but poor plasma glucose was associated with faster decline in perceptual speed, particularly among adults less than 78 years of age[25]. Older adults who were classified as preclinical dementia (dementia-free at study enrollment but diagnosed with dementia at a study follow-up assessment) had lower (poor) LS7 scores than older adults without a dementia diagnosis across the study follow-up assessments[25]. While high LS7 total scores at midlife has been shown to be related to lower risk of dementia at follow-up study assessments[27], some literature has observed non-significant findings with LS7 total scores at midlife and dementia risk[28]. However, the biological risk factors (e.g., high blood pressure and plasma glucose) that are included in the LS7 score have been shown to be significantly related to rates of cognitive change[25] and dementia risk[28].

The finding that infection burden was associated with dementia, but not with AD risk, may be due to sample size limitations. Several infectious pathogens have been detected in AD patient brains although no single infection has been exclusively and causally linked to AD[29]. A number of biological mechanisms are possible. First, several neurotropic infectious agents may have a synergistic role in AD that is dependent on both exposure circumstances and host factors (e.g., genetic predisposition)[30]. Second, AD patients may have greater susceptibility to infections because there may be viral or bacterial pathogens in their brains[29]. Third, infections likely yield additional neuroinflammation in the presence of AD pathology (i.e., Aβ)[31]. Fourth, and more consequential, infections likely play a causal role in AD pathogenesis[30]. A hypothetical model suggests that systemic and bacterial amyloids and other PAMPs accelerate brain pathology in AD[2], in which the mutual effects of amyloid accumulation and systemic infection lead to increasing AD pathology[2]. Although Aβ alone is unlikely sufficient to trigger neurodegeneration, its neurotoxicity asserts by PAMP’s presence[2]. This combination of factors would then be able to trigger neurodegeneration[2].

Four recent studies have used the UK Biobank or other UK-based data, to examine multiple infections and their relationships to cognitive decline and dementia. Muzambi et al. [32] identified infections using ICD-10 codes from linked primary care data limited to the previous 5 years. Analyses modeled rates of cognitive decline over follow-up time and hippocampal and white matter hyperintensity volume. Sipilä et al. [3] focus on hospital-treated infections and capture almost 1,000 different infections identified using ICD-10 codes. Findings suggest systematic effects of infection on dementia and that various ways infection burden was measured captured important differences in effects. The lack of specificity for infection and dose-response effects suggests systemic inflammation may be the predominant mechanism and proximal cause of dementia rather than specific microorganisms. Furthermore, and similar to our present study, using Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (Jan 1, 2004-Dec 31, 2018), a historical cohort study involving 989,800 individuals ≥ 65 years with no history of dementia or cognitive impairment was conducted by Muzambi et al. whereby common infections (sepsis, pneumonia, other lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections) were examined in relation to incident dementia diagnosis over a median follow-up time of 5.2 years[33]. Results suggested that dementia risk increased in those with any infection (HR=1·53) compared with those without infection, and that HRs were highest for sepsis (HR=2·08), pneumonia (HR=1·88) and for infections leading to hospital admission (HR=1·99)[33]. Finally, Makli et al. used infections identified by the UK Biobank along with IgG data and dementia determinations using primary care linkage[34]. Of 15 infections analyzed, only Herpes Simplex virus-1 was significantly related to dementia diagnosis[34]. The authors also found that combined presence of HSV1, VZV1, HHV6, and HHV7 was related to dementia as opposed to having no infections[34].

Furthermore, other comparable studies have been conducted in US populations. Most notably, a retrospective cohort study involving a national sample of US veterans (N=417,172) aged ≥56 years examined associations of systemic and localized extra-central nervous system bacterial infections occurring &gt;2 years before the initial dementia diagnosis and the risk for dementia, after adjusting for demographic, medical and psychiatric characteristics[35]. Results suggested that any extra-CNS bacterial infection (HR=1.20), septicemia (HR=1.39), bacteremia (HR=1.22), osteomyelitis (HR=1.20), pneumonia (HR=1.10), urinary tract infections (HR=1.13), and cellulitis (HR=1.14) were independent risk factors for dementia[35]. In another study, during the surveillance period, 72% of the 1,689 older persons in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) prospective cohort study (mean age at MRI 755) were hospitalized, 14% had a serious infection, and 4% had a critical illness[36]. While all-cause hospitalization was associated with lower white matter integrity using measures like FA and MD, critical illness and major infection were associated with smaller brain volume, particularly within regions implicated in AD, including a smaller AD signature region (−1.28 cm(3), 95% CI=−2.21 to −0.35) [36].

Study findings should be interpreted taking its strengths and limitations into consideration. First, this study is one of few cohort studies to examine the association between hospital-treated infections in relation to dementia, while having sufficient power to stratify by cardiovascular health. Second, the outcome variables were defined using exact diagnosis dates through record linkage by UK biobank investigators. Third, a wide range of topics are covered by the UK Biobank allowing for unbiased estimates for exposure-outcome relationships through adjustment of confounders. Potential limitations of this study include selection bias due to missing data on key variables of interest as well as measurement error resulting from use of self-report and ICD codes, with a larger measurement bias experienced for the algorithmically defined AD rather than all-cause dementia diagnosis. Proration applied to both LE8 and SES scores reduced the selection bias due to missing data on covariates by reducing the % missing to 10%. Due to the large sample size, it was computationally prohibitive to conduct multiple imputations. Moreover, as is the case for most studies, the exact date of onset of dementia and/or AD is largely unknown. Although several confounders were taken into consideration, residual confounding remains plausible due to the observational nature of this study. Furthermore, although prevalent cases of dementia were further excluded up to 3 year of follow-up after baseline assessment, reverse causality is still a possible explanation for the association between infection burden and dementia, whereby individuals with at least mild cognitive impairment prior to baseline assessment were at greater risk for infection. Finally, our results cannot necessarily be generalized to the entire UK population since the sample relied on volunteers and a large proportion of individuals who were invited did not complete the study.

In conclusion, dementia is related to hospital-treated infections, while cardiovascular health, as measured by LE8, modifies the relationship of total infection burden with all-cause dementia. These findings indicate that the direct association of prior infection with all-cause dementia can potentially be modified by improving cardiovascular health. Nevertheless, randomized controlled trials targeting cardiovascular health among individuals with or without prior occurrence of infections, are needed to ascertain causality. In-depth analyses are also needed to elucidate these preliminary findings, including examining different types and sub-types of infections and whether they are linked to early neuroimaging and other markers of AD and all-cause dementia differentially across levels of cardiovascular health.

Note: Based on 124,284 observations for participants with earliest dates of occurrence to baseline assessment in the case of prevalent infections (mean days to baseline±SD:5,432±5,944); 45,046 for prevalent hospital treated infections (mean days to baseline±SD:3,911±4,703); 79,228 for non-hospital treated prevalent infections (mean days to baseline±SD:6,296±6,385). A cutoff of 25,550 equivalent to 70y was applied to remove potential errors in time to baseline. The original distribution of the three-level infection categorization was: 0: n=230,731 (no infections); 1: n=79,253 (non-hospital treated infections); 2: n=45,062 (hospital-treated infections) out of the total of 355,046.

FIGURE 2. Volcano plot of odds of hospital-treated infections vs. non-hospital-treated infections by type of infection

Abbreviations: Ln=Loge; OR=Odds Ratio.

Note: Based on a series of age and sex-adjusted logistic regression models, with main predictor being the type of prevalent infection (1=yes, 0=no) and the outcome being hospital-treated vs. non-hospital-treated infection (1=yes, 0-no). The y-axis is the predictor’s associated p-value on a −Log10 scale and the X-axis is the Loge(odds ratio) from the age and sex-adjusted logistic models for each predictor. A twofold increase or decreased odds of the infection being hospital-treated is marked by red and blue colors, respectively. Values of the odds ratio in between is marked by a black color. An estimate with an uncorrected p-value&lt;0.05 is marked by the UKB field number (See UKB showcase URL: https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/ ), while a Bonferroni corrected p-value&lt;0.00038 (132 estimates) is marked with a dashed line. All infections occurred prior to baseline assessment. Dot sizes are proportional to the largest of two prevalence proportions (hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized) for each infection type, using the formula dot size=1+log2(3*larger_of_two_means/avg_of_larger_than_two_means).
