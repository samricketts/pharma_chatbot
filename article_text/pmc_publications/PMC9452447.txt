Recent findings suggest that amyloid-β may not the only peptidic culprit for the cognitive decline observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. A C-terminal fragment of Aβ, amyloid-α (Aα), also known as p3, has been shown to form amyloidogenic oligomers and fibrils more rapidly than Aβ. However, the insolubility and aggregation propensity of this 24–26-residue peptide makes it exceptionally difficult to produce, purify, and subsequently study. This paper reports a reproducible, multi-step method for the purification and pre-treatment of Aα and related analogues, yielding 95–99% pure peptides. We anticipate that the methods described herein will permit previously inaccessible biophysical and biological experiments that may be critical to understanding the role of this too long overlooked peptide in AD disease pathology.

Graphical Abstract

Obtaining pure amyloid-α (Aα) in its unaggregated form is a major challenge in Alzheimers’s disease research. A reproducible, multi-step method for the purification and pre-treatment of Aα and related analogues is reported, yielding 95–99% pure peptides. Reverse-phase PLRP-S columns are employed under basic conditions, in conjunction with filtration and careful storage techniques.

pmc1 Introduction

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) lack defined tertiary structures under physiological conditions. Unlike typical proteins in which strong structure-function relationships can be interpreted and mimicked, IDPs, also known as natively unfolded proteins, offer unique challenges preventing their exploration. This is due, at least in part, to their hydrophobicity, significant confirmational heterogeneity, and relatively smooth energy landscapes.1 Aggregation prone IDPs are frequently associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including, amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease, and amylin in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Aα, a C-terminal fragment of Aβ, the AD-associated peptide, is a 24–26-residue, hydrophobic, aggregation-prone IDP (Fig. 1A). It is produced from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid-β precursor protein (AβPP), a transmembrane protein with unknown endogenous function, by sequential α- and γ-secretase cleavages. Consequently, free Aα (also known as p3) is released from the cell membrane, after which it rapidly self-assembles to form transient oligomers and, eventually, stable fibrils.

Recent evidence suggests that Aα may play a more significant role in AD than previously suggested.2,3 Thus, it is critical that efforts are made to understand the biological and biophysical properties of this peptide. However, while extensive methods exist for producing high-quality, monomeric Aβ,4 to the best of our knowledge, there are no published methods for the preparation of Aα. Traditional methods adopted for preparation of Aβ are not sufficient given that Aα is significantly more hydrophobic than full-length Aβ. This difference is exemplified by a significantly higher calculated Grand Average of Hydropathy (GRAVVY) score for Aα over Aβ: 1.313 for Aα40 and 1.455 for Aα42 vs. 0.058 for Aβ40 and 0.205 for Aβ42 (Fig. 1B). Further, we recently reported that the aggregation propensity of Aα is 3–4x faster than Aβ, as demonstrated by thioflavin-T (ThT) and 5(6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) quenching assays.3 While these biophysical characteristics are interesting from a disease pathology standpoint, they create large barriers to studying the peptide. We believe this may account for the modest and conflicting body of literature surrounding this peptide.2,3

We report a reliable method for purification and pretreatment of Aα and associated analogues, Aα-F19Y, Aα-F20Y, and TAMRA-Aα. Our method combines high pH buffers with styrenedivinylbenzene (PLRP-S) reverse phase columns to yield high-purity, unaggregated peptides (Fig. 1C). This method enables researchers to evade reproducibility challenges in data acquisition commonly encountered with especially hydrophobic, aggregation-prone peptides, such as Aα. This protocol, which prioritizes purity over yield, has been adapted from previous work from our lab6 and others,7 to account for the increased hydrophobicity of Aα over Aβ (Fig. 1B). This approach has allowed us to study the aggregation properties of Aα more straightforwardly than would have otherwise been possible.3

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Materials

Aα was synthesized and purified as described in the manuscript. Synthesis was conducted on a Liberty Blue CEM peptide synthesizer assisted by a CEM discovery microwave. Columns used: Prep Column: Cat# PL1212-6801 (Agilent PLRP-S 300 A, 8 uM, 25mm × 300 mm). Semi-prep column: Cat#: PL1112-6801 (Agilent PLRP-S 300 A, 8 um, 7.5 mm × 300 mm). Analytical column: Cat# PL1512-5500 (Agilent PLRP-S 100A, 5um 4.6 × 250 mm).

2.2 Synthesis

Fmoc-Val pre-loaded Tentagel S PHB resin with 0.22 mmol/g loading was selected. Synthesis was performed on a 0.1 mM scale relative to resin loading. Tentagel resin was pre-swelled with DMF for 30 m prior to synthesis. For Fmoc deprotection steps, a solution of 30% piperidine in DMF was added to the resin and the reaction vessel was heated first to 75 °C for 15 s, followed by 90 °C for 50 s. Amino acid coupling reactions were performed twice for each amino acid to reduce truncations. A solution of 0.2 M Fmoc-amino acid, 0.5 M diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) and 1.0 M ethyl cyanohydroxyiminoacetate (Oxyma) was added to the resin, and the reaction vessel was heated to 75 °C for 15 s, followed by 90 °C for 110 s. These deprotection and coupling steps were repeated until the full, 24-residue peptide was synthesized. To cleave the polypeptide from solid support, a mixture of 20:2:1 trifluoracetic acid (TFA): triisopropylsilane (TIPS): liquified phenol was added to the resin and allowed to shake for 2–3 h. The TFA was evaporated under a steady N2(g) stream until &lt; 1 mL remained.

2.3 Sample dissolution

Approximately 3 mg of crude, NH4OH pretreated, lyophilized peptide was dissolved in approximately 5–7 mL of 0.1% NH4OH in 9:1 ultrapure water: acetonitrile prior to preparative HPLC. For semi-preparative HPLC, approximately 0.2–0.4 mg of peptide collected from the preparative purification was dissolved in approximately 1–3 mL of 0.1% NH4OH in 19:1 ultrapure water: acetonitrile. For analytical HPLC, approximately 0.02 mg of solid peptide collected from the semi-preparative purification was dissolved in 20 μL of 0.1% NH4OH in ultrapure water, and subsequently vortexed and sonicated (40 kHz) in 30 s increments.

2.4 Quantitation

An extinction coefficient of 83,370 M−1 cm−1 at 205 nm for Aα40 was calculated with the Nick Anthis Protein Parameter Calculator (http://nickanthis.com/tools/a205.html).

2.5 Dot blot assay

Dot blot experiments were performed as previously described.3 Aα was dissolved in 20 mM NaOH (not exceeding 5% of final dilution volume) and diluted to 20 μM with pH 7.4 1x PBS. The solution was kept at 37 °C for the duration of the experiments. At a series of timepoints over 7 days, 2 μL of solution was blotted onto nitrocellulose. After drying, the blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST for 5 min × 3 and incubated with either 4G8 or 6E10 antibodies (1:10,000 in 5% nonfat milk in TBST) overnight at 4 °C, followed by washing with TBST for 5 min × 3. The membrane was incubated with secondary antibody (1:10,000 in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST) for 1 h at RT, then washed with TBST for 5 min × 3, and developed with the Opti-4CN Substrate kit (Bio-Rad, 1708235).

2.6 Thioflavin T (ThT) assay

ThT experiments were performed as previously described.3 Aα was dissolved in 20 mM NaOH (not exceeding 5% of final dilution volume) and diluted to 5 μM with pH 7.4 1x PBS with 10 μM ThT. The ThT-peptide mixtures were transferred to a black, clear bottom, 96-well plate. Fluorescence measurements were conducted with a Biotek Synergy HTX plate reader (λem= 440 nm, λex= 485 nm). The experiments were conducted with continuous shaking and datapoints were collected every 5 min.

2.7 Fibril growth

Fibril experiments were performed as previously described.3 Aα was dissolved in 20 mM NaOH (not exceeding 5% of final dilution volume) and diluted to 20 μM with pH 7.4 1x PBS. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 7 days, and spotted onto freshly glow discharged carbon-coated electron microscopy grids (Ted Pella, 01701-F). The grids were stained with 30 μL of 1% uranyl acetate and allowed to dry. TEM images were collected on a JEOL 1230 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV.

2.8 Oligomer growth

Oligomer experiments were performed as previously described.3 Aα was dissolved in 20 mM NaOH (not exceeding 5% of final dilution volume) and diluted to 20 μM with pH 7.4 1x PBS. The samples were incubated at 4 °C for 6 h, and spotted onto freshly glow discharged carbon-coated electron microscopy grids (Ted Pella, 01701-F). The grids were stained and imaged as described above.

2.9 Photo-induced crosslinking (PICUP) and SDS-PAGE

PICUP experiments were performed as previously described.3 Aα F➔Y mutants, Aα40-F19Y and Aα40-F20Y, were dissolved in 20 mM NaOH and diluted to 50 μM in pH 7.4 1x PBS. For crosslinking, 4 μL of 1 mM [Ru (bipy)3]2+ and 4 μL of 20 mM ammonium persulfate were added to 32 μL of the peptide solutions, and irradiated with light for 1.2 s. The solutions were then quenched with 40 μL of loading buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Finally, crosslinked samples were run on 12% tris-tricine polyacrylamide gels at 100 V for 2 h and developed by silver staining.

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 Synthesis

Aα was synthesized by standard solid-phase Fmoc chemistry on a CEM Liberty Blue microwave-assisted peptide synthesizer. Since high loading resins promote aggregation during synthesis, significantly reducing yield, peptide synthesis was conducted exclusively with a low loading resin. Diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) and ethyl cyanohydroxyiminoacetate (Oxyma) were used for amino acid coupling, while piperidine was used for Fmoc-removal.

After cleavage from solid support with a trifluoracetic acid (TFA) cocktail, the crude peptide was precipitated in cold diethyl ether twice. The solid pellet was then pre-treated and aliquoted in 0.1% NH4OH 1:1 acetonitrile: ultrapure water to reduce aggregate formation. Dynamic light scattering, size exclusion chromatography and small angle X-ray scattering studies conducted by Ryan et. al. have demonstrated that NH4OH pre-treatment reduces aggregate formation upon dissolution.8 The resultant samples were then lyophilized immediately to reduce aggregation and methionine oxidation.

3.2 Preparative HPLC purification of crude Aα

As with other IDPs, Aα is exceptionally sensitive to small perturbations and impurities, a fact reflected in the contradictory studies on Aα.2 To address this, our purification method accounts, for this, and additional factors affecting aggregation and reproducibility such as temperature, age, concentration, agitation, and pre-treatment.9–11. Classic purification methods typically employed for full-length Aβ under acidic conditions are not advisable for Aα as aggregation is promoted at low pH. Thus, basic buffers were selected. Solutions of 0.1% NH4OH in ultrapure water and 0.1% NH4OH in 4:1 acetonitrile: ultrapure water served as Buffers A and B, respectively. Crude, NH4OH pretreated, lyophilized peptide was dissolved in 0.1% NH4OH in 9:1 ultrapure water: acetonitrile, and subsequently vortexed and sonicated (40 kHz) in 30 s increments. Sonication time did not exceed 30 s, as sonication promotes aggregation through seed formation.12,13 As heat promotes aggregation,14,15 the temperature of the sonicator did not exceed room temperature. To enhance the removal of impurities, care was taken to not overload the column with peptide.

Since amyloid aggregation is thought to operate via a seeding mechanism,16 the presence of even one aggregate in solution can rapidly promote fibril formation. Thus, the crude sample was filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe filter to remove pre-formed aggregates and extend column lifetime. The sample was injected manually, and the relevant solvent gradient was initiated as shown in Fig. 2A. A slow, linear gradient (light purple dotted line shown in Fig. 2A) of % Buffer B over 70 min allows for separation of species of similar polarity. The desired peak was collected as illustrated in Fig. 3A (green highlighted region), excluding the leading and tailing segments, and the sample was immediately lyophilized. Approximately less than 50% of the total peptide peak was collected. The primary impurity removed through this step was oxidized Aα, in which methionine-19 was oxidized to methionine sulfoxide (MetO). MetO can significantly impact the biophysical properties of full-length Aβ,17 and Aα is expected to be impacted similarly. The lyophilized peptide was stored at 40 °C for no longer than 6 months to maintain a purity &gt; 95% by reducing the overall percentage of oxidized and/or degraded peptide. Representative mass spectra of Aα before and after preparative HPLC purification are shown in Fig. 4.

3.3 Semi-preparative HPLC purification of Aα

HPLC set-up and buffer preparation was conducted as previously described.6 Peptide collected from the preparative purification was dissolved in 0.1% NH4OH in 19:1 ultrapure water: acetonitrile, and subsequently vortexed and sonicated (40 kHz) in 30 s increments. The sample was injected manually without a syringe filter, and the relevant solvent gradient was initiated (Fig. 2B). Buffer preparations were conducted as described in “Preparative HPLC Purification of crude Aα”. A slow, linear gradient (light purple dotted line shown in Fig. 2B) of Buffer B % over 60 min allows for separation of the desired peptide from impurities. The desired peak was collected as illustrated in Fig. 3B (orange highlighted region), excluding leading and tailing segments, and the sample was immediately lyophilized. Approximately less than 50% of the total peptide peak was collected. Solid peptide was stored at −40 °C for no longer than 3 months. Sample storage in excess of 2 months was avoided, as methionine oxidation alters the biophysical and biological properties of the peptide.17 A representative mass spectrum is shown in Fig. 4.

3.4 Analytical HPLC analysis of purified Aα

Buffer preparation was conducted as described in the text above. A representative analytical chromatogram is shown in Fig. 2C. The purity of the peptide was determined with the integration analysis software provided by Agilent: each individual peak was integrated, and the desired peptide-peak percentage area was calculated. Typically, an area % of 95–99% was ascertained. As shown in the representative mass spectrum (Fig. 4), oxidized Aα (calculated mass: 2407.3) was not observed after purification. If calculated purity fell below 95%, the semi-preparative purification was repeated to yield &gt; 95% peptide purity. To prioritize purity and ensure reproducibility in biophysical studies, pure peptide yields below 10% of crude material are to be expected.

Additionally, if peptide storage exceeded 2 months, semi-preparative purification was repeated to remove oxidation and/or degradation products.

The methods described herein proved to be highly reproducible across multiple batches of synthesized Aα. The characterization of second synthetic batch is shown in Fig. S1 for reference. To date, our preparation methods have only been applied to synthetic Aα.

3.5 Pre-treatment, quantitation, and reconstitution of Aα

To reduce repeated reconstitutions, and consequently, oxidation and aggregation, pure Aα was pre-treated with 0.1% NH4OH in ultrapure water and aliquoted after purification.

Since Aα lacks tyrosine and tryptophan, concentration quantitation via UV absorbance at 280 nm is impossible. Instead, concentration was determined by measuring absorbance from the peptide backbone at 205 nm, based on work from Anthis et. al.18 An extinction coefficient of 83,370 M−1 cm−1 at 205 nm for Aα40 was calculated with the Nick Anthis Protein Parameter Calculator.18 This method is preferable to quantitation by mass, which requires significant quantities of solid peptide.

Prior to characterization, pre-treated lyophilized Aα was reconstituted in ice cold 20 mM NaOH, vortexed, sonicated, then kept on ice until immediately prior to experimentation. Dissolution in NaOH, as opposed to TFA or HCl, promotes reproducible aggregate formation.19 NaOH addition never exceeded 5% of the total volume to reduce the impact on aggregation propensity. We have empirically observed that NaOH addition under this limit did not attenuate fibril formation nor induce cellular apoptosis (data not shown).

If an abundancy of pre-formed aggregates was identified, samples were spin-filtered through 100 kDa MWCO filters at 14000g for 10 minutes, mitigating premature seeding.

3.6 Biophysics of pure Aα

Since even trace impurities can dramatically alter the properties of amyloidogenic peptides, rigorous, orthogonal biophysical techniques are critical for assessing peptide quality.11,20 We recommend conducting the assays described herein for each new batch of Aα to identify reproducibility problems that may arise form unique impurities or premature aggregates. As demonstrated by the conflicting findings on Aα,2 careful optimization of parameters such as temperature, pH, concentration, buffer composition is critical in obtaining reliable data.

Pure Aα obtained from the purification methods described above was characterized by various biophysical methods during different stages of aggregation. A more in-depth analysis of these findings can be found in our previous study, in which the same meticulous preparation and purification conditions were successfully employed.3 We have since reproduced this preparation method several times with great success, and felt a more detailed account would benefit the Alzheimer’s research field. To confirm the identity of Aα, two anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies were employed: 6E10 (binds Aβ1-16 and thus not expected to bind Aα) and 4G8 (binds Aβ17-24/Aα1-8). At various timepoints under fibril-forming conditions, over 7 days, as expected, Aα strongly reacted with 4G8 but not 6E10 (Fig. 5A).

Fibril formation rate and morphology were assessed with the thioflavin T assay (ThT) assay (Fig. 5B) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 5C–D). The ThT assay exhibited a characteristic sigmoidal growth curve typically associated with amyloidogenic peptides, and previously observed for Aα,3 beginning with a lag phase, followed by an elongation phase, ending with an equilibration phase. Consistent with our previous reports,3 Aα formed round, intermediate oligomers (Fig. 5C) and long, twisted fibrils (Fig. 5D).

3.7 Preparation of Aα analogues.

Synthetic analogues of Aα can be useful biophysical and biological probes for assays otherwise inaccessible with endogenous Aα. Two such analogues, Aα-F19Y and Aα-F20Y, phenylalanine to tyrosine single-point mutants, were designed as described in our previous study,3 to access the method of photo-induced crosslinking of unmodified proteins (PICUP). With PICUP, amyloidogenic peptides can be crosslinked via tyrosine residues to trap and characterize metastable, low-molecular-weight oligomers. However, since Aα lacks tyrosine, Aα-F19Y and Aα-F20Y permit the use of PICUP without significantly altering the aggregation propensity of native Aα.3

The purification and preparation methods described here were also adapted for useful Aα analogues. The HPLC and MS characterization of these peptides are shown in in the SI (Fig. S2-S4). The SDS-PAGE gel obtained from PICUP exposure (XL) of Aβ40, Aα-F19Y and Aα-F20Y Fig. 5E revealed the formation of monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric oligomers. This is consistent with our previous report.3

Moreover, fluorescently labeled Aα is a useful probe for additional biophysical and biological assays, such as TAMRA-quenching,3 confocal microscopy,21 flow cytometry,22 FRET, and many others. A designated PRLP-S column was used for TAMRA-conjugated peptides to avoid fluorophore contamination during purification of unlabeled peptides. A representative confocal microscopy image of quiescently grown TAMRA-Aα fibrils is shown in Fig. S4.

4 Conclusions

Aggregation-prone IDPs are remarkably sensitive to contaminants and deviations in synthetic source, purification method, and reconstitution solvent. These factors breed abundant inconsistencies in the literature. This is especially true for Aα, a rapidly self-assembling, hydrophobic, C-terminal fragment of Aβ.2 Whether Aα is even amyloidogenic is still a major point of contention.2,3 It is our hope that our purification protocol of Aα (formerly known as p3) provides easier access to a difficult peptide that may play a pivotal role in Alzheimer’s disease.
