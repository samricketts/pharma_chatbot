Progressive neuronal demise is a key contributor to the key pathogenic event implicated in many different neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). There are several therapeutic strategies available, however none of them are particularly effective. Targeted neuroprotective therapy is one such therapy, which seems a compelling option, yet remains challenging due to the internal heterogeneity of the mechanisms underlying various NDDs. An alternative method to treat NDDs, is to exploit common modalities involving molecularly distinct subtypes and thus develop specialized drugs with broad-spectrum characteristics. There is mounting evidence which supports for the theory that dysfunctional ryanodine receptors (RyRs)-mediated disrupts intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, contributing to NDDs significantly. This review aims to provide direct and indirect evidence on the intersection of NDDs and RyRs malfunction, and to shed light on novel strategies to treat RyRs-mediated disease, modifying pharmacological therapies such as the potential therapeutic role of dantrolene, a RyRs antagonist.

pmc1. Introduction

Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Shi et al. 2018; Liang and Wei 2015), Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Belvisi et al. 2019), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Tedeschi et al. 2019), Huntington’s disease (HD) (Pini et al. 2019) and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) (Egorova and Bezprozvanny 2019), are typically characterized by persistent neuronal loss or death implicated in the central and peripheral nervous systems (Karagas and Venkatachalam 2019). NDDs are generally gradual and progressive, and there is presently no available cure, thus these disorders remain a major socioeconomic burden worldwide, due to temporary treatments which can prolong lifespan. Though the ideal maneuver would be to fully exploit neuroprotective methods, current treatments are only able to achieve partial symptom-relieving effects. In PD, symptomatic relief by dopamine replacement is transient and accompanied by unexpected adverse side effects (Masi et al. 2019). Similarly, in AD symptom relief is rarely obtainable (Tong et al. 2018). Though intensive research, referenced above, has been done towards achieving optimal neuroprotectivity, clinical trials have not shown results. In recent years there has been a push towards understanding the underlying mechanistic pathogenesis in different NNDs, but using this research to finding a cure has presented a major issues, including the high degree of pathophysiological diversity and potential internal heterogeneity in these diseases (Masi et al. 2019). Therefore, there is a need for a refined neuroprotective therapy with multiple targets for each NDD subclass, considering the complexity of NDD pathogenesis. An alternative strategy is to explore common disease pathways and develop specialized drugs with broad-spectrum features. Interestingly, despite the different hallmarks of these diseases, they all commonly exhibit endogenous pathogenic similarities which all involve intracellular Ca2+ dysregulation (Tong et al. 2018; Popugaeva et al. 2017; Tedeschi et al. 2019; Patai et al. 2017). Spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular Ca2+ is typically instrumental and well-orchestrated in all cell types. Ryanodine receptors (RyRs), the largest group of intracellular Ca2+ receptors, are located on the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) membranes, and are responsible for Ca2+ release from cytosolic storage compartment, in order to maintain activity-dependent neuronal gene expression, mitochondrial function, vesicle releasing in synapses, and axodendritic plasticity (Karagas and Venkatachalam 2019; Zundorf and Reiser 2011; Forostyak et al. 2016; Grosskreutz et al. 2010; Raymond 2017; Braubach et al. 2014; Kilpatrick et al. 2016; Chan et al. 2009; Egorova and Bezprozvanny 2019; Chen et al. 2008). Increasing evidence demonstrates that dysfunctional RyRs-mediated Ca2+ handling is regarded as a core pathogenic event implicated in a wide variety of cellular neurodegenerative pathways across different NDDs (Vervliet 2018; Kushnir et al. 2018; Santulli et al. 2018; Abu-Omar et al. 2018; Lanner 2012; Wei and Xie 2009; Yang et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2017). In this review we provide evidence linking neurodegeneration to RyRs dysfunction in selected NDD classes, which paves the way for developing RyRs-targeted disease modifying therapeutics through pinpointing the potential role of dantrolene, a RyR antagonist (Inan and Wei 2010).

2. RyRs in the brain

RyRs are a series of intracellular Ca2+ channels located on SR/ER and are present in nearly all cell types, including neurons and muscles (Kushnir et al. 2018; Vervliet 2018). There are three major structurally similar RyRs mammalian isoforms: RyR1, RyR2 and RyR3. This terminology depends mainly on the initial detecting and purifying process; however, ensuing analysis has shown that none of them are tissue-specific. For instance, RyR1 was initially found in skeletal muscles (Marks et al. 1989). In cardiac muscle cells, they highly express RyR2 isoform (Nakai et al. 1990). As for RyR3, it was initially described in the brain and also identified in the diaphragm (Hakamata et al. 1992; Marks et al. 1989). All three RyRs isoforms are constitutively expressed in the mammalian brains, while the RyR2 type is the most predominant (Hertle and Yeckel 2007; Lai et al. 1992). In neurons, RyRs are localized along the ER structure which forms a continuous network linking all structures together in the axodendritic regions (e.g. the soma, dendrites, spines, and axons) (Abu-Omar et al. 2018).

In human brains, both granular and Purkinje cells express these three RyRs isoforms in hippocampal CA regions and dentate gyrus (Martin et al. 1998; Nakashima et al. 1997; Stein et al. 1992), basal nuclei (Stein et al. 1992), cortex (Nakashima et al. 1997), and cerebellar region (Martin et al. 1998; Stein et al. 1992). However, the ratio of these isoforms displays region-associated differences in the brain. Across the development and aging process, RyRs mRNA expressed in brains displays trajectory changes from embryos to adult age, implicated in distinct mammals (Abu-Omar et al. 2018). Though less is known about the specified time profile of gene expression patterns, evidence from RT-PCR results show that RyR2 expression is unregulated pending maturity, with the RyR1 and RyR3 isoforms being towards to the opposite (Faure et al. 2001).

3. RyRs in Ca2+ homeostasis and neural function

3.1 Normal regulation of RyRs and Ca2+ homeostasis in the neuronal development and natural aging

A vast array of calcium Ca2+ signaling components (Table 1) involve in neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis. Cytosolic Ca2+ signaling controls, maintains, and orchestrates general physiology in neurons. Although many distinct intracellular stores are associated with Ca2+ regulation, the ER is where RyRs are primarily located, and they function as the predominant Ca2+ store. In neurons, the sources contributing to the cytosolic Ca2+ increase mainly originate from RyRs, depending on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from the ER (Roderick et al. 2003). Taking into account the intrinsic feature of CICR, cytosolic Ca2+ can experience major elevation through interplays between RyRs and other intracellular regulators (Karagas and Venkatachalam 2019). This RyRs-mediated Ca2+ homeostasis (Figure 1) undergoes constant changes across development and natural aging, and hence contributes a crucial role in proliferation, differentiation and maturation in neurons (Clodfelter et al. 2002; Berridge et al. 2000; Sutherland et al. 2014). There is clear evidence which shows that CICR via RyRs regulate growth cone guidance through netrin-1, underling neuronal network development, since inhibition of the RyRs reverts the effect of netrin-1, with growing axons then turning to the contrary way (Hong et al. 2000; Tang and Kalil 2005; Low et al. 2012).

3.2 Dysregulation of RyRs-associated Ca2+ homeostasis in neurodegeneration

Persistent increase of intracellular Ca2+ owing to RyRs dysregulation of CICR may produce ensuing age-associated excitotoxicity (Clodfelter et al. 2002), and hence cause vulnerability and even demise in various cell types (Thibault et al. 2007). Divergent alterations in ER Ca2+ handling via RyRs (e.g. too much release or little uptake) may result in downstream pathophysiology (Karagas and Venkatachalam 2019), generally causing some extent of uncontrolled ER stress and subsequently activate the unfolding of proteins (UPR). Moreover, there is considerable evidence substantiating intimate and intricate crosstalk between the ER and mitochondria (Kumar 2019; Moltedo et al. 2019). Accordingly, ER stress triggers downstream pathogenic events, including oxidative stress, impaired cellular energy metabolism, and changes in disease-specific proteins, engendering dysregulated Ca2+-dependent axodendritic dysfunction and plasticity, sometimes even causing death in neurons (Karagas and Venkatachalam 2019; Masi et al. 2019; Tong et al. 2018) (Figure 2). Aside from the ER and mitochondria, the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes may partially act as Ca2+ reservoirs and thus are involved in Ca2+ signaling events (Raffaello et al. 2016). In addition, accumulating evidence has illuminated the key role of the ER, mitochondria and lysosomes in autophagy modulation (La Rovere et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2019). There is no doubt that upstream RyRs-mediated Ca2+ malfunction plays a pivotal role in subsequent neurodegeneration.

4. RyRs in different NNDs

As aforementioned, dysregulated RyRs expression and activity contribute to neurodegeneration. The role of RyRs implicated in common NDDs will be summarized and characterized in this section.

4.1 Alzheimer’s Disease

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common NDD, is clinically characterized by persistent deterioration of memory and cognitive abilities that ultimately leads to dementia. Within the umbrella of AD about 1–2% of cases are familial AD (FAD) derived from mutations in several relevant genes and the bulk of the cases are sporadic AD (SAD) (Liang and Wei 2015; Tong et al. 2018). Though the etiology of AD remains unclear, the fact that the main neuropathological features implicated in AD are a progressive accumulation of extracellular senile plaques (beta-amyloid, Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formed by hyperphosphorylated tau has allowed a host of drugs to be developed to target to the amyloid, tau, or acetylcholine. However, none of these therapeutics have achieved clinically satisfactory efficacy, some even exhibited unaccepted drug-associated complications and thus succumbed to discontinuation (Tong et al. 2018). Thus, new anti-AD therapeutics are vital to specifically target the pathogenic origins of different NDD subtypes.

Recently, increasing evidence suggests that RyRs-mediated intracellular Ca2+ dysregulation plays a pivotal regulatory role in AD pathogenesis (Shi et al. 2018; Liang and Wei 2015; Vervliet 2018; Stutzmann et al. 2006). Postmortem samples of individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD exhibited an increase in RyR2 transcripts in MCI brains compared to NCI. However, there is a reduction in a RyR2 splice variant, associated with an anti-apoptotic function in MCI and AD brains. These alterations in RyRs expression at early disease stages may reflect the onset of pathologic mechanisms leading to later neurodegeneration (Bruno et al. 2012). Likewise, family data sets revealed that polymorphisms within RyR3 gene are associated with risk and age at onset of AD (Gong et al. 2018). Moreover, there are several AD mouse models which have illustrated that RyRs levels in the hippocampus were unregulated, resulting in excessive RyRs-mediated Ca2+ release, which contributed to an early pathogenic event (Chan et al. 2000; Oules et al. 2012; Chakroborty et al. 2012). Some have argued that presenilin (PS1 or PS2) mutations exert a “gain-of-function” effect on the RyRs channel (Rybalchenko et al. 2008; Hayrapetyan et al. 2008), and hence mediate RyRs overexpression (Stutzmann et al. 2006). Other reports also demonstrated that apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a genetic risk factor, may amplify ER Ca2+ release via RyRs, contributing to Aβ plaques and NFT formation (Ohkubo et al. 2001; Namba et al. 1991). Research has shown that acute and short-term exposure to dantrolene, an RyRs antagonist, can stabilize Ca2+ signals, improve the synaptic plasticity and transmission, maintain neurotrophic support [brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fast axonal transport (FAT)], lower Aβ load, and ameliorate learning and memory impairment (Chakroborty et al. 2012; Oules et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2015; Peng et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2015; Gan and Silverman 2015; Guo et al. 1996; Guo et al. 1997). A previous study in our lab revealed that intranasal administration of dantrolene provided better therapeutic efficacy on cognitive function, compared to subcutaneous route in 5xFAD transgenic mice [the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and PS1 double-transgenic mouse, which co-expresses five familial AD mutations], particularly when the intervention was initiated immediately after the appearance of Aβ formation and onset of cognitive impairment. However, neither modes of administration of dantrolene ameliorated amyloid pathology (Shi et al. 2019). To this end, similar reports were made in two AD murine models (3xTg-AD, APP+/−/PS1+/−) in which RyR2-mediated cytosolic Ca2+leak from the ER was significantly improved by a novel RyRs stabilizing drug (Rycal), and hence it further reduced the Aβ load and improved synaptic functioning (Lacampagne et al. 2017). Certainly, it is noteworthy that negative effects of RyRs inhibition by dantrolene have also been described by some researchers (Zhang et al. 2010), who demonstrated that long time duration of dantrolene treatment resulted in a contrary effect in an 8-month APPPS1 mice model, including exacerbating Aβ production, synapse loss and neural atrophy in the hippocampus. As discussed above, the trajectory of AD-related initiation and progression, as well as RyRs blockade duration, may result in these discrepancies within these diverging models. Additionally, the specificity of dantrolene towards RyRs allows for another explanation (Popugaeva et al. 2017). One important study sheds light on the notion that RyRs may play a dual role implicated in the pathogenesis of AD (Liu et al. 2014). In that study, the deletion of RyR3 increased neuronal excitability and exacerbated AD pathology in the hippocampal region in young APPPS1 mice. However, in older mice, similar RyR3 deletions decreased the excitability of neurons, mushroom spines loss and Aβ load. The contradictory results corroborate previous observations of RyRs expression that is elevated in hippocampal regions of AD-affected cases while being apparently reduced in the subiculum, and CA1-CA4 regions at late stages (Kelliher et al. 1999). Taken together, RyRs may function as a protective actor at early stages and a pathogenic contributor at the late stages of AD. Therefore, the effect of RyRs modulation in AD definitely warrants further investigation in future studies.

4.2 Parkinson’s disease

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is generally thought of as the second most common type of NDD and is characterized by the progressive loss of neurons in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system as well as in other nervous systems (Kalia and Lang 2016). In clinical settings, almost 90% of PD cases exhibit a sporadic nature, with the remaining cases ascribed to genetic causes, indicating heterogeneous mechanisms may exist in PD. Currently, the incomplete nature of understanding of this disease has been a major motivator for acquiring disease modifying drugs (Lang and Espay 2018). Despite the diverse etiology, research supports that there are common pathways, including oxidative damage, mitochondrial malfunction, UPR, calcium dysregulation, and neuroinflammation which contribute to PD (Hirsch et al. 2013; Hirsch and Hunot 2009; Michel et al. 2007; Michel et al. 2016). Recently, the effect of a newly designed and synthesized 6-aminoquinoxalines (especially the compound called 4c) was tested in an in-vitro PD model involving selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. This test exhibited promising neuroprotective effects (Le Douaron et al. 2016). However, dantrolene, an antagonist of RyRs, significantly counteracted the beneficial efficacy of 4c, suggesting that this drug may exert its effect via the activation of RyRs. Such a report mirrors former studies which show that caffeine and its metabolic counterpart (paraxanthine) also displayed their potential effects of neuroprotection in distinct PD models (Xu et al. 2010; Guerreiro et al. 2008). It has been proposed that the neuroprotective effect of caffeine and its derivatives was ascribed to minute activation of the RyRs. A paraquat (PQ)-induced neurotoxicity PD model in Drosophila provided new insights into the role that RyRs may play in the PQ-related neurotoxicity, which at least in part occurs by increasing cytosolic Ca2+ levels in DA neurons, since PQ-induced cell death can be inhibited by downregulating the amount of functional RyRs (Cassar et al. 2015). Likewise, in primary cultured DA neurons, cell demise caused by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) insult can be ameliorated by Homer1 knockdown, and this protection was argued to beat least partially caused by modulatory effects on the homeostasis of Ca2+ channels by both the ER and cell membrane, which certainly includes RyRs (Chen et al. 2013). Dantrolene’s effect on PD remains unanswered and requires further investigation, since currently available evidence shows incontrovertibly that the regulation of RyRs plays some sort of pivotal role in neuroprotection in PD

4.3 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neuromuscular disease which features continuous and selective loss of motor neurons (MNs) in the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Familial cases account for about 10% of all cases and mortality generally occurs soon after symptom onset (3–5 years) (Masi et al. 2019; Aggad et al. 2014). At present, the underlying cause of ALS still remains largely undetermined (Masi et al. 2019), though several mutations of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) have recently gained attention as critical players in ALS (Leal et al. 2013). Poor understanding of the internal pathogenesis of MNs neurodegeneration halts research of promising therapeutics for ALS. As a downstream event triggered by ALS causes, axonal hyperexcitability contributes a major process driving neurotoxicity. Of note, cortical hyperexcitability has been reported to exist in carriers with SOD1 mutations ahead of onset of clinical symptoms, indicating that abnormal electrical activity contribute a crucial driver of ALS progression (Menon et al. 2014). Likewise, the SOD1 mouse model exhibits hyperexcitability and degeneration of MNs, suggesting an internal link between alterations of ionic mechanisms (Na+, K+ and Ca2+) and neuronal degeneration (Park et al. 2017). Compelling preclinical evidence supports that altered finely-tuned Ca2+ modulation and improper activation of a series of Ca2+ signaling pathways converge to form the mechanism via three ensuing neurotoxic effects: oxidative damage, mitochondrial exhaustion and neuroinflammation, making the MNs vulnerable (Jaiswal 2013; Grosskreutz et al. 2010; Kawamata and Manfredi 2010; Lautenschlaeger et al. 2012; Leal and Gomes 2015; Sirabella et al. 2018; Tadic et al. 2014; Tradewell et al. 2011; Jaiswal 2014) and thus causing muscle cramps and fasciculations. It has been proposed that Ca2+ release from ER plays a crucial effect in the MNs vulnerability to excitotoxicity, which is mainly mediated by RyRs (Grosskreutz et al. 2010; Jaiswal 2014; Kim et al. 2002). Subsequently, in vitro, blockades of RyRs with dantrolene mitigates Ca2+ signaling in cultured MNs (Jahn et al. 2006) and thus shows a neuroprotective effect (Rothstein and Kuncl 1995; Wei and Perry 1996; Hernandez-Fonseca and Massieu 2005; Staats et al. 2012). However, in vivo, feeding dantrolene daily to mice, who have an overexpression of SOD1 glycine to alanine at position 93 (SOD1G93A), did not show any effect on the number of MNs, ubiquitin aggregation, or the survival of the mice, demonstrating that elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ through RyRs does not result in the selective loss of MNs (Staats et al. 2012). Discrepancies of results between in vitro and in vivo trials may be explained, at least in part, that dantrolene in the targeted MNs did not achieve high enough concentration to exert its protective efficacy (Staats et al. 2012). Given the limited and inconsistent conclusions gleaned from different studies, dantrolene’s effect remains a promising avenue which needs to be well-characterized in future ALS animal models.

4.4 Spinocerebellar ataxia

Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a term referring to an array of hereditary movement control difficulties, with the hallmarks of clinically altered gait, limb and facial movements (Masi et al. 2019). SCAs are a group of progressive NDDs, and type 2 and 3 (SCA2 and SCA3) are the most common cases (Hsieh et al. 2017). These two types of SCAs are caused by the persistent disappearing of Purkinje cells initiated by aggregated mutant proteins with neurotoxic properties (Bushart and Shakkottai 2019). In neuronal development and natural aging, RyRs play a crucial role in the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of Purkinje cells (Ohashi et al. 2014; Hsieh et al. 2017; Abu-Omar et al. 2018). The upregulation of RyRs expression or RyRs action may prevent Purkinje cells from experiencing pathologic events of loss and demise (Vervliet 2018). In a context of SCA3 mouse model, researchers found that upregulated RyRs and serotonin levels counteracted the disease-associated loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar region (Hsieh et al. 2017). Key discoveries in the field of SCA revealed that mutant ataxin-2 or ataxin-3 protein could cause intracellular Ca2+ release via inositol 1,4,5-triphate receptor (IP3R), and this process was exaggerated by the RyRs through CICR (Liu et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2008). Accordingly, Ca2+ stabilizer dantrolene protects Purkinje cells from demise in SCA2–58Q mouse model (Liu et al. 2009). Likewise, long-time feeding of dantrolene could alleviate age-dependent motor coordination deficits and prevent neuronal loss in SCA3-YAC-84Q transgenic mouse model (Chen et al. 2008). Rapidly accumulating evidence continues to verify that the RyRs may provide a novel therapeutic target in different SCA settings (Egorova and Bezprozvanny 2019). In considering design of the clinical trial, potential side effects of long term exposure to dantrolene must be taken into consideration in the future study.

4.5 Huntington’s disease

Huntington’s disease (HD) is a genetically insidious NND characterized by the combination of chorea with neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment. This is caused by an expanded polyglutamine cytosine adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat in the gene coding for the huntingtin protein (HTT), in an autosomal-dominant fashion (Raymond 2017; Tang et al. 2005). Little is known about the underling pathogenic mechanism of HD, though evidence points to possible neurotoxicity caused by the aberrant HTT. At present, there is considerable evidence that mutant HTT (mHTT) can trigger the malfunction of the RyRs, and hence engender excessive Ca2+ leakage, and subsequent intracellular Ca2+ overload in neurons of the striatal and cortical region from R6/2 transgenic mice (Guerrero-Hernandez et al. 2014; Braubach et al. 2014; Suzuki et al. 2012). Additionally, cytosolic Ca2+ leakage and the demise of neurons improved significantly after in vitro expression of FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12), with the function of RyRs stabilization (Suzuki et al. 2012). Furthermore, dantrolene could potentially exert a dual effect in vivo in YAC128 mice, with both neuroprotection and causing neuropathology (Chen et al. 2011; Braubach et al. 2014). Future research is warranted to better understand the role of RyRs-mediated Ca2+ dysregulation in the treatment of HD, which of cause includes dantrolene.

5. Conclusion and implications

Essential breakthroughs in genetic research, and access to improved disease-associated models, has significantly improved the investigation of internal pathogenesis underlying distinct NDD subclasses. The role of RyRs in NDDs has ignited enormous interest and generated immense hope. Particularly, as listed in the current review, RyRs-mediated Ca2+ dysregulation has already emerged as a key process implicated in different NDD subtypes. Thus, a wide variety of strategies targeting RyRs has been tested and has achieved satisfactory results. However, these findings should be correctly interpreted, given that they all originate from cell and/or animal models. Therefore, we should be cautious when making the transition to human disease, meaning that there is still a long way to go.

Intriguingly, both downregulation and upregulation of RyRs acquire benefits in neuroprotection, as seen in AD and PD, suggesting exquisite degree of RyRs regulation may be the answer to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis. Nevertheless, we appreciate that the growing body of literature highlights that RyRs plays a central role in the pathogenesis of NDDs and are under intense investigation.

Moreover, dantrolene, an antagonist and a stabilizer of RyRs has already exhibited promising effects in different NDD models, though some of them are conflicting (summarized in Table 2). Thus, future studies focusing on dantrolene should be done, including clinical trials. Our studies along with several others indicate that dantrolene is inefficient at penetrating the CNS which proves a limitation for trying to optimize its therapeutic effect in AD and other NDDs (Oules et al. 2012; Peng et al. 2012; Muehlschlegel and Sims 2009; Zhang et al. 1993). Intranasal administration of therapeutic drugs has been used to improve drug penetration into the CNS for agents that have limitations of passing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Xiao et al. 2013). Due to dantrolene’s short half-life (Haraschak et al. 2014), an improved drug-delivery maneuver needs to be employed in order to reach a constant and elevated brain/plasma ratio. Based on research indicating that dantrolene is dose-dependent, the intranasal approach is one that would be beneficial to transport drugs across the BBB and penetrate into the CNS at an optimal concentration and duration (Krause et al. 2004; Shi et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2019). The recent novel findings primarily from our own lab reveal that intranasal administration of dantrolene significantly increased its concentrations and durations in the brain, compared to the oral approach (Wang et al. 2020) or subcutaneous route (Shi et al. 2020). These recent studies overcome the difficulty of limited dantrolene penetration into CNS and inspire future studies using dantrolene to treat different NNDs.

Figure 1 RyRs-mediated Ca2+homeostasis in neurons.

Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration rises following the influx of external Ca2+ via activation of VDCC, TRP/Orai channels, and ROC. Other signals may facilitate release of internal Ca2+ from the ER lumen through RyRs, which is also activated by aforementioned influx of external Ca2+(CICR). On the other hand, depletion of ER Ca2+ activates the capacitive Ca2+ entry via signals transferring from the Ca2+ sensor STIM to Orai/TRP channels. Mitochondria sequester Ca2+ via the uniporter MCU, and release Ca2+ into the cytosol through the NCXmito. Cytosolic Ca2+ is removed by extrusion of Ca2+ to the outside by the NCX and the PMCA. The release Ca2+ can be pumped back into the ER by SERCA using ATP. Intracellular Ca2+ binds to buffers and effectors, and thus maintains a vast array of normal cellular processes in neurons.

Figure 2 RyRs-mediated Ca2+ dysregulation causes apoptosis or death in neurons under different neurodegenerative disorders.

In conditions of different neurodegenerative disorders, extracellular stimuli trigger too much entry of external Ca2+ into cytosol via VDCC, TRP channels, and receptor operated calcium channel (ROC), primarily glutamate receptors. Under other scenarios, some intracellular signals also enable release of internal Ca2+ from the ER that open RyRs, which is also activated by surrounding adequate Ca2+ concentration using a mechanism of CICR. These two pathways can induce pathological elevation of cytosolic Ca2+concentration, which in turn, further causes excessive and abnormal Ca2+ entry into mitochondria leading to mPTP opening, increase of ROS, diminishes of ATP production, and release of cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIFs), eventually results in apoptosis. Moreover, abnormal elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ leads to activation of Ca2+/Ca2+ binding proteins which further promote the productions of a battery of apoptosis caspases, which is responsible for apoptosis or death of neurons.

Table 2. Therapeutic effect of dantrolene in different NDD models

NDD	Disease model	Effect of dantrolene	Reference	Remarks	
AD	Hippocampal cultures of PS1-M146VKI and Wild-type C57BL/6 mice	Rescues structural plasticity and long-term LTP maintenance (L-LTP) defects in KI neurons.	Zhang et al. 2015	Discrepancies may originate from the kinetics of AD-like initiation and progression as well as duration of RyRs blockade underling distinct models. Additionally, the specificity of dantrolene towards RyRs contributes to the discrepancy.
