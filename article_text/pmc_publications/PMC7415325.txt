In this study, we examined the uncertainty and local instability of motor function for cognitive impairment screening using a previously validated upper-extremity function (UEF). This approach was established based upon the fact that elders with an impaired executive function have trouble in the simultaneous execution of a motor and a cognitive task (dual-tasking). Older adults aged 65 years and older were recruited and stratified into 1) cognitive normal (CN), 2) amnestic MCI of the Alzheimer’s type (aMCI), and 3) early-stage Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Participants performed normal-paced repetitive elbow flexion without counting and while counting backward by ones and threes. The influence of cognitive task on motor function was measured using uncertainty (measured by Shannon entropy), and local instability (measured by the largest Lyapunov exponent) of elbow flexion and compared between cognitive groups using ANOVAs, while adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. We developed logistic ordinal regression models for predicting cognitive groups based on these nonlinear measures. A total of 81 participants were recruited, including 35 CN (age=83.8±6.9), 30 aMCI (age=83.9±6.9), and 16 early AD (age=83.2±6.6). Uncertainty of motor function demonstrated the strongest associations with cognitive impairment, with an effect size of 0.52, 0.88, and 0.51 for CN vs. aMCI, CN vs. AD, and aMCI vs. AD comparisons, respectively. Ordinal logistic models predicted cognitive impairment (aMCI and AD combined) with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.82. The findings accentuate the potential of employing nonlinear dynamical features of motor functions during dual-tasking, especially uncertainty, in detecting cognitive impairment.

Introduction

The increasing incidence of dementia poses a serious public health challenge [1]. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is predicted to afflict 1 in 85 people globally by the year 2050 [2]. Although no treatment has yet been found to slow or halt this disease, its early detection can be quite beneficial, as it may facilitate addressing safety concerns, arranging financial and legal matters, and planning and implementing treatments and future palliative care decisions [3]. Nonetheless, the application of current memory screening tools is constrained by several factors, including being subjective, affected by education and language biases, or the requirement for the global judgment of the examiner (e.g., in the clock-drawing test) [4–6]. Consequently, a quick and objective screening tool that could easily screen for and monitor the cognitive decline in the clinical setting would be beneficial.

The decline in brain executive functioning is among the detrimental effects of healthy aging [7]; however, in MCI and AD, these deficits become more pronounced [8]. The executive functions of the brain include processes such as sequencing actions to achieve goals, planning strategies, and allocating attentional resources [9, 10]. Accordingly, smooth and successful multi-tasking is contingent upon the effortless operation of executive functions. Therefore, individuals who suffer from AD often show difficulty in multi-tasking. Such observations have motivated researchers to find meaningful associations between the cognitive status of patients who suffer from dementia and their performance during dual-tasking in which a motor function (e.g., gait) is performed simultaneously with a cognitive task (e.g., reciting animals or counting); dual-tasking has been used extensively for this purpose [11–13].

Within a dual-task paradigm, the selected motor [14] and cognitive tasks [15, 16] could influence the outcome. For instance, while in many studies, the decline in gait performance during dual-tasking has been associated with cognitive impairment [11, 12, 17], others have not reported such associations [14, 18, 19]. Besides, since routine daily motor activities rely heavily on procedural memory systems, novel motor functions that may require some degree of skill learning may increase the demand on attentional resources and working memory; consequently, a novel motor task could be more beneficial in revealing cognitive impairment within a dual-task paradigm [14]. Further, implementing gait as the motor function for dual-tasking could be limited due to common mobility impairments among elders [20, 21], as well as space requirements.

We previously introduced a dual-task function, based exclusively on upper-extremity motor functions (UEF) [13, 14, 22, 23]. Two motor and two cognitive functions were explored in this setting in previous work. In the fast-paced motor function, participants performed elbow flexion/extension as quickly as possible for 20 seconds [24–26]; and in the normal-paced motor function, the flexion/extension occurred with a relatively uniform desired speed for 60 seconds. Also, counting backward by ones and threes in separate trials were considered as the cognitive functions. Within our previous work, we reported the advantages of UEF over gait in detecting cognitive impairments [14].

Further, we showed that normal speed motor function in dual-tasks could better identify cognitive impairment compared to rapid elbow flexion [25]. Consequently, these results were employed to develop cognitive indices based on select UEF parameters (i.e., flexion number, flexion variability, and flexibility variability) to identify amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). These parameters reflect the speed and the correct range of motion within the dual-task upper-extremity function, according to previous work [13, 27–29]. The variability parameters were chosen to represent changes in the flexion range of motion (flexibility variability), and variations in the flexion time-intervals (flexion variability) within dual-tasking [22].

Although our previous work was promising in detecting cognitive impairments, only linear motor function features were tested. The importance of nonlinear dynamical measures to better detect motor function alterations due to cognitive impairment was accentuated in previous works [11, 29–31]. For instance, the potentials of the largest Lyapunov exponent (LyE) as a measure of local instability, and using entropy as a measure of uncertainty (or predictability), to detect cognitive impairments within gait-based dual-tasking have been addressed in previous works [11, 29]. Such measures could unravel hidden dynamical structures of motor function alterations due to dual-tasking, and enhance the potential of objective cognitive impairment identification.

The objective of this study was to enhance the assessment of motor function alterations due to dual-tasking using nonlinear dynamic analysis for detecting cognitive impairments. To this end, we measured the uncertainty (using Shannon entropy) and local instability (using LyE) in the UEF motor function. We hypothesized that these nonlinear dynamical measures would differentiate between cognitive groups and that by combining our previously developed models with these new measures, better detection of cognitive impairment would be achieved.

Methods

Participants

Community-dwelling older adults (&gt;65 years) were recruited from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute, and stratified into three clinically confirmed cognitive groups: cognitive normal (CN), MCI of the Alzheimer’s type (aMCI), and early-stage AD. To clinically determine the cognitive status of participants, we utilized the National Institute of Aging - Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria [32, 33]. Inclusion criteria were: 1) age of 65 years or older; 2) ability to comprehend the instructions of the study; and 3) Proficiency in the English language. Participants with one of the following conditions were excluded: 1) severe complications in motor performance (e.g., stroke, and Parkinson’s disease); 2) severe speech disorders; and 3) significant musculoskeletal problems associated with the upper-extremity (e.g., elbow bilateral fractures, and rheumatoid arthritis). This study was approved by the University of Arizona Institutional Review Board. Before the experiments, all participants were informed about the procedure and signed the written consent form that was prepared based on the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki [34].

Clinical measures

In addition to neuropsychological tests for cognition diagnosis, to account for potential confounding factors in the dual-task performance, the following clinical measures were recorded: 1) physical frailty (the Fried Index) [35]; 2) comorbidity (Charlson comorbidity score (CCI)) [36, 37]; and 3) depression (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)) [38]. Our proposed cognitive measure is contingent upon the motor function; consequently, the Fried index was used to determine frailty among the participants. Details of the frailty measurement based on the Fried index can be found in [14]. Further, since an association between comorbidity and increased risk of cognitive impairment has been reported [39], we collected the CCI score for the participants. Finally, depression was measured to account for its potential impact on dual-task performance [40].

UEF assessment

Angular velocity of the forearm and the upper-arm were recorded (Figure 1) by employing wearable motion sensors (tri-axial gyroscope sensors, sample frequency =100 Hz, BioSensics LLC, Cambridge, MA). Participants completed one trial of single-task and two trials of dual-task UEF, each one for 60 seconds: normal-paced single-task arm flexion with no counting (NST), normal-paced arm flexion while counting backward by ones (NDT1); and normal-paced arm flexion while counting backward by threes (NDT2). To capture the essential dynamics of the underlying nonlinear mechanism, we only included those participants with at least 20 cycles of flexion [41]. We calculated the entropy and largest Lyapunov exponent (LyE) for un-filtered relative angle and angular velocity time-series of the elbow flexion.

Calculating entropy

In this study, we used Shannon entropy (H) [42] to quantify the uncertainty (or regularity) of the continuous angular velocity (or angle) time-series (X), which represents the predictability of the elbow flexion cycles when they are influenced by the cognitive task. At first, the time-series was binned based on the Freedman-Diaconis rule [43] for the optimal number of bins (n); then, we computed the probability that an arbitrary value of the time-series (xi) would belong to each bin p(xi). Finally, the entropy was calculated using H(X)=−∑i=1np(xi)log[p(xi)]; where log[.] designates the binary logarithm operator.

Calculating LyE

LyE was selected here to represent the dynamic stability to maintain a consistent elbow flexion movement despite the outside disturbance, which was the cognitive task here. To calculate LyE, the state-space corresponding to a time-series was reconstructed using the time-delay method [44]. Accordingly, a time-delay and an embedding dimension were estimated for each time-series. The first minimum of the average mutual information (AMI) function of the time-series was chosen as the time-delay, and the embedding dimension was estimated employing the false nearest neighbors method [44]. Subject-specific values obtained for the time-delay and embedding dimension were utilized to reconstruct the state-space for each time-series. The Wolf algorithm [45], as explained in [41], was employed to compute the LyE in the reconstructed state-space.

Calculating basic UEF parameters

Several linear measures representing kinematics of the elbow flexion were previously defined as basic UEF parameters [25]. As suggested in our previous model, we incorporated three of these outcome measures in the current study, including 1) flexibility variability, defined as the coefficient of variation (COV) of the flexion angle range; 2) flexion variability, defined as COV of time distances between consecutive angular velocity peaks; 3) flexion number, defined as the total number of flexion/extensions.

Before extracting the UEF outcomes, to clear any potential drifts, the angular velocity signal was fed into a high-pass Butterworth filter (1st order, cutoff = 2.5 Hz). Further, local peaks (maximum and minimum) of angular velocity signal and the cycles of elbow flexion were detected via an in-house App developed in MATLAB ver 2018b.

Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using JMP (version 11; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), and statistical significance was inferred when p≤0.05. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess between-cognitive group differences in continuous sociodemographic and clinical parameters. Chi-square tests were used to examine sex and comorbidity categories differences, and Fisher’s exact test was employed to evaluate differences in frailty prevalence between cognitive groups. Performing separate multivariable ANOVA models, we compared the entropy and LyE of relative elbow angle and angular velocity time-series (dependent variable) between cognitive groups (independent variable) for each condition of NST, NDT1, and NDT2, and Cohen’s effect size (d) was calculated. We adjusted all models with age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) to address potential confounding.

Within each dual-task condition, we developed an ordinal logistic regression model to determine cognitive status using sociodemographic characteristics, basic UEF parameters, and nonlinear measures. We took the following steps to establish logistic models: 1) descriptive analysis of the nonlinear measures: within each group, we detected outliers using box plots and histograms; also, distribution normality was checked using Shapiro-Wilk W test; 2) univariate analysis: to select independent variables for the following steps, we selected parameters which showed significant association with cognitive groups; 3) collinearity testing: variance inflation factor was used, and collinearity was detected when VIF was bigger than 10 [46]; and 4) stepwise parameter selection: UEF basic parameters (number of flexions, flexibility variability, and flexion variability), nonlinear measures, and sociodemographic parameters were selected based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) values.

10-fold cross-validation was considered to assess the models. First, we randomly divided the sample into k=10 equal parts. Then, at the kth iteration, one partition was utilized for the validation, and the remaining k - 1 subsets were fed into the model as the training set. To better report the performance of the models in detecting the cognitive impairment, we combined aMCI and AD participants into one group and compared them with the CN group. The mean and standard deviation across training sets were calculated for area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and AIC. Also, the mean and standard deviation of sensitivity and specificity were calculated within testing sets.

Results

Participants

A total of 91 participants were recruited, among whom 81 individuals comprised of 35 CN (age=83.8±6.9), 30 aMCI (age=83.9±6.9), and 16 AD (age=83.2±6.6) performed sufficient cycles of elbow flexion for the nonlinear dynamic analysis to be included. As shown in Table 1, cognitive groups had similar age, sex, and BMI distribution with no significant difference (p&gt;0.59). Similarly, no significant difference was observed in the frailty status, comorbidity score, and depression score between the groups (p&gt;0.13).

The 10 participants whom we excluded from this study were all cognitively impaired (four aMCI and six AD) and could not perform enough motion to unfold the nonlinear underpinning dynamics of the UEF dual-tasks (i.e., at least 20 cycles of the motor task within 60 seconds).

Uncertainty and local instability of motor outcome between cognitive groups

The entropy and LyE of the elbow angle and angular velocity time-series showed significant differences between cognitive groups within both normal UEF dual-task frameworks (Figure 2). On average among both dual-task difficulties (i.e., counting ones and threes), the entropy of elbow angular velocity showed the most significant effect size for all between-group comparisons (CN vs. aMCI: average effect size = 0.52; CN vs. AD: average effect size = 0.88; and aMCI vs. AD: average effect size = 0.51; Table 2).

The entropy of the elbow angle was non-significant within the single-task trial for all between-group comparisons (p&gt;0.89). Nonetheless, this quantity was significantly different between CN and aMCI within NDT1 and NDT2 (p&lt;0.05), and CN and AD (p&lt;0.002) comparisons. Except for the comparison between aMCI and AD groups within NST, the entropy of elbow angular velocity was significantly different in all between-group comparisons within NST (p&lt;0.01), NDT1 (p&lt;0.006), and NDT2 (p&lt;0.02). Of note, the importance of dual-task trials was highlighted considering the magnitude of effect sizes corresponding to NDT1 and NDT2 compared with NST. The mean effect size of this quantity for all between comparisons for NST, NDT1, and NDT2 was 0.34, 0.50, and 0.76, respectively.

The LyE of elbow angular velocity was only significantly different in the CN and AD comparisons within NST (p&lt;0.01), NDT1 (p&lt;0.02), and NDT2 (p&lt;0.02). The LyE of elbow angle was non-significant in NDT2 trials for all between-group comparisons (p&gt;0.07). However, this quantity could differentiate between CN and AD (p&lt;0.003), and aMCI and AD (p&lt;0.03) groups within NDT1.

Logistic models

Results from the ordinal logistic models for NDT1 and NDT2 are shown in Table 3. For both models, in addition to previously defined UEF basic parameters (flexion number, flexibility variability, and flexion variability), the entropy of angular velocity was selected in the stepwise approach. Results from the 10-fold cross-validation for this model showed mean ROC area under curve of 0.86±0.02 for aMCI and 0.84±0.02 for AD prediction with training sets, and sensitivity and specificity of 0.82±0.16 and 0.85±0.12, respectively, for predicting cognitive impairment (aMCI and AD combined) within the testing sets. Corresponding values were 0.87±0.02, 0.83±0.02, 0.82±0.14, and 0.82±0.1 for NDT2.

Discussion

Upper-extremity function performance is altered when combined with a counting backward cognitive task. Such dual-tasking challenges can be employed for quick executive function screening, provided that reliable measures and features are identified to differentiate between cognitive groups. In this study, we explored two nonlinear dynamical measures (i.e., entropy and LyE) to expand and better specify our previously developed logistic models to identify cognitive impairment. While both entropy and LyE could differentiate between cognitive groups within the UEF dual-task paradigm, the potential of motor task entropy was more promising. More importantly, as hypothesized, using these new measures, we managed to enhance the performance of our previously developed models in detecting cognitive impairments.

Using the current logistic model, we were able to enhance MCI and early AD identification compared to previously developed basic UEF models [25]. Our previously developed logistic models included flexion number, flexibility variability, and flexion variability as input parameters. This original model could predict cognitive impairment with a sensitivity of 0.77 and specificity of 0.71, on average among conditions. Using the model developed, incorporating nonlinear dynamical measures, the sensitivity and specificity, as depicted in Table 3, were increased to 0.82 and 0.84, respectively. Based on the current evidence, we believe adding nonlinear analysis, which considers the hidden dynamical structures of motor function alterations due to dual-tasking, better specifies cognitive impairment when compared to more simple peak-dependent parameters such as flexion variability of flexion number. Further, the logistic models developed here demonstrated no noticeable difference in terms of the cognitive task difficulty. This observation was in line with what has been previously reported [25], regarding the importance of cognitive task difficulty in identifying MCI and early AD.

Our findings suggest that among implemented nonlinear methods, entropy was the most efficient approach for identifying dual-task motor alterations. Entropy, as a measure of uncertainty, quantifies the number of states that a system can possess [47]. In other words, higher entropy indicates that the system can shift between more states, and predicting its future behavior using the information from the current state is unlikely. On the other hand, a system with very low entropy is focused on a limited number of states, and its future behavior is more predictable. The results of this study were in line with this interpretation. As shown in Figure 2, within each cognitive group, the entropy was increased with the cognitive task (counting) difficulty. In other words, with an increase in the required attentional resources, the level of uncertainty in the motor function performance was elevated, and it became more unpredictable. More importantly, in between-group comparisons, the entropy showed an increase with the level of cognitive impairment. This result could be attributed to the impaired executive functioning in MCI and early AD compared to cognitively normal older adults. In this study, the participants had to continuously bend their arm using a relatively uniform desired speed while counting backward. When appropriate attentional resources to set and maintain these goals and monitor the progress are not assigned by the executive function of the brain, the uncertainty of motor function will increase (possessing more states).

These observations could be attributed to the role of the prefrontal cortex in speed regulation [48]. In the trials of this study, the participants had to maintain a relatively uniform, albeit desired, flexion/extension speed. Therefore, the increase in shifting between velocity states of the motor function in cognitively impaired participants could be associated with the smaller neural density in the prefrontal cortex of these individuals. Another explanation for this observation could be explained within the neural specificity framework [49]. In a healthy young brain, during performing a motor task that should rely on procedural memory systems, other memory systems should be suppressed through the regulations imposed by the brain executive functions [50]. While this paradigm becomes negatively impacted by healthy aging, one may hypothesize that this impairment becomes exacerbated in the presence of cognitive declines. In other words, due to some extra brain activations (either deemed as unnecessary [50] or compensatory [51]), aMCI and AD patients may have more difficulty focusing on the primary task, and consequently, an increase in the uncertainty of motor function outcome could be observed. Accordingly, the potential of the entropy to differentiate between the cognitive groups was more pronounced in the presence of a cognitive task (comparing the effect sizes in Table 2). While these explanations are valid, their accuracy should be confirmed in future studies implementing brain imaging during dual-tasking.

Similar to entropy results, differences in LyE were observed among cognitive groups. Within a dual-task framework, considering the limited attentional resources, the cognitive task can be deemed as an internal perturbation to the motor task, potentially affecting its performance. To quantify the local stability of the motor task toward this perturbation (i.e., the ability to resist the perturbation), we measured the largest Lyapunov exponent, and as expected, the LyE increased with the cognitive task difficulty. In other words, the local stability of the motor function declined as the perturbation became stronger (counting backward by threes vs. ones). Similarly, in between-group comparisons, as the decline in the cognition became more pronounced, the value of LyE increased, and ergo, the local stability of the motor task decreased. Although the trend observed in the values of the LyE was similar to that of the entropy, the potential of LyE for differentiating between cognitive groups was not as strong. As shown in Figure 2, the LyE of elbow angle and angular velocity were not significantly different between CN and aMCI in dual-task trials.

One reason that could negatively impact the LyE values is the unequal number of flexion cycles performed by participants [52]. Within the current study, in consonance with our previously developed protocol [25], the trials were completed within a fixed period of 60 seconds. Of note, within different samples, it was shown that the flexion number was an important quantity to differentiate between cognitive groups [14, 25]; therefore, the current design for the UEF dual-task experiments was justified. Nonetheless, the values reported for the LyE in this study should be interpreted with caution. Instead of a fixed final time, to gain a better understanding of the potential of LyE to differentiate between cognitive groups within the UEF dual-task paradigm, the number of flexions should be fixed in future studies.

In this study, we did not include all the participants from the original dataset [25] and excluded those who could not perform at least 20 cycles of the motor task within 60 seconds. The 10 participants whom we excluded from this study, were all cognitively impaired (four aMCI and six AD), and could not perform enough motion to unfold the nonlinear underpinning dynamics of the UEF dual-tasks. As a quick check, we fed the information of these participants into our previously developed UEF cognitive indices and managed to detect the cognitive impairments. In other words, due to the crucial importance of the flexion number, in case a participant cannot perform enough motion within the 60s trials, the previously developed indices can be employed to detect the cognition status. Further, as this is a screening test, the inability to complete adequate flexions should trigger a positive test and indicate the need for clinical follow-up.

Efficient coordination between default mode network (DFN), frontoparietal central executive network (CEN), and salience network (SN) is crucial for brain executive functions and allocating attentional resources during dual-tasking [53]. Previous research has shown that SN modulates the anti-correlated activity of DFN and CEN [54]. Impaired modulation between these networks results in excessive activation of DFN during executive control, and consequently, increased variability in the behavioral performance [55]. There is a body of evidence suggesting that the coupling between these networks is disrupted in aMCI and AD patients, even before they show any symptoms of AD [56]. Such evidence highlights the importance of effective dual-task experimental setups for the early detection of MCI. The results of this study, in line with previous research, insinuated that motor function assessment within dual-tasking could potentially reflect such pernicious alterations of the human brain, and it merits further investigations accompanied by brain imaging.

In this study, we assumed that smooth and successful multi-tasking is contingent upon the proper action of executive functions; and consequently, the decline in dual-task performance among aMCI and AD patients was attributed to impaired executive functions in these patients. Although the literature abounds with studies supporting this assumption, there exist symbolic cognitive models in which the role of executive functions in multi-tasking is ignored; and instead, it is assumed that multitasking emerges from the interaction of autonomous process threads [57]. Although analyzing dual-tasking (concurrent motor and cognitive task) within this novel framework may provide interesting theoretical insights for cognitive modeling, the results of this study should be examined within the realm of nonlinear dynamical system (NDS) theories for human cognition.

Limitations and future work

In this study, we used the elbow angle and angular velocity time-series to estimate the local instability and uncertainty of the motor task. One alternative for evaluating the dynamics of the UEF dual-task is to examine the iterated maps, instead of the whole time-series. For instance, we previously have defined the flexion variability based on the time distance between consecutive peaks of the elbow angular velocity [25]. Similarly, instead of using the whole motion time-series, one may only consider the peak time-series and explore the dynamics of the system and its hidden structures. Although this approach may be more beneficial and effective in differentiating between cognitive groups, providing a time-series with an appropriate length could pose a challenge for older adults. Although there exist some helpful guidelines in this regard for gait [41], they cannot be generalized to an upper-extremity motor task, and this issue should be addressed in future work.

Considering the selection criteria, the conditions of this study were limited to amnestic MCI of the Alzheimer’s type and early AD. Nonetheless, since AD is the most common type of dementia, current findings support this as a promising screening tool for assessing cognitive impairment in most older adults, with potential future use for other dementias. This limitation will be addressed in our follow-up studies, in which participants with different definitively diagnosed types of dementia will be recruited.

In this paper, we did not investigate the associations between the entropy and LyE variables and the subject neuropsychological tests. In future publications, we will explore the correlation between these nonlinear measures and different components of cognitive impairments within neuropsychological tests (e.g., working memory, attention, and executive functioning deficits) should be explored within our cohort. Moreover, to investigate kinetic variables (e.g., elbow muscle forces and moments) in UEF dual-tasking, musculoskeletal modeling of the upper-extremity should be considered [58–60].

Conclusion

Within the current study, we examined the potential of uncertainty and local instability of motor function outcomes to detect cognitive impairments within a UEF self-selected pace dual-task framework. We measured the uncertainty of the elbow angle and angular velocity employing the Shannon entropy; further, the largest Lyapunov exponent was used to determine the local stability of the same kinematic time-series. Results of this study demonstrated that both of these measures could differentiate between cognitive groups within the UEF dual-task paradigm; however, the uncertainty observed in the elbow angular velocity time-series showed the most significant associations with the cognition status. Further, using the entropy of motor function outcomes, we enhanced the performance of our previously developed logistic models based on peak-dependent outcomes, for detecting cognitive impairments in older adults. Overall, the current study further highlighted the potential of UEF dual-tasking as a simple, quick, and accurate tool for screening cognitive impairments among community-dwelling older adults.

Highlights

A quick and objective memory screening tool is essential for the early detection of mild cognitive impairment.

Dual-task assessment within upper-extremity motor function can differentiate between cognitively normal, amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and early Alzheimer’s disease participants.

Motor function uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, increases with the level of cognitive impairment.

Motor function instability, as measured by the largest Lyapunov exponent, increases with the level of cognitive impairment.

Within the upper-extremity dual-tasking, using motor function uncertainty, in addition to conventional motor function variability measures, early stage cognitive impairment was detected with high sensitivity and specificity.
