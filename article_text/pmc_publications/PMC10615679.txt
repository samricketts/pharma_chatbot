Introduction:

The aim of the study was to assess factors associated with the perceived risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and how the perceived risk of ADRD was related to cognitive function.

Methods:

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 5 waves of data from the Health and Retirement Study (2012–2022) that included adults aged 65 years or older with no previous diagnosis of ADRD at baseline. Cognitive function was measured at baseline and over time using a summary score that included immediate/delayed word recall, serial 7’s test, objective naming test, backwards counting, recall of the current date, and naming the president/vice-president (range=0–35). Perceived risk of developing ADRD was categorized at baseline as “definitely not” (0% probability), “unlikely” (1–49%), “uncertain” (50%), and “more than likely” (&gt;50–100%). Additional baseline measures included participants’ sociodemographic background, psychosocial resources, health behaviors, physiological status, and healthcare utilization.

Results:

Of 1,457 participants (median age 74 [IQR=69–80] and 59.8% women), individuals who perceived that they were “more than likely” to develop ADRD had more depressive symptoms and were more likely to be hospitalized in the past two years than individuals who indicated that it was “unlikely” they will develop ADRD. Alternatively, participants who perceived that they would “definitely not” develop ADRD were more likely to be non-Hispanic Black, less educated, and have lower income than individuals who indicated it was “unlikely” they would develop ADRD. Participants who reported their risks of developing ADRD as “more than likely” (β =−2.10, P&lt;.001) and “definitely not” (β =−1.50, P&lt;.001) had the lowest levels of cognitive function; and the associations were explained in part by their socioeconomic, psychosocial, and health status.

Conclusions:

Perceived risk of developing ADRD is associated with cognitive function. The (dis)concordance between individuals’ perceived risk of ADRD and their cognitive function has important implications for increasing public awareness and developing interventions to prevent ADRD.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) currently affect 6.2 million Americans aged 65 and older (“2021 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures,” 2021). Every five years, the number of older adults diagnosed with ADRD doubles in the United States and it is estimated that 14 million older adults will be diagnosed with ADRD by 2060 (Matthews et al., 2019; What Is Alzheimer’s Disease? | CDC, 2022). Although the underlying causes of ADRD are not fully understood, prior studies have identified a wide array of risk factors associated with the development of ADRD, including high blood pressure, physical inactivity, sedentary behaviors, smoking, and low education (Livingston et al., 2020; National Academies of Sciences, 2017; Raichlen et al., 2022). Despite the increasing number of interventions that have been developed to target these risk factors and to increase awareness of ADRD, the general public often has inadequate knowledge about ADRD and their risks of developing the disease (Deb et al., 2017). In fact, many Americans consider the development of cognitive impairment and/or dementia as a normal part of the aging process (Alzheimer’s Association., 2021; Amjad et al., 2018; Dilworth-Anderson &amp; Gibson, 2002; Huggins et al., 2022; Johl et al., 2016; Parveen et al., 2017).

The Health Belief Model provides a theoretical explanation that illustrates how an individual’s attitudes and belief can influence their health behaviors and ultimately impact their health outcomes (Green et al., 2020). As a core component of the Health Belief Model, perceived susceptibility refers to an individual’s subjective assessment of their risk of developing a disease (Green et al., 2020). Prior studies have demonstrated that an individual’s perception of developing a disease is associated with their adoption of healthy behaviors and the use of preventive strategies (Brewer et al., 2004; Ferrer &amp; Klein, 2015; Lee et al., 2022). An estimated 50% of U.S. adults aged 50 to 64 believed they were at least somewhat likely to develop ADRD, and approximately 30% of persons aged 65 years and older thought they had a 50% or greater likelihood of developing ADRD (Lee et al., 2022; Maust et al., 2020). Studies have shown that individuals with a higher perceived likelihood of developing ADRD were more likely to pay for a medicine to prevent ADRD, to talk with their physician about strategies to prevent cognitive decline, and to engage in advance care planning (Chung et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2022; Maust et al., 2020). However, little is known about the factors associated with older adults’ perceived risks of developing ADRD and how these perceptions are associated with cognitive function.

This study used longitudinal data of U.S. older adults to examine the association between the perceived risk of developing ADRD and levels of cognitive function. Two major research questions were addressed. First, what are the sociodemographic, psychosocial, behavioral, physiological, and/or healthcare utilization factors associated with older adults’ perceived risks of developing ADRD? Second, how are older adults’ perceived risks of ADRD associated with cognitive function?

MATERIALS AND METHOS

Data Source and Study Sample

The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a nationally-representative longitudinal study of U.S. older adults sponsored by the National Institute on Aging (Juster &amp; Suzman, 1995; The Health and Retirement Study, 2022). Since 1992, the HRS has collected data every two years from a nationally-representative sample of U.S. adults over the age of 50. Using a steady-state design with replenished sampling, the HRS now provides more than two decades of biennial data on more than 40,000 older adults. The multi-stage sampling design, implementation, and response rates for the HRS have been documented in detail elsewhere (Juster &amp; Suzman, 1995; The Health and Retirement Study, 2022). In 2012 and 2016, supplementary survey modules were administered to random subsamples of HRS participants to better understand older Americans’ perceptions of ADRD, long-term care expectations, and financial planning. This study was approved by the Duke Health Institutional Review Board (IRB Pro00101404).

A total of 3,342 HRS respondents who were surveyed in the 2012 and 2016 survey modules and followed for up to 4 years (2012 to 2016 and 2016 to 2020, respectively, as illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1). We excluded 283 respondents who did not provide a valid answer to the perceived ADRD risk question (Figure 1). We then excluded respondents who were younger than age 65 (n=1,527) at the time of data collection because the cognition questions were only asked of respondents aged 65 and older. There were 47 respondents aged 65 and older who were surveyed both in the 2012 and the 2016 modules; therefore, we only kept their responses from the 2012 data. We further excluded respondents who had missing data for their baseline measures of cognition (n=3) and who reported having a diagnosis of ADRD at baseline (n=25). The final analytical sample included 1,457 respondents who contributed a total of 3,563 observations over the study period.

Perceived Risk of ADRD

Respondents were asked the following question in 2012: “Using a scale of 0–100 where 0 means no chance and 100 means absolutely certain, what are the chances that you will develop Alzheimer’s disease sometime [within the next 5 years/sometime in the future]?” A similar question was asked in 2016 (“…what is the percent chance that you will develop dementia sometime in the future?”). Based on prior research on subjective probabilities (De Bruin et al., 2000; Hurd, 2009), the distribution of the answers in the current study (Supplementary Figure 2), and preliminary analyses using alternative approaches (i.e., continuous, piecewise, different cut-points), respondents were categorized into four groups of perceived risk of developing ADRD: (1) Definitely not (0% chance), (2) Unlikely (1–49% chance), (3) Uncertain (50% chance), and (4) More than likely (51–100% chance). Prior research on the psychometrics of subjective probabilities has suggested that respondents who answer 0%, 50%, or 100% probabilities share distinct response characteristics (De Bruin et al., 2000; Hurd, 2009). Accordingly, recent research using the HRS has also included similar response categories (e.g., 0%, 1–49%, 50%, etc.) to examine perceived life expectancy (Lou &amp; Carr, 2022). In the current analysis, the distribution of responses to the questions of perceived risk also supported a similar 4-group approach – see Supplementary Table 2. The reference group (“unlikely”) was selected because it captured the general perception held by most older adults in this U.S. cohort and allowed us to directly examine substantively distinct perceptions of risk.

Cognitive Function

At each wave (2012 to 2020), the HRS administered a series of cognitive tests to assess respondents’ overall cognitive function in regard to orientation, memory, and executive function (Langa et al., 2020). The specific measures included immediate and delayed word recall (scored 0–20), recall of current date (scored 0–4), naming the president and vice-president (scored 0–2), serial 7’s test (scored 0–5), backwards counting (scored 0–2), and objective naming test (scored 0–2). Following prior research, correct responses from each measure were summed to create a total cognition score that ranged from 0 to 35, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.(Mccammon et al., 2022; RAND HRS Longitudinal File 2018 (V1) Documentation, 2022).

Covariates

Based on prior literature (Chung et al., 2009; Livingston et al., 2020; Maust et al., 2020), we included a wide array of covariates to account for respondents’ baseline characteristics. Sociodemographic background included age (years), sex, race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, or Other race/ethnicity), educational attainment (less than high school, high school graduate, some college, or college and above), foreign-born (yes or no), and household income (in thousands of dollars). Psychosocial resources included marital status (currently married/partnered or not), number of living children, and depressive symptoms measured by the abbreviated Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD; range 0–8). Behavioral factors included smoking status (never, former smoker, or current smoker), alcohol consumption (0, 1, or ≥ 2 drinks per day), vigorous physical activity (never, ≥ 1 per week, or ≥ 1 per month), receiving cholesterol screening (yes or no), and receiving a flu shot (yes or no). Health-related factors included body mass index (BMI, kg/m2; (18.5–24.9, 25–29.9, or ≥ 30), self-rated health status (excellent/very good, good, or fair/poor), disease diagnoses (hypertension, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and stroke), and having an overnight hospital stay in the past two years (yes or no).

Preliminary analyses also included additional variables such as living arrangement and health insurance type (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, private); however, these variables were highly correlated with other variables included in the analyses (e.g., age, income, marital status, etc.) and were therefore dropped from the final analyses. We also included a variable for survey cohort to account for potential design differences (i.e., question wording) with regard to perceived risks of ADRD within the 2012 module and between the 2012 and 2016 modules. Several sensitivity analyses were used to assess whether the differences in design/wording may have introduced biased. First, we compared the distribution of responses to the perceived risk questions by cohort and the results indicated no significant differences (shown in Table 1). Second, we tested interactions between study cohort and perceived risks and there were no significant differences to warrant stratified analyses. Third, we also tested for potential study cohort and age interactions to assess whether respondents who were younger (i.e., at age 65) may perceive their risk of developing ADRD differently than respondents who were much older—and the results showed no significant differences. Finally, all models adjusted for study cohort when examining the association between perceived risks of ADRD and cognitive function (shown in Supplementary Table 2).

Statistical Analysis

The baseline characteristics of study participants were computed across levels of the perceived risk of developing ADRD using means and standard deviations (SD) as well as median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), Wilcoxon ranksum tests, and χ2 tests were used to compare characteristics among groups. We then used fully-adjusted multinomial logistic regression models to identify factors associated with the perceived risk of developing ADRD (definitely not, unlikely, uncertain, more than likely).

Next, we used multivariable mixed models to examine whether the perceived risk of developing ADRD was associated with baseline levels and/or changes in respondents’ cognitive function over time (Detry &amp; Ma, 2016; Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002; Singer &amp; Willett, 2009). Unconditional models were tested for model fit using Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values (Supplementary Table 1). Preliminary analyses showed that perceived risks of ADRD had a nonlinear association with cognitive function (inverted U-shape). As noted above, the categorical measure for perceived risks of ADRD allowed us to account for nonlinearity and produced results that were consistent with those obtained from continuous (spline) and piecewise models. Additionally, exploratory analyses that separated Hispanic ethnicity from the other racial/ethnic category yielded similar results as those presented here. Multiple imputation methods were used to address missing data (&lt;5% across all covariates) and to preserve the sample size (Collins et al., 2001; Little &amp; Rubin, 2019.).

Model 1 included fixed and random linear effects for time (wave) while adjusting for age, sex, race, and cohort. Model 2 further included covariates for sociodemographic background, psychosocial resources, behavioral factors, and health-related factors. P values referred to two-tailed tests, and statistical significance was considered at p &lt; .05. Sampling weights were not used in the analyses as all multivariate analyses accounted for variables used in the sampling weights (e.g., age, sex, race) to produce unbiased estimates and avoid inflated standard errors (Winship &amp; Radbill, 2016). All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.2 (Stata Corp, LLC).

RESULTS

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of study participants by the level of perceived risk of developing ADRD. Among the 1,457 respondents, 19.9% perceived that they definitely would not develop ADRD in the next five years, 42.8% reported unlikely, 23.8% were uncertain about their risk of developing ADRD, and 13.5% perceived that they were more than likely to develop ADRD in the next five years. Compared to respondents in the other three groups, those in the “definitely not” group were slightly older, were more likely to be non-Hispanic Black race, reported lower levels of education and household income, and were less likely to be born in the United States. Respondents who reported “unlikely” to develop ADRD had better psychosocial and health profiles and were more likely to be married or partnered, had fewer depressive symptoms, were more likely to consume two or more drinks per day, were more likely to report excellent self-rated health, and were less likely to have diabetes or heart disease. The “definitely not” group reported the lowest rates of cholesterol check-ups and hospitalizations compared with other groups. Respondents in the “unlikely” group had the highest cognition scores at baseline, whereas those in the “definitely not” group and “more than likely” groups had the lowest cognition scores (Supplementary Figure 3).

Table 2 shows the adjusted multinomial estimates of factors associated with perceived risks of ADRD. Figure 2 further illustrates the predicted probabilities (PP) obtained from the estimates in Table 2 to facilitate interpretation. The results demonstrate that respondents who perceived that they would “definitely not” develop ADRD were significantly more likely to be older (PP = 14% at age 65 vs. 23% at age 85), non-Hispanic Black (PP = 25% for non-Hispanic Black vs. 16% for non-Hispanic White), less educated (PP = 23% for less than HS degree vs. 15% for college or more), have lower household income (PP = 19% for $25,000 per year vs. 16% for $50,000 per year), and consume less alcohol (PP = 19% for never drinking vs. 12% for ≥ 2 drinks per day) than respondents who indicated that it was “unlikely” they will develop ADRD. Alternatively, respondents who perceived that they would “more than likely” develop ADRD were significantly more likely to be among other race/ethnicity groups (PP = 23% for other race/ethnicity vs. 12% for non-Hispanic White), have more CESD depressive symptoms (PP = 19% for 4 symptoms vs. 11% for no depressive symptoms), and were more likely to have been hospitalized in the past two years (PP = 17% for the hospitalized vs. 12% for the non-hospitalized) than respondents who indicated that it was unlikely” they will develop ADRD. No differences were found in the characteristics of study participants who reported that it was “unlikely” or “uncertain” that they would develop ADRD in the next 5 years.

Table 3 presents results from the base and fully adjusted mixed models. At baseline, we found significantly lower cognitive function among older adults who reported their risks of developing ADRD as “definitely not” (β =−1.50, P&lt;.001), “uncertain” (β =−0.99, P&lt;.001), and “more than likely” (β =−2.10, P&lt;.001) compared with those who report their risks of developing ADRD as “unlikely.” After fully adjusting for multiple confounding factors (see Supplementary Table 2), the associations were partially attenuated but remained significant (“definitely not” β =−0.58, P=.041; “uncertain” β =−0.64, P=.006; and “more than likely” β =−1.72, P&lt;.001). For older adults who reported their risks as “more than likely,” this is equivalent to a nine-year age difference in level of cognitive function compared to those who reported their risks as “unlikely.” All study participants exhibited a significant decline in cognitive function over time, and there were no differences in the rate of cognitive decline across the four groups.

DISCUSSION

Using longitudinal data from a nationally-representative study of older adults, we found that nearly 1-in-5 participants perceived that they definitely would not develop ADRD in the next five years. However, we also found that these older adults had levels of cognitive function that were significantly lower than the majority of older adults who reported being unlikely to develop ADRD. Older adults who perceived that they were more than likely to develop ADRD in the next five years had the lowest levels of cognitive function—which translates to an almost 10-year age difference in level of cognitive function compared to those who reported their risks as unlikely.

Results from this analysis identified several factors that were related to the perceived risk of developing ADRD. We found that individuals with worse health status, including both physical health (i.e., being hospitalized in the past two years) and mental health (i.e., having more depressive symptoms), were more likely to perceive that they would develop ADRD in next 5 years. Similar findings from prior research have also shown that respondents with poor mental health were more likely to perceive that they were somewhat or very likely to develop ADRD (Maust et al., 2020). Given that these individuals had the poorest cognitive function, interventions that focus on addressing modifiable risk factors of ADRD in this vulnerable group are highly needed. Furthermore, prior research has suggested that the subclinical progression of ADRD may be occurring years before the detectable onset of disease (Hughes &amp; Ganguli, 2009). Therefore, it is critical to address modifiable risk factors such as smoking sensation and blood pressure control not only in later life but throughout the life course (Livingston et al., 2020).

We found that the non-Hispanic Black respondents were 89% more likely to perceive that they would definitely not develop ADRD in next 5 years compared to their White counterparts. This finding is similar to prior research that also reported a significant racial difference in the perceived risk of developing ADRD (among U.S. adults aged 50–64) (Maust et al., 2020). We also found that older adults with lower levels of education and income were more likely to perceive that they definitely would not develop ADRD relative to those with higher levels of socioeconomic status (SES)—which are consistent with findings from prior studies (Hajek &amp; König, 2020). Together, these results are notable considering that non-Hispanic Black populations and older adults with low SES have among the highest prevalence of ADRD in the United States (Majoka &amp; Schimming, 2021; Matthews et al., 2019). Thus, more targeted interventions are needed to increase dementia knowledge and to mitigate the potential risks of developing ADRD in high-risk populations.

Contrary to some previous research, we found that respondents at older ages were more likely to perceive that they definitely would not develop ADRD. However, a recent study of adults aged 50–64 showed that age did not impact people’s perception of their ADRD risk.(Maust et al., 2020) Our findings may be due in part to a “survival effect.” That is, individuals at older ages (≥ 65) may increasingly exhibit a positive outlook of delaying/avoiding a specific illness as they reach advanced ages in the absence of an existing condition (Cockerham et al., 1983; Rakowski &amp; Cryan, 1990; Roberts, 1999). Relatedly, we found that older adults who were hospitalized in the previous two years perceived that they were more than likely to develop ADRD. Similarly, the psychological health of older adults is an important factor that can influence their perceptions of illness (as well as actual illness). We found evidence consistent with prior research showing that depressive symptoms not only contribute to greater perceptions of developing ADRD, but also to overall lower levels of cognitive function (Krogh et al., 2014; Maust et al., 2020; McDermott &amp; Ebmeier, 2009).

Another key finding was that most cognitively-beneficial behaviors (e.g., physical activity, tobacco use, etc.) did not differ across older adults who had markedly different perceptions of developing ADRD. For example, despite having the perception of being more than likely to develop ADRD in the near future—and also having the lowest levels of cognitive function—less than 20% of these adults engaged in any vigorous physical activity at least once a week. Increasing evidence has suggested that being physically active may slow the progression of cognitive decline and/or prevent the onset of ADRD (Barnes et al., 2013; Geneva: World Health Organization, 2019; Groot et al., 2016; Iso-Markku et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 123 C.E.; Ngandu et al., 2015; Rovio et al., 2005). Yet, studies have shown that less than half of the general public believe the cognitive benefits of physical activity (Cations et al., 2018; Olanrewaju et al., 2016). Although to date there are no established methods for estimating an individual’s risk of developing ADRD in an objective manner, a recent study has found that the Framingham 10‐year cardiovascular disease risk score may help predict an individual’s cognitive function (Wei et al., 2023). These findings suggest that public awareness campaigns and educational interventions are needed to help increase the public’s understanding of risk factors for dementia and to promote the engagement of healthy lifestyle behaviors.

The (dis)concordance between an individual’s perception of ADRD risks and their cognitive function has potential implications for public health and clinical practice (Kenning et al., 2017; Mez et al., 2013). In our study, we found that older adults who perceived that they definitely would not develop ADRD in the next five years had significantly poorer cognitive function than those who perceived their risks of developing ADRD to be unlikely. These findings largely remained after accounting for a wide array of covariates. The Health Belief Model suggests that an individual’s perception of risk may reflect their understanding of a given health condition and may motivate individuals to change their health behaviors (Green et al., 2020). Previous studies have found that those who perceived a high risk of developing ADRD were more likely to complete a living will, discuss treatment preferences with a health care provider, and engage in preventive actions (Lee et al., 2022; Maust et al., 2020). Therefore, an accurate awareness of an individual’s risk of developing ADRD may prompt the use of preventive strategies and/or discussions with their health care providers about ADRD.

We found that respondents who were non-Hispanic Black and respondents with low SES were more likely to perceive that they definitely would not develop ADRD. Prior research has found that individuals from these backgrounds are more likely to have limited knowledge about ADRD and exhibit stigma towards this condition (Kenning et al., 2017; Mez et al., 2013). Although the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease included specific goals to increase public awareness of ADRD (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2021), more culturally tailored programs and interventions are especially needed to address the misperceptions of ADRD and to increase dementia knowledge in racial and ethnic minority groups and in low socioeconomic groups.

Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, the information on perceived risk of ADRD was only available at baseline. It is possible that individuals may change their perception as they age. However, our current analyses allowed us to better establish temporality in the associations over time (i.e., Supplemental Table 1 shows that perceived risks of ADRD were not associated with changes in cognitive function over time). Second, because of limited information available on the clinical diagnosis of ADRD in the HRS core survey, we were unable to assess the relationship between the perceived and actual risks of developing dementia in this study. Third, although the HRS implemented a sampling strategy to ensure respondents in their survey modules were representative of the overall HRS sample, the sample sizes of racial and ethnic minority groups were relatively small. In particular, we found that respondents included in the other racial/ethnic category were the most likely to perceive they would more than likely develop ADRD. However, we remain cautious in our interpretation of this finding due to the limited sample size and heterogeneity captured in this racial category (i.e., Hispanic, Asian, and/or other races). Fourth, we acknowledge that some participants—i.e., racial/ethnic minority groups and those with poorer cognitive function at baseline—were more likely to have missing/invalid responses to the perceived risk questions, which might have introduced some selection bias in this study. Furthermore, the limited duration of follow-up in this study (4 years) may have prevented us from observing significant differences in rates of cognitive decline. Finally, we acknowledge that additional factors such as personality (e.g., neuroticism, conscientiousness, and openness), health literacy, and family history of ADRD may be associated with respondents’ perception of ADRD risk; however, these measures were only ascertained in a limited number of respondents in our current study.

CONCLUSIONS

In this longitudinal study of adults aged 65 and older, the perceived risk of developing ADRD was associated with cognitive function. Respondents who were non-Hispanic Black and low SES were more likely to perceive that they would definitely not develop ADRD in next 5 years. Individuals who reported more depressive symptoms and had been hospitalized in the past two years were more likely to perceive that they would develop ADRD. The uptake of most cognitively-beneficial behaviors did not differ across older adults who had markedly different perceptions of developing ADRD. Our findings suggest there is an urgent need for public awareness campaigns and educational interventions to help increase the public’s understanding of ADRD and to promote the uptake of evidence-based healthy lifestyle behaviors, especially among high-risk groups.

Highlights:

In this U.S. cohort study, nearly 1-in-5 adults aged 65 and older reported that they would not develop ADRD in their lifetime.

Older adults who perceived the lowest (definitely not) and highest (more than likely) risk of developing ADRD had the lowest levels of cognitive function over time.

The (dis)concordance between an individual’s perceived risks of ADRD and their cognitive function has potential implications for increasing public awareness and developing interventions to prevent ADRD.
