Methylene blue (MB) is commonly used in diagnostic procedures and is also used to treat various medical conditions. Neurological effects of MB have been reported in clinical observations and experimental studies. Thus the modulation of GABAA receptor function by MB was investigated. Whole-cell GABA-activated currents were recorded from HEK293 cells expressing various GABAA receptor subunit configurations. MB inhibition of GABA currents was apparent at 3 μM, and it had an IC50 of 31 μM in human α1β2γ2 receptors. The MB action was rapid and reversible. MB inhibition was not mediated via the picrotoxin site, as a mutation (T6’F of the β2 subunit) known to confer resistance to picrotoxin had no effect on MB-induced inhibition. Blockade of GABAA receptors by MB was demonstrated across a range of receptors expressing varying subunits, including those expressed at extrasynaptic sites. The sensitivity of α1β2 receptors to MB was similar to that observed in α1β2γ2 receptors, indicating that MB’s action via the benzodiazepine or Zn2+ site is unlikely. MB-induced inhibition of GABA response was competitive with respect to GABA. Furthermore, mutation of α1 F64 to A and β2 Y205 to F in the extracellular N-terminus, both residues which are known to comprise GABA binding pocket, remarkably diminished MB inhibition of GABA currents. These data suggest that MB inhibits GABAA receptor function by direct or allosteric interaction with the GABA binding site. Finally, in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, MB inhibited GABA-activated currents as well as GABAergic IPSCs. We demonstrate that MB directly inhibits GABAA receptor function, which may underlie some of the effects of MB on the CNS.

1. Introduction

The neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the predominant fast inhibitory neurotransmitter of the adult central nervous system (CNS), acts principally via Cl− selective ligand-gated ion channels (GABAA receptors). Activation of GABAA receptors results in membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal inhibition in adults. GABAA receptors are pentameric membrane proteins comprising seven different classes of subunits, many with multiple variants (α1-6, β1-3, γ1-3, ρ1-3, δ, ε, π and θ) (Barnard et al. 1998; Whiting 1999). Within the GABAA receptor family, the combination of α1β2γ2 is the most abundantly expressed member in brain (Fritschy and Brünig, 2003). Dysfunction of GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission can shift the balance of inhibitory and excitatory forces in the CNS, resulting in pathological consequences. Abnormal GABAergic neurotransmission is implicated in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, depression, seizure disorders and anxiety disorders. Correspondingly, enhancement or modulation of GABA-induced currents an important mechanism of action of a large number of existing and developing therapeutic agents.

Methylene blue (MB) has been used in humans for more than 120 years. It is clinically used in diagnostic procedures and also used to treat a number of medical conditions such as carbon monoxide poisoning, methemoglobinemia and cyanide poisoning (Clifton and Leikin, 2003). Due to its high lipophilicity, MB has a remarkably high permeability through the blood-brain barrier and can reach concentrations up to hundreds of μM in brain after intravenous or oral administration (Peter et al., 2000; O’Leary et al., 2010). In recent years, MB has attracted great interest as it is proposed to be a new neurobiological approach to improve normal memory and to treat memory impairment and neurodegeneration associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. The memory-enhancing effect of MB has been investigated in phase II clinical trials on patients with Alzheimer disease (ID: NCT02380573, ClinicalTrials.gov) and post-traumatic stress disorder (ID: NCT01188694). MB has multiple cellular and molecular targets in the CNS that appear to underlie its neurological effects (Oz et al., 2011; Rojas et al., 2012). Here we identified GABAA receptors as a pharmacological target for the CNS actions of MB.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Brain slice preparation

Transverse hippocampal slices were acutely prepared from postnatal day (P) 0–15 (day of birth = P1) C57BL/6J mouse (either sex). The mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane and rapidly decapitated. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All stages of brain dissection and tissue slicing were conducted in ice-cold (~4 °C) artificial cerebral-spinal fluid (ACSF) of the following composition (in mM): 124 NaCl, 5.0 KCl, 1.3 MgSO4, 26 NaHCO3, 1.24 KH2PO4, 2.4 CaCl2 and 10 glucose; 300 mOsm and pH ~7.4 after equilibration with a 95%O2/5%CO2 gas mixture (carbogen). Thin hippocampal slices (200 μm) were cut with a vibratome VT1000S (Leica Biosystems, Inc). Slices were submerged in ACSF (22–25 °C) aerated with the carbogen gas mixture. Slices were stored at room temperature in carbogen bubbled ACSF until used.

2.2. Cloned GABAA receptors

Cells stably expressing human α1β2γ2 receptors were studied in the present investigation. Cells transiently expressing various human or rat GABAA subunit configurations were also studied. Human α1, β2 and γ2L (long isoform of the γ2 subunit) subunit cDNA in the vector pCDM8 were generously supplied by Dr. Nancy Leidenherimer (Louisiana State University, LA, USA). Rat GABAA receptor α1, β2 and γ2 were generously provided by Dr. Cynthia Czajkowski (Wisconsin University at Madison, WI) and subcloned into mammalian transfection vector pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were transfected using PolyJet™ DNA In Vitro transfection reagent (SignaGen Laboratories, Rockville, MD) to achieve transient expression of α1β2γ2, α1β2, α4β2δ or the corresponding mutants. Briefly, HEK cells were plated onto coverslips and transfected with wild-type or mutant subunits. Typically, GABAA receptor subunit cDNA in 1:1:3 ratio for α1, β2 and γ2 subunits or 1:1:5 for α4, β2 and δ was added to cells growing exponentially on one coverslip placed in a 35 mm culture dish. cDNA ratios for each subunit are based on previous studies (Boileau et al., 2003; Meera et al., 2009) and our own experience. Transfected cells were used for electrophysiological analysis 24–48 h after the transfection.

2.3. Site-Directed-Mutagenesis

Mutations of receptor subunit cDNA were performed using commercially available QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) with commercially produced mutagenic primers (Integrated DNA Technologies). All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing (Biotechnology Core Facility, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX).

2.4. Electrophysiology

All whole-cell patch recordings were made at room temperature (22–25°C) at a holding potential of −60 mV. Patch pipettes of borosilicate glass (M1B150F, World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) were pulled (Flaming/Brown, P-87/PC, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) to a tip resistance of 7–8 MΩ. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 140 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP; pH 7.2. For brain slice studies, a single slice was transferred to a recording chamber (~ 2 ml) and superfused continuously (5–7 ml/min) with external solution consisting of the following (in mM): 140 NaCl, 3.0 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2.4 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 330 mOsm and pH 7.3. Individual CA1 pyramidal neurons within the hippocampal slice were visualized using an upright, fixed stage microscope (Nikon Optiphot-2UD) equipped with standard Hoffman modulation contrast (HMC) optics and a video camera system (Sony model XC-75 CCD video camera module, DOT-X monitor). Miniature GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were isolated and recorded in the whole-cell configuration in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists (10 μM CNQX and 50 μM AP-5) and tetrodotoxin (TTX, 0.3 μM). For studies on cloned receptors, a coverslip containing cultured cells was placed in a small chamber (~ 1.5 ml) on the stage of an inverted light microscope (Olympus IMT-2) and superfused continuously (5–8 ml/min) with the following external solution containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 5.5 KCl, 0.8 MgCl2, 3.0 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 D-glucose, pH 7.3. The currents (GABAergic mIPSCs, GABA-activated Cl− currents) from the whole-cell configuration were obtained using a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200A, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) equipped with a CV201A headstage. Signals were filtered at 5 kHz, monitored on an oscilloscope and a chart recorder (Gould TA240), and sampled at 30 kHz using a Digidata 1200 and pClamp software (pClamp 6.0, Axon Instruments) and stored on a computer for offline analysis. The series resistance (Rs) was compensated online by 60–70% in voltage-clamp mode to reduce voltage errors. To monitor the possibility that access resistance changed over time or during different experimental conditions, at the initiation of each recording we measured and stored the current response to a 5 mV voltage pulse on our digital oscilloscope. This stored trace was continually referenced throughout the recording. The cells in which access resistance or baseline showed instability during recording period were not included in the analysis.

2.5. Experimental protocol

GABA was prepared in the extracellular solution, and was applied from independent reservoirs by gravity flow for 10 sec to cells using a Y-shaped tube positioned adjacent to the cell. With this system, the 10–90% rise time of the junction potential at the open tip averages approximately 30 ms (Huang and Dillon, 1999). Once a control response was determined, the effect of MB was examined by co-applying it with a roughly EC30 concentration of GABA. Because recovery from the drug-induced effect was readily obtained, effects of multiple concentrations of MB could generally be obtained from same cell. Current-voltage (I–V) relationship of GABA currents was assessed from a single cell using a ramp stimulus protocol. A transmembrane voltage ramped from −60 to +60 mV over 0.5 s time course was applied prior to (passive conductance phase) and during GABA application. The difference of these two current ramps (pA) represented the GABA-induced current, and was plotted as a function of applied holding potential (mV) to yield the I–V curve of GABA-induced currents.

2.6. Chemicals

MB was purchased from American Reagent, Inc (Shirley, NY) and directly diluted in saline to the final concentrations. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) was purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK) and prepared in ddH2O. 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX) and 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5) were provided from NIMH Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program, and prepared in ddH2O. Picrtoxin (PTX) was purchased from Sigma and prepared in DMSO. The stock solutions were diluted in saline so that the final DMSO concentration (v/v) was &lt; 0.1%.

2.7. Data analysis

The GABA-activated currents were analyzed with Clampfit 6.0 (Axon Instruments). The miniature synaptic events were detected and analyzed using MiniAnalysis 6.03 (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA). IPSC events were sampled for a 5-min continuous recording period for each neuron under control, MB and washout conditions. IPSC events were detected automatically using the threshold criteria of root mean square (RMS) noise and then inspected visually for any aberrant currents. GABA-dependent IPSCs were analyzed by the rise time (10–90%), peak amplitude and charge transfer (area under IPSC waveform) parameters of the MiniAnalysis. The time constants of current decay were calculated with biexponential function fitting of the averaged trace of grouped IPSC events.

GABA concentration-response profiles were fitted to the following equation: I/Imax= [GABA]n/(EC50n + [GABA]n), where I and Imax represent the normalized GABA-induced current at a given concentration and the maximal current induced by a saturating concentration of GABA, respectively, EC50 is 50% effective GABA concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient.

Concentration-response profiles for MB action were evaluated using approximately the EC30 GABA concentration. Concentration-response curves for MB inhibitory effect were fitted to the following equation: I/Imax=[MB]n/([MB]n+ IC50), where I is Cl− current amplitude at the end of drug application normalized to control at a given MB concentration, IC50 is the half-blocking concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient. A minimum of three individual experiments was conducted for each paradigm.

MB facilitated current decay rate under a number of conditions. The percentage of decay (%D) was calculated according to the formula %D=100×(Ipeak-I10s)/Ipeak, where Ipeak is the current at the peak of the ligand (GABA or GABA plus MB) response and I10s is the current remaining after 10 sec of continuous application. All data are presented as means ± SEM. Student’s t-test (paired or unpaired) or one-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak post hoc test was used to determine statistical significance (p&lt; 0.05).

3. Results

Table 1 illustrates concentration-response profiles for the GABAA receptor configurations assessed in the present studies. The EC30 agonist (GABA or muscimol) concentrations were calculated and used for each configuration in subsequent investigation of potential MB effects.

3.1. MB inhibition in human α1β2γ2 GABAA receptors

We first evaluated potential MB-induced effects on HEK293 cells stably expressing human α1β2γ2 GABAA receptors using whole-cell patch clamp technique. When co-applied with EC30 GABA (10 μM), MB (1–300 μM) inhibited GABA-activated currents in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The inhibitory effects of MB were rapid in onset and fully reversible within a one to three min washout period (Fig. 1A). MB exhibited its inhibitory action as low as 3 μM, reducing GABA initial peak currents to 92 ± 2.6 of control (p&lt;0.05, paired t-test, compared to control). MB inhibited initial peak as well as end-application currents (Fig. 1A). The IC50 values were 28 ±6.1 and 31 ± 5.8 μM for initial peak and end-application GABA-gated currents, respectively (n=6, p&gt;0.05, paired t-test). Moreover, percentage of decay (%D) was increased by MB at concentrations above 100 μM (%D: from 23 ± 3.3% at control to 48 ± 4.3 % at 100 μM MB; from 19 ± 2.6% at control to 69 ± 3.4% at 300 μM MB, n=6, p&lt;0.05, paired t-test, compared to control. As a result, 300 μM MB decreased GABA currents to 25 ± 3.9% and 9.7 ± 1.9% of control for initial peak and end-application current, respectively (p&lt;0.05, paired t-test). As enhanced current decay reflects inhibitory action via desensitization or channel block and better represents MB-inhibitory action, we quantified MB inhibition using end-application currents (Table 1). Next, we examined the effect of pre-applied 10 μM MB for 2 min on the subsequent response to 10 μM MB co-applied with 10 μM GABA in human α1β2γ2 receptors. As shown in Fig. 2, pre-equilibration of MB did not alter the ability of MB to block GABA response. On average, MB inhibited GABA-activated currents to 78 ± 2.7% via co-application and 78 ± 2.1% with pre-treatment (n=5).

To further distinguish whether MB primarily acts on GABA molecules or GABAA receptors, we examined the MB effect on the currents gated by another GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol, which is structurally different from GABA but acts at the GABA binding site (Amin and Weiss, 1993). As shown in Fig. 3, MB (1–1000 μM) resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition on the currents activated by EC30 muscimol (2.5 μM) in human α1β2γ2 receptors. The IC50 for MB inhibition was 29 ± 2.8 μM and Hill coefficient was 1.3 ± 0.1 (n=5). Similar MB effect on currents activated by two agonists with different structure favors MB action on the receptors.

3.2. Dependence of inhibition by MB on the GABA concentration

MB may modulate GABA-activated currents by affecting the affinity of receptors for GABA and/or the efficacy of GABA at the receptors. To distinguish between these possibilities, the effect of MB on concentration-response curves was studied in human α1β2γ2 receptors stably expressed in HEK cells. As shown in Fig. 2, MB (30 μM) had greater inhibitory effect on the currents activated by low [GABA] but had little effect on the response to saturating [GABA] in α1β2γ2 receptors. As a result, the EC50 for GABA shifted from 34 ± 4.9 μM in control to 49 ± 5.2 μM in the presence of 30 μM MB (n=8, p&lt;0.05, paired t-test), whereas the maximum current and Hill coefficient were not significantly altered (Fig. 4A). To further examine dependence of MB inhibition on [GABA], we examined MB inhibitory curves at different [GABA]. As shown in Fig. 4B and Table 2, the blocking effect of MB depends on the concentration of GABA used. IC50 values were 19 ± 2.2 μM (with 5 μM GABA), 31 μM ± 1.8 (10 μM GABA) and 218 ± 28 μM (30 μM GABA) (p&lt;0.05, one-way ANOVA test). These data suggest that MB blocks GABA currents in a competitive manner.

3.3. Effect of MB on the GABA current-voltage relationships

Because a voltage-dependent effect of a drug may shed some light on possible sites of action, we assessed the extent to which the effect of MB on GABAA receptors may be influenced by membrane voltage. We tested MB’s ability to modulate the current-voltage (I–V) relationship of GABA-induced currents recorded from human α1β2γ2 receptors. In the absence of MB, the I–V relationship displayed outward rectification (Fig. 5A), consistent with our previous report (Huang and Dillon, 1999). In the presence of 30 μM MB, the reversal potential of GABA-activated current was not altered (Fig 5A). However, the MB-induced inhibition of the GABA response displayed a modest but significant voltage–dependent effect (Fig. 5A). The average inhibitory effect of 30 μM MB was 58 ± 3.2% at −60 mV and 45 ± 4.5% at +60 mV (n=13, p&lt;0.05, paired t-test) (Fig. 5B).

3.4. Subunit-dependent activity of MB at GABAA receptors

GABAA subunit composition determines pharmacological properties (Huang et al., 2006). For example, the γ2 subunit is required for sensitivity to the benzodiazepine (BDZ) family of compounds (Sigel and Buhr, 1997). δ-subunit containing GABAA receptors are insensitive to BDZ but are a preferred receptor subtype for gaboxadol (THIP) and neurosteroids at low (nanomolar) concentrations (Stell et al., 2003; Krogsgaard-Larsen et al., 2004). Thus we investigated whether MB preferentially interacts with specific subunit configurations of GABAA receptors. HEK293 cells were stably expressing rat α3β2γ2 rat α6β2γ2 or transiently transfected with rat α1β2, human α5β2γ2 and rat α4β2δ receptors. Currents activated using equipotent [GABA] (EC30 of corresponding GABAA receptors, Table 1) were recorded with co-application of varying [MB] (1–300 μM). As shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2, MB inhibited GABA-gated currents of all GABAA receptor configurations tested in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, α5β2γ2 receptors had higher sensitivity to MB while α6β2γ2 had relatively less sensitivity to MB compared to human α1β2γ2 receptors (Table 2). Whereas maximal efficacy was not established in all cases due to insolubility issue of MB at concentrations ≥1 mM, in most cases residual currents at end-application of 300 μM MB were 10–30 % of control.

3.5. Effect of β2(T6’F) mutation on MB inhibition

MB had inhibitory effects on all receptor subunit configurations examined, suggesting a conserved site for this action. A pore-lining threonine residue (T’6) within the second transmembrane domain (TM2), which is highly conserved among all GABAA subunits, confers sensitivity of GABAA receptors to picrotoxin (PTX) (Gurley et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 1995), pentylenetetrazole (Dibas and Dillon, 2000), ethanol (Johnson et al., 2012) and 4′-ethynyl-4-n-propylbicycloorthobenzoate (EBOB) (Hisano et al., 2007). Thus, we examined whether this residue is also involved in MB’s inhibitory effect. The effect of MB on GABA currents activated by an EC30 GABA was assessed in wild type α1β2γ2 and α1β2(T6’F)γ2 receptors transiently transfected in HEK293 cells. The ability of a β2 T6’F mutation to block sensitivity to PTX (Gurley et al., 1995) was confirmed here (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2, mutation of β2 T6’F had little influence on MB-mediated inhibition of GABA-activated currents. On average, IC50 values were 34 ±2.5 and 35 ± 6.0 μM for wild type and mutant receptors, respectively. The inhibitions of GABA response caused by 300 μM MB were 70 ± 5.9 and 77 ± 6.8 % for wild type and α1β2(T6’F) γ2, respectively (p&gt;0.05, unpaired t-test). These data suggest that MB-induced inhibition of GABAA receptors is not mediated via T6’ at the TM2 region.

3.6. Effect of mutations of GABA binding residues on MB inhibition

The above results indicate MB inhibits GABA-activated currents in a competitive manner. This led to the possibility that MB may interact at the GABA binding site. Based on previous investigations (Amin and Weiss, 1993; Boileau et al., 1999; Holden and Czajkowski, 2002; Huang et al., 2004), we mutated two key residues within the GABA binding pocket in the N-terminal domains of human GABAA receptors: F64A in the α1 subunit and Y205F in the β2 subunit. The mutant α1 or β2 subunits were co-expressed with wild type β2 and γ2 or α1 and γ2 subunits, respectively. The ternary receptors containing mutant α1 or β2 subunits greatly shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the left, resulting in approximately 47–4,280 folds increase in GABA EC50 compared to wild type α1β2γ2 receptors (Table 1) (Huang et al., 2004). The effect of MB on GABA-activated currents was assessed using EC30 GABA. Single mutation of Y205F at β2 subunits significantly attenuated both potency and efficacy of MB inhibitory effect, resulting in a 3-fold increase in IC50 (from 31 ±1.8 μM in wild type to 93 ± 8.6 μM in mutant) and 27% reduction of MB efficacy measured with 300 μM MB (from 90 ± 1.9% in wild type to 66 ± 5.1% in mutant receptors, p&lt;0.05, unpaired t-test) (Table 2, Fig. 8). The α1 F64A mutation dramatically diminished MB sensitivity in α1β2γ2 configuration. The efficacy for MB inhibition was reduced by 83% [15 ± 5.3% in α1(F64A)β2γ2] compared to wild type. Double point mutations of α1(F64A)β2(Y205F)γ2 essentially abolished MB effect (Fig. 8).

3.7. MB inhibition of hippocampal GABAA receptors

To ensure that blockade of GABAA receptors was not unique to recombinant receptors, we assessed its effect on GABA currents recorded from pyramidal neurons in the mouse hippocampal CA1 area. CA1 pyramidal neurons express synaptic GABAA receptors consisting of α1-3, β1-3 and γ1-3 subunits, and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors containing either α4/α5 or δ subunits (Brunig et al., 2002; Stell et al., 2003; Caraiscos et al., 2004). As shown in Fig. 9, MB also reversibly and dose-dependently blocked the whole-cell currents activated by 10 μM GABA. The ability of MB to block native GABAA receptors was comparable to that observed in the recombinant receptors. To further investigate whether MB modulated GABAergic neurotransmission, we assessed the effect of MB on miniature GABAergic IPSCs (mIPSCs) recorded with whole-cell configuration from mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons. GABAergic mIPSCs were isolated by blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors (50 μM AP-5 and 10 μM CNQX) and Na+ channels (0.3 μM TTX), at a holding potential of −60 mV. Once the baseline was stable, mIPSCs were collected over a 5-min period before, during and after the perfusion of 10 μM MB. As shown in Fig. 10, in all recorded cells (n=7), MB decreased amplitude, frequency and charge transfer of mIPSCs. The mean amplitude of mIPSCs was reduced from 39 ± 3.3 pA in control to 33 ± 2.5 pA in the presence of MB (p&lt;0.01, paired t-test). The 10–90% rise time was increased by MB while decaying phase of mIPSCs was not altered. Moreover, MB modulatory effect on GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic currents was reversible (Fig. 10).

4. Discussion

To our knowledge, we demonstrate here for the first time that MB inhibits GABAA receptors at clinically relevant concentrations (Peter et al., 2000). Our data show that MB reversibly and dose-dependently blocks GABA-activated currents from recombinant GABAA receptors and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Theoretically, MB may modulate GABA-activated currents by reducing effective [GABA] as a result of MB chemically reacting with the GABA molecule, acting on GABAA receptors and/or influencing receptor phosphorylation via intracellular pathways. Several lines of evidence presented here suggest that MB directly acts on the receptors. First, enhanced current decay at high [MB] is inconsistent with reduced effective [GABA] due to direct reaction of MB with the GABA molecule. Similar inhibition of MB on the currents activated by GABA and the structurally distinct GABA agonist muscimol also supports MB action on the receptors instead of the ligands. Second, MB action is rapid in onset and washout, which is incompatible with an effect mediated via changes in intracellular signaling. Finally, results from mutagenesis studies provide direct evidence to support MB interaction with GABAA receptors.

We attempted to map the action site for MB inhibition with investigation of different GABA subunit compositions and site-directed mutagenesis. MB blockade of the GABA response was demonstrated in all subunit configurations we tested here. Preservation of MB inhibition in BZD-insensitive receptors (α1β2 and α6β2γ2) excludes the BZD site for MB action. GABAA receptors containing δ-subunits are generally thought to be more sensitive to THIP, neurosteroids and Zn2+ than those containing γ subunits (Korpi et al., 2002; Stell et al., 2003; Krogsgaard-Larsen et al., 2004). We found that the sensitivity of δ-containing receptors to MB is similar to that of other subunit configurations, suggesting that MB action is unlikely mediated via THIP, neurosteroids or Zn2+ sites. The fact that mutation of T6’F in the β2 subunit has little influence on MB’s inhibitory effect eliminates likelihood of MB action via the site associated with the channel blocker picrotoxin. Competitive antagonism of MB with GABA supports the notion that MB may interact with the GABA binding site. Based on 4 Å resolution of acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) (Miyazawa et al., 2003; Unwin, 2005) and 3 Å resolution of GABAA receptor β3 crystal structures (Miller and Aricescu, 2014), the ligand binding site is formed by loops (designated loops A–F) at the inter-subunit interfaces (Corringer et al. 2000). We have identified two residues (β2 Y205 of loop C and α1 F64 of loop D) of the GABA binding pocket that confer MB sensitivity. Previous studies have shown that the Y205 residue of the β2 subunit is complementarily facing F64 of the α1 subunit within the binding pocket (Newell and Czajkowski, 2003; Miller and Aricescu, 2014). Mutation of β2 Y205F and/or α1 F64A caused remarkable shifts in both GABA and MB sensitivity. Furthermore, the reduction of MB sensitivity appears to be in parallel with the shifts of GABA EC50 in the following sequence: α1(F64A)β2(Y205F)γ2&gt;α1(F64A)β2γ2&gt;α1β2(Y205F)γ2. It has been reported that the ability of ligands to bind to GABAA receptors is inhibited by protons (Huang et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005). Notably, the pKa of MB is about 0 to −1; hence effectively 100% of MB is in the protonated form at physiological pH (DiSanto and Wagner, 1972). However, whether MB directly or allosterically interacts with GABA in the agonist binding site requires further investigations using radioligand binding and computer modeling. Voltage-dependence would not be expected for a ligand interacting at the GABA binding site. However, this effect was nominal, and in fact might relate as much to relative channel open probability than voltage per se (O’Toole and Jenkins, 2012). Outward rectification is relatively enhanced at lower level of open probability in the presence of MB. As a result, MB-induced inhibition at positive potentials is less than at negative potentials.

MB at a dose of 1–4.0 mg/kg is safe in humans (Peter et al., 2000; Walter-Sack et al., 2009). Pharmacokinetic studies show that the half-life of MB in human body is approximately 10 hours and bioavailability is ~73%. Depending on the route of administration (i.e., oral vs i.v.), the peak concentration of MB in blood ranges from 2.2–19 μM with typical dosage (1–2 mg/kg) commonly used in clinical treatments as well as clinical trials as memory-enhancing intervention (Peter et al., 2000; Walter-Sack et al., 2009). MB can accumulate rapidly in the brain and its concentration is 10–20 times higher in the brain than in the blood one hour following systemic administration, reaching brain concentration up to hundreds of μM (Peter et al., 2000). In the present studies, we show MB started to inhibit GABAA receptors at concentrations as low as 3 μM. MB was able to inhibit γ2-containing synpatic receptors as well as extrasynaptic receptors with IC50 values from 19 to 49 μM and inhibitory efficacy from 74–96%. In hippocampal slices, MB was also shown to inhibit GABA-evoked currents and GABAergic mIPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The decreased frequency of mIPSCs in the presence of MB is in a good agreement with inhibition of presynaptic α7 nicotinic ACh receptors by MB (Al Mansouri et al., 2012). Since MB competitively inhibits GABAA receptor function, reduction of mIPSC amplitude by MB seems contradictory to the view that synaptic GABA levels were thought to be saturating. However, The studies from the last two decades indicate that the actual concentration of neurotransmitter at postsynaptic receptors is not invariably saturating, being influenced by cleft surface area, number of neurotransmitter vesicles released, cleft configuration and time (Mody and Pearce, 2004; Barberis et al., 2011). A substantial number of postsynaptic receptors are exposed to subsaturating [GABA] (Hill et al., 1998). Inhibition of mIPSC amplitude in the hippocampal neurons by MB could be at least partially attributed to dynamic fluctuation of [GABA] at postsynaptic receptors and/or reduced GABA release from presynaptic neurons caused by MB inhibition on nACh α7 receptors (Al Mansouri et al., 2012). Modulation of GABAergic mIPSC amplitude has also been reported with zolpidem (Defazio and Hablitz, 1998; Chen et al., 2007) and protons (Mozrzymas et al., 2003; Chen and Huang, 2014). Collectively, our data suggest that MB inhibits GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmssion at clinically relevant concentrations.

The memory-enhancing effects of low-dose methylene blue were first shown in rodents 30 years ago, and have been demonstrated in short-term or long-term memory tasks in rodents and humans (Callaway et al., 2004; Gonzalez-Lima and Bruchey, 2004; Rojas et al., 2012; Rodriguez et al., 2016a; Rodriguez et al., 2016b). MB has recently been investigated as a memory-enhancing drug to treat neurodegenerative diseases associated with impaired mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in animal models and clinical trials (Lin et al., 2012; Poteet et al., 2012; Rojas et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2016). The beneficial memory effects of MB are traditionally linked to its remarkable antioxidant, metabolic-enhancing properties in mitochondria and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (Oz et al., 2011; Rojas et al., 2012). The results presented here reveal GABAA receptors as a novel target for MB’s neurological effects. The GABAA receptor mediates most central nervous system inhibition and plays a critical role for synaptic plasticity and learning behaviors. The involvement of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons during long-term potentiation (LTP) induction is well documented (Kullmann and Lamsa, 2011). Decreased GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition in the hippocampus generally results in an enhanced performance in learning and memory. For example, blockade of GABA blockers dramatically facilitated the induction of LTP (Wigstrom and Gustafsson, 1983; Wigstrom and Gustafsson, 1985). The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil or partial inverse agonists facilitated place learning in the Morris water-maze (Lal and Forster, 1990; Brioni et al., 1991; McNamara and Skelton, 1993). In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that elevated GABA inhibitory tone in the hippocampus impairs cognitive function in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease and in AD patients (Jo et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014). Our results combined with these prior findings implicate GABAA receptors in the memory-enhancing effects of MB. The therapeutic window for this effect may be relatively narrow, however. Although MB is safe when used at therapeutic doses (≤2 mg/kg), higher doses can cause adverse CNS effects such as anxiety, confusion and dizziness, and a single bolus injection of 5 mg/kg MB in adult rats can cause neuronal death (Vutskits et al., 2008). The adverse CNS effects noted above as well as the neurotoxic effects could be explained by extension of MB’s therapeutically beneficial, memory-enhancing effects on GABAergic neurotransmission.

In summary, we demonstrated that MB directly blocks GABAA receptors as well as GABAergic neurotransmission at clinically relevant concentrations, which may contribute to the neurological effects of MB. Furthermore, our data suggest that MB inhibits GABAA receptor function by direct or allosteric interaction with GABA binding sites.
