Background:

Thickness of the cerebral cortex decreases with aging. Recent research suggests that obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus may accelerate this cortical thinning, and that obesity-related insulin resistance may be a shared mechanistic pathway. Aging of the cerebral cortex demonstrates sex-specific trajectories, with a gradual shift towards accelerated thinning beginning in midlife. Here we investigated if adiposity-related insulin resistance is associated with lower thickness of the human cerebral cortex in a community-based sample of middle-aged adults.

Methods:

We studied 533 adult participants (36–65 years) from the Saguenay Youth Study. Adiposity was assessed with bioimpedance and insulin resistance was evaluated from a fasting blood sample with the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance HOMA-IR. Associations between adiposity-related insulin resistance (adiposity/IR) and cortical thickness were assessed with linear models, separately in males and females younger or older than 50 years. Potential biological underpinnings were investigated with virtual histology.

Results:

Adiposity/IR is associated with lower cortical thickness in females older than 50 years but not in males or younger females. The strength of the association varies across the cerebral cortex, with regions of the lateral frontal and parietal cortices and the superior temporal cortex demonstrating most pronounced thinning. Based on virtual histology, adiposity/IR-related cortical thinning may involve neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells acting so that they lower the cortical potential for synaptogenesis, formation of dendritic spines, production of extracellular matrix and myelination.

Conclusion:

Adiposity-related insulin resistance is associated with lower cortical thickness in middle-aged women older than 50 years. This aspect of thinning may involve neuronal and glial cells in a way that lowers the capacity of the cerebral cortex for neuronal plasticity and maintenance of myelination.


Introduction

Obesity is a major health problem across most high- and medium-income countries, as it affects large segments of the population (&gt;60% of adults) and carries a significant risk for multiple diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Both obesity and T2DM are risk factors for cognitive impairment and dementia – they may act through a shared biological pathway, namely obesity-induced insulin resistance (IR) 1.

Adipose tissue (of an obese individual) releases bioactive molecules that promote IR in multiple tissues of the body. Insulin resistance is defined by lower responsiveness of tissues to insulin, which is an anabolic hormone (produced mainly in pancreas) that promotes nutrient uptake (glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids), energy storage, and cellular growth. Insulin resistance is initially compensated by a higher production of insulin, leading to hyperinsulinemia1. This compensatory process eventually fails, leading to the development of hyperglycemia, which is the diagnostic feature of T2DM1.

Recent research suggests that IR exists not only in peripheral tissues but also in the brain2. Most insulin in the brain originates from the circulating pancreatic insulin. Insulin enters the brain primarily via selective, saturable transport across the capillary endothelial cells of the blood–brain barrier3–5. Levels of insulin in the circulation correlate with the levels of insulin in cerebrospinal fluid6. Insulin acts through binding to the insulin receptor, which is expressed on all cell types in the brain2. Particularly high levels of the insulin receptor are seen in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebral cortex7,8. Experimental work suggests that insulin impacts synaptic plasticity9 and, in neuronal cultures, insulin promotes neurogenesis and inhibits apoptosis (reviewed in2). Through these effects, IR may impact thickness of the cerebral cortex.

Thickness of the cerebral cortex decreases with aging10,11. Accelerated cortical thinning is a characteristic feature of cognitive impairment and dementia and may start years before clinical diagnosis12. Further, the current understanding is that both obesity and T2DM accelerate brain aging, and that aging of the cerebral cortex demonstrates sex-specific trajectories, with a gradual shift beginning in midlife (around fifties)10,13–16.

The aim of the present study was to investigate association between adiposity-related insulin resistance and thickness of the human cerebral cortex in a community-based sample of middle-aged adults. We performed this analysis separately in males and females who were either younger or older than 50 years10,13. Further, we explored potential biological underpinnings of these associations with virtual histology17–19.

Methods

Participants

Here we studied adult participants from the Saguenay Youth Study (SYS), which is a community-based study conducted in the Saguenay-Lac-St.-Jean region of Quebec, Canada20. The study is aimed at investigating the etiology and early stages of common cardiometabolic and brain diseases in 1,028 adolescents and 962 parents. In the present work, we studied data from 533 SYS adults (age 36–65 years) in whom brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fasting glucose and insulin data were available, and who were not treated with insulin. These included 244 males of whom 150 were older than 50 years, and 289 females of whom 95 were older than 50 years. Written consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by local research ethics committees.

Measurements

Thickness of cerebral cortex:

T1-weighted (T1W) magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain were acquired with a 1.5 Tesla Siemens (Avanto) scanner using the 3D Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo sequence with 176 sagittal slices (1-mm isotropic resolution, TR = 2,400ms, TE = 2.65ms, TI = 1000ms, and flip angle = 8°). Using the acquired T1W brain images, the thickness of the cerebral cortex was derived with FreeSurfer (v 5.3.) in each of the 34 regions (per hemisphere) segmented using the Desikan-Killiany atlas. In the present study, we studied mean cortical thickness (across the entire cortical mantle) as a primary outcome, and regional cortical thickness (averaged across the two hemispheres) as secondary outcomes.

Body adiposity:

Total body fat (TBF) was measured with multifrequency bioelectrical impedance (Xitron Technologies, San Diego, CA). All participants were asked to refrain from caffeine, alcohol, and vigorous activity 24 hours before the measurement. The measurement was made after a 20-minute stabilization period, during which the participants were resting in a supine position. Body weight and height were measured, and body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.

Systemic IR:

Systemic IR was assessed with the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) method as: HOMA-IR= fasting glucose (mmol/L) X fasting insulin (mU/L)/22.521. For this measurement, blood samples were drawn between 8:00 am and 10:00 am after an overnight fast (&gt;10 hours).

Statistical analyses

Prior to any statistical analyses, all variables were examined for normality of distribution and log-transformed if required.

Derivation of adiposity/IR factor:

We used principle component analysis (PCA) to extract shared variance between adiposity (TBF) and systemic IR (HOMA-IR). Prior to PCA, TBF was adjusted for height.

Associations between cortical thickness and adiposity/IR factor:

We used linear regression to test whether mean cortical thickness is associated with adiposity-related IR (the 1st principal component, PC1), while adjusting for age. We performed this analysis separately in 4 groups: younger (age&lt;50 years) and older (age &gt;=50 years) males, and younger (age&lt;50 years) and older (age &gt;=50 years) females, and we corrected statistical significance for 4 comparisons, with significant p-value being &lt;0.05/4=0.0125.

All further analyses were performed in a subset of older females who were the only group to show significant association between mean cortical thickness and adiposity-related IR, after correction for multiple comparisons. These included examining associations between thickness at each of the 34 cortical regions delineated with FreeSurfer and adiposity-related IR. As cortical thickness is correlated (i.e., not independent) across the 34 regions, we corrected the statistical significance of these 34 tests using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons.

Virtual histology and functional element enrichment analyses:

‘Virtual histology’ is a method to study relative contributions of 9 cell types (CA1 and S1 pyramidal neurons, interneuron, astrocyte, microglia, oligodendrocyte, as well as ependymal, endothelial and mural cells) to observed variations in interregional profiles of cortical thickness17–19,22. To perform virtual histology analyses, we tested whether, across the 34 cortical regions, inter-regional profiles of correlation coefficients of cortical thickness vs. adiposity-related IR (i.e., ‘PC1-related cortical thinning’) are associated with interregional profiles of ‘expression of cell type-specific genes’. The ‘expression of cell type-specific genes’ at each of the 34 cortical regions was derived as follows: gene-expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (6 donors, 24 to 57 years of age) were first mapped to the 34 regions of the Desikan-Killiany atlas22,23. To establish representativeness of gene expression profiles across donors, and across lifespan, gene-expression profiles were filtered based on donor-to-median correlation and with an external dataset of inter-regional gene expression (BrainSpan). The final set of 2,511 genes was studied here. Next, single-cell RNA sequencing data from the mouse hippocampus and S1 cerebral cortex were used to categorize the 2,511 genes specific to the 9 cell types (CA1 and S1 pyramidal neurons, interneuron, astrocyte, microglia, oligodendrocyte, as well as ependymal, endothelial and mural cells)23. Finally, the 2 types of inter-regional profiles were correlated across the 34 regions to obtain the sample distribution of correlation coefficients for each of the cell types. This distribution was then tested for significance against a null distribution generated by re-shuffling the ‘cell-type’ membership (100,000 times)17. For cell types significantly associated with ‘PC1-related cortical thinning’, we tested genes with Pearson correlation coefficient (r) greater than expected by chance for enrichment of biological processes or pathways using STRING database v11.0 (https://string-db.org/).

Results

Characteristics of studied participants

Basic characteristics of the studied participants are provided in Table 1. Males and females were of a similar age; reflecting our ‘young/old’ design, younger vs. older individual were younger by ~8 years in both sexes. Despite similar body mass index (BMI) across all 4 groups, females vs. males showed higher body adiposity (TBF), with younger vs. older males not differing in TBF and younger vs. older females showing marginally lower TBF (p=0.07). Males vs. females were more insulin resistant, and, in both sexes, younger vs. older individuals were less insulin resistant. Finally, males vs. females showed lower mean cortical thickness, with no differences being seen between younger and older individuals of either sex.

Adiposity-related insulin resistance

In both sexes and age groups, adiposity (TBF) correlated similarly with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, r=0.53–0.62, Figure S1). To extract shared variance between TBF and HOMA-IR, we used PCA. We performed this PCA separately in each of the 4 sex and age groups. In all 4 groups, the first principle component, PC1, explained a similarly high proportion of variance (77–82%, Table S1) and was loaded similarly by both TBF (loading of 0.88–0.90, Table S1) and HOMA-IR (loading of 0.88–0.90, Table S1). We used this PC1 as a measure of adiposity-related IR – ‘adiposity/IR’ – in further analyses.

Adiposity-related insulin resistance is associated with lower cortical thickness in older females

As shown in Table 2, adiposity/IR was associated with mean cortical thickness in older females only, in whom higher adiposity/IR was associated with lower mean cortical thickness (beta=−0.28 [0.10], p=0.007, corrected p=0.035; Table 2). This association was independent of age, as age was included in the model. Adiposity/IR explained 7% of variance in mean cortical thickness. This association did not substantially change after additional adjusting for hypertension or lipid disease (Table 2).

Further, in older females, we observed that the association between adiposity/IR and cortical thickness varies across 34 cortical regions delineated with FreeSurfer. Multiple regions in frontal and parietal lobes and the superior temporal cortex showed nominally significant (n=14) and FDR-significant (n=8) associations, with all of them being negative, i.e., higher adiposity/IR was associated with lower cortical thickness (Figure 1). The most significant region was Pars Opercularis in the frontal cortex (beta=−0.33 [0.10], FDR-p=0.035). Adiposity/IR explained 11% of variance in cortical thickness of this region. Finally, associations of TBF or HOMA-IR with cortical thickness across the 34 cortical regions were similar but less pronounced than those of adiposity/IR (Figure S2).

Adiposity/IR-related cortical thinning involves neuronal and glial cells

Next, we used a virtual-histology approach17 to identify cell types contributing to adiposity/IRrelated cortical thinning in older females. We found that regions with greater thinning showed more frequently lower expression of genes specific to CA1 pyramidal neurons (p=1.8×10−4), astrocytes (p=1.9×10−3) and ependymal cells (p=1.9×10−3), and higher expression of genes specific to S1 pyramidal neurons (p=1.7×10−3) and oligodendrocytes (p=6.4×10−3, Figure 2).

Examining further the cell types with more genes demonstrating lower expression in regions with greater thinning, enrichment analysis showed that: (a) genes of CA1 pyramidal neurons were frequently involved in ‘neurogenesis’ and ‘positive regulation of neuron projection development’ (Table S2), with the most strongly associated gene being FAT4, which encodes a protocadherin critical for cortico-genesis and neuron differentiation24 (r=−0.70, Figure 3); (b) genes of astrocytes were enriched in processes of ‘glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis’ and ‘amino acid transmembrane transport’ (Table S2), with the most strongly associated gene being CSPG5 (r=−0.75, Figure 3), which encodes chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan promoting neuritogenesis25; and (c) genes of ependymal cells were enriched in processes such as ‘cell projection organization’ (Table S2), with the most strongly associated gene being RFX3 (r=−0.68, Figure 3), which encodes a transcription factor regulating the development of corticothalamic connections26.

Examining further the cell types with more genes demonstrating higher expression in regions with greater thinning, enrichment analysis showed that: (a) genes of S1 pyramidal neurons were more frequently involved in processes regulating ‘membrane potential’, ‘potassium ion transmembrane transport’ and ‘multicellular organismal process’ (Table S2), with the most strongly associated gene being TPBG (r=+0.79, Figure 3), which encodes an inhibitor of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling involved in activity-dependent neuritogenesis27–29; and (b) genes of oligodendrocytes were enriched in terms ‘potassium ion transporter activity’ and ‘paranode and juxtaparanode regions of axon’(Table S2), with the most strongly associated gene being PLEKHA1 (r=+0.70, Figure 3), which encodes a signal-transduction adaptor protein inhibiting oligodendrocyte differentiation30.

Discussion

The present study of a community sample of middle-aged adults (36–65 years) shows that adiposity/IR is associated with lower cortical thickness in females older than 50 years but not in males or younger females. The study also shows that the strength of the association in older females varies across the cerebral cortex, with regions of the lateral frontal and parietal cortices and the superior temporal cortex demonstrating most pronounced thinning in relation to adiposity/IR. Finally, the study suggests that this aspect of thinning involves neuronal and glial cells in a way that lowers the capacity of the cerebral cortex for neuronal plasticity and maintenance of myelination.

Here we observed that adiposity-related insulin resistance is associated with lower cortical thickness in regions of the lateral frontal and parietal cortices and the superior temporal cortex. Interestingly, similar areas of the cerebral cortex demonstrated lower glucose metabolism in association with HOMA-IR in pre- and early diabetic patients and in individuals at risk for Alzheimer’s disease31,32. Further, the frontal and parietal cortices showed lower cortical thickness in association with T2DM in a community-based sample of non-demented elderly (mean age of 68 years)11 and Alzheimer Disease case-control sample of elderly (mean age of ~75 years)33.

In the present study, we observed that adiposity/IR was associated with lower cortical thickness in older females but not in younger females. Most females undergo menopause in around the age of 50 years, which is characterized by a relatively sudden decrease of female sex hormones, including estradiol. Estradiol is considered neuroprotective34, and its decrease in the brain may make the brain more vulnerable to adverse environmental factors, such as the internal environment created by T2DM (e.g., insulin resistance and hyperglycemia). To assess the specific effects of menopause vs. aging requires further research.

In the present study, adiposity/IR was associated with lower cortical thickness in older females but not older (or younger) males. This was observed despite the fact that males vs. females were more insulin resistant (in both age groups) and showed lower cortical thickness (also in both age groups). Our observation, however, is supported by previous experimental research reporting that female vs. male brains undergo age-related changes earlier, and that these changes involve – particularly in females – decreases in bioenergetics metabolism35. Our observation is also supported by recent human studies, demonstrating that cortical thickness may be more vulnerable to cardiometabolic risk factors in older females than males14, and that a ‘loss’ females sex hormones (and estradiol in particular) may contribute to this effect16.

Cortical thickness is determined by cyto- and myelo-architectural features, such as the size and number of neurons and their dendritic branches and the myelination of axons; it is also determined by the size and number of glial cells36 and volume of extracellular space37,38. In the present study, we observed that cortical regions with greater adiposity/IR-related thinning showed more frequently lower expression of genes specific to CA1 pyramidal neurons, astrocytes and ependymal cells, and higher expression of genes specific to S1 pyramidal neurons and oligodendrocytes. These results suggest pyramidal neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells are involved in adiposity/IR-related cortical thinning.

Our finding that, in the regions with greater adiposity/IR thinning, the ‘low’-expressed genes specific to CA1 pyramidal neurons and ependymal cells are enriched in genes of ‘neurogenesis’ and ‘neuron-projection development and organization’ suggests that these cell types may contribute to adiposity/IR-related thinning through having these processes lowered, leading to lesser potential for, e.g., activity-driven augmentations in dendritic spine density39,40. Dendritic spines are specialized protrusions on neuronal dendrites that are the sites of excitatory synaptic input and that can increase neuronal surface area and size41.

Further, we found that, in the regions with greater adiposity/IR thinning, the ‘low’-expressed genes specific to astrocytes were enriched in genes of ‘glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis’. Glycosaminoglycans are proteoglycans that form a meshwork-like part of extracellular matrix, i.e., perineuronal nets that are critical for astrocyte-neuron interactions and neuronal synaptogenesis28,37,38. These results suggest that astrocytes may contribute to adiposity/IR-related cortical thinning through lowering the production of the matrix, which may decrease its volume and neuronal synaptogenesis (and thus dendritic spine density).

Finally, we observed that, in the regions with greater adiposity/IR thinning, the ‘high’-expressed genes specific to S1 pyramidal cells and oligodendrocytes were enriched in genes regulating ‘membrane potential’, ‘potassium ion transmembrane transport’, ‘multicellular organismal process’ and ‘paranode and juxtaparanode regions of axon’, and that some of these genes were inhibitors of neuritogenesis and myelination27–30. Oligodendrocytes form myelin ensheathment around neuronal axons42. Myelin ends attach to axons in paranode and juxta-paranode regions, which include voltage-gated potassium channels critical for regulating membrane potential, and thus signal transduction along the axons42 as well as neuron excitability (when at the axon initial segment43). Whether adiposity/IR inhibits oligodendrocyte production of myelin, thus diminishing the ensheathment of axon and impacting membrane potential and axon integrity requires further study; it may though contribute to lower cortical thickness.

As mentioned above, the association between adiposity/IR and lower cortical thickness was observed in older females only, which may in part be related to menopausal decrease in estradiol34. Consistent with this possibility, several of the above molecular pathways implicated in adiposity/IR-related cortical thinning are regulated by estradiol. For example, estradiol promotes synaptogenesis44 and enhances dendritic spine density45. The lack of estradiol ‘neuroprotective’ effects may make the brains of peri- and early post-menopausal females more vulnerable to adiposity/IR effects, as uncovered by our virtual histology and enrichment analysis.

Our study is the first to investigate associations between adiposity-related insulin resistance and cortical thickness in a community-based sample of middle-aged adults. Insulin resistance requires the collection of fasting blood samples, which is rarely done in brain imaging studies46. Our study is also the first to explore potential biology behind insulin resistance-related cortical thinning. Our study, however, is limited in that it is a cross-sectional study, and, as such, it cannot imply causality between peripheral insulin resistance and associated cortical thinning. Also, our study is modestly sized and requires replication in larger cohorts. Finally, it is well established that obesity clusters together not only with diabetes, but also with hypertension and lipid disease in the same individuals, and thus further larger studies are needed to disentangle effects of these correlated conditions. Nevertheless, additional adjusting for hypertension or lipid disease, did not change the results of the present study.

In conclusion, adiposity-related insulin resistance is associated with lower cortical thickness in middle-aged women older than 50 years. This thinning may involve neuronal and glial cells in a way that lowers the capacity of the cerebral cortex for synaptogenesis, dendritic spine formation, extracellular matrix production and myelination. These results provide yet another impetus for prevention of obesity, the prevalence of which increases substantially after menopause in females.
