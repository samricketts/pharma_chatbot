White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) have been linked to cognitive dysfunction and dementia, although the reasons are unclear. One possibility is that WMHs promote neurodegeneration, which, in turn, affects cognition. We examined whether cortical thickness, a marker of neurodegeneration, mediates the relationship between WMHs and cognition among 519 older adults. Using conditional process analysis modeling techniques, we examined the association between WMH volume and global cognition and tested whether cortical thickness mediates this relationship statistically. We also tested specific regional hypotheses to determine whether cortical thickness or volume in the medial temporal lobe mediates the relationship between WMH volume and memory. Increased total WMH volume was associated with poorer global cognition and memory. The mediating effects were present across all cognitive domains. Global cortical thickness and medial temporal lobe thickness/volume mediated the relationship of WMH volume on global cognition and memory functioning. The mediating relationship was similar across racial and ethnic groups or across diagnostic groups (i.e., mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer’s disease). The findings suggest that WMHs promote atrophy, which, in turn, drives cognitive decline and highlight a potential pathway in which small vessel cerebrovascular disease affects cognition by promoting neurodegenerative changes directly.

1. Introduction

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are areas of increased signal visualized on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They are frequently detected among older adults (DeCarli et al., 2005), strongly related to vascular risk factors (Breteler et al., 1994), and thought to reflect overall burden of small vessel cerebrovascular disease (Biesbroek et al., 2017). Although their specific etiology is debated, pathological correlate studies suggest general involvement of small vessel occlusive disease and specific correlation of WMH burden with arteriolar sclerosis, gliosis, white matter pallor, axonal loss, and demyelination (Erten-Lyons et al., 2013; Fazekas et al., 1993). WMHs are among the strongest radiological predictors of cognitive functioning (Debette and Markus, 2010; Gunning-Dixon and Raz, 2000), and both the severity and distribution of WMHs may alter the risk and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Brickman, 2013; Lee et al., 2016). Increased WMH burden and progression independently predict incident AD (Brickman et al., 2012, 2015) and the rate of cognitive decline in AD (Brickman et al., 2008a). Regional WMHs are elevated up to 20 years before estimated symptom onset in autosomal forms of AD (Lee et al., 2016).

Although the relationship of WMH with cognitive functioning and AD has been described consistently, the mechanisms of this relationship are poorly understood. WMH may have a direct effect on cognition by disrupting brain networks subserving cognitive processes (Albert, 1993; Gunning-Dixon et al., 2008). Alternatively, WMH could be a radiological marker of Wallerian-like degeneration that occurs secondary to disease-related neurodegeneration (Schmidt et al., 2011). This possibility is unlikely because of the strong association between vascular risk factors and WMHs, suggesting that the etiology of WMH is more likely related to vascular disease. Another possibility is that ischemic damage, which has a propensity for white matter small vessels, causes axonal cytoskeleton damage (Jones et al., 1999), leading to tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation (Erten-Lyons et al., 2013), which, in turn, drives cortical neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. This type of pathophysiological sequence is similar to what is seen in traumatic brain injury (Ojo et al., 2016). In this view, the relationship between WMH and cognition is mediated by cortical neurodegeneration. Some indirect evidence of this possibility exists. Increased tau burden is associated with cortical thinning (LaPoint et al., 2017), and higher regional WMH burden predicts future increases in cerebrospinal fluid levels of tau protein but not vice versa (Tosto et al., 2015). Similarly, animal models clearly show increased tau phosphorylation due to ischemic damage and hypoperfusion (Gordon-Krajcer et al., 2007; Koike et al., 2010). Population-based studies show that increased WMHs and other markers of cerebrovascular disease are associated with AD-like patterns of brain atrophy, which, in turn, are associated with diminished cognitive functioning (Habes et al., 2016; Knopman et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017).

The purpose of this study was to examine whether cortical thickness mediates the relationship between WMH and cognition in a cohort of community-dwelling older adults. We first examined global measures of WMHs, cortical thickness, and cognition. Next, based on our previous work that has implicated parietal lobe WMHs specifically in AD (Brickman et al., 2012, 2015), we focused on regional WMH volume, and more specific cortical thickness/volume and cognitive markers of AD, including entorhinal cortex thickness and hippocampal volume, and memory. A unique aspect of the study is that it includes participants from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, thus reflecting the increasing heterogeneity that comprises the current aging population. Rates of AD are higher among Hispanics and African Americans (Mayeda et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2001); however, the causes of this increase are not well established. Our previous work has shown a strong relationship between higher WMH and lower cognition among African Americans (Zahodne et al., 2015). We extend this work by testing explicitly whether the mediating role of cortical thickness in the relationship between WMH and cognition differs as a function of race/ethnicity. We also explored whether the mediating role of cortical thickness in the relationship between WMH and cognition differed between individuals characterized as cognitive normal and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Participants

Participants were recruited from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), which is a community-based study of cognitive aging and dementia among Medicare-eligible residents of northern Manhattan New York WHICAP participants were recruited in 3 waves, beginning in 1992, 1999, and 2009. MRI was introduced into the WHICAP study in 2004 (Brickman et al., 2008b) using a 1.5T MRI system and repeated after approximately 4.5 years on a subset of participants. Beginning in 2010, 552 participants from the cohort recruited in 2010 received high-resolution MRI scanning using a 3T MRI system. Participants self-identified with a race/ethnicity including the categories: non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, black, or other. Because few participants self-identified as “other” (n = 14), they were grouped with non-Hispanic whites for statistical analyses. Only participants with complete WMH and cortical thickness data from 3T samples of 2010, as well as cognitive and demographic data, were included in the analyses, resulting in a final sample size of n = 519. Compared with the 33 participants with incomplete data, included participants were similar in age, education, race/ethnicity, and cognition (p &gt; 0.05 for all comparisons) but had slightly higher years of education (12.8 ± 4.5 vs. 10.0 ± 5.2, t (548) =3.30, p = 0.001). The intention of the MRI substudies was to enroll individuals without dementia. However, 8 participants met clinical criteria for AD at the time of MRI scanning. An additional 83 individuals met criteria for MCI (Manly et al., 2008) and were also included in the overall sample. Table 1 displays the demographic characteristics of the 519 participants included in the current analyses.

2.2. Neuropsychological testing

Participants were evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery in their preferred language (English or Spanish) that has been validated across language groups (Siedlecki et al., 2010). As previously described (Siedlecki et al., 2010), summary measures for the cognitive domains of memory, language, visuospatial abilities, and executive functioning/psychomotor speed were derived based on a factor analysis of individual tests in the battery. A global cognitive summary score was derived for each participant by averaging the 4 domain scores. The memory summary score was also considered in secondary analyses; exploratory analyses considered summary scores on the other domains as well. The memory score was derived from total recall, delayed recall, and delayed recognition from the Selective Reminding Test (Buschke and Fuld, 1974). A diagnostic consensus conference was held, which included at least 1 neurologist and 1 neuropsychologist, who reviewed neuropsychological, medical, and functional interview data, to adjudicate a dementia diagnosis based on standard criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 1987; Manly et al., 2008; McKhann et al., 1984); MRI data were not included in diagnostic formulation. The diagnosis of MCI was assigned as previously described (Manly et al., 2008).

2.3. Magnetic resonance imaging

2.3.1. Image acquisition

Magnetic resonance images were obtained using a 3T Philips Intera scanner at Columbia University between 2011 and 2015. T1-weighted (repetition time = 20 ms, echo time = 2.1 ms, field of view = 240 cm, and 256 ± 160 matrix with 1.3-mm slice thickness) and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR; repetition time = 11,000 ms, echo time = 144.0 ms, inversion time = 2800 ms, field of view = 25 cm, 2 NEX, and 256 ±192 matrix with 3-mm slice thickness) images were acquired in the axial orientation.

2.3.2. WMH quantification

Whole-brain and regional WMH volumes were quantified with previously developed methods (Brickman et al., 2011, 2015). Briefly, each participant’s T2-weighted FLAIR image was skull stripped and a single gaussian curve was fit to voxel intensity values in the resultant image. An intensity threshold of 2.1 SD above the mean intensity value was set to define the lower boundary of hyperintense voxels, and voxels above that threshold were labeled. The threshold was determined by operator expertise and based on the visual inspection of the data. The resulting map was manually inspected and corrected for each subject, removing any voxels that were mislabeled as WMH voxels. Total WMH volume in cubic centimeters was defined as the number of labeled voxels multiplied by voxel dimensions. A regional “lobar” atlas was coregistered to each subject’s FLAIR image to derive WMH volumes in frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Fig. 1 displays a three-dimensional reconstruction of WMH volume derived for a single participant.

2.3.3. Cortical thickness and subcortical volume

FreeSurfer (version 5.3; http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) processing and analysis applied to each participant’s T1-weighted MRI scan was used to compute values of cortical thickness across the whole brain. Cortical thickness of left and right hemispheres, weighted by their respective surface area, was averaged to derive a single global mean cortical thickness measurement. Because they are specifically implicated in AD (Jack et al., 2013), we also considered the cortical thickness of the entorhinal cortex, averaged and weighted across the 2 cerebral hemispheres. As an additional medial temporal lobe structure, we derived the total volume of the hippocampus by summing of the volume of left and right hippocampus. We derived cortical thickness values of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as a control region because it is also implicated in higher order cognitive functioning but not necessarily in early AD. The DLPFC cortical thickness measure was derived by taking a weighted average of the left and right hemisphere structures: superior frontal gyrus, rostral middle frontal gyrus, and the caudal middle frontal gyrus.

2.4. Statistical analysis

We tested whether cortical thickness mediates the relationship between WMH and cognitive function. Mediational analyses were tested using PROCESS for SPSS 2.15.1 framework (Hayes, 2012). First, we tested whether the primary independent variable, in this case WMH volume, predicted the outcome measure, cognitive functioning. Next, we tested the direct effects of the primary predictor on the mediator (i.e., cortical thickness) and the direct relationship between the mediator and the outcome. Finally, we tested the indirect mediating effect or the extent to which the relationship between WMH and cognitive functioning operates statistically through cortical thickness. To test the primary hypothesis, we considered total WMH volume, global mean cortical thickness, and global cognitive functioning as predictor, mediator, and outcome, respectively. On an exploratory basis, we examined each of the cognitive domain scores separately.

As our previous work implicated parietal lobe WMH specifically in AD, we next examined each of the regional WMH volume (i.e., frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital) as predictors, medial temporal lobe thickness/volume (entorhinal cortex and hippocampus) and the control region’s thickness (DLPFC) as parallel mediators, and memory performance as the outcome, in 4 separate models.

Fig. 2 illustrates the direct, mediational, and moderated-mediational models graphically.

We explored whether the mediating role of global cortical thickness in the relationship between total WMH and global cognition is different across racial and ethnic groups (third model in Fig. 2). We first examined racial/ethnic group differences in WMH volume, cortical thickness, and cognition with general linear models. Next, we conducted a moderated-mediation analysis in PROCESS (Model 58; (Hayes, 2013)) that tested whether the indirect relationship described previously varies as a function of the racial/ethnic group. For these analyses, non- Hispanic white participants served as the reference group for separate comparisons with African American and Hispanics, the primary racial/ethnic groups represented in the WHICAP cohort. Similarly, we explored differences across diagnostic groups by stratifying by unimpaired versus impaired status. Because of the small number of participants diagnosed with AD, we combined the MCI and AD groups and compared them to unimpaired participants. All statistical tests controlled for age, number of years of education, and total intracranial volume as derived with FreeSurfer.

3. Results

3.1. Participant characteristics

Descriptive statistics for demographic, neuroimaging, and cognitive variables are presented in Table 1.

There were more women among the African American participants compared with the other 2 race and ethnic groups. Hispanics had fewer years of education than African Americans, who had fewer years of education than whites. Hispanics had higher rates of MCI and AD than the other race/ethnicity groups. The 3 race and ethnic groups were similar in age. Adjusting for age, education, and total cranial volume, racial/ethnic groups differed in total WMH volume, parietal lobe WMH volume, and average cortical thickness. For WMH volumes, African American participants had the highest volumes and whites had the lowest; Hispanic participants were intermediate. For cortical thickness measures, African American participants had the lowest thickness and whites had the highest thickness; Hispanic participants were intermediate. Adjusting for age and years of education, the 3 groups differed in overall cognitive performance; whites had higher overall cognitive scores than blacks who, in turn, had higher scores than Hispanics. For memory, whites obtained higher scores than Hispanics who obtained higher scores than blacks.

3.2. Associations among WMH, cortical thickness, and cognition

Direct and mediated effects of total WMH on cognition are presented in Table 2. Higher total WMH volume was associated with lower overall cognitive performance and lower cortical thickness. The indirect effect of WMH on cognition was significantly mediated by global cortical thickness. The findings remained when participants with dementia at the time of the scan (n = 8) were removed from the analyses. When examining each cognitive domain summary score as a separate outcome measure, the mediating (i.e., indirect) effect of global cortical thickness was significant for the relationship between total WMH and memory, executive functioning/psychomotor speed, language, and visuospatial functioning.

When examining regional relationships, higher frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital WMH volumes were associated with lower memory functioning (direct effects shown in Table 3). In mediation analyses, the associations of frontal, parietal, and occipital WMHs on memory functioning were significantly mediated by entorhinal cortical thickness and hippocampal volume, but not by DLPFC thickness (indirect effect; see Table 3). Lower DLPFC thickness was not a significant mediator between any lobar WMH and memory performance.

3.3. Mediating effects across groups

While the mediation effects of cortical thickness in the relationship between total WMH and global cognition were not significant within racial/ethnic groups, likely due to diminished statistical power, the indirect relationships were of similar magnitude across the groups and compared with the effects in the combined group (whites vs. blacks: index = 0.0006, CI: −0.0030, 0.0018; whites vs. Hispanics: index = 0.0001, CI: −0.0029, 0.0026). These results suggest that although racial/ethnic minority groups had higher levels of WMH and lower cognitive test scores, the relationship between WMH and cognition is similarly mediated by cortical thickness across racial and ethnic groups. Similarly, when stratified by the impairment group, the indirect effects, while not statistically significant in the latter, were similar in the 2 groups (unimpaired group: β = −0.0014, CI: −0.0028, −0.005; MCI/AD group: β = −0.002, CI: −0.0032, 0.0021), suggesting that the effect of WMHs on cognition and the mediating role of cortical thickness is similar in those with and without cognitive impairment.

4. Discussion

WMHs have been implicated in age-related cognitive decline and AD, which is typically expressed as a decline in memory function and characterized by atrophy in the cortical mantle and medial temporal lobe. To understand the mechanisms that link WMHs to cognitive decline and AD, we examined the extent to which atrophy, a marker of neurodegeneration, in the cerebral cortex and medial temporal lobe structures mediates the relationship between WMH and cognition. We found strong direct effects of WMHs on cognition and additional indirect effects of WMHs on cognition through cortical thickness, suggesting that some of the consistently observed associations of WMHs on cognition are at least partially attributable to their effect on atrophy. This mediating relationship was apparent for overall cognitive functioning as well as functioning in each of the cognitive domains. We previously showed specific relationships between parietal lobe–distributed WMHs and risk for AD (Brickman et al., 2012, 2015); when we examined regional specificity in this study, we showed that parietal lobe, but also frontal and occipital lobe, WMHs were associated with memory functioning, and that this relationship was partially mediated by entorhinal cortical thickness and hippocampal volume. This effect was specific for these medial temporal lobe structures, as demonstrated by the control region analysis with the DLPFC as mediator.

The 2 primary observations of this study—that WMHs have a direct effect on cognition and that WMHs have an indirect effect on cognition through regional markers of atrophy—have implications for the understanding of why WMHs are such strong predictors of cognitive decline and AD. Direct effects of WMHs suggest that small vessel cerebrovascular disease disrupts brain networks that underlie higher order cognitive processes. Indeed, previous work showed disrupted coupling of structural and functional connectivity with subsequent impact on executive functioning and memory among individuals with high degrees of WMHs (Reijmer et al., 2015). The observed indirect effects of WMHs on cognition through cortical thinning may reflect axonal damage associated with small vessel cerebrovascular disease (Gouw et al., 2011) that promotes neurodegenerative changes in the cortex (see example in Fig. 3), which in turn drive cognitive loss. This process, similar to what has been observed in traumatic brain injury (Ojo et al., 2016), may be dependent on tau hyperphosphorylation, suggesting a direct causal link between small vessel cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer’s pathology (Gordon-Krajcer et al., 2007; Koike et al., 2010). This relationship may be regionally specific, as the findings were observed mostly for parietal and frontal lobe WMHs (Brickman et al., 2012, 2015; Meier et al., 2011; Yoshita et al., 2006). Although Alzheimer’s pathology appears to have a predilection for frontal and parietal regions, we do not yet know whether small vessel cerebrovascular disease promotes Alzheimer’s pathology in these regions.

A particularly unique aspect of our study was that we were able to examine differences across race and ethnicity. Higher levels of age-related cognitive impairment and greater rates of AD among ethnic and racial minorities have been reported consistently (Mayeda et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2001), but the sources of these disparities are not understood. We previously showed that the direct relationships of WMH and regional volume on cognition differ across race and ethnic groups (Zahodne et al., 2015). In this study, African American and Hispanic participants had higher WMH volumes, lower cortical thickness, and lower measures of cognition compared with white participants, but, although not statistically significant within group, the mediating role of cortical thickness in the relationship between WMH and cognition was similar across groups. The higher WMH burden among African American and Hispanic older adults and its association with cortical thickness could be one important source of disparities in cognitive functioning and AD. The findings point to control of vascular risk factors or interventions that target vascular disease as a particularly relevant target measure to prevent cognitive decline among African Americans and Hispanics.

We were similarly able to test whether the relationship between WMH and cognition and the mediating role of cortical thickness differed across diagnostic groups by stratifying subjects into cognitively healthy and cognitively impaired (i.e., MCI/AD) groups. The primary observed effects were similar across these diagnostic groups, suggesting that the effect of WMHs on cognition and on the mediating role of cortical thickness does not depend on diagnostic status. Although the mediating relationship in the MCI/AD group did not reach statistical significance, we interpret that the effects were comparable because of the similar directionality and effect sizes between groups. We speculate that the small vessel cerebrovascular disease potentiates tau-related and neurodegenerative changes independent of amyloid pathology. Of course, future work that incorporates AD-specific biomarkers will be required to test this possibility explicitly.

Our findings are consistent with previous reports in large community-based cohorts. Knopman et al. (2015) showed cortical volume partially mediated the relationship between WMH and cognition in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Tuladhar et al. (2015) also reported that cortical thinning mediates the relationship between WMH and cognition. Similarly, Habes et al. (2016) used structural equation modeling to show that WMH burden accounts for greater degrees of age-related brain atrophy and atrophy in AD-specific regions. Our study adds to this growing body of literature that implicates small vessel disease in cognitive aging, neurodegeneration/atrophy, cognitive decline, and AD. In addition to the examination of regional distributions of WMHs and a whole-brain approach to cortical thickness, our study is unique in that we were able to test differences across racial/ethnic and diagnostic groups. Although our ability to infer causality is limited by the cross-sectional design, advanced statistical techniques allowed us to test mediation and moderated-mediation analyses regarding the relationships among WMHs, cortical thickness, and cognition.

5. Conclusion

We demonstrated that cortical thinning mediates the relationship between WMH and cognition and that regional WMHs affect memory through medial temporal lobe atrophy. Although African American and Hispanic participants had lower cognitive scores, higher WMH burden, and lower cortical thickness, relationships among these factors were similar across racial and ethnic groups.
