Introduction:

Growing evidence implicates air pollution as a risk factor for dementia, but prior work is limited by challenges in diagnostic accuracy and assessing exposures in the decades prior to disease development. We evaluated the impact of long-term fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposures on incident dementia (all-cause, Alzheimer’s disease [AD], and vascular dementia [VaD]) in older adults.

Methods:

A panel of neurologists adjudicated dementia cases based on extensive neuropsychological testing and magnetic resonance imaging. We applied validated fine-scale air pollutant models to reconstructed residential histories to assess exposures.

Results:

An interquartile range increase in 20-year PM2.5 was associated with a 20% higher risk of dementia (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5%, 37%) and an increased risk of mixed VaD/AD but not AD alone.

Discussion:

Our findings suggest that air pollutant exposures over decades contribute to dementia and that effects of current exposures may be experienced years into the future.

pmc1 | INTRODUCTION

Dementia is a highly prevalent disease and is expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades as the population ages.1 Individuals with dementia experience cognitive decline and lose their ability to function independently, affecting their own quality of life and health as well as the well-being of their caregivers and family members.2 Few avenues for treatment or prevention have been convincingly demonstrated.

Air pollution is a pervasive and modifiable exposure. Decades of research have shown that air pollution is an important contributor to respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.3 Evidence is building that air pollution may contribute to dementia,4–12 which led the 2020 Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care to add air pollution to the list of potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia.1 This growing evidence base highlights the need for careful consideration of methodological issues common in epidemiologic studies of dementia and air pollution.13–15 The major barriers to studying this association include the lack of populations with rigorous, prospective dementia characterization to allow for both accurate diagnosis and precise ascertainment of the timing of disease onset and the difficulty of assessing air pollution exposures during the critical window of exposure, which likely is many years before the disease develops.16 Constructing residential histories and exposure profiles is challenging because address histories prior to study entry may be unknown, and people with dementia may not recall their prior residences. Furthermore, most air pollution exposure assessment approaches have not estimated exposure before 1999 due to the absence of widespread monitoring. In addition, most prior studies have relied on administrative records.14 Although this approach permits the inclusion of large, geographically diverse populations, administrative records are not accurate with regard to diagnosis or precise with regard to disease onset.14,17 These records also have limited information on key confounding factors, such as education and smoking, or potential effect modifiers, such as the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, the strongest genetic predictor of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which may increase susceptibility to the impacts of air pollution exposure.9,18

We report findings from the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study (GEMS), a clinical trial of Ginkgo biloba (G. biloba) supplementation specifically designed to characterize the development of dementia in older adults via rigorous dementia ascertainment, coupled with a long-term residential history in participants that accounts for residential mobility prior to baseline and a novel approach to characterizing individual-level outdoor pollutant concentrations back to 1980. We draw on this unique study resource to investigate the impact of long-term fine particulate matter (less than 2.5 μm in diameter) (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposures on incident dementia overall and by subtype, and to investigate whether the impact is modified by APOE genotype.

2 | METHODS

2.1 | Study design and participants

GEMS has been described previously.19 Briefly, GEMS was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of G. biloba for the prevention of dementia and AD. G. biloba did not have a protective effect,20 but the study provides a setting to evaluate risk factors for dementia, including air pollution, due to the exceptional dedication of resources to detecting subtle incident neurocognitive changes. Between 2000 and 2002, a total of 3069 adults 75 years of age and older were recruited from four sites in the United States—Winston-Salem, North Carolina (NC); Hagerstown, Maryland (MD); Sacramento, California (CA); and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (PA)—using methods relying primarily on voter registration and other regional mailing lists.21 All participants identified three proxies including one who agreed to provide information should the participant be unable to do so. Those with prevalent dementia or other neurological or neurodegenerative diseases at baseline were excluded. Prevalent dementia was defined as meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for dementia22 or having a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale score greater than 0.5.23 In addition, participants taking cognitive enhancers, treatments for AD, or supplements or medications that could interfere with the action of G. Biloba supplements were excluded. Signed informed consent was obtained from participants and their proxies for the RCT. The University of Washington Institutional Review Board approved this study.

2.2 | Procedures for dementia ascertainment

GEMS participants were evaluated prospectively for dementia every six months from randomization until the end of follow-up in 2008. At each semi-annual exam, participants were administered three dementia screening examinations: the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE),24 the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog),25 and the CDR.23 A decline in a pre-specified number of points on two of three of these cognitive assessments, a report by participant or proxy of the onset of a new memory or other cognitive problem, or a diagnosis of dementia or prescription for dementia medication by a private physician since the prior visit triggered administration of an extensive neuropsychological battery (NPB) consisting of 12 tests in six cognitive domains. Following the NPB, participants classified as having incident dementia based on a previously described algorithm then underwent a neurological evaluation and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).20 A dementia adjudication panel confirmed the diagnosis and determined dementia subtype by consensus according to diagnostic criteria from the National Institute of Neurological and Communication Disorders and Stroke, Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke–Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l’Enseignement en Neurosciences, and the Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers.20 Each dementia case was categorized as either Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) with no AD, VaD and AD (here called “mixed” type), or dementia of other etiology (eg, dementia with Lewy bodies). Due to the small number of participants with incident VaD with no AD, we grouped these cases with VaD/AD mixed type dementia. Only 15 participants developed dementia classified as “other.” As a result, we did not perform analyses evaluating the impact of air pollution on dementia classified as “other.”

2.3 | Exposure assessment

Long-term exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 at home prior to study entry were of primary interest. We based exposure on participant residential addresses, which were documented and updated during semi-annual follow-up visits and by telephone contact between visits. We constructed residential history up to 20 years prior to study entry using LexisNexis (LN), a commercial credit-reporting company (Supplement 1).26 LN applies proprietary algorithms and public information (eg, mortgage records) to obtain address history.26 We refer to this comprehensive approach to address history reconstruction as “enhanced history (EH)” and to the approach that assumes no residential mobility prior to study enrollment as “baseline history (BH).”

Once address history from 1980 forward was reconstructed, we geocoded each residential location using parcel-based geocoding methods available with the Business Analyst tool in ArcGIS10.6.1 using the TeleAtlas Dynamap 2000 v.16.1 road network (Boston, MA). For each geocoded location, we calculated more than 300 spatiotemporal geographic predictors of air pollutant exposure. Because dementia is believed to develop over decades, we hypothesized that long-term mean exposure is most important in the development of this chronic disease.27 We applied a validated PM2.5 spatiotemporal model to estimate long-term PM2.5 exposure at each residential location between 1980 and 1999.28 Long-term NO2 exposure between 1990 and 1999 was estimated with a validated national prediction model.29 Exposure metrics were: (1) mean PM2.5 exposure in the 5, 10, 15, and 20 years prior to GEMS enrollment; and (2) mean NO2 exposure in the 5 and 10 years prior to GEMS enrollment. Each air pollution averaging period includes mean exposures up to 1999. For example, the 10-year average was calculated as the mean of the annual averages from 1990 through 1999. These intervals were selected because they occurred prior to GEMS enrollment.

2.4 | Statistical analyses

We performed descriptive analyses of individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics by study community and examined differences using analysis of variance or chi-square tests, as appropriate. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) describing associations between long-term air pollutant exposure and incident all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD/AD mixed in those who were free from dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline. PM2.5 and NO2 and their respective averaging periods were evaluated in separate analyses. HRs were reported per interquartile range (IQR) increase in air pollutant exposure. Follow-up time began at age at randomization and ended at the age halfway between the last examination without dementia and the examination at which the diagnosis was made.20 Censoring occurred at the age of last contact or death.20

Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders including year of randomization, GEMS study site, treatment assignment, sex, education, occupational history, smoking status, pack-years smoking, percent of life exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS), and neighborhood deprivation index (NDI; Supplement 2), since research has shown that the neighborhood social environment is an important confounder of associations between air pollution and health.30 We also included APOE genotype as a precision variable in all analyses. We included a multiplicative interaction term for air pollutant exposure and APOE genotype to evaluate APOE genotype as an effect modifier. To account for missing APOEε4 carrier information, we used the mice package31 in the R statistical computing language (R Core Team) to perform multiple imputation of missing APOE status and missing covariate values (Supplement 3).

2.5 | Sensitivity analyses

We performed a number of sensitivity analyses (Supplement 4). We altered both the air pollutant and NDI exposure periods by including up to the year of randomization to evaluate the robustness of results to alternative averaging periods. We also evaluated the impact of peak annual exposure in the 20 years prior to the year 2000. In addition, we examined modification of the effect of air pollution on dementia risk by gender, study site, G. biloba treatment assignment, and reported history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus (see Supplement 2). Finally, we examined the impact of additional potential confounders including body mass index, physical activity, and alcohol consumption, all of which were assessed at the examination closest in time to the baseline visit.15

3 | RESULTS

A total of 3069 individuals participated in GEMS. Of these, we excluded 482 who had MCI at baseline and an additional 23 who were missing information on air pollution exposure. Thus, the final analytic sample included 2564 participants with mean (SD) follow-up of 5.7 years (1.5); 324 (12.6%) developed dementia of any type (Table 1). AD comprised 65% of these cases. A mixture of dementia with features of both VaD and AD comprised 30% of the cases. Mean age at randomization was 78 years (3.2). Overall, 54% of participants were male with similar distributions across study sites. The cohort was nearly 97% White. Of the 80% of the cohort with information on APOE ε4 carrier status, 23% had at least one copy of the ε4 allele.

Participant home addresses were clustered around GEMS clinics at baseline (Figure 1A) but were dispersed widely in the two decades preceding enrollment (Figure 1B–C). Figures 1B and 1C indicate that the PM2.5 declined substantially between 1980 and 1989 and also that assuming participants lived in the same address 20 years prior to enrollment in GEMS influenced estimated long-term exposure. For example, the absolute value of the difference between EH- and BH-estimated PM2.5 exposure exceeded the IQR of 2 μg/m3 for 7% of participants in 1989 (Figure 1B) and 12% of participants in 1980 (Figure 1C). Figure 2 shows the distributions of estimated long-term PM2.5 and NO2 exposure for GEMS participants by averaging period and study community using the EH-based approach.

In adjusted analyses, we observed significant associations between PM2.5 exposure and all-cause dementia regardless of the exposure averaging period (Figure 3). A 2 μg/m3 higher PM2.5 exposure (IQR) in the 20 years prior to enrollment in GEMS was associated with a 1.20-fold higher (95% CI: 1.05, 1.37) risk of dementia. Results were similar for a 5-ppb IQR higher 10- and 5-year NO2 exposure, respectively (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.37; HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.37). HRs describing air pollutant associations with mixed VaD/AD generally were larger in magnitude, with statistical significance varying by pollutant and averaging period. Relationships with AD were slightly smaller in magnitude and more imprecise than those observed for all-cause dementia. We saw no evidence on the multiplicative scale that the impact of air pollutant exposure differed by APOE ε4 carrier status (P &gt; 0.58 for interaction), AD (P &gt; 0.27 for interaction), or mixed VaD (P &gt; 0.37 for interaction) regardless of pollutant or averaging period. Sensitivity analyses did not change overall conclusions (Figures S2–S5). Although the point estimates for the HRs varied somewhat between study sites, the CIs were wide and overlapping, and we did not see evidence that the impact of air pollution exposure on dementia risk varied significantly by study site (Figures S6 and S7). The impact of air pollution on dementia risk also did not vary by gender, G. biloba treatment assignment, or reported history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus reported at baseline (Figures S6–S9).

4 | DISCUSSION

We found strong associations between long-term PM2.5 and NO2 exposure and incident dementia in a large cohort of older adults with repeated and rigorous follow-up for dementia over a mean of nearly six years. We used detailed and updated residential history information and state-of-the-art air pollutant models to assess exposure two decades prior to study entry, the period most closely matching when the underlying disease processes are hypothesized to begin. Results were consistent across pollutant and averaging period and robust to various stages of adjustment for confounders and additional sensitivity analyses and supported the hypothesis that the earliest assessed exposure period was most important to subsequent dementia development. Associations were stronger for mixed VaD/AD than for AD but were only statistically significant for the longest exposure averaging periods. We saw no evidence that the impact of air pollution varied by APOE ε4 carrier status. Overall, findings provide strong evidence that air pollution exposure increases the risk of dementia, and that important pollutant effects likely precede dementia onset by several years if not decades.

Our findings are consistent with previous work demonstrating associations between air pollutant exposure and dementia.14,32,33 The magnitude of the effect we observed is similar to what others have found. In a notable exception, compared to the 1.20-fold increase in all-cause dementia that we found, Grande and colleagues observed a stronger effect of an IQR increase in PM2.5 exposure in an urban Swedish setting in the 5 years prior to dementia diagnosis (ie, HR = 1.54 per 0.88 μg/m3 increase; 95% CI: 1.33, 1.78). More pronounced effects of an increase in PM2.5 in relatively low air pollutant settings have been found in recent work,8,34 and the comparatively high exposures in the GEMS cohort may explain, in part, the smaller effect estimates observed in our study. Similar to Grande and colleagues, we observed larger magnitudes of effect for VaD and no significant effects for AD. This is consistent with findings from a community-based cohort in a US metropolitan area, in which no association between PM2.5 and AD neuropathology was found.35

The importance of VaD relative to AD in our study may explain in part why we did not observe significant effect modification by APOE ε4 carrier status, which is more strongly linked to AD. Air pollution has well-established impacts on cardiovascular health,36 and cardiovascular disease is associated with a higher risk of dementia.37 As such, our findings related to VaD are expected. Air pollution also may cause dementia through oxidative stress, inflammation, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, or direct particle translocation to the brain along the olfactory tract.38 We must acknowledge that even with the rigorous methods for assessing dementia including brain MRI, misclassification of dementia subtype is likely in the absence of postmortem evaluation.39 As a result, it is possible that the association between air pollution and AD may be weaker than what we observed, particularly if vascular pathology is driving the increased risk of dementia.

Our study had a number of strengths. We had comprehensive, rigorous, and frequent prospective assessments for dementia, a necessary strategy to accurately assess dementia in the absence of dementia registries or surveillance systems.14 The vast majority of previous studies on this topic ascertained dementia cases from administrative databases5,12,40 such as Medicare claims34,41 or hospitalization data,11,42 each of which relies on health care service utilization, which favors the identification of more severe cases and those with comorbidities. In the few studies that prospectively assessed dementia,4,8,9,33 researchers did not have access to brain MRI, a critical tool for distinguishing subtypes. In contrast, dementia was the primary end point of the GEMS RCT, and extensive resources were directed toward prospective and accurate dementia ascertainment. In addition to screening every six months during follow-up, GEMS participants regularly underwent detailed NPB testing and, if indicated, had a full neurological evaluation and brain MRI to determine dementia subtype, with final diagnosis made by an expert adjudication panel. This allowed for highly accurate classification of dementia and temporally resolved estimates of disease onset. In addition, most previous studies assumed that recent or current air pollution exposure was a reasonable proxy for exposure during the critical window of development of dementia4,9,43 and that participants were living in the same place during this window.10,41,42 Our exploration of residential history reveals substantial residential mobility with potentially meaningful consequences for air pollution exposure assessment. The findings reported here are among the first to account for residential mobility and exposures in the decades prior to disease development, the time period hypothesized to be most important.14 Longer averaging periods and the incorporation of lags between air pollution exposure and dementia ascertainment are critical to examine, as the onset of changes associated with dementia can be seen many years before diagnosis.15 Moreover, our detailed residential history from a prospective follow-up of participants combined with a finely resolved air pollution model enabled us to generate residence-specific rather than postal code-5,10,34 or city district-level42 estimates of air pollution exposure. Our study also benefitted from the inclusion of four geographically diverse sites in the United States, standardized data collection across sites, and extensive information on potential confounders including smoking, education, and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status.

We acknowledge several limitations to our study. Residential history misclassification and exposure measurement error are a concern; we expect this error was not associated with dementia status, which would imply attenuation toward the null on average under repeat sampling. Effects of air pollutants were dependent on participation in GEMS. Those experiencing cognitive decline are less likely to participate in research studies and more likely to be lost to follow-up,44,45 which likely would attenuate associations between air pollution and dementia.14 Studies of dementia are particularly subject to selective attrition.46 However, because dementia was the primary end point in the GEMS clinical trial and procedures were in place to mitigate this effect, selective attrition was less of a concern here.20 All participants, even those who died during follow-up, were classified as having or not having dementia at the time of their deaths. It is possible that competing events could have muted observed effects if air pollution exposure was related to the cause of death, a potential bias of particular concern in deaths related to cardiovascular disease. Finally, our study may not be generalizable to other study populations. Although special efforts were made to recruit minorities into the cohort,21 only 3% non-Whites were enrolled, and participants were relatively well educated.

5 | CONCLUSION

Although many high-income countries have successfully reduced pollutant concentrations, these reductions are not uniform, and increased concentrations continue to afflict many communities as well as many rapidly industrializing countries. Given the apparent sustained impact of pollutant exposures on dementia risk decades later, air pollution exposure reductions may be urgently needed to reduce the burden of dementia risk in older adults for years to come.

HIGHLIGHTS

There is an urgent need to identify modifiable risk factors for dementia.

Twenty-year average air pollution is linked to dementia risk in older adults.

Air pollutant effects likely precede dementia onset by decades.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

1. Systematic review:

We searched PubMed for human studies on air pollution and dementia through July 2021. Most previous studies have relied on administrative records to assess dementia cases, which is efficient but lacks accuracy in diagnosis, dementia subtype classification, and timing of disease onset. In addition, most prior work has evaluated the impact of recent air pollution exposure on risk without characterizing long-term residential mobility, and as a result could not accurately examine exposures during the time of most interest, when the underlying neurodegenerative disease processes occur.

2. Interpretation:

We detected strong associations between long-term air pollutant exposure and incident dementia, provide compelling evidence for pollutant effects on dementia with an underlying vascular etiology, and demonstrate the importance of exposure in middle age on the development of dementia in later life.

3. Future directions:

Future research should investigate the biological mechanisms underpinning the associations to inform potential targets for interventions.
