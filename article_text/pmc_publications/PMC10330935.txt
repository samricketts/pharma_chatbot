Background:

Cognitive deficits contribute to disability in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Cognitive intra-individual variability (IIV) is associated with cognitive decline in age-related disorders, but IIV has not been related to functional ability in PD. We examined IIV in predicting functional ability in participants with PD.

Methods:

De-identified National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center data (N=1228) from baseline and follow-up visits included participants with PD propensity score matched to control participants at baseline on age (M=72), education (M=15), and gender (28% female). PD symptom duration averaged 6 years. Outcome measures included the Functional Ability Questionnaire (FAQ), overall test battery mean (OTBM) of ten cognitive variables, IIV calculated as the standard deviation of cognitive data for each participant, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Unified PD Rating Scale gait and posture items. Baseline FAQ status in the PD group was predicted using logistic regression with age, education, cognition, GDS, and motor function as predictors. We compared baseline characteristics of PD participants with and without functional impairment at follow up.

Results:

PD participants showed lower OTBM and greater IIV, GDS, and motor dysfunction than controls (p&lt;.0001). Education, OTBM, IIV, GDS, and gait predicted functional status (77% overall classification; AUC=.84). PD participants with functional impairment at follow up showed significantly lower OTBM and greater IIV, GDS, and motor dysfunction at baseline (p&lt;.001).

Conclusion:

IIV independently predicts functional status in participants with PD while controlling for other variables. PD participants with functional impairment at follow up showed greater IIV than those without functional impairment at follow up.

Parkinson’s disease

pmcIntraindividual variability (IIV) refers to variability in performance within a task administered repetitively or across tasks (Hultsch &amp; MacDonald, 2004). IIV has emerged as a potential biomarker for the early detection of cognitive impairment in individuals with neurodegenerative disease (Anderson et al., 2016; Camicoli et al., 2008). IIV provides greater information than measures of central tendency alone. Thus, it can be used as a marker in the early stages of neurodegenerative disorders when neurological soft signs occur several years before clinical symptom onset. Neuroimaging studies of healthy individuals suggest that greater IIV on attention and working memory tasks is associated with dorsal motor network dysfunction possibly due to diminishing white and gray matter volume (Kelly et al., 2008; Weissman et al., 2006). Early identification of IIV in progressive neurodegenerative disorders could potentially assist in better clinical decision making.

The bulk of IIV research is in Alzheimer’s disease and healthy older adults. Previous studies have associated higher IIV in cognitive estimates with shorter conversion time to dementia in individuals who are cognitively healthy or have mild cognitive impairment (Anderson et al., 2016). Given that cognitive impairments are present in over 80% individuals with Parkinson’s disease (Cooney &amp; Stacy, 2016; Moustafa et al., 2016) it is important to identify the predictive utility of cognitive IIV estimates in this population. PD-related IIV studies are limited and have focused on reaction time (RT) and movement time measures (Burton et al., 2006; Caetano et al., 2018; Camicioli et al., 2008; Crawford et al., 1989; de Frias et al., 2012; Morrison et al., 2021; Reed, 1998). Individuals with PD show variable RT (Crawford et al., 1989) and those with less symptom severity had lower variability in RT and movement time on an arm extension task (Reed, 1998). Compared to controls, participants with PD showed similar average response time but greater IIV on a choice stepping reaction time test (Caetano et al., 2018). An 18-month longitudinal study demonstrated that IIV in RT significantly predicted dementia in persons with PD (de Frias et al., 2012), and PD participants showed greater IIV on finger tapping compared to healthy older adults (Roalf et al., 2018). Other studies report that greater IIV in choice RT is associated with greater disease severity in PD (de Frias et al., 2007). In one of the few studies examining IIV on neuropsychological measures in PD, baseline IIV predicted cortical volume loss at one year controlling for motor severity and overall cognitive ability at baseline (Jones et al., 2022).

Reduced dopaminergic activity has been reported to increase neural noise, which may manifest as greater IIV in behavioral measures (MacDonald et al., 2006). This finding is consistent with theory positing age-related decreases in striatal catecholamine levels as a cause of noise or random variability during task-related information processing (Li &amp; Lindenberger, 1999). IIV shows a U-shaped pattern over time with IIV decreasing from childhood to early adulthood and gradually increasing IIV in older adulthood (Williams et al., 2005). Developmental changes in white matter volume follow a similar nonlinear pattern with inverted U-shapes observed in all regions studied including frontal and subcortical white matter (Westlye et al., 2010). Given the involvement of dopaminergic frontal-subcortical systems in PD, these findings indicate that IIV may be especially useful in characterizing PD. Specifically, capturing IIV in early stages of PD might be important for identifying those who may progress faster in the disease spectrum.

While variability in RT has been identified as a possible index of disease severity, it is unknown if cognitive IIV relates to functional decline in PD. PD-related neurodegeneration in the dopaminergic circuits of the substantia nigra predominantly manifests as difficulty in movement, gait, and decreased ability or inability to perform activities of daily living (ADL; Kouli et al., 2018). Separate from physical causes of functional limitations, the hallmark cognitive deficit in PD, executive dysfunction, has obvious relevance to activities of daily living (Dirnberger &amp; Jahanshahi, 2013), and recent research has linked executive function with stepping accuracy and obstacle avoidance in PD (Caetano et al., 2019). Given the interactions between cognitive impairment in PD and motor performance and the neural pathways implicated in IIV and executive function, it is imperative to gauge the sensitivity of IIV to functional decline in PD.

In this study, we focused on three objectives in a sample of individuals with PD and matched controls. First, we compared cognitive IIV, functional ability, motor function, and emotional status in matched healthy older adults and individuals with PD. We hypothesized that participants with PD would show worse cognitive function, functional ability, and motor function and greater emotional difficulty than healthy control participants. Second, we evaluated bivariate relationships among outcome measures. We hypothesized that greater cognitive, emotional, and motor difficulty would be associated with worse baseline functional ability. Finally, we compared baseline characteristics of individuals with and without functional impairment at follow up. We hypothesized that individuals showing functional impairment at follow up would show greater cognitive, emotional, and motor difficulty at baseline compared to individuals without functional impairment at follow up.

Method

Participants

This study involved secondary analysis of de-identified National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) data. Institutional Review Board deemed the project non-human subjects research. An initial dataset (N = 32,778) with baseline and follow-up visits was screened to select control participants with normal cognition at baseline using a NACC classification variable (N = 10,435), and participants diagnosed with PD (N = 667) at baseline. Cases were excluded if outcome measures of emotional status (n = 80), motor function (n = 51), or cognitive status (n = 32) were missing resulting in an intermediate sample of control participants (N = 10,325) and participants with PD (N = 614). Participants with PD were matched to control participants on age, education, and gender resulting in a final sample of 1228. Participants were 71.3 years old on average (SD = 8.9) with 15.6 years of education (SD = 3.1). The sample was 25.9% female with the following racial and ethnic proportions: 86.2% non-Hispanic white, 7.3% African American, 4.3% Hispanic/Latino, 1.5% Asian American, and 0.7% other racial and ethnic identities. Among PD participants, time since diagnosis averaged 5.8 years (SD = 5.5), and 79.5% of PD participants were reported to be taking a Parkinson’s disease medication at the time of the evaluation.1

Measures

Cognitive Status.

Ten cognitive variables from the NACC Uniform Data Set (UDS) version 1 and 2 were examined: Boston Naming Test odd items (Kaplan et al., 2001), Digit Symbol Coding (Wechsler, 1987), Digits Forward and Backward (Wechsler, 1987), Logical Memory I and II (Wechsler, 1987), semantic word generation (animals and vegetables; Gladsjo et al., 1999), and Trail Making Test-A and -B (Reitan, 1955). Raw scores were converted to norm-referenced z scores adjusted for sex, age, and education (Shirk et al., 2011; Weintraub et al., 2009). Norm-referenced cognitive scores were averaged to create an overall test battery mean (OTBM). The standard deviation of test scores was calculated for each participant as the measure of IIV (Christensen et al., 1999).

Emotional Status.

The Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS; Sheikh &amp; Yesavage, 1986) is a widely used 15-item measure of depression that has shown utility in individuals diagnosed with PD (Weintraub et al., 2007). Total scores range from 0 to 15. The GDS showed good internal consistency in this sample (α = .84).

Functional Ability.

The Functional Ability Questionnaire (FAQ; Pfeffer et al., 1982) is a 10-item informant-report measure of ADL. Items are scored from 0 (normal) to 3 (dependent) with higher scores indicating greater need for assistance in ADL. Total scores range from 0 to 30. A total score cutoff (≥ 2) differentiated healthy older adults from older adults with cognitive impairment (González et al., 2021) and was used to classify FAQ total score as normal (0–1) or impaired (2–30). The FAQ demonstrated excellent internal consistency in the sample (α = .96).

Motor Function.

Motor function was assessed using Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor examination gait and posture items. In NACC UDS version 1 and 2, the original UPDRS motor examination form was used (Fahn et al., 1987). This version contains 14 items and results in 27 ratings. Items are scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (marked difficulty or inability to complete the action) with higher scores indicating greater motor dysfunction. Gait and posture items were examined individually.

Analyses

PD participants (N = 614) were matched to control participants using one-to-one propensity score matching without replacement implemented using the psmatch2 command in Stata 13.2 (StataCorp LP, 2013). Matching covariates included age and education in years and dichotomous gender. Analyses included parametric (t-tests) and non-parametric (chi-square tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests) tests for demographic and outcome measure comparisons according to the distributional properties of the variables. Associations among outcome variables were examined using Spearman rank-order correlations (rs). Regarding effect sizes, we calculated Cohen’s d for parametric analyses (d = M2 – M1 / SDpooled), and r for non-parametric analyses: r = √(Χ2 / N) for chi-square tests; and r = z / √N for Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. A logistic regression model was fitted in the PD group using functional status as the dependent variable, and age, education, and cognitive (OTBM and IIV), emotional (GDS), and motor function (UPDRS gait and posture) at baseline as independent variables. Among participants with PD who did not show functional impairment at baseline, a subset analysis compared baseline characteristics between participants with and without functional impairment at follow up.

Results

Characteristics of the sample

Demographic characteristics of participants are listed in table 1. There were no differences between PD and control groups in age, education, or gender. The control group had a lower percentage of non-Hispanic white participants than the PD group, Χ2(1) = 25.5, p &lt; .001, r = .14. The control group showed significantly higher OTBM, t(1226) = 23.7, p &lt; .0001, d = 1.4, and significantly lower IIV, t(1226) = −15.1, p &lt; .0001, d = −0.9, than the PD group. Control participants had fewer depressive symptoms (lower scores on GDS, z = −15.1, p &lt; .0001, r = .43), greater functional independence (lower scores on FAQ, z = −21.7, p &lt; .0001, r = .62) and better gait (z = −25.1, p &lt; .0001, r = .72) and posture (z = −24.1, p &lt; .0001, r = .69) assessed using UPDRS gait and posture items. Demographic and outcome measure correlations are shown by group in Table 2. Box plots of OTBM and IIV distributions by group are shown in Figure 1.

Relationship between IIV and functional impairment

A logistic regression model was fitted with FAQ as outcome and age, education, OTBM, IIV, GDS, gait, and posture as predictors. The model was preferred over a constant-only model, χ2(7) = 210.8, p &lt; .0001. A Pearson goodness of fit test was nonsignificant (p = .49) indicating good model fit. The model correctly classified 76.2% of participants and showed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% confidence interval .80 - .86). Education, OTBM, IIV, GDS, and gait made independent contributions to the model. Model details are in Table 3.

Comparison between PD group with and without functional impairment

Participants in the PD group with (n = 28) and without (n = 63) functional impairment at follow up were compared at baseline. Age and education were not different between these groups. The PD group without functional impairment at follow up showed higher OTBM, t(89) = 2.8, p =.007, d = 0.6, lower IIV, t(89) = −2.8, p = .006, −0.6, less depression, z = −2.9, p = .003, r = .31, and higher functional status, z = −2.5, p &lt; .01, r = .27. Gait and posture were not different between the groups. Subgroup analysis details are in a supplemental data table in the appendix.

Discussion

This study examined cognitive and emotional status, motor function, and functional ability in individuals diagnosed with PD and matched participants with normal cognition. Findings supported our first hypothesis in that healthy control participants demonstrated better cognitive function (i.e., higher OTBM and lower IIV), less mood disruption (i.e., lower GDS), better motor function (i.e., lower scores on UPDRS gait and posture items), and better functional ability (i.e., lower FAQ score) with a medium effect size on the GDS and large effect sizes observed on all other comparisons. In the PD group, functional ability and cognitive status were associated in the predicted direction with functional independence positively correlated with OTBM and negatively associated with IIV. In the control group, functional ability showed a small to medium positive association with OTBM and no relationship to IIV. Age positively correlated with IIV with small to medium effects in both groups. Finally, in the PD group, individuals without functional impairment at follow up showed better cognition, less depression and better functional status compared to those with functional impairment at follow up.

These findings are consistent with prior research demonstrating relationships among IIV and other markers of cognitive decline in neurodegenerative conditions (Burton et al., 2006; Crawford et al., 1989; de Frias et al., 2012; Reed, 1998). Prior work examining IIV in PD focused on RT and speed of movement (Burton et al., 2006; Caetano et al., 2018; Camicioli et al., 2008; Crawford et al., 1989; de Frias et al., 2007; de Frias et al., 2012; Morrison et al., 2021; Reed, 1998) and related IIV on these measures to conversion to dementia and disease severity. Overall, these studies indicated that individuals with PD may show increased latency on choice RT tasks (Burton et al., 2006; Camicioli et al., 2008), and that IIV is associated with disease progression (de Frias et al., 2007). Another longitudinal study showed that individuals with PD incipient dementia showed greater inconsistency in RT tasks compared to those without dementia and healthy controls (de Frias et al., 2012). Importantly, all these studies used inconsistency IIV, which measures within person variability across trials in a single session or over time (Costa et al., 2019). Here, we use dispersion IIV, which is within person variability across different domains at a given time point (Costa et al., 2019). Only one study in PD used dispersion IIV on neuropsychological measures to identify risk of future cognitive decline (Jones et al., 2020).

These findings extend previous work in PD in two ways. First, we demonstrate the potential utility of a different type of IIV since it was determined by measuring dispersion in a cognitive test battery rather than inconsistency. The cognitive test battery included some timed measures of cognitive speed and flexibility expected to correlate with RT, but it also included untimed measures of attention, naming, and memory indicating that our findings are not entirely attributable to variability in speed. Dispersion based measures of IIV have been found to vary across studies with inconsistent associations with age that have recently been proposed to represent meaningful differences in how the older adult brain engages cognitive resources and functions efficiently with observation of influence from cognitive reserve (De Felice &amp; Holland, 2018). In this context, our findings in participants with PD indicate that the disease process may accelerate changes in brain functionality observed in healthy aging. The more nuanced characterization of brain function in aging revealed by dispersion measures of IIV compared to traditional ability scores may reflect greater sensitivity of IIV to changes in brain function or perhaps that IIV reflects brain function rather than serving as a cognitive probe from which inferences about brain function can be drawn. Secondly, our primary outcome was a measure of functional ability with therapeutic implications beyond prediction of dementia and disease severity. Although multiple cognitive skills are likely necessary for functional independence, the ties between executive skills and functional independence seem strongest, but historically are challenging to assess in ecologically valid manner (Lezak, 1982). IIV may represent an improved approach toward evaluation of executive function as typically defined. Thus, our preliminary findings indicate that IIV can be considered an important surrogate biomarker of cognitive decline in PD and its potential influence on physical functioning.

The second hypothesis focused on associations between cognitive measures and functional ability. We predicted that greater cognitive ability would be positively associated with functional independence and increased variability would be inversely associated with functional independence. In addition to bivariate analyses supporting this hypothesis, the logistic regression model showed that IIV predicts functional status independent of overall cognitive ability while controlling for demographics, mood, and motor function. This finding is important as functional status is critical to the well-being of individuals with PD and their caregivers. A decline in functional status with motor deficits like bradykinesia, postural instability and freezing can increase the risk of fall and negatively affect ADL. Previous studies have shown that gait inconsistencies in individuals with PD are associated with increased fall risk (Morrison et al., 2021; Hausdorff, 2007; Puyjarinet et al., 2019). While these studies indirectly link motor IIV and functional decline, we report for the first time that cognitive IIV is a direct predictor of functional status in those with PD. Developing robust predictors of functional status is an important first step toward identification of individuals at greater risk of functional decline.

Our final hypotheses regarding baseline differences between participants with and without functional impairment at follow up provides preliminary data relevant to the goal of identifying characteristics of individuals at risk for future functional decline. Participants with PD who were not functionally impaired at follow up showed better cognitive function (lower IIV, higher OTBM), lower mood disruption, and higher functional ability at baseline than the participants with PD who were functionally impaired at follow up. Baseline motor function was not different between these groups. Effect sizes were medium to large on cognitive comparisons, and medium on functional and mood comparisons. Our findings partly concur with a systematic review that found baseline motor and cognitive impairments to predict disability and movement difficulty in PD (Marras et al., 2002). Taken together, identifying individuals who are at risk for functional decline during early stages of Parkinson’s may guide clinical decision making and intervention.

The lack of baseline differences in motor function between groups in the subset analysis was unexpected and not consistent with our hypothesis. Considering the bivariate correlations in the healthy control and PD groups indicates possible explanations. In the control group, no relationship was observed between functional ability and motor function, but associations were noted between age and motor function and between cognitive and emotional status and functional ability. These findings are consistent with expectation: older age is associated with reduced motor function, and cognitive and emotional factors are well-known causes of functional limitations. In the PD group, not only were expected relationships among cognitive and emotional status and functional ability observed, but also motor function showed a much stronger relationship with functional status with a medium to large effect size. To conduct the subset analysis, we restricted the sample to participants with PD without functional impairment at baseline to pursue the aim of identifying baseline characteristics associated with development of impairment at follow up, so participants impaired at baseline were excluded from the analysis. Reducing the sample in this way likely restricted the range in functional and motor measures contributing to lack of differences in motor function.

Limitations of the study include the retrospective design with a fixed test battery containing older versions of current instruments. As a longitudinal project, the NACC data collection endeavor continued using older versions of tests (Wechsler, 1987a, 1987b) to allow consistency over time. Measures of motor function were also limited to an earlier UPDRS version due to its ongoing use in the NACC dataset. Although updated versions of tests typically retain strong associations with their predecessors, the generalizability of these findings to current clinical practice may be attenuated by test stimuli and normative differences. Our measure of IIV was based on ten cognitive variables available in the dataset. We are not aware that an optimal number of cognitive tests for calculating dispersion IIV has been recommended, but it might be possible that more robust estimates could be obtained with a larger battery of 20 to 30 tests. The sample was mostly male and white with a high educational level limiting application of the findings to more diverse clinical settings. Moreover, we did not have information pertaining to disease severity and PD phenotypes in this sample. Future research might build on this work to elaborate on PD phenotypes susceptible to functional decline, delineate different patterns of symptom presentation, and relate these observations to specific functional abilities. Additional research is also needed to develop and validate guidelines for interpreting IIV as a clinical indicator at the level of the individual patient. A related aim is to examine whether IIV retains clinical relevance across different test combinations and test battery lengths.

In conclusion, this study provides a useful starting point for additional work to identify predictors of functional ability in PD with important implications for clinical care and intervention. These findings reinforce the importance of whole person patient care recognizing the complex interactions in factors contributing to functional ability in daily life. IIV could be used as a prognostic biomarker in PD for identifying those at risk for functional decline. Identifying IIV has important implications in designing PD-specific cognitive-motor rehabilitation programs incorporating dual task approaches to improve balance and reduce fall risk.
