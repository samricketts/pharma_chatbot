Background:

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with impaired cerebral circulation which underscores diminished delivery of blood oxygen and nutrients to and throughout the brain. In the 3xTg-AD mouse model, we have recently found that &gt; 10 cerebrovascular miRNAs pertaining to vascular permeability, angiogenesis, and inflammation (e.g., let-7d, miR-99a, miR-132, miR-133a, miR-151-5p, and miR-181a) track early development of AD. Further, endothelial-specific miRNAs (miR-126-3p, miR-23a/b, miR-27a) alter with onset of overall AD pathology relative to stability of smooth muscle/pericyte-specific miRNAs (miR-143, miR-145).

Objective:

We tested the hypothesis that cerebrovascular miRNAs indicating AD pathology share mRNA targets that regulate key endothelial cell functions such as angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and blood flow regulation.

Methods:

As detected by NanoString nCounter miRNA Expression panel for 3xTg-AD mice, 61 cerebrovascular miRNAs and respective mRNA targets were examined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis for canonical Cardiovascular (Cardio) and Nervous System (Neuro) Signaling.

Results:

The number of targets regulated per miRNA were 21 ± 2 and 33 ± 3 for the Cardio and Neuro pathways respectively, whereby 14 ± 2 targets overlap among pathways. Endothelial miRNAs primarily target members of the PDE, PDGF, SMAD, and VEGF families. Individual candidates regulated by ≥ 4 miRNAs that best mark AD pathology presence in 3xTg-AD mice include CFL2, GRIN2B, PDGFB, SLC6A1, SMAD3, SYT3, and TNFRSF11B.

Conclusion:

miRNAs selective for regulation of endothelial function and respective downstream mRNA targets support a molecular basis for dysregulated cerebral blood flow regulation coupled with enhanced cell growth, proliferation, and inflammation.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia (~6.7 million people in the United States alone) [1] and is described by compromised neurovascular regulation of blood flow throughout the brain [2]. Clinical evidence now clearly demonstrates that cerebrovascular dysfunction encompassing intracranial arteries, arterioles, and capillaries results in decreased blood flow, reduced cerebral oxygenation, and increased white matter hyperintensities that altogether drive and accompany neurodegenerative AD pathology [3, 4]. Further, the prognosticative value among the intersection of cerebrovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and amyloidosis markers is widespread for determining cognitive decline among racially and ethnically diverse individuals [5, 6]. Despite such observations, only a small percentage (≤5%) of agents currently in clinical trials are dedicated to directly addressing vascular health versus ≈30% for amyloid and tau [7]. The molecular pathogenesis of AD remains obscure, whereby no effective prevention or treatment strategies have been secured yet. As a potential non-invasive diagnostic and therapeutic tool, vascular miRNAs that negatively regulate expression of downstream messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein targets [8] are promising biomarkers due to their novelty in modern molecular biology research while stable in the blood circulation [9]. We have recently found that cerebrovascular miRNAs track early development of AD pathology in the 3xTg-AD model [10].

If not stably expressed throughout, cerebrovascular miRNAs are primarily downregulated during AD relative to pre-AD conditions in the 3xTgAD model which include let-7d, let-7g, miR-23a, miR-23b, miR-27a, miR-29a, miR-29c, miR-99a, miR-126-3p, miR-132, miR-135a, miR-150, miR-151-5p, and miR-181a [10]. Upregulated miRNAs during AD include miR-29a, miR-29c, and miR-690. For sex-based differences, most of the downregulated miRNAs emerged in AD males (let-7d, let-7i, miR-23a, miR-34b-3p, miR-99a, miR-126-3p, miR-132, miR-150, miR-151-5p, miR-181a) with only two for females (miR-150, miR-539). This general finding aligns with the bulk of structural changes (density, junctions, and length) observed primarily in the cerebral vessels of male 3xTg-AD animals [11]. In addition, cerebrovascular miRNAs can delineate conditions of cognitive impairment versus young as let-7g and miR-1944 in males and miR-133a and miR-2140 in females [10]. With onset of extracellular amyloid- (A) deposition relative to cognitive impairment, miR-99a is downregulated in males. With the exception of miR-2141, all of the detected cerebrovascular miRNAs were stably expressed from the onset of AD and onward for progression of disease. Thus, a strength and limitation of cerebrovascular miRNA expression appears to be the sole ability to mark early (but not late) development of AD.

An additional noteworthy finding in 3xTg-AD mice is that endothelial-specific-miRNAs (miR23a/b [12], miR-27a [13, 14], and miR-126-3p [15, 16]) are downregulated in AD versus pre-AD conditions, whereas smooth muscle/pericyte-specific miRNAs (miR-143 [17] and miR-145 [12, 18]) remain stable throughout [10]. Upregulated downstream molecular targets of endothelium-specific miRNAs govern vascular integrity [13], angiogenesis [16, 19], and clearance of A [20]. Accordingly, such members of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) [21], platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [22], “mothers against decapentaplegic” (SMAD) [23], and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [24] gene families are integral to progression of AD pathology. At the same time, vascular miRNAs may interface with the brain parenchyma for processes of neuroinflammation as well [25]. Altogether, emerging evidence points to AD as a convergence of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disease [26].

In light of our recent molecular [10] and structural [11] findings for cerebral vessels in 3xTg-AD animals, the current study endeavored to ascertain mRNA targets downstream of miRNAs indicative of AD onset. A key objective was to determine whether there were mRNA targets shared among miRNAs that changed with AD pathology in 3xTg-AD animals versus others that were stably expressed throughout. In addition, we examined differences in such targets across biological sexes regardless of AD progression. With the premise that AD is a neurovascular disorder [2], our approach entailed a comprehensive Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of 61 distinct cerebrovascular miRNAs along pathway strings for cardiovascular (Cardio) and nervous system (Neuro) signaling. More than 1,800 targets emerge for identification among the two pathways, whereby 455 are shared. The most prominent individual mRNAs for marking the presence of AD pathology while regulated by ≥ 4 cerebrovascular miRNAs include Cofilin 2 (CFL2), Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Type Subunit 2B (GRIN2B), PDGFB, Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 1 (SLC6A1), SMAD3, Synaptotagmin 3 (SYT3), and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Receptor Superfamily Member 11b (TNFRSF11B). Further, CFL2, Histone Deacetylase 8 (HDAC8), Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R), ORAI Calcium Release-Activated Calcium Modulator 2 (ORAI2), PDGFD, Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA) distinguish among males and females during Pre-AD and/or AD, alongside members of the Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSPA1A/B), Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel (SCN2A/B and 8A) and SYT (SYT1/2/4) families. Altogether, miRNAs selective for regulation of endothelial function and respective downstream mRNA targets support a molecular basis for dysregulated cerebral blood flow regulation coupled with enhanced cell growth, proliferation, and inflammation. Accordingly, pathways associated with cerebrovascular miRNAs and their respective mRNA targets advance mechanistic and therapeutic insight for resolving early AD development.

METHODS

Animal care and use, cerebrovascular RNA isolation, and NanoString miRNA profiling

In accord with approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Loma Linda University and performed in accord with the National Research Council’s “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (8th Edition, 2011), our original study [10] isolated and examined cerebrovascular miRNA from 24 3xTg-AD mice [27, 28]. Three males and three females were used throughout four groups as young (1–2 mo) [29], cognitive impairment (CI, 4–5 mo) [29], presence of extracellular Aβ plaques (Aβ, 6–8 mo) [28], and extracellular Aβ plaques with neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau (AβT, 12–15 mo) [28]. Note that these study groups are described by absence of cognitive deficits with no overt Aβ or tau throughout the entire brain (young) [29]; early deficits in memory retention coupled with intraneuronal A pathology in the hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala but no “plaques” as extracellular Aβ deposition (CI) [29]; moderate cognitive impairment coupled with cortical Aβ but no tau pathology (Aβ) [28]; and severe cognitive impairment coupled with extensive hippocampal inflammation (AβT) [28] respectively.

The purification of cerebral blood vessels from each mouse brain was based on a modified protocol originally developed by the Cohen-Salmon laboratory [30]. In brief, brain tissue was homogenized and then subjected to a series of centrifugation and filtration cycles in HEPES-buffered Hanks Balanced Salt Solution with bovine serum albumin. Following final RNA extractions from all animals/groups, samples were analyzed using a mouse miRNA nCounter platform (CSO-MMIR15-12, Mouse Version 1.5 miRNA assay; NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA). Using the nSolver software, (Version 4.0; NanoString Technologies) detected miRNAs with a normalized count threshold of ≥ 5 [31] across all samples were retained for further analysis. Details of respective protocols can be consulted in Chum et al. [10].

Signaling pathway and statistical analyses

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) microRNA Target Filter was used to generate miRNA:mRNA targeting information. 61 out of the 86 microRNAs uploaded have targeting information available in IPA. “Experimentally Observed” and “High (predicted)”were selected for miRNA Confidence filter. Ingenuity Canonical Pathways pertaining to Cardiovascular Signaling (Cardio) were selected and filtered to 61 microRNAs targeting 711 mRNAs. In addition, Neurotransmitter and Other Nervous System Signaling (Neuro) was selected and filtered to 61 microRNAs targeting 1163 mRNAs. Graph Pad Prism (Version 9; San Diego, CA, USA) was used for plotting data and conducting data analysis. For simultaneous comparison among pathology groups (young versus CI versus Aβ versus AβT or Pre-AD versus AD) and both sexes, statistical analysis included two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc correction for multiple comparisons. As applicable, Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov parametric tests examined normal distribution of data combined among biological sexes as Young versus CI versus Aβ versus AβT (n=6 each). For overall Pre-AD (Young + CI) and AD (Aβ versus AβT) datasets where n=12 per group, Anderson-Darling and D’Agostino and Pearson parametric tests were additionally applied. Kruskal-Wallis (Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons) and Mann-Whitney tests were used in replacement of one-way ANOVA (Holm-Sidak posthoc) and two-tailed unpaired t-tests respectively for non-parametric comparisons. Note that a combination of young with CI for Pre-AD grouping was for the purpose of gauging the indicative sensitivity of various miRNAs (individual group transitions and overall AD versus Pre-AD) and how advanced pathology needs to be in order for certain changes in miRNA expression to take place. Outlying data points were determined by the robust regression and outlier removal (ROUT, Q=1%) method in comparisons that involved n≥6 per study group. An n of 1 represented one independent miRNA expression analysis from one mouse brain. All summary data are presented as the mean±SEM and differences among groups were accepted as statistically significant with p&lt;0.05.

RESULTS

The primary goal of the current study was to determine individual mRNA targets downstream of miRNAs that are altered versus those that were stable in expression upon onset of AD in 3xTg-AD mice [10]. Further, we also examined whether various targets aligned with each biological sex (males and females) during Pre-AD and/or AD conditions. A total of 61 separate miRNAs with distinct pools of targets were recognized and mapped by the IPA canonical Cardio and Neuro pathway strings. Presentation of data is organized as an overview of the number of mRNAs targets per miRNA that are recognized by Cardio, Neuro, and overlap of Cardio and Neuro (Figs. 1 and 2). Representative Cardio and Neuro Venn diagrams of mRNA targets are illustrated for miRNAs that best mark AD pathology for Figs.3–7.Table 1 provides an overview of all 61 miRNAs as points of significance (or the lack thereof) among AD pathology and/or biological sex alongside lists of all individual mRNA targets for both Cardio and Neuro. Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 list all individual mRNA targets for Cardio and Neuro respectively with lists of all regulating miRNAs per target. Table 2 illustrates distinguished mRNA targets shared by≥3 miRNAs with scoring for indicative strength of AD pathology and biological sex. Finally, Tables 3 and 4 present a final distillation of the most prominent mRNA markers (+ known cellular roles) for AD pathology and biological sex respectively.

Cardio and Neuro Strings: Target numbers and extent of overlap before and during AD

Emerging evidence points to AD as a neurovascular disorder [2], whereby the brain parenchyma is dependent on the metabolic nourishment provided by the cerebral microcirculation and vice versa. Based on our view from cerebrovascular samples isolated from 3xTg-AD mice, there is a total of 964 discrete mRNA targets among general Cardio and Neuro signaling pathways to consider for best marking the development of AD pathology. The Cardio string revealed 711 targets, ranging from 1 to 80 in number regulated by each miRNA (mean±SEM: 20.69±2.29) (Fig. 1). In turn, each Cardio target is regulated by a range of 1 to 11 miRNAs (1.78±0.04) (Supplementary Table 1). The Neuro string indicates 1,163 targets, ranging from 5 to 131 per miRNA (32.56±3.35) (Fig. 1). Accordingly, each Neuro target is regulated by a range of 1 to 11 miRNAs (1.71±0.03) (Supplementary Table 2). Overlap among Cardio and Neuro targets ranges from 1 to 56 (13.54±1.52) (Fig. 1) corresponding to a fractional overlap among the Cardio and Neuro marker pools as 0.66±0.02 and 0.41±0.01 respectively (Fig. 2A). The fraction of shared Cardio targets with Neuro was higher (p&lt;0.0001) relative to vice versa (shared Neuro with Cardio) throughout conditions as miRNAs that changed in expression with AD pathology (Cardio: 0.68±0.03; Neuro: 0.41±0.02) and those stable in expression throughout (Cardio: 0.66±0.02; Neuro: 0.40±0.02) (Fig. 2B). In turn, note that conditions of AD pathology do not alter (p&gt;0.90) the fraction of shared targets among pathways for either Cardio or Neuro (Fig. 2B). Altogether, these data support a high level of integration of the cardiovascular system with the nervous system in the blood vessels of the brain that is retained with AD. Our next goal was to determine the identity of the individual molecular markers themselves that are regulated by respective miRNAs and whether the onset of AD could be tracked accordingly.

Let-7d, miR-181a, miR-132, and miR-99a: shared mRNA targets

We found that let-7d, miR-181a, miR-132, and miR-99a are significantly downregulated in aging males, and thereby mark the onset of the Aβ/AD in 3xTg-AD male mice (Table 1) [10]. Out of all the miRNAs that change in expression with AD, let-7d has the highest number of targets for Cardio (=69), Neuro (=89), and respective overlap (=43) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). For Cardio and Neuro, miR-181a has 15 and 24 targets respectively (overlap=7); miR-132 has 12 and 22 targets respectively (overlap=8); and miR-99a marks transition from CI to A [10] and has 10 and 16 targets respectively (overlap=5) (Table 1 and Fig. 1).

For Cardio, the most noteworthy markers are V-Ki-Ras2 Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS); TNF Superfamily Member 10 (TNFSF10) among let-7d and miR-181a; IGF1R among let-7d and miR-99; and TNFRSF11B among miR-181a and miR-132 (Fig. 3A). Examples of common families shared among at least two of these miRNAs include the Ras Homolog Family (RHO) among let-7d and miR-181a; TNFSF among let-7d, miR-132, and miR-181a; DnaJ Heat Shock Protein Family Hsp40 (DNAJ), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) and Frizzled Class Receptor (FZD) among let-7d and miR-99; and the Matrix Metallopeptidase (MMP) family among miR-132 and miR-181a. Further, the Interleukin (IL) family spans across let-7d, miR181a, and miR-132.

For Neuro, the same relationships remain for KRAS and IGF1R with an addition of GRIN2B shared among let-7d and miR-181a and Polymerase RNA II Subunit D (POLR2D) among let-7d and miR-132 (Fig. 3B). miR-132 and let-7d also share members of the SLC family. Let-7d and miR-181a share the “a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif” (ADAMTS) family (Fig. 3B). Further, the G Protein-Coupled Receptor family (GPR) spans across let-7d, miR-132, and miR-99.

miR-151-5p: interactions with let-7d and miR-99 for Cardio and let-7d and miR-181a for Neuro

While not discerning biological sex differences, miR-151-5p is also a strong indicator for overall AD while marking the onset of the Aβ with sexes combined (Table 1) [10]. miR-151-5p has 11 and 32 targets for Cardio and Neuro respectively (overlap=8) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). For Cardio, miR-151-5p shares the Protein Phosphatase (PPP) family with let-7d and miR-99 (Fig. 4A). Also, miR-151-5p targets the muscarinic cholinergic receptor target CHRM2 while let-7d regulates the nicotinic cholinergic receptor target CHRNA7. For Neuro, it is worth noting that miR-151-5p also targets a member of the GRIN family as GRIN1 with noting that let-7d and miR-181a Share GRIN2B as well (Fig.4B). As with let-7d, miR-132, and miR-99, miR-151-5p also shares a GPR family member as GPR173 (Fig. 4B).

miR-23, miR-126-3p, and miR-150: shared mRNA targets

miR-23a/b and miR-126-3p mark overall AD versus Pre-AD through significant downregulation in males only, whereas miR-150 indicates AD for both males and females (Table 1) [10]. For Cardio and Neuro, miR-23 has 20 and 33 targets respectively (overlap=14); miR-126-3p has 9 and 16 targets respectively (overlap=8); and miR-150 has 13 and 17 targets respectively (overlap=10) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). For both Cardio and Neuro, VEGFA and Myosin Heavy Chain 1 (MYH1) emerge as shared among miR-126-3p and miR-150 and miR-23 and miR150 respectively (Fig. 5). miR-23 and miR-126-3p share the Regulator of G-protein Signaling (RGS) and SYT families along the Neuro string (Fig. 5B). It is also worth noting that miR-150 targets GRIN2B and PDGFB as common with let-7d and miR-181a and let-7d only, respectively.

miR-27a and miR-135a: shared targets and interactions with miR-23 for Cardio and Neuro

Although relatively weak indicators of subtle AD pathology progression, miR-27a and miR-135a are decreased in expression in AD versus Pre-AD animals (Table 1) [10]. For Cardio and Neuro, miR-27a has 43 and 62 targets respectively (overlap=29); and miR-135a has 27 and 39 targets respectively (overlap=17) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). For both Cardio and Neuro, the SMAD family is shared among miR-23, miR-27a, and miR-135a with SMAD5 as the most notable (Fig. 6). Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1) and the Myocyte Enhancer Factor (MEF) family (MEF2A and MEF2C) are indicated among miR-27a and miR-135a as well (Fig. 6). Note that miR-126-3p targets a MEF family member (MEF2B) as well (Table 1). The PDE family is shared among miR-27a and miR-135a along with miR-23 (Fig. 6). As unique to Cardio, PKIA is a common target among miR-23 and miR-27 (Fig. 6A). Neuro continues to illustrate the importance of the SLC and GRIN families during AD pathology as shared by miR-27a and miR-135a (Fig. 6B). With a match among miR-27a and miR-135a as SYT3, other AD-marking miRNAs as miR-23, miR-126-3p, and miR-151-5p, miR-27a and miR-135a also share members of the SYT family (Table 1).

miR-133a: interactions with let-7d and miR-99 (Cardio) and let-7d, miR-99, and miR-132 (Neuro)

miR-133a uniquely marks onset of CI in female animals but has limited utility for indicating overall AD pathology (Table 1) [10]. miR-133a has 25 and 45 targets for Cardio and Neuro respectively (overlap=16) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). For Cardio and Neuro, it is notable that miR-133a shares IGF1R with let-7d and miR-99 along with members of the PPP family (Fig. 7). Further, miR-133a shares the PDE family with let-7d, miR-23, miR-27a, and miR-135a (Table 1). A Neuro marker as Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein A (PAPPA) is shared among miR-133a and let-7d (Fig. 7B). In addition, Neuro continues to illustrate the importance of the SLC family for AD pathology among miR-133a, miR-132, and let-7d (Fig. 7B). Further, the SYT family is highlighted as targets of miR-133a as common with miR-23, miR-27a, miR-126-3p, and miR-151-5p (Table 1). Other Neuro markers include Notch Receptor 1 (NOTCH1), RGS8, and Synaptosome Associated Protein 25 (SNAP25) as shared among miR-23 and miR-27a (Fig. 7B).

Other notable miRNAs for AD pathology: miR-690, miR-29c, miR-34b-3p, miR-129-3p, and miR-539

Other miRNAs that indicate AD pathology include miR-690, miR-29c, miR-34b-3p, miR-129-3p, and miR-539 (Table 1) [10]. miR-690 has 5 and 7 targets for Cardio and Neuro respectively (overlap=4) (Table 1). For both Cardio and Neuro, miR-690 shares Ras-related Protein R-RAS 2 (RRAS2) with miR-23 and the Caspase (CASP) family with let-7d, miR-135a, miR-29c, and miR-129-3p. For Neuro only, Intersectin 1 (ITSN1) is shared among miR-690 and miR-181a. miR-29c has 32 and 65 targets for Cardio and Neuro respectively (overlap=24) (Table 1). For both Cardio and Neuro, miR-29c contains prominent markers for AD pathology such as PDGFA and PDGFB. Also, the Cell Division Cycle 42 (CDC42) marker is shared among miR-29c and miR-133a. miR-34b-3p has 4 and 8 targets for Cardio and Neuro respectively (overlap=3), whereas miR-539 has 3 and 6 targets respectively (overlap=2) (Table 1). For Neuro, the Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Type A Receptor Subunit α 4 (GABRA4) marker is shared exclusively among miR-34b-3p and miR-539. Also, both miRNAs have a transmembrane receptor or ion channel target as Purinergic Receptor P2Y1 (P2RY1) and Potassium Inwardly Rectifying Channel Subfamily J member 6 (KCNJ6) respectively. miR-129-3p has 19 and 23 targets for Cardio and Neuro respectively (overlap=11) (Table 1). A noteworthy observation is that miR-129-3p also targets GRIN2B with other AD miRNA pathology markers such as let-7d, miR-135, miR-150, and miR-181a. In addition, miR-129-3p targets the SMAD family as with miR-23, miR-27a, miR-132, and miR-135. miR-129-3p shares KCNJ1 with miR-126-3p and the KCNJ family in general with others as let-7d, miR-135a, miR-151-5p, and miR-539.

miRNAs and respective mRNAs that indicate role of biological sex during Pre-AD or AD

A total of 29 miRNAs distinguish between males or females during Pre-AD and/or AD, whereby 22 do not mark progression of AD pathology itself per se (Table 1) [10]. One of such miRNAs includes the smooth muscle/pericyte-specific miR-145 [12, 18]. Of note, all of the 5 miRNAs that selectively indicate differences in the Young group (miR-99b, miR-101b, miR-133a, miR-204, and miR-377) are higher (p&lt;0.05) in expression in females versus males. For Pre-AD overall, 19 miRNAs (miR-23b, miR-34b-3p, miR-34c, miR-99b, miR-142-5p, miR-145, miR-149, miR-150, miR-200b/c, miR-202-5p, miR-377, miR-423-3p, miR-466g, miR-467f, miR-539, miR-574-3p, miR-1187, miR-1942, and miR-2183) have a higher (p&lt;0.05) expression in females versus males, whereas only 5 (miR-16, miR-22, miR-132, miR-382, miR-451) are lower (p&lt;0.05) in females versus males. Only 2 miRNAs were different in expression among males and females during AD only as miR-125a-5p (females&gt;males) and miR-146a (females&lt;males).

Overall, the most prominent targets for marking biological sex itself include HDAC8, HSPA1A/1B, IL6R, Potassium Calcium-Activated Channel Subfamily M Regulatory β Subunit 1 (KCNMB1), PDGFD, and Rac Family Small GTPase 1 (RAC1) for both Cardio and Neuro; Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) for Cardio only; Arrestin β1 (ARRB1), Cholecystokinin (CCK), CFL2, Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor (CSF1R), Erb-B2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 3 (ERBB3), ORAI2, Retinoic Acid Receptor-Related Orphan Receptor α (RORA), SYT1/2, SCN2B, SIRT1, and Vesicle Transport Through Interaction With T-SNAREs 1B (VTI1B) for Neuro only (Table 4). Note that three members each of the SYT (SYT1/2/4) and SCN (SCN2A/2B/8A) families mark differences among males and females.

Strong, moderate, and borderline mRNA markers for AD pathology and biological sex

The most highly targeted markers across both Cardio and Neuro include the Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN, 11 miRNAs for each) and Transforming Growth Factor β Receptor 2 (TGFBR2, 8 miRNAs), whereby both markers are weak indicators of AD pathology (≤27%) and biological sex differences (≤36%) (Table 2). PDGFB is strong (75%, 4 regulating miRNAs) and SMAD3 is moderate (60%, 5 regulating miRNAs) for AD (Table 3). Other moderate markers for AD throughout both Cardio and Neuro while regulated by 3 miRNAs include CDC42, FGF1, G Protein Subunit Gamma 5 (GNG5), MEF2C, MYH1, PDGFA, and Phospholipase A2 Group IIF (PLA2G2F) (Table 3). “Borderline” AD markers (≈50%) regulated by 4 or more miRNAs include FOXO1, IGF1R, SMAD4/5, Sp1 transcription factor (SP1) and VEGFA (Tables 2 and 3). Note that CDC42, GNG5, IGF1R, MYH1, and VEGFA are all moderate (67%) markers for biological sex as well (Table 4).

For Cardio-specific, PKIA and Ubiquitin Conjugating Enzyme E2 D2 (UBE2D2) are regulated by the most miRNAs (=7) while weak markers for AD pathology overall (43% and 14% respectively) and weak to moderate for biological sex (57% and 43% respectively) (Table 2). TNFRSF11B is strong (75%) for AD and is regulated by 4 miRNAs (Table 3). Moderate Cardio AD markers regulated by 3 miRNAs include the Collagen Type Iα Chain members (COL1A1/A2), an E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase (NEDD4), PDE8B, and Regulator of Calcineurin 2 (RCAN2) (Table 3). Borderline AD markers regulated by 4 miRNAs for both AD and biological sex include Dishevelled Segment Polarity Protein 3 (DVL3) and Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 Subunit α Inhibitor (HIF1AN) (Tables 3 and 4).

For Neuro-specific, GRIN2B and RGS17 are regulated by the most miRNAs (=9), whereby GRIN2B is a moderate (56%) marker for AD pathology in contrast to RGS17 (11%) (Tables 2 and 3) Both GRIN2B and RGS17 are weak markers for biological sex as 44% and 33% respectively. SYT3 is regulated by 4 miRNAs while strong (75%) for AD pathology (Table 3). Moderate markers of AD pathology regulated by 5 miRNAs include CFL2 and SLC6A1. Other moderate markers regulated by 3 miRNAs include ADAMTS14/15, GPR55, KCNJ1, PAPPA, POLR2D, RGS1, and Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein 2 (VAMP2). Borderline markers include ADAMTS2, β-Secretase 1 (BACE1), Ectonucleoside Triphosphate Diphosphohydrolase 7 (ENTPD7), SCN2B, and Versican (VCAN) (Table 3). The SCN (SCN2A/2B/8A) and, except for SYT3, SYT (SYT1/2/4) families generally indicate differences in biological sex (60%–100%) (Table 4). Other sex markers include CFL2 as strong (100%) and SLC6A1, PAPPA, POLR2D, and VAMP2 as moderate (Table 4).

Other strong (100%) markers for AD while regulated by only 2 miRNAs include Activin A Receptor Type 1 (ACVR1C), Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase Regulatory Subunit 2 (PIK3R2), RRAS2, and SMAD9 for Cardio and Neuro; Diaphanous Related Formin 2 (DIAPH2), DNAJB7, and TNFSF10 for Cardio; and ADAMTS12, Fas Cell Surface Death Receptor (FAS), FKBP Prolyl Isomerase 1A (FKBP1A), FosB Proto-Oncogene AP-1 Transcription Factor Subunit (FOSB), GABRA4, Glial Cell Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF), GPR82, ITSN1, Lipase H (LIPH), RGS16, and Stathmin 2 (STMN2) for Neuro.

Markers absent for indicative value among AD pathology and biological sex

The most highly targeted marker that is absent (0%) for AD pathology is the Ras Family Small GTP Binding Protein (RAP1B, 7 miRNAs) (Table 2). Others in this category while regulated by 6 miRNAs include UBE2W (Cardio), H3.3 Histone A/B (H3–3A/B), Ras-Related Protein Rab-9B (RAB9B), and RGS4 (Neuro). All others regulated by at least 4 miRNAs include IL6, GNG10, and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7 and 14 (MAPK7/14) (Cardio and Neuro); Apelin (APLN), and FGF7 (Cardio); and ERBB3, KCNJ2, and POLR2K (Neuro).

For biological sex, absent markers regulated by 4 miRNAs include the apoptosis regulator BCL2-Associated X Protein (BAX), CASP3, FOXO1, and Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase A5 (RPS6KA5) for Cardio and Neuro; Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) for Cardio; and BACE1, Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 1 (S1PR1), and VCAN for Neuro. Markers absent for both AD pathology and biological sex are regulated by 4 miRNAs at most and include ACVR1, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 5 (BMP5), and Ras Related Dexamethasone Induced 1 (RASD1) for Cardio and Neuro; IL10RB for Cardio; and 5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor 1F (HTR1F), Neuronal Differentiation 1 (NEUROD1), and Pro-Apoptotic WT1 Regulator (PAWR) for Neuro.

DISCUSSION

The development of dementia has eluded science and medicine for well over 150 years [32], with AD proper identified by 1910 with presence of visible plaques and/or neurofibrillary tangles in brain histology specimens [33]. It was not until 1980 that at least 100 peer-reviewed studies/year were dedicated to understanding AD and, since then, that number has increased exponentially to currently over 16,000/year for 2022. Recently, focus has shifted for the etiology of AD from primarily a neurological disease to one that involves disruption in healthy neurovascular interactions [2, 26]. There remains a clear need in locating and identifying molecular signatures of AD development from original genetic material as DNA and throughout to post-translational modifications of functional proteins. Our previous work focused on a comprehensive analysis and discussion of cerebrovascular miRNAs in particular that are consistently expressed throughout adulthood in male and female 3xTg-AD mice [10]. miRNAs in general are promising biomarkers due to their novelty in modern molecular biology research while stable in the blood circulation [9]. We found that a select set of cerebrovascular miRNAs were informative for tracking early development of AD pathology [10]. Thus, the current study was an in-depth analysis of the known cardiovascular and nervous system mRNA targets regulated by the cerebrovascular miRNAs that mark onset of AD versus miRNAs that remained stable in expression throughout. In addition, we examined molecular targets that differed among males and females during Pre-AD or AD conditions. There was a significant overlap (≥40%) among Cardio and Neuro pathways and mRNA targets regulated by cerebrovascular miRNAs detected in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice, supporting neurovascular coupling at the molecular level. Prominent mRNA markers indicating AD pathology altogether support excitotoxicity (GRIN2B, SLC6A1, SYT3) coupled with vascular remodeling (e.g., FGF1, PDE8B, PDGFA/B, SMAD3/4/5, VEGFA) and inflammation (TNFRSF11B). Further, differences among males and females center on cardiac function (e.g., SCN2B), neuronal growth and neurotransmission (e.g., NAPG, NTRK3, SCN2A/8A SLC6A1, SYT1/2/4, VTI1B), transcriptional regulation and protection of the proteome (e.g., HDAC8, HSPA1B, SIRT1), and cell cycle/proliferation (e.g., CCNA2, CCND1, ERBB3, FGF16, IGF1R, UBE2G1/V1, VEGFA). Fundamental and translational implications of these findings in the context of AD pathology are further discussed in detail below.

Abundant overlap of targets among the cardiovascular and nervous system pathways: support for neurovascular integration at the molecular level

Regardless of AD pathology, most (≈70%) of the cardiovascular molecular target pool overlaps with that of the nervous system, whereas the vice versa for the nervous system with cardiovascular system is significantly less (≈40%) (Figs. 1 and 2). These data support an enhanced integration of cardiovascular signaling targets with that of the nervous system during conditions of health and disease. As a whole, such overlap is consistent with a revised view that both vascular and neurodegenerative factors are integral to the development of dementia [34, 35].

Prominent miRNAs for marking AD pathology and major common targets

The miRNAs that marked AD pathology were organized into tiers based on points of significance among individual phases of pathological development (Young versus CI versus Aβ versus AβT), overall AD (Aβ and AβT) versus Pre-AD (Young and CI) in accord with biological sex. We sought common targets among each tier as well among all miRNAs that alter in expression with AD versus the others that remain stable. Let-7d, miR-181a, miR-132, miR-99, and miR-151-5p scored the highest with highlights for GRIN2B, IGF1R, KRAS, POLR2D, TNFSF10, and TNFRSF11B (Figs. 3 and 4). Next, the addition of miR-126-3p and miR-150 revealed MYH1 and VEGFA (Fig. 5). miR-23 combined with miR-27a and miR-135a pointed to the SMAD (SMAD3/4/5/9) and PDE (PDE1A/4B/6D/7A/7B/8B) families (Fig. 6) with an emphasis on SMAD3 and PDE8B in particular for AD pathology (Table 3). miR-133a added SLC6A1 with analysis of miR-132 and further illustration of the importance of IGF1R when combined with let-7d and miR-99 (Fig. 7). As the most significant miRNA, let-7d regulates 44% (12 out of 27) of the mRNA targets shared among≥3 miRNAs that best indicate AD pathology (Table 3). Overall, in our hands for 3xTg-AD animals, let-7d is arguably the strongest miRNA marker for AD pathology. This observation is consistent with findings for human subjects [36, 37].

Potential role for cellular excitotoxicity: GRIN family, SLC6A1, and SYT3

GRIN2B is the most prominent marker for the highest number of regulating miRNAs (=9) that coincide with onset of AD pathology (56%). As a whole, 50% (7 out of 14) of the GRIN family members (GRIN1/2A/2B/2C/2D) correspond to miRNAs that alter in expression with AD pathology. The significance of the GRIN family is that they code for NMDA receptor subunits as integral to aberrant neuronal excitation/synaptic plasticity (GRIN2B) [38] and a more recently recognized role for impaired cerebral blood flow regulation (GRIN1) [39] regulated by miR-151-5p during AD pathology. Heightened expression for GRIN2B and SLC6A1 can also coexist during conditions of MCI and AD [40]. Their combined role supports neuroexcitotoxicity as SLC6A1 terminates GABA activity (hyperpolarization/repolarization), thus removing a major brake to membrane excitation (depolarization) while exacerbating the activity of excitatory Ca2+-permeant NMDA receptors sensitive to glutamate [41]. Further, in tandem, SYT3 (Table 3) may also contribute to enhanced high frequency presynaptic exocytosis of glutamate as well [42].

Potential contribution of IGF/IGF1R signaling to AD pathology

Although a borderline indicator of AD pathology progression overall in our hands (Table 3), IGF/IGF1R signaling remains noteworthy as regulated by let-7d, miR-27a, miR-99, and miR-133a. Insulin resistance and dysregulation of IGF/IGF1R signaling have been demonstrated in postmortem brain tissues of humans with a prior diagnosis of AD [43]. Further, small molecule inhibition of IGF1R in the APP/PS1 mouse model (human mutant amyloid precursor protein + presenilin−1) using picropodophyllin attenuates development of AD [44]. With&gt;40 years of studies examining a link between Type II Diabetes (T2D) and AD [45, 46] and a recent sharp increase of T2D in the general population [47], the role of IGF/IGF1R will likely remain as a pertinent target for treatment of dementia for the foreseeable future [48].

Angiogenesis gone awry: PDGF, PDE, SMAD, and VEGF families

As integral to angiogenic signaling, our data point to consistent roles of the PDGF, PDE, SMAD, and VEGF families during development of AD pathology. PDGFB is crucial for pericyte development [49] and PDGFA of the glial vascular unit in particular is associated with late stage AD neuropathology [50]. PDE8B is upregulated in AD brains of human subjects [51]. Further, APP C-terminal fragments can induce a specific increase in PDE8B in vitro in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells [52]. Also, pharmacological inhibition of SMAD3 enhances amyloid clearance from the brains of APP/PS1 mice [53]. Pathological VEGF signaling has also been identified with AD and, in particular, VEGFA can stimulate abnormal angiogenesis in the brain, resulting in capillary stalling and impaired cerebral blood flow [24, 54]. It is worth noting that VEGFA is central to cancer pathology as well, whereby poor-quality vessels are produced with features of irregular, tortuous branching and hyperpermeability [55]. Altogether, cumulative molecular and integrative evidence suggests that enhanced angiogenic signaling is not necessarily favorable for maintaining healthy perfusion of the brain during development of AD and advanced amyloidosis.

Tumor necrosis factor as a therapeutic target

Tumor necrosis family members also play a role in AD pathology in ours tudies (Table 3). As a key example, TNFSF10 is a proapoptotic cytokine regulated by strong miRNA indicators of AD pathology as let7d and miR-181a (Table 1). Indeed, neutralization of TNFSF10 in 3xTg-AD mice using an antibody from 3 to 9 months of age improves cognition while reducing hippocampal amyloid burden and inflammation [56]. As regulated by miR-132, miR-135a, and miR181a, TNFRSF11B (or osteoprotegerin) was a strong indicator of AD pathology in our studies (Table 3). TNFRSF11B has also been identified as a potential therapeutic target for MCI and AD in human subjects with crossover applications as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis [57, 58].

Endothelin signaling and AD pathology

Let-7d regulates Endothelin 1 (EDN1) as a potent vasoconstrictor integral to AD pathology [59, 60]. According to our current data set, endothelin receptor signaling during AD pathology can be delineated by examining the roles of miR-135 [Endothelin Receptor Type A (EDNRA)] and miR-29c (EDNRB). Also, the reader should also bear in mind that EDNRA is also regulated by the stably expressed miRNAs as miR-30a and miR-128 (Table 1).

Role of vascular cell type: Endothelial and smooth muscle/pericyte markers

Levels of “endothelial-specific” miRNAs such as miR-23a/b [12], miR-27a [13, 14], and miR-126-3p [15, 16] are significantly decreased in AD relative to pre-AD animals. miR-27a in particular targets 8 of the strongest AD markers as FGF1, MEF2C, NEDD4, RCAN2, RGS1, SLC6A1, SMAD3, and SYT3 (Table 3). These markers generally encompass vascular growth and contractility. The smooth muscle/pericyte-specific miRNAs such as miR-143 [17] and miR-145 [12, 18] remain stable throughout all animal groups (Table 1) [10]. With the exception of GRIN2B (regulated by miR-143) and IGF1R (regulated by miR-145), neither miRNA regulates mRNA markers of AD (Table 3). As consistent with prior studies [13, 20], these data suggest a selective vulnerability of endothelial cell miRNAs to AD pathology.

miRNAs and their targets indicating biological sex differences

Almost half (27; 44%) of mapped miRNAs indicated statistically significant differences among males and females prior to AD. Further, most (22; 82%) of those miRNAs were significantly higher in expression in females relative to males. With considering that miRNAs are negative regulators of mRNA expression and transcription, this would yield a general downregulation of respective mRNA targets in females more so than males. A key subset of differential markers among males and females as shown in Table 4 include voltage-gated Na+ channels (e.g., SCN2B), synaptotagmins (e.g.,SYT1), and histone deacetylases (HDACs; e.g., HDAC8, SIRT1). SCN2B impairment and/or deletion underlies atrial and ventricular arrhythmias [61], whereas aberrant SCN2A and SCN8A expression/function is related to epilepsy and/or autism spectrum disorder [62]. SYT1 and SYT2 mediate Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release and have been identified as therapeutic targets for syndromic intellectual disability [63] and myasthenia gravis [64] respectively. Thus, it is possible that SYT may regulate different functions in males and females, depending on tissue and cell type, and the presence or absence of sex hormones in accord with animal age and/or pathology. HDACs and their role in protein acetylation have been implicated in an array of neurodegenerative disease pathologies as well such as Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and AD [65]. With regard to females, HDAC8 and SIRT1 in particular are co-regulators of nuclear estrogen-related receptor α expression and its DNA-binding affinity [66]. As a key characteristic of breast cancer, heightened estrogen signaling can increase HDAC8 expression [67], which contributes to aggressiveness of tumor growth and spread in tandem with resistance to chemotherapy [68]. Another interesting observation entails how KCNMB1 [codes for β subunit of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels] was also a strong indicator among males and females. It has been recently demonstrated that depletion of estrogen indeed impairs vasodilatory activity of cerebral arterioles and functional hyperemia of the brain via reduced BKCa channel function [69]. Overall, the precise mechanisms for how biological sex plays a role in setting the stage for early AD pathology remains a ripe topic for future investigation.

Study considerations and future directions

The current study represents an in silico follow-up analysis to an original study [10] that did not examine age and sex-matched B6129SF2/J mice as the background wild-type strain for the 3xTg-AD animals of study. However, we reinforce that the significance of our miRNA data pertains to early development of AD up to 8 months at the oldest age point, whereby cerebrovascular structure [70], neurovascular function [71], and cognition [27, 72, 73] remain relatively stable in wild-type animals. Further, with n-values of 3 per individual study group for males and females, future studies will be required for completely resolving roles of biological sex and/or subtle pathological phases throughout the healthspan/lifespan of the 3xTgAD mouse. Further, note that behavioral features (well-known, characterized) may not necessarily be reflective of comprehensive changes in molecular expression (mostly unknown or unclear) with absolute precision over time. With molecular events likely being the driver of disease, the original histological and behavioral evidence provided a starting point for examining gene profiles during the life of the 3xTgAD mouse.

Based on our current data set for biological sex for example, we will refine focus on early stage disease only in future experiments with transition to cognitive impairment and initial deposits of extracellular amyloid in the brain. As one example, we are interested in how testosterone can potentially upregulate let-7d [74] during early development of AD. With notable roles for markers such as HDAC8 and VEGFA, another future objective is to quantify a potential overlap of preclinical dementia and cancer pathology at the molecular level. All discussed mRNA markers and respective pathways for indicating development of cerebrovascular aging and AD will require thorough experimental confirmation using molecular biology, ex vivo, and in vivo study tools in future studies.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Optimal neurovascular function is required for healthy cognition throughout life, whereby its disruption can set the stage for relatively widespread types of dementia such as AD. The molecular and integrative underpinnings of AD pathology remain poorly understood overall while extremely complex and thereby requiring comprehensive methods of analysis. Based on our original data collected for cerebrovascular miRNA expression throughout the healthspan of 3xTg-AD mice, we conducted an indepth in silico analysis of relevant mRNA markers along cardiovascular and nervous system signaling pathway strings. A total of 61 miRNAs were mapped, whereby most (≈70%) of cardiovascular markers are integrated with the nervous system throughout miRNAs. Common targets among miRNAs that are significantly altered in expression during AD conditions entail those that govern angiogenesis (e.g., PDE, PDGF, and SMAD families) while underscoring molecular markers of cellular excitotoxicity (e.g., GRIN2B, SLC6A1, SYT3) and inflammation (e.g., TNF family). Most differences noted among males and females are prior to AD and center on markers that modulate membrane excitability for cardiac contractility and neurotransmission (e.g., SCN and SYT families), transcriptional regulation and protection of the proteome (e.g., HDAC8, HSPA1A/1B, SIRT1), and cell cycling and proliferation (e.g., ERBB3, UBE2G1/V1). Altogether, these data provide a comprehensive molecular “fingerprint” of the early progression of AD pathology based on neurovascular pathway analyses of cerebral blood vessels in the brain of an animal study model. In such manner, this study may provide valuable information that will successfully inspire and direct future translational and clinical studies of AD using novel vascular miRNA and mRNA targets for diagnosis and therapy.
