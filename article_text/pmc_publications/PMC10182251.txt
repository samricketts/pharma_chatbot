Background:

We studied the effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status and sex on rates of cognitive decline in early- (EO) and late- (LO) onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Method:

We ran mixed-effects models with longitudinal cognitive measures as dependent variables, and sex, APOE ε4 carrier status, and interaction terms as predictor variables in 998 EOAD and 2562 LOAD participants from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center.

Results:

APOE ε4 carriers showed accelerated cognitive decline relative to non-carriers in both EOAD and LOAD, although the patterns of specific cognitive domains that were affected differed. Female participants showed accelerated cognitive decline relative to male participants in EOAD only. The effect of APOE ε4 was greater in EOAD for executive functioning (p &lt; 0.0001) and greater in LOAD for language (p &lt; 0.0001).

Conclusion:

We found APOE ε4 effects on cognitive decline in both EOAD and LOAD and female sex in EOAD only. The specific patterns and magnitude of decline are distinct between the two disease variants.

pmc1 | INTRODUCTION

Presentation and course of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is highly variable. This is especially true when comparing two disease variants—early-onset AD (EOAD; onset &lt;65 years) and late-onset AD (LOAD; onset ≥65 years).1 EOAD is more likely to manifest in atypical cognitive syndromes (i.e., non-amnestic) and appears to be a more rapid and aggressive disease compared to LOAD.2–4 However, factors influencing the trajectory of decline, and whether those factors affect EOAD and LOAD similarly, are currently unclear.

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 variant and female sex are associated with greater AD risk. APOE ε4 is associated with increased brain amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology relative to other APOE isoforms5 and may also lead to tau pathogenesis, neuroinflammation, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration.6 Its frequency is 13% to 15% worldwide, but among individuals with AD, the prevalence increases to upwards of 40%.7,8 APOE ε4 is associated with earlier symptom onset in LOAD, but possibly later symptom onset in EOAD,9 suggesting that is plays a clinically relevant role in the presentation of these disease variants. Regarding sex, females make up approximately two-thirds of LOAD diagnoses10 and tend to carry a higher disease burden, even in preclinical stages.11,12 In LOAD, the interaction between APOE ε4 status and sex suggests that female APOE ε4 carriers are at increased risk of developing dementia compared to male non-carriers.13–15 Thus the role of APOE ε4 and female sex in the risk of developing AD is well established but how they may differentially impact the trajectory of decline is less clear, particularly in EOAD.

Longitudinal studies of cognitive decline in LOAD APOE ε4 carriers versus non-carriers are mixed, with evidence for slower decline,4,16–18 faster decline,19–22 and no differences in rate of decline.23–25 These contradictions may reflect methodological differences in sample size, follow-up time, covariates, inclusion of medical comorbidities, cognitive measurement, and type and degree of cognitive impairment. Many studies do not account for the aforementioned sex differences, including that female APOE ε4 carriers show disproportionate cognitive dysfunction compared to male carriers.13 In addition, focus has understandably been on LOAD (despite some studies including individuals age 50+), and few have sought to directly investigate EOAD or the comparison between EOAD and LOAD (c.f.4,26,27).

Longitudinal studies of sex are more limited but suggest that female participants experience more rapid cognitive decline over time compared to male participants in EOAD and LOAD.24,28–30 Of interest, results are mixed when examining sex and APOE ε4 interactions in LOAD. Although some have found that having the APOE ε4 allele accentuates sex differences and leads to accelerated cognitive decline in LOAD females,29,30 others have not found any effect of APOE ε4 in EOAD or LOAD.24,28

The present study compared trajectories of cognitive decline between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers in EOAD and LOAD. The magnitude of this difference was also compared between EOAD and LOAD to examine the differential effects of APOE ε4 in these disease variants. Given the well-established sex differences in AD, we also examined the impact of sex and the interaction between sex and APOE ε4 status on cognitive decline in both disease variants. Few studies currently exist in the literature that directly investigate EOAD, and even fewer that compare the trajectories of EOAD and LOAD. Those that have been conducted utilize relatively small sample sizes. The present study addresses prior limitations by utilizing a large sample followed over multiple years, including individuals without significant comorbid pathologies, individuals with a wide range of degree and type of cognitive impairment (i.e., mild cognitive impairment [MCI] to later-stage dementia; not only classic amnestic syndrome), and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery measuring global cognition as well as specific cognitive domains.

2 | METHOD

2.1 | Participants

This analysis used data from 36 of 42 past and present Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs), which are part of the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). These data were collected from these ADRCs between September 2005 and January 2021.

ADRCs obtain informed consent from participants during data collection and are maintained by their respective institutional review boards before submitting data to NACC. All eligible ADRC participants are evaluated with the Uniform Data Set (UDS) protocol, and their data are submitted to the NACC.31 Participants undergo yearly in-person or telephone evaluation at the ADRCs, which includes medical, psychiatric, and neurologic histories; neuropsychological batteries; psychiatric and neurological examinations: and the CDR (CDR) Dementia Staging Instrument.32

For the present study, participants who had full UDS testing, APOE genotyping, and a primary diagnosis of MCI or dementia due to probable AD at three or more longitudinal visits were selected from the NACC database (n = 4693 participants, 22,734 visits). All participants had an MCI or dementia diagnosis from first observation. Age at onset was collected during the clinical evaluation by a clinician and was based on informant report of age at onset of symptoms (DECAGE variable from NACC). Participants with significant neurologic and psychiatric comorbid conditions, including severe white matter hyperintensities, other neurodegenerative disorders, stroke within 2 years of age at onset of cognitive decline, hydrocephalus, epilepsy, brain neoplasms, human immunodeficiency virus positivity, psychiatric disorders except depression, cognitive disorder due to systemic disease or medical illness, and alcohol misuse, medication-induced cognitive changes, and traumatic brain injury in the year preceding the onset of cognitive decline were excluded (n = 1109). We then excluded individuals with autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) mutations, and those who were part of a kindred with ADAD or FTD mutations (n = 4) and individuals who had missing symptom onset (n = 20). Finally, we excluded 2861 telephone visits, as they did not include cognitive testing and retained only in-person visits in the analyses. Please see Figure 1 for a breakdown of our participant exclusions. Our final sample consisted of 3560 (75.9%) participants—998 EOAD and 2562 LOAD—and 14,126 visits. The average number of visits for both groups was four (EOAD: mean = 3.8, SD = 1.7; LOAD: mean = 4.0, SD = 1.8). Number of visits ranged from 1 to 12 in EOAD and 1 to 15 in LOAD. The average number of visits occurring before dementia diagnosis was 0.5 (SD = 1.2) in EOAD and 0.7 (SD = 1.4) in LOAD. The average number of visits at or after dementia diagnosis was 3.3 (SD = 1.8) in EOAD and 3.4 (SD = 2.0) in LOAD.

2.2 | Cognitive outcomes

Extensive detail of the ADRC’s neuropsychological test battery in the UDS is described elsewhere.33,34 The present study focused on measuring global cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA], Mini Mental State Exam [MMSE]35,36), language (Boston Naming Test [BNT], Multilingual Naming Test [MINT], [animals and vegetables verbal fluency]37,38), memory (Weschler Memory Scale, 3rd Edition—Revised Logical Memory [WMS-III-R LM] immediate and delayed recall,39 Craft Story immediate and delayed recall40), attention/processing speed (Trail Making Test A [TMT A]), and executive functioning (Trail Making Test B [TMT B]41).

The UDS cognitive battery has changed over time. In UDS3, the MMSE was replaced by MoCA, BNT was replaced by MINT, and WMS-III-R LM was replaced by Craft Story.33 The crosswalk study42 was conducted in 935 subjects who received both new and phased out cognitive tests. The study established good correlations between the UDS2 and UDS3 tests and recommends using predicted measures from individuals who received both tests. We applied these methods to convert UDS2 (MMSE, BNT, and WMS-III-R LM) into predicted UDS3 measures (MoCA, MINT, Craft Story) for our analysis by running linear regression models. Final predicted values that were outside either the minimum or maximum score value were truncated to the minimum or maximum value as appropriate. Raw cognitive scores were used in the regression analyses for conversion. Cognitive data included in the regression analyses were raw scores (actual or predicted based on crosswalk analysis as necessary).

2.3 | Genotyping

NACC, its partners, and the ADRCs work together to track phenotypic data, biologic specimens, and genotypic data from ADRC participants (https://naccdata.org/nacc-collaborations/partnerships). Participants in the present study were selected based on the availability of APOE allele data and grouped based on presence or absence of APOE ε4.

2.4 | Statistical analysis

All analyses were run in SAS version 9.4. T-tests and Fisher exact tests were used to compare baseline demographics and cognitive measures between EOAD and LOAD subjects.

Mixed-effects models with longitudinal cognitive measures as dependent variables were run separately in EOAD and LOAD to assess whether APOE ε4 carrier status or sex affected the rate of cognitive decline in each group. APOE ε4 carrier status, sex, follow-up time, and all interaction terms—specifically APOE*time, sex*time, sex*APOE, and APOE*sex*time—were included as potential predictors adjusting for age, education, and disease severity (CDR-SB [Sum of Boxes]) at baseline. Random intercept and random slopes were included as random effects in each of the models. For models where the three-way interaction (APOE*sex*time) was not significant, a final model was re-run without the three-way interaction. For cognitive measures with significant three-way interactions, we estimated differences in slope estimates between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers for male and female, and between male and female for APOE ε4 carrier and non-carriers, separately.

A second set of mixed-effects models comparing EOAD and LOAD were used to assess group differences in rates of decline between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers and females and males. Full models including a four-way interaction effect of APOE*sex*time*group were fit. Following a non-significant four-way interaction, we removed the four-way interaction and examined the three-way interactions—APOE*time*group, sex*time*group, and APOE*sex*time—to determine whether APOE ε4 status and sex-associated differences in rates of decline were similar between EOAD and LOAD. These models had the same covariates and random effects as the previous models.

From these final models, graphs were created to visualize effects of APOE ε4 on cognition stratified by sex with EOAD/LOAD groups using the mean values for the covariates and CDR-SB = 1 (see Figure 2).

3 | RESULTS

3.1 | Sample characteristics

Demographic and baseline cognitive data in EOAD and LOAD are shown in Table 1. Compared to the EOAD group, the LOAD group was less educated (15.3 vs 14.7 years, p &lt; 0.0001) and had a lower rate of the APOE ε4 allele (60.9% vs 65.6%, p &lt; 0.0089). The EOAD group also had higher rates of dementia diagnosis than did the LOAD group, and correspondingly the LOAD group had higher rates of MCI (p &lt; 0.0001). There were no significant sex differences between groups (p = 1.0000). EOAD and LOAD groups differed significantly by race, which was driven by a greater number of Black and African Americans in the LOAD group. However, both groups were majority White Americans (near 90%). Cognitively, the LOAD group outperformed the EOAD group at baseline on CDR-SB (4.7 vs 5.0, p = 0.0084), MoCA (16.5 vs 15.8, p = 0.0006), and Craft Story immediate recall (7.0 vs 6.7, p = 0.0415). The EOAD group outperformed the LOAD group at baseline on MINT (25.9 vs 23.7, p &lt; 0.0001), semantic fluency (20.9 vs 20.1, p = 0.0172), TMT A (0.58 vs 0.53, p = 0.0011), and TMT B (0.20 vs. 0.18, p = 0.0002). There was no significant difference between groups at baseline on Craft Story delayed recall (p = 0.4665).

3.2 | Effects of APOE ε4 status and sex on rates of cognitive decline in EOAD and LOAD

The results of mixed-effects models in EOAD and LOAD are presented in the supplemental materials (Table S1). No significant APOE*sex*time interactions were detected on any of the cognitive measures for EOAD. As shown in Table 2, EOAD APOE ε4 carriers showed significantly accelerated decline compared to non-carriers on Craft Story immediate (p = 0.0100) and delayed recall (p = 0.0303), semantic fluency (p = 0.0008), TMT A (p = 0.0199), and TMT B (p &lt; 0.0001). EOAD females showed significantly faster decline than males on MoCA (p = 0.0234), Craft Story delayed recall (p = 0.0104), MINT (p = 0.0087), and semantic fluency (p = 0.0330).

In the LOAD group, there was a significant APOE*sex*time interaction for MoCA (p = 0.0094) and Craft Story delayed recall (p = 0.0165). On the MoCA, male APOE ε4 carriers declined at a faster rate than male non-carriers (p &lt; 0.0001), whereas there was no significant difference in rate of decline between female APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers (p = 0.1376). Similarly, on Craft Story delayed recall, male APOE ε4 carriers also declined at a faster rate than non-carriers (p = 0.0443), whereas there was no significant difference in rate of decline between female APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers (p = 0.1705). There were no other significant APOE*sex*time interactions for any other cognitive measures. However, APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers showed significantly accelerated decline on all remaining measures: Craft Story immediate recall (p = 0.0206), MINT (p &lt; 0.0001), semantic fluency (p &lt; 0.0001), TMT A (p &lt; 0.0001), and TMT B (p = 0.0062). A significant sex effect on cognitive decline was shown only on TMT A, in that LOAD females declined significantly faster than males (p = 0.0471).

Figure 2 presents the predicted cognitive declines based on the final mixed-effects models for the four sub-groups formed by combining sex (male, female) and APOE ε4 carrier status (carrier, noncarrier) within EOAD and LOAD, separately adjusting for covariates. Time is defined as years since first visit where individuals were diagnosed with MCI or dementia.

3.3 | Comparing magnitude of accelerated decline in EOAD and LOAD

There were no significant four-way (APOE*sex*time*group) interactions for any of the cognitive measures. For the cognitive tests without significant APOE*sex*time interactions (all but MoCA and Craft Story delayed recall), we compared the difference in APOE effect on cognitive decline between EOAD and LOAD. Both LOAD and EOAD APOE ε4 carriers showed faster decline compared to non-carriers on TMT B. However, the magnitude of the difference in the slope of decline was greater in EOAD compared to LOAD (p &lt; 0.0001; see Table 2). Not surprisingly, given that carrier status did not significantly affect rate of decline on the MINT for the EOAD group, the magnitude of the slope difference was greater in the LOAD than EOAD group (p &lt; 0.0001). Comparison of sex effects between EOAD and LOAD showed a greater magnitude of difference in the EOAD than the LOAD group, with females declining faster on TMT B (p = 0.0029) and MINT (p = 0.0268).

4 | DISCUSSION

Results showed that both APOE ε4 and sex play a role in the trajectory of cognitive decline in EOAD and LOAD. However, they exerted different effects on cognitive decline in the two disease variants.

In the EOAD group, the presence of APOE ε4 and female sex accelerated cognitive decline. APOE ε4 carriers declined more rapidly in memory, executive functioning, and processing speed. However, there was no effect on global cognitive function (i.e., MoCA). Of interest, APOE ε4 did not consistently affect language abilities. Although fluency declined more quickly among carriers, there was no difference in naming. In fact, naming showed the opposite pattern, with non-carriers having a steeper slope of decline (although this was not statistically significant). Given that processing speed was slower among carriers, it is possible that an element of general slowing underlies the greater decline seen in fluency (a speeded test) but not naming (a non-speeded test).

Sex also modified the trajectory of decline. Females declined more rapidly than males in language, delayed memory, and global cognitive function. Thus patients who are female APOE ε4 carriers may be at greatest risk of rapid and earlier decline in functioning in EOAD, placing increased burden on care partners and families in these cases.

Relatively few studies have focused specifically on EOAD. Those that have contradict each other, with some reporting that female sex and APOE ε4 presence do not affect trajectory of decline and others reporting that APOE ε4 carriers show slower decline than noncarriers.4,24,26,27 This contrasts current findings. Several important methodological differences between the present study and previous work may account for these differences. First, some prior work did not compare differences in the slope of the decline of carriers and non-carriers within EOAD. Instead, they compared slopes of decline to LOAD groups (i.e., EOAD vs LOAD APOE ε4 carriers; EOAD vs LOAD APOE ε4 noncarriers4,26). Second, as our study suggests, use of a global cognitive screener, which was used in Yoon et al.,24 who found no difference in rates of decline among APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers, may not be sufficiently sensitive to capture group differences. Of interest, Yoon et al. also found no sex differences in rates of decline on this cognitive screener, which contrasts our findings. It is possible that our larger sample, in addition to inclusion of a wider range of severity of impairment, might account for this discrepancy. Finally, in the only other study to directly compare APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers within EOAD using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, Kim et al.27 found that APOE ε4 non-carriers declined faster than carriers. These results are difficult to reconcile with present findings, but it is worth noting that the present study had a significantly larger sample (998 EOAD/2562 LOAD vs 193 EOAD/496 LOAD), followed participants for longer (48 vs 32 months), included sex in analysis, and had participants with higher education (≥12 years; 69% vs 28%).

In LOAD, APOE ε4 affected the rate of decline in all cognitive domains, including global cognitive function, whereas female sex generally did not accelerate decline. In fact, for global cognitive function and delayed memory, only males showed the APOE ε4 effect. Female LOAD APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers declined at a similar rate. Prior work of the effect of APOE ε4 on the trajectory of cognitive impairment in LOAD is mixed, but our findings generally align with those demonstrating an accelerated decline.19,20,22,43 However, the lack of overall sex effects on rate of cognitive decline in LOAD and the sex*APOE interaction effects showing that male APOE ε4 carriers had the greatest rate of decline, are not generally consistent with previous (although limited) work.29,30 It is possible that because previous studies included an age range that spanned EOAD (e.g., 55+30), they captured the female sex effects that our study suggests are prominent in this group. In addition, it is also possible that because previous work utilized only individuals with MCI at baseline, including individuals who have already advanced to dementia washes out the female sex preference over time.29,30

Our study intentionally included a range of impairment spanning from earliest MCI to moderate dementia in both EOAD and LOAD. Inclusion of a range of cognitive impairment and disease severity may be necessary to observe associations between APOE ε4 status and cognition. Furthermore, floor effects in dementia can make associations difficult to detect.16 The effects of APOE ε4 might be more robust early in the course of disease,21,44 and perhaps even before clinical symptoms may arise.45

Direct comparisons between EOAD and LOAD also highlight some notable differences in the effects of APOE ε4 and sex. The effect of APOE ε4 was stronger for language in LOAD, whereas the effect of APOE ε4 on executive function and the effect of female sex on language were stronger in EOAD. Further work is needed to explore possible reasons for these disease-variant cognitive specificities.

The present study highlights some methodological considerations for past and future work. First, global cognitive function measures such as the MoCA or MMSE may capture the longitudinal decline effects of APOE ε4 and sex in LOAD but may be less sensitive for capturing this APOE ε4–associated decline in EOAD. Use of a more comprehensive neuropsychological battery may be necessary for capturing these declines in this group. Second, a more syndromically diverse sample (i.e., MCI and dementia; inclusion of typical amnestic and atypical non-amnestic syndromes) may have facilitated a broader exploration of associations with non-memory domains. It is still the case that the majority of our sample was amnestic. However, syndromic specificity was captured in the most recent UDS protocol and this small sample shows that ≈17% of EOAD and 11% of LOAD had non-amnestic predominate profiles (e.g., non-amnestic MCI single domain, logopenic primary progressive aphasia, posterior cortical atrophy). In prior work, memory is more consistently associated with APOE ε420,46 compared to other cognitive domains. However, findings from amnestic predominant AD may not generalize to non-amnestic AD presentations,47 which are more common in EOAD.

Our study does not address mechanisms of the accelerated cognitive decline we see with APOE ε4 and female sex. However, others have shown that both are associated with higher degree of pathology. APOE ε4 increases brain Aβ pathology relative to other APOE isoforms5 and may also lead to greater tau pathogenesis, neuroinflammation, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration.6 In EOAD specifically, females have been found to have significantly greater atrophy of the hippocampus; greater tau deposition in the frontal, inferior parietal, and temporal lobes; and greater amyloid deposition globally.48 Further research is needed to characterize whether APOE ε4 and sex influence the association between trajectory of cognitive decline and these potential biological mechanisms.

4.1 | Limitations and strengths

We addressed prior limitations in the field by utilizing a large sample (n = 3560) followed over multiple years and visits (mean &gt; 4 years/visits) and by including individuals without significant comorbid pathologies and known genetic mutations associated with AD and FTD, individuals with a range of degree and type of cognitive impairment (i.e., early MCI to later-stage dementia and non-amnestic syndromes), and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery measuring global cognition as well as specific cognitive domains (memory, language, attention/processing speed, and executive functioning).

However, the current study was not without limitations. It is the first to examine APOE ε4 and sex effects on cognitive decline in EOAD, and because it was an exploratory study, we did not correct for multiple comparisons.49 This study does not address how much of the APOE and sex effects on cognitive decline were age-related and observed in those with normal cognition. Further studies including both AD and cognitively normal individuals would be needed to appropriately address this question. Given that misdiagnosis is not uncommon in AD, lack of pathology-confirmed cases is a limitation. Previous work found that 29% of patients diagnosed with AD showed non-AD pathology postmortem, whereas 39% of those diagnosed as non-AD had AD pathology postmortem.50 Those rates are believed to be higher in EOAD. In addition, disease severity was distributed differently between EOAD (dementia &gt; MCI) and LOAD (MCI &gt; dementia). Because disease stage may play a role in the associations between APOE ε4 and cognition, this difference is potentially meaningful. For this reason, we controlled for disease severity (CDR-SB) in our analyses. We also controlled for age and education, which are known to impact cognition, but we may not have accounted for all important factors.51 Our sample included only individuals from North America who were mostly White and well educated, thereby limiting the generalizability of results. Notably, we were unable to adjust for race and ethnicity in our analyses due to the low sample size in non-White, non-Hispanic/Latino/a groups. This is an important limitation as race-based differences in interactions between APOE and cognition are repeatedly demonstrated (e.g.,52)1. In addition, there are known interaction effects between genetic variation (APOE ε4 or ButyrylCholinesterase K), cholinesterase enzyme inhibitors, and cognition (e.g.,53,54). Unfortunately, our data set did not allow for an examination of these interaction effects, but this is a ripe area for future research.

5 | CONCLUSIONS

The present study demonstrated that trajectory of cognitive decline in sporadic AD varies as a function of sex, APOE ε4 status, and age at onset. These results suggest a potential utility of developing sex and APOE ε4 status–specific timelines of progression in EOAD and LOAD separately. Investigation in other large research consortia such as the Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LEADS55) can further characterize the genetic influences of APOE ε4, sex, and other risk factors on AD, as well as the potential mechanistic pathways that these factors play in cognitive decline, particularly in EOAD.

Highlights

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status and sex differentiate rates of cognitive decline in early-onset (EO) and late-onset (LO) Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

APOE ε4 in EOAD accelerated decline in memory, executive, and processing speed domains.

Female sex in EOAD accelerated decline in language, memory, and global cognition.

The effect of APOE ε4 was stronger for language in LOAD and for executive function in EOAD.

Sex effects on language and executive function decline differed between EOAD and LOAD.

RESEARCHINCONTEXT

1. Systematic review:

We used defined search terms in traditional search engines (e.g., PubMed) and reference sections from prior related works to identify relevant articles. We reviewed the literature broadly because there are few studies that examine factors affecting the trajectory of cognitive decline in early-onset (EO) and late-onset (LO) Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

2. Interpretation:

In a large sample of syndromically diverse patients with sporadic probable AD, our findings highlight the clinical importance of including sex and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 in predicting the trajectory of cognitive decline in AD. In addition, we provide further evidence of disease variance in the patterns of decline in EOAD and LOAD.

3. Future directions:

Investigation in other large research consortia such as the Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) can help further characterize influences of APOE ε4, sex, and other risk factors on AD progression, as well as identify potential mechanistic pathways mediating cognitive decline, particularly in EOAD.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

1 Most of our sample was White non-Latino/a, non-Hispanic−≈80%. Analyses with only White non-Latino/a, non-Hispanic (NHW) participants can be found in supplementary materials (Table S2). These data show generally similar results between all participants and analyses with only NHW. The notable differences are two, new three-way interactions. One is for Craft Story Immediate Recall for EOAD showing that female carriers declined faster than male noncarriers. The other is for the MINT for LOAD showing that female non-carriers declined faster than male carriers, although the graphs of predicted cognitive decline showed that trajectories were fairly consistent across the NHW group and all participant groups (see supplementary materials [Figure S1]).
