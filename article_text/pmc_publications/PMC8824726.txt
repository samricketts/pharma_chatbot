We identify an apolipoprotein E3 variant (APOE3-V236E), named apoE3-Jacksonville (apoE3-Jac), that is associated with healthy brain aging and reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Herein, we resolve the functional mechanism in which apoE3-Jac reduces apoE aggregation and enhances its lipidation in human brains, as well as in cellular and biochemical assays. Expression of apoE3-Jac in astrocytes increases several classes of lipids in the brain including phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, and sulfatide, critical for synaptic functions compared to apoE3. Importantly, mice expressing apoE3-Jac have a reduced amyloid pathology, plaque-associated immune responses, and neuritic dystrophy. The V236E substitution is also sufficient to reduce the aggregation of apoE4, whose gene allele is a major genetic risk factor for AD and DLB. These findings have major implications on how apoE aggregation contributes to disease pathogenesis and nominate a drug targeting strategy by reducing apoE aggregation.


pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a strong genetic component (1, 2). Thus, identifying the genetic factors that protect against dementia and promote healthy brain aging may provide critical biological insights into disease etiology and drug targeting strategies. A previous study of whole-genome sequencing in the Icelandic population identified a variant protective against AD dementia in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP-A673T). Although this APP substitution is extremely rare in other Caucasian populations with a carrier frequency of ~0.006% (3, 4), the implication of a functional effect in reducing the production of amyloid-β (Aβ) is profound. This finding also demonstrates that genes central to disease pathogenesis may also harbor variation that can act to protect against disease onset.

The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the major genetic risk factor for AD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (1, 5, 6), whereas APOE2, a well-established longevity determinant, affords protection against the disease (7, 8). A recent case report showed that an individual who had two copies of the APOE3 Christchurch (R136S) mutation is resistant to autosomal dominant AD (9), likely by reducing apoE interaction with heparin. We previously identified the APOE3-V236E variant to be protective against AD dementia with a population carrier frequency of 0.3% (10). As this study was conducted primarily at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, we now refer to this V236E variant as APOE3-Jacksonville (APOE3-Jac). The variant was found to be associated with markedly reduced risk of AD; however, the mechanism by which this variant protects against AD risk remains unclear. By performing human genetic and pathological analyses, and functional assays in cellular and animal models, we demonstrate that the apoE3-Jac promotes healthy brain aging and decreases amyloid deposition by reducing apoE self-association and increasing lipidation. Importantly, our in vivo results support an association between amyloid plaque-associated apoE, plaque load, and related toxicity, whereas the presence of apoE3-Jac significantly ameliorated these effects. Our findings have vital implications for the role of apoE aggregation in the pathogenesis of AD and DLB, and provide insights into the development of a therapeutic strategy targeting apoE aggregation in dementia.

RESULTS

APOE3-Jac (V236E) variant is associated with healthy brain aging, reduced insoluble apoE and decreased AD pathology

We previously demonstrated that the APOE3-Jac variant is associated with markedly reduced risk of AD (10). To explore the potential protective mechanism of this variant in aging, we performed exome sequencing in a series of autopsy-confirmed exceptional aging individuals (n=46) who were aged over 85 years of age and had minimal brain pathology associated with neurodegeneration. By examining the genes known to play a role in neurodegenerative disorders we again identified APOE3-Jac variant in one of the exceptional aging brains (Fig. 1A) (10). To date, this rare APOE3-Jac variant (0.12%) occurs on the APOE3 backbone and confers a reduced risk of AD (OR = 0.10, 0.03 to 0.45) equal to or superior to the APOE2 allele (OR = 0.46, 0.38 to 0.54). Interestingly, distinct from AD brains, which showed marked global atrophy, the brain carrying APOE3-Jac variant exhibited normal structure even at age above 85 years (Fig. 1B). We subsequently genotyped this variant in two independent series of exceptional-aging individuals (&gt;85 years): a postmortem replication cohort (n=62) and an antemortem positron emission tomography (PET) series of aged individuals who were amyloid negative and neurodegeneration negative (n=45) (Fig. 1C) (11). Significantly, we identified an additional APOE3-Jac carrier in each series giving an overall carrier frequency of 2.0% in our exceptional-aging subjects compared to our control series and previous studies (Table 1).

Additionally, recent genetic studies have also demonstrated a robust association between the APOE4 allele and risk of DLB (6, 12), the second leading cause of dementia in the elderly. To investigate the effect of APOE3-Jac variant in DLB, we assessed the frequency in a series of patients with clinical DLB (n=441) and cases with pathologically-defined high/intermediate likelihood DLB (n=622; Table S1), compared to a clinical control series (n=975). Importantly, the V236E substitution was not observed in any of the DLB patients but was observed in three control subjects (3/975; carrier frequency 0.3%; P=0.11) (Table 1), which although not statistically significant, further supports a protective effect.

Although direct knowledge can be gained from genetic studies, it is critical to resolve the underlying functional mechanism to provide insight into the development of therapeutic strategy which not only protects against AD but also promotes healthy brain aging. The APOE3-V236E substitution is the first disease-associated change located in the C-terminal domain where apoE binds lipids and oligomerizes in biochemical assays. Thus, we analyzed the distribution and dynamic pools of apoE in human brains from age-matched cases with APOE3 or APOE3-Jac variant. The amounts of soluble apoE were not significantly different between brains from APOE3 and APOE3-Jac carriers (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, brain tissues from APOE3-Jac carriers exhibited vastly reduced insoluble apoE, as well as increased ratios of soluble/insoluble apoE (Fig. 1D, E), suggesting that this apoE variant reduces its propensity for aggregation. In addition, soluble Aβ42 levels and both insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were lower in the brains of APOE3-Jac carriers (Fig. 1F, G; Fig. S1A). Furthermore, immunohistochemical evaluation identified typical cored Aβ plaques in the brains of APOE3 individuals, whereas brains with APOE3-Jac variant had either a few diffused, amorphous Aβ deposits or were absent for any plaque pathology (Fig. 1H; Fig. S1B). These results suggest that apoE aggregation status may have a critical impact on amyloid deposition. As apoE co-deposits with Aβ in the amyloid plaques (13–15), we examined and found that the degree of co-localization between apoE and Aβ deposition appeared to decrease in the brains carrying APOE3-Jac variant compared to those from APOE3 (Fig. S1C–F). These results are consistent with the notion that apoE self-aggregation might facilitate Aβ aggregation and deposition, signifying that reduced apoE aggregation in APOE3-Jac carriers might be a critical mechanism for its protective role against the development of AD.

APOE3-Jac (V236E) variant reduces self-association and increases lipidation

Human apoE consists of a receptor-binding region in the N-terminal domain, a lipid-binding region in the C-terminal domain, and a hinge region that links both domains (16). Lipid-free apoE tends to self-aggregate in aqueous solution due to the hydrophobic interaction between amphipathic α-helices in the C-terminal domain (17, 18). The APOE3-Jac variant is localized adjacent to the lipid-binding region and within a region implicated in apoE oligomerization (Fig. 2A). We thus investigated whether V236E substitution alters the aggregation property of apoE3 produced from HEK293 cells using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) run on FPLC. Wild-type (WT) apoE3 was eluted primarily as a single peak with aggregates of 4-6 apoE molecules, whereas the apoE3-Jac variant was eluted as a peak consistent with the size of monomers (Fig. 2B, C). Using chemical cross-linking to preserve protein aggregates, we found that WT apoE3 existed primarily as oligomers compared to apoE3-Jac variant showing monomers (Fig. 2D). ApoE is a heparin-binding protein and the affinity to heparin is typically enhanced upon apoE aggregation due to the presence of multiple epitopes (19, 20). We found that apoE3-Jac variant was eluted at lower NaCl concentrations (~0.45 M), again consistent with a reduction of aggregation compared to WT apoE3 (Fig. S2A–C).

ApoE, critical for brain cholesterol homeostasis and produced primarily by astrocytes, delivers cholesterol and essential lipids to neurons by interacting with members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family (21). Given that the region involved in apoE self-aggregation overlaps with that of lipid binding, we examined the lipid-loading property of apoE3 versus the apoE3-Jac variant by cholesterol efflux assay (Fig. 2E). ApoE3 dose-dependently increased cholesterol efflux from astrocytes derived from Apoe knockout (apoE-KO) mice (Fig. S2D). Significantly, the apoE3-Jac variant was more efficient in promoting cholesterol efflux compared to apoE3 (Fig. 2F). To evaluate whether this variant is also associated with more abundant cholesterol in human brains, we performed immunoprecipitation of apoE under native conditions and found that the cholesterol-to-apoE ratio was higher in the brains with APOE3-Jac variant compared to those with APOE3 (Fig. 2G). SEC analysis also showed that brains carrying APOE3-Jac variant exhibited a trend of higher percentage of apoE that is associated with cholesterol (Fig. S3). Of note, the binding of apoE3-Jac variant to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1), and TREM2 was not altered compared to apoE3 (Fig. 2H; S2E).

Using an established viral mediated gene delivery approach (22), we further investigated how apoE3-Jac expression affects lipid metabolism in vivo. Adeno-associated viruses serotype 8 (AAV8) expressing apoE3 or apoE3-Jac variant under the control of astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter were bilaterally injected into the cerebral lateral ventricles of mice at postnatal day 2 (P2). Brain tissues from the resultant mice were subjected to lipidomics analysis, and a weighted lipid co-expression network was built. Interestingly, blue and turquoise modules which comprise cholesterol, cholesterol ester (CE), phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sulfatide, and cerebroside were positively correlated with apoE3-Jac expression (Fig. S4), suggesting the critical role of apoE3-Jac in lipid metabolism.

ApoE3-Jac (V236E) variant reduces amyloid deposition, and plaque-related toxicity in amyloid model mice

To investigate whether apoE3-Jac variant affects amyloid pathogenesis in vivo, we also established 5xFAD amyloid model mice expressing apoE3 or apoE3-Jac via AAV-mediated gene delivery. The expression level of apoE3-Jac variant was similar to that of apoE3 in the brain although a decreasing trend of apoE3-Jac in the detergent-insoluble fractions was observed (Fig. S5A). Significantly, we found that 5xFAD amyloid model mice with astrocytic expression of AAV-apoE3-Jac variant (FAD/apoE3-Jac) exhibited a reduction in amyloid deposition compared with those expressing AAV-apoE3 (FAD/apoE3) (Fig. 3A). As expected, the Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in the detergent-insoluble (guanidine, GDN) fractions of FAD/apoE3-Jac mice were significantly reduced compared to those in FAD/apoE3 mice (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, we observed a positive correlation between the levels of apoE and Aβ40, as well as between the levels of apoE and Aβ42 in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. S5B), suggesting that the aggregated apoE contributes to Aβ pathology.

Previous studies showed that apoE is co-deposited in senile plaques and plays a crucial role in fibrillar plaque formation (23, 24). Consequently, we examined how apoE3-Jac variant impacts the formation of fibrillar amyloid plaques using Thioflavin S (Thio S) staining. Consistent with the Aβ immunostaining pattern, expression of apoE3-Jac reduced fibrillar plaque load (Fig. 3C). Importantly, we also found that plaque-associated apoE was reduced in mice expressing apoE3-Jac compared with those expressing apoE3 (Fig. 3D). After normalizing to the plaque area, the difference of plaque-associated apoE level was not observed (Fig. S5C), suggesting the reduction of plaque-associated apoE is likely due to the decrease of fibrillar plaques in apoE3-Jac mice. The V236E mutation did not have significant effect on the accumulation of mouse endogenous apoE in Aβ plaques (Fig. S5D).

Furthermore, previous studies showed that the lack of apoE expression impairs plaque-associated microgliosis (24). Thus, we investigated whether expression of apoE3-Jac variant affects the degree of microglial response to amyloid plaques. Intriguingly, mice expressing apoE3-Jac variant exhibited a significant reduction in microglial clustering around Aβ plaques (Fig. 3E) and Thio S-positive fibrillar plaques (Fig. S5E) compared with those expressing apoE3. The total immunoreactivity of Iba1-postive microglia was not significantly different between mice expressing apoE3 or apoE3-Jac (Fig. S5F), suggesting that the apoE effect on microglial function was specific to their responses around amyloid plaques. Furthermore, regression analysis showed that plaque-associated apoE positively correlated with amyloid plaque burden and the numbers of microglia surrounding plaques (Fig. 3F, G). Recent transcriptomics studies identified sub-clusters of disease-associated microglia (DAM) across AD mouse models and human brains with APOE being one of the highly regulated genes (25). We thus examined whether astrocytic apoE3-Jac expression impacts the transition of microglia to DAM phenotype. We found that the level of glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB)-positive DAM surrounding plaques was not significantly different between apoE3 and apoE3-Jac mice (Fig. S6A). Additionally, astrocytic apoE3-Jac expression did not influence the phagocytic function of microglia, as examined by CD68 staining, compared to apoE3 expression (Fig. S6B). We further examined the levels of Iba1-positve microglia and Galectin-3 (Gal-3)-positive DAM surrounding plaques in human brain tissues expressing APOE3/3 or APOE3/3-Jac. We observed a slightly reduced plaque-associated microglia phenotype in APOE3/3-Jac brain (Fig. S6C, D). However, due to the rarity of this variant, and low amyloid burden in APOE3/3-Jac human brain (amyloid deposition was undetectable in 2 out of 3 brain tissues by immunofluorescent staining), additional samples are required for more definitive conclusion. We next examined how astrocytic expression of apoE3 or apoE3-Jac affects astrogliosis and found that FAD/apoE3-Jac mice displayed significantly lower GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes than those in FAD/apoE3 mice in the cortex (Fig. S7A). A significant positive correlation between the immunoreactivity of GFAP and amyloid plaque burden was observed (Fig. S7B), suggesting that astrogliosis is related to Aβ pathology. In like manner, FAD/apoE3-Jac mice exhibited a reduced level of vimentin, an alternative marker for reactive astrocytes, in the cortical region compared to those in FAD/apoE3 mice (Fig. S7C)

Increased plaque-associated neuritic dystrophy, induced by deposits of fibrillar Aβ, has been shown to contribute to cognitive decline over the clinical course of AD (26). Given that FAD/apoE3-Jac mice exhibited significant reduction in fibrillar plaques and plaque-associated microgliosis, we next examined the amyloid-associated neuronal toxicity in these experimental mice by co-immunostaining of Aβ and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), a marker for dystrophic neurites. The FAD/apoE3-Jac mice showed a significant reduction of dystrophic neurites surrounding amyloid plaques compared with FAD/apoE3 mice (Fig. 3H) though no such difference was observed after normalizing to Aβ plaque (Fig. S7D). A positive correlation between plaque-associated neuritic dystrophy and the amount of apoE in the plaques was detected (Fig. 3I). Intriguingly, such correlation was only found in FAD/apoE3 mice, but not in FAD/apoE3-Jac mice when analyzed separately (Fig. S7E). This result suggests that the plaque-associated apoE3, but not apoE3-Jac variant, facilitates amyloid deposition and associated neurotoxicity. Behavioral analysis demonstrated that FAD/apoE3-Jac mice had a trend of improved cognitive function compared to FAD/apoE3 mice without influencing anxiety-related behaviors (Fig. S8).

Human AD brains with APOE4 genotype exhibit more aggregated apoE, the level of which correlates with increased Aβ aggregation

As stated, APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD (5, 27). To gain insight into the aggregation status of apoE4 in AD, we examined the distribution of apoE in a large AD pathological cohort with different APOE genotypes (n=469, Table S2). Importantly, we showed that apoE levels were increased in detergent-insoluble formic acid (FA) fractions but decreased in TBS-soluble fractions, in an APOE4 gene dose-dependent manner (Fig. S9A). The ratios of insoluble to soluble apoE were highest in patients homozygous for APOE4 and lowest in APOE4 non-carriers (Fig. S9B, C). In addition, the insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were higher in patients with higher insoluble apoE (Fig. S9D). These results imply that the increased aggregation propensity of apoE4 may facilitate Aβ aggregation and deposition in AD.

V236E substitution is capable of reducing apoE4 self-association and promoting cholesterol efflux

To investigate whether the V236E substitution can also alter the aggregation property of apoE4 when introduced onto the APOE4 backbone, we examined the sizes of WT apoE4 and apoE4-V236E (apoE4-Jac) by SEC. In contrast to apoE4, which existed primarily as oligomers, a major monomeric peak and a minor oligomeric shoulder were detected for apoE4-Jac (Fig. 4A). Cross-linking analysis further demonstrated that apoE4 existed primarily as aggregates, while apoE4-Jac was mostly monomeric (Fig. 4B–C). In addition, apoE4-Jac exhibited a lower affinity to heparin and showed reduced aggregation upon cross-linking (Fig. 4D–F). We also performed analytical ultracentrifugation experiments to determine the molecular weights of bacterially expressed apoE4 and apoE4-Jac. Importantly, apoE4 was shown to have greater tendency to aggregate and existed primarily as tetramers (28, 29), whereas apoE4-Jac variant consisted mostly dimers even when a high concentration of apoE (30 μM) was used (Fig. S10A). In addition, apoE4-Jac exhibited an increased cholesterol efflux capacity compared to apoE4 (Fig. S10B). Finally, we showed that co-expression of apoE3-Jac with apoE3 in HEK cells decreased the levels of oligomeric apoE3 examined by SEC (Fig. S11A). In like manner, co-expression of apoE3-Jac with apoE4 reduced the capacity of apoE4 to oligomerize (Fig. S11B).

DISCUSSION

As we move into the era of precision medicine defined by the variation within the genome of individuals, identifying and resolving the protective variants and underlying mechanisms of successful aging may be more critical than understanding the role of pathogenic mutations. Specifically, from the perspective of clinical genomics, determining the susceptibility of a patient for a given disease will depend on the combination of both risk and protection conferred by specific genetic variation. Thus, the interpretation of risk from APOE may ultimately depend on the overall assessment at the locus, rather than the simple presence or absence of the APOE ε4 or ε2 allele alone.

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and DLB, are often characterized as diseases of protein aggregation (30–33). A recent case report found that an individual carrying two copies of the APOE3-Christchurch (R136S) mutation did not develop AD three decades after the expected disease onset (10). This APOE3-Christchurch carrier has a high amyloid load but less tau pathology. Biochemical analysis showed a vastly reduced affinity of this apoE variant to heparin which has been implicated in multiple Aβ- and tau-related pathogenic pathways (34, 35). Our study demonstrates that apoE3-Jac protects against AD and related dementia, and promotes healthy brain aging by reducing its self-aggregation, leading to decreased amyloid plaques and related toxicity, as well as enhanced lipidation. The identification of protective factors that occur normally in the population provides direct insight into the pathophysiology of the disease and can nominate novel therapeutic avenues. Notably, the apoE3-V236E substitution is the first AD-associated variant within the C-terminal domain, a region critical for apoE oligomerization and lipidation (10, 36). Though the protective APOE3-Jac variant was found to reside in the APOE3 backbone in the carriers, our study demonstrated that V236E substitution is also sufficient to reduce apoE4 aggregation and increase cholesterol efflux. Thus, learning from nature, compounds targeting apoE self-aggregation might reproduce the protective effects of the APOE-Jac variant.

Brain is highly enriched in lipid contents; the deficits of lipids have been implicated in the pathophysiology of AD (37, 38). We show that reduced aggregation of the apoE3-Jac correlates with increased lipidation both in human brains and in biochemical assays, suggesting that apoE aggregation is linked to reduced lipid carrying capacity. Brain lipids transported by apoE/lipoprotein particles have been shown to play critical roles in neuronal membrane homeostasis and synaptic functions (21). Brain lipidomics analysis indicates that apoE3-Jac expression increases several classes of lipids, such as PS, PE, sulfatide, cerebroside and PA, which are important to cognitive functions (38–40). ApoE was shown to regulate the metabolism of sulfatide whose depletion was observed in the early stages of AD and amyloid model mice in an age-dependent manner (41, 42). Decreases of major lipid species (i.e., PA, PC, PE, PS and sulfatide) were previously observed in AD APOE4 carriers (43). In addition, several studies have demonstrated that increasing apoE lipidation, either through genetic or pharmacological approaches, promotes Aβ clearance and improves cognitive performance in mice (27, 44, 45). Thus, the protective effect of apoE3-Jac may be attributed to its increased lipid-loading property, leading to its superior role in brain lipid metabolism and healthy brain aging. Imperatively, the aggregation propensity of apoE likely influences its lipidation capacity (22), as dissociation of apoE oligomers to monomers appears to be required for lipid binding to the protein (46). In addition, lipid-poor apoE has been suggested to have greater susceptibility to aggregation, which may impair Aβ clearance and promote Aβ deposition (22). Our in vivo study demonstrates that expression of apoE3-Jac in an amyloid mouse model decreases the association of apoE with amyloid plaques, which may in turn reduce amyloid deposition as well as plaque-associated microgliosis and resultant neuronal toxicity. It is also possible that mice expressing apoE3-Jac exhibit fewer Aβ deposits due to less apoE aggregation and plaque seeding, whereas each plaque has similar relative amount of apoE. ApoE3-Jac may also result in a different subtype of the amyloid deposits or affect amyloid morphology. It is difficult to distinguish whether apoE self-aggregation alone, apoE-Aβ aggregation, or both is the initial driving force for AD disease progression. The assessments of apoE-Aβ aggregates at the end stage of amyloid development may not fully recapitulate the apoE effects on Aβ seeding at the initial stage (47). Additional studies are needed to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which apoE and its variants mediate Aβ aggregation and deposition.

Although we did not observe a significant difference in the amount of GPNMB+ microglia surrounding plaques between apoE3 and apoE3-Jac mice, we observed a reduction in Iba1+ microglia and Gal-3+ microglia in one human brain carrying APOE3-Jac. Because the amyloid plaque level was undetectable in the other two APOE3-Jac human brains, we could not perform quantitative analysis. It will be interesting to further investigate whether astrocytic expression of apoE3-Jac generates certain types of amyloid deposits that elicit an attenuated microglial response. Alternatively, apoE3-Jac secreted by astrocytes may interact with microglia impacting their responses to the Aβ plaques. In summary, our study uncovers a potential pathogenic mechanism of aggregated apoE as well as the plaque-associated microglial responses and neurotoxicity, supporting that pharmacological targeting of apoE aggregation should be explored as a therapeutic strategy for AD and related dementias.

Due to the relatively low frequency of the APOE3-Jac variant (MAF, 0.12%) and its existence in the oldest-old individuals with minimal AD pathology, one limitation of our analysis using human brains is the small sample size. Replication will be required in much larger cohorts. Interestingly, a recent population study from Denmark performed APOE sequencing and re-genotyping in 105,597 subjects (48). The APOE3-Jac variant was associated with a reduced risk of developing dementia, with a hazard ratio of 0.30 and a p-value of 0.09 that approaches statistical significance. This large population-based study further supports the protective nature of APOE3-Jac against general dementia and promotion of healthy aging. Our data showed that amyloid model mice expressing apoE3-Jac had a trend of improving cognitive performance compared to those expressing apoE3. Though such a beneficial effect of apoE3-Jac on cognition was not apparent in mice at 4 months of age, this effect may be more prominent with aging which warrants further investigation. The validation of rare variant association is one of the challenges for future sequencing studies and the frequency of APOE3-Jac variant in databases such as gnomAD is very low (MAF 0.001; which may reflect the disease phenotype of many of those subjects). Nevertheless, our functional studies clearly define an anti-aggregation property of this apoE variant. The beneficial effects of the apoE3-Jac variant likely represent a major molecular mechanism by which it promotes healthy brain aging and reduces the risk for AD.

In summary, apoE3-Jac represents one of the critical apoE variants that gain a functional advantage over the common isoforms, conferring protection against AD and DLB, by promoting dementia-free prosperous brain aging. Our findings have major implications in understanding apoE-related disease pathogenesis and in designing mechanism-based, apoE-targeted therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects

Neuropathologically-defined exceptional-aging brains (≥ 85 years) were obtained from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank. Individuals who did not have neurodegenerative disease diagnosis (e.g. AD, DLB, frontotemporal lobar degeneration), were cognitively normal prior to autopsy, and had available frozen tissue, were selected. A test set was selected for exome sequencing from the aging cohort (n=46/108) and the remaining cases were used for validation (n=62/108). An autopsy-confirmed cohort of aged AD cases (≥ 85 years) who had available frozen tissue were additionally screened (n=392).

Neuroimaging-defined exceptional-aging and AD cohorts were obtained from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and Mayo Clinic Study of Aging research cohorts. Study participants were selected for inclusion if they had both PiB-positron emission tomography (PET) and FDG-PET scans, and were above the age of 85 at the time of scanning. Exceptional aging was defined as ≥ 85 years, cognitively normal, PiB-PET negative (Aβ plaque negative), and FDG-PET negative (when using glucose hypometabolism as a surrogate marker of neurodegeneration). We used a PiB-PET cut-off point of &gt;1.40 standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) normalized to grey/white matter of the cerebellum (49). The FDG-PET cut-off point was &lt;1.32 SUVr normalized to pons and cerebellar vermis (50). The AD cohort was defined as ≥ 85 years, clinically possible or probable AD, PiB-PET positive, and FDG-PET (neurodegeneration) positive. For biochemical analyses, APOE3 (n=8) and APOE3-Jac (n=3) postmortem frontal cortex samples from those with normal clinical diagnoses and minimal amyloid or tau pathology were used. Average age of the subjects was 90.13 ± 2.8 years and was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.90).

The DLB series are a combined series of clinical DLB (n=441) and pathologically defined (n=622) and were collected at the Mayo Clinic Florida and Rochester (see supplemental Table 1); 975 clinical controls subjects with no signs of neurodegenerative disease or family history were recruited at Mayo Clinic Florida.

Genetic Analysis

For performance of exome sequencing and screening of the APOE3-Jac variant, DNA was obtained from frozen brain tissues with standard protocols. Exomes were captured using Agilent’s SureSelect Human All Exon V4 plus UTRs kit. Massively parallel shotgun sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument. Raw paired-end reads of length 101 bp were mapped to hg19 by Novoalign V2. The numbers of mapped reads ranged from 63 million to 139 million, giving as least 20X read coverage for more the 80% of the capture region of all samples. SNPs were called by GATK HaplotypeCaller, and were assigned quality scores by VQSR, a tool from GATK. Qualified SNPs were annotated with additional information including mutation type, population frequency and predicted function. Each of the replication cohorts and DLB patients were genotyped for the APOE3-Jac variant (single nucleotide polymorphism rs199768002 T/c). The APOE3-Jac genotype was established using a custom TaqMan assay in an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System with 384-Well Block Module (Applied Biosystems, California, USA).

Site-Directed Mutagenesis

Human apoE3 and apoE4 plasmids were a kind gift from Dr. Mary Jo LaDu at the University of Illinois, Chicago. ApoE3-Jac and apoE4-Jac variants were generated on the backbone of apoE3 or apoE4, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis using QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The introduced mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Mice

Apoe-KO mice were purchased from Taconic. 5xFAD (B6SJL) transgenic mice were purchased from Jackson Lab. Genotyping was performed according to the vendor’s instructions. All animals were housed under standard laboratory conditions in ventilated cages on 12-hr light:dark cycles in a pathogen-free environment. All animal procedures were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Viral vector construction and production, intracranial injections in neonatal mice

The AAV8-GFAP-apoE3 and AAV8-GFAP-apoE3-Jac vector construction and virus production were performed by the Hope Center Viral Vectors Core at the Washington University School of Medicine; AAV8 virus intracranial injection in neonatal mice was performed as previously described (22). Briefly, postnatal day 2 (P2) mice were cryo-anesthetized on ice for 5 min and injected intracerebroventricularly with 2 μl of virus (~1013 viral particles/ml) into both hemispheres using a syringe (Hamilton) with a 30 gauge needle (Hamilton). All injected animals were then returned to their mothers for further recovery. Both male and female mice were used for the experiments.

Cholesterol Efflux Assay

The preparation of BODIPY-cholesterol and cholesterol efflux assay was performed as previously described (51), with minor modifications. Briefly, primary astrocytes from Apoe-KO mice were labeled with BODIPY-cholesterol by incubating cells with labeling medium (phenol red-free DMEM) containing CD/BODIPY-cholesterol/unlabeled cholesterol for 1-1.5 hr. After washing, Apoe-KO cells were equilibrated with DMEM containing 0.2% BSA, ACAT inhibitor and cAMP (0.3 mmol/L) for 16-18 hr. Cells were then washed and incubated with phenol red-free DMEM media containing equal amounts of purified human apoE3, apoE4 or apoE3-Jac, apoE4-Jac as cholesterol acceptors for 4 hr. The efflux media and RIPA cells lysates were collected, and the fluorescence intensity was measured using a microplate reader (excitation 482 nm, emission 515 nm). Baseline corrected cholesterol efflux correspond to the ratio of fluorescence in media to total fluorescence.
