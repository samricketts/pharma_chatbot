The mechanisms by which the apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOEε4) allele influences Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiological progression are poorly understood. We tested the association of APOEε4 carriership and amyloid-β (Aβ) burden with longitudinal tau pathology. We longitudinally assessed 94 individuals across the aging and AD spectrum who underwent clinical assessments, APOE genotyping, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography (PET) for Aβ ([18F]AZD4694) and tau ([18F]MK-6240) at baseline, as well as a 2-year follow-up tau-PET scan. We found that APOEε4 carriership potentiates Aβ effects on longitudinal tau accumulation over two years. The APOEε4-potentiated Aβ effects on tau-PET burden were mediated by longitudinal plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 (p-tau217+) increase. This longitudinal tau accumulation as measured by PET was accompanied by brain atrophy and clinical decline. Our results suggest that the APOEε4 allele plays a key role in Aβ downstream effects on the aggregation of phosphorylated tau in the living human brain.

pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles1,2, which are the main suspects of promoting neuronal loss and cognitive impairment3. Although the ε4 variant of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the main genetic risk factor for sporadic AD4-7, it is still poorly understood how the APOEε4 allele impacts the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative condition8. Interestingly, rather than just driving the increase of Aβ burden9, recent observations have implicated the APOEε4 allele in potentiating the downstream effects of Aβ burden on cognitive deterioration10-12. In addition, evidence from animal studies indicates that the APOEε4 allele might influence the association of Aβ with cognition by contributing to tau pathogenesis13-15. Accordingly, cross-sectional human investigations have suggested an interaction of APOEε4 and Aβ on tau pathology16-18. Tracking the longitudinal association of APOEε4 and Aβ pathology with tau pathology progression in living individuals is a critical next step to better understand the multifaceted role of the APOEε4 allele in the development of AD pathophysiology and may provide insights into the biological definition of the disease3.

In the present study, we used imaging and fluid biomarkers for the quantification of Aβ burden and tau pathology progression to test the hypothesis that APOEε4 carriership potentiates the deleterious Aβ effects on longitudinal tau-PET accumulation. We also aimed to investigate whether tau phosphorylation mediates APOEε4-potentiated effects of Aβ pathology on the deposition of tau aggregates. In addition, we assessed whether the aforementioned effects were associated with neurodegeneration and clinical deterioration.

Results

We studied 94 individuals (62 CU older adults, 25 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 7 with sporadic late-onset AD dementia) with baseline and follow-up tau-positron emission tomography (PET; mean [SD] follow-up, 2.3 [0.5] years). Extended Data Fig. 1 reports the selection of study participants. Demographic characteristics of our population (55 to 85 years) are shown in Supplementary Table 1. There was no statistically significant difference between CU older adults, MCI, and AD dementia individuals regarding age, sex, years of education, APOEε4 status, or time of follow-up. At baseline, higher plasma p-tau217+ levels were significantly associated with Aβ positivity (P &lt; 0.0001) and tau positivity (P &lt; 0.0001) but not with APOEε4 status (P = 0.097).

APOEε4 and Aβ+ coexistence is related to tau-PET accumulation

The annual change in tau-PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was assessed across the four groups defined at baseline based on APOEε4 and Aβ statuses (APOEε4 noncarriers or carriers and Aβ− or +). Average voxel-wise maps revealed that Aβ+ APOEε4 carriers presented higher and more widespread tau-PET SUVR increase in relation to the three other groups (Fig. 1). Analysis of covariance confirmed that the Aβ+ APOEε4 carrier group had significantly higher rates of temporal meta-region of interest (ROI) tau-PET SUVR change as compared to all other groups (vs. Aβ− APOEε4 noncarrier: P = 0.0004; vs. Aβ− APOEε4 carrier: P = 0.0006; vs. Aβ+ APOEε4 noncarrier: P = 0.0007; Fig. 2a). By contrast, no significant differences were observed among the Aβ− APOEε4 noncarrier, Aβ− APOEε4 carrier, and Aβ+ APOEε4 noncarrier groups (P ≥ 0.867; Fig. 2a). Logistic regression further supported that only the concomitant presence of Aβ+ and APOEε4 carriership was associated with higher odds of being classified as tau accumulator (P = 0.011; Fig. 2b and c; Supplementary Fig. 1a).

APOEε4 potentiates Aβ effects on tau-PET accumulation

We next tested the interaction and main effects of APOEε4 status and global Aβ-PET burden on longitudinal tau accumulation as measured by PET. ROI-based linear regression analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between APOEε4 and global Aβ-PET load on tau-PET SUVR increase in the temporal meta-ROI (β = 0.040, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.017 to 0.062, P = 0.0009; Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 2). Analysis of variance confirmed that the model with the interaction term best described the association of APOEε4 and Aβ-PET with longitudinal tau-PET as compared to the reduced model including APOEε4 status plus Aβ-PET SUVR (P &lt; 0.001). We next investigated the topography of the interaction effects of APOEε4 and Aβ on longitudinal tau-PET tracer retention across the brain. Voxel-wise linear regression analysis demonstrated that the interaction between APOEε4 carriership and global Aβ-PET burden was significantly associated with higher tau-PET SUVR increase in classical brain regions of tau tangle deposition, such as temporoparietal areas (Fig. 2e). Notably, APOEε4 and Aβ joint effects were mainly observed in neocortical areas comprising Braak III-VI (Fig. 2f). Similar findings were observed in sensitivity analyses including APOEε2 carriers (Extended Data Fig. 2). Exploratory analysis testing gene-dose associations are reported in Supplementary Table 3. Additional exploratory analysis conducted in the subgroup on non-demented participants is presented in Extended Data Fig. 3.

APOEε4 impacts Aβ effects on tau-PET via tau phosphorylation

We investigated whether pathological tau phosphorylation, assessed longitudinally with plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 enhanced by additional phosphorylated sites (p-tau217+), could explain APOEε4 and Aβ interaction effects on 2-year tau deposition as measured by PET. We found that the interaction between APOEε4 carriership and global Aβ-PET burden was associated with longitudinal plasma ptau217+ increase (β = 0.020, 95% CI 0.009 to 0.032, P = 0.0005; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 5). Analysis of variance further supported the adequacy of the interaction model in comparison to the to the reduced model including APOEε4 status plus Aβ-PET SUVR (P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, plasma p-tau217+ change was significantly related to tau-PET SUVR change in the brain regions showing APOEε4 and Aβ interaction effects on longitudinal tau-PET (β = 0.048, 95% CI 0.032 to 0.064, P &lt; 0.0001; Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 6). Tau-PET accumulators presented significantly higher rates of plasma p-tau217+ increase than non-accumulators (Extended Data Fig. 4). Mediation analyses showed that Aβ-PET burden effects on 2-year tau-PET SUVR increase occurred through the longitudinal increase of plasma p-tau217+ levels in APOEε4 carriers (direct pathway: P = 0.104; indirect pathway: P = 0.040) but not in APOEε4 noncarriers (direct pathway: P = 0.910; indirect pathway: P = 0.490; Fig. 3c and d).

Brain atrophy and clinical decline parallel tau-PET accumulation

We assessed whether longitudinal tau accumulation as measured by PET was accompanied by brain atrophy (indexed by cortical gray matter [GM] density) and clinical deterioration (assessed with the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes [CDR-SB] score). We found that tau-PET SUVR increase was associated with higher rates of cortical brain atrophy (β = −0.0010, 95% CI −0.0017 to −0.0003, P = 0.008; Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 8). Tau-PET SUVR increase was also associated with higher rates of clinical decline (β = 0.212, 95% CI 0.108 to 0.315, P = 0.0001; Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 9). In analyses restricted to cognitively impaired individuals, we also observed that tau-PET SUVR increase was significantly associated with higher rates of brain atrophy (β = −0.0014, 95% CI −0.0025 to −0.0003, P = 0.014; Supplementary Table 10) and clinical deterioration (β = 0.236, 95% CI 0.048 to 0.424, P = 0.016; Supplementary Table 11).

Discussion

The results from the present study support that the APOEε4 genotype potentiates Aβ effects on the longitudinal brain accumulation of tau aggregates through pathological tau phosphorylation. This longitudinal tau deposition was paralleled by higher rates of brain atrophy and clinical deterioration.

APOEε4 carriership potentiated Aβ effects on tau accumulation over two years across the AD spectrum. Our results are supported by previous neuropathological evidence showing that the association between APOEε4 and tau tangles is stronger in the presence of Aβ pathology17. Recent cross-sectional clinical studies also reported that APOEε4 modulates the association of Aβ and tau in individuals across the AD continuum16,18. Here, we built on these observations by providing evidence that the APOEε4 allele accentuates Aβ effects on the subsequent, longitudinal accumulation of phosphorylated tau into insoluble tau aggregates. It has been reported that Aβ deposition is more closely related to cognitive decline10-12 in APOEε4 carriers than in APOEε4 noncarriers. Our results suggest that this observation may be explained by the fact that APOEε4 potentiates Aβ effects on tau aggregation, which in turn promotes neurodegeneration and clinical decline. Here, we propose that, beyond its well-established contribution to Aβ aggregation9, APOEε4 also modulates Aβ effects on tau pathology. This concept is supported by a recent animal study showing that the removal of neuronal ApoE4 mitigates tau pathology19. Altogether, these findings have important implications for the design of future anti-Aβ and/or anti-tau clinical trials. It reinforces the importance of the screening for both APOEε4 and Aβ statuses as enrollment criteria to identify individuals at higher risk of short-term tau accumulation. Furthermore, our findings also support that the development of combination therapies targeting both ApoE4 and Aβ pathology might have the potential to synergistically halt tau progression in AD.

Our results support that APOEε4 carriage potentiates Aβ-dependent tau aggregation in neocortical regions comprising Braak III-VI. Accumulation of tau tangles in the medial temporal cortex can be often found in cognitively intact individuals20,21, whereas widespread accumulation over the neocortex is usually related to dementia symptoms22-24. Although it has been widely proposed that Aβ pathology triggers the spread of tau over the neocortex25, transcriptomic data demonstrated that APOE expression also has a pivotal role in tau spreading26. Our findings corroborate both these notions, suggesting that the APOEε4 allele catalyzes the Aβ-dependent spread of tau aggregates outside the temporal lobe. This is in line with cross-sectional imaging studies showing APOEε4 and Aβ joint effects on tau deposition in regions outside the temporal cortex16,27,28. Additionally, the APOEε4-potentiated Aβ effects on neocortical tau deposition were associated with brain atrophy and clinical decline, which further support that this phenomenon is a key factor in the development of dementia23,24.

Recent investigations have demonstrated the presence of Aβ-independent effects of the APOEε4 genotype on medial temporal tau burden28-30. Together with our results, this corroborates the notion that the APOEε4 allele influences AD pathogenesis through distinct pathways. While the Aβ-independent contribution of APOEε4 to tau accumulation is restricted to the medial temporal structures, it exacerbates neocortical tau aggregation via Aβ-dependent mechanisms. Therefore, our study enriches an evolving framework in which APOEε4 presents heterogeneous consequences in AD development.

We observed that APOEε4-potentiated Aβ effects on tau accumulation occurred through pathological tau phosphorylation, which was assessed with plasma p-tau217+. Initially, fluid p-tau and tau-PET have been proposed to be interchangeable biomarkers for detecting tau pathology3. In opposition to this concept, more recent studies demonstrated that fluid p-tau usually becomes abnormal prior to tau-PET positivity31-34, with substantial changes already in preclinical AD stages35,36. In this context, p-tau biomarkers have been proposed to be more closely related to brain Aβ than to tau deposition37. It is believed that during AD progression, tau protein becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to Aβ pathology and, subsequently, aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles38. Therefore, a reasonable explanation for the temporal difference between fluid and imaging tau biomarkers is that they assess different biochemical pools of hyperphosphorylated tau, while plasma fluid p-tau biomarkers measure soluble and non-aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau fragments, tau-PET detects insoluble tau deposits39. Our results support this evolving framework in which tau protein undergoes pathological phosphorylation in response to Aβ pathology and, subsequently, this hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates as neurofibrillary tangle39. In addition, we found that this phenomenon explains, at least partially, the biological underpinnings of APOEε4 and Aβ joint effects on tau deposition. Taken together with animal and in vitro studies showing that ApoE4 expression increases tau phosphorylation40,41, these observations reveal a model in which APOEε4 is an important player in tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation.

Methodological limitations of the present study should be considered to interpret our results. Some of our analyses used thresholds to define biomarker positivity. Thresholds are always subject to conceptual and analytical idiosyncrasies as biomarkers naturally provide continuous values. Therefore, the use of different approaches to defining threshold values could change some of our findings. A potential source of self-selection bias is the fact that the study population was composed of volunteers motivated to participate in a study about dementia. Our study population had a limited number of APOEε4 homozygotes, which limited the analysis of gene-dose relationships. It would be highly desirable to further explore potential APOEε4 gene-dose effects on the association between Aβ and tau pathologies in a populational-based cohort with a higher sample of APOEε4 homozygotes. Our statical models suggested that the APOEε4-dependent Aβ effects on longitudinal tau deposition were mediated by the concentrations of p-tau217+. Although this suggest potential causal relationships that are in accordance with previously proposed biological models of disease progression31,42,43, mechanistic studies are needed to examine this further. Finally, future multicenter studies with longer follow-up intervals and multiple time points are needed to better characterize the temporal relationships between APOEε4, Aβ, and tau across the AD spectrum.

To conclude, our results reveal that the APOEε4 genotype potentiates Aβ deleterious effects on tau phosphorylation and aggregation in AD.

Methods

Participants

Data were derived from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) cohort (https://triad.tnl-mcgill.com), an ongoing longitudinal and prospective study of aging and AD. Study participants were recruited from the community or the McGill University Research Centre for Studies in Aging through advertisements, printed materials, word of mouth, and referrals. Individuals were not eligible for inclusion if presenting inadequate visual and auditory capacities for neuropsychologic assessment, inability to speak English or French, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or PET safety contraindications, recent head trauma, major surgery, active substance abuse, or inadequately treated neurological, psychiatric, or systemic conditions. All study participants provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Montreal Neurological Institute PET Working Committee and the Douglas Mental Health University Institute Research Ethics Board (IUSMD-16-60). Participants received compensation commensurate with the number of study procedures completed and the duration of participation.

Our cohort consisted of TRIAD participants across the aging and AD clinical spectrum who underwent clinical assessments, APOE genotyping, MRI, Aβ-PET, and tau-PET at baseline, as well as a follow-up tau-PET at least 1.5 years after baseline. CU individuals had a global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0 and no objective cognitive impairment. Participants with MCI had a global CDR score of 0.5, subjective and objective cognitive impairments, and preserved activities of daily living44. Patients with sporadic late-onset AD dementia had a global CDR score from 0.5 to 2 and fulfilled the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria for probable AD45. In contrast with APOEε4, the APOEε2 allele has been reported to protect against AD development46. Thus, similar to previous studies47, we did not include individuals bearing the APOEε2 allele in our population to increase the reliability of our APOEε4-related results.

Blood biomarker and APOE genotype

Plasma p-tau217+ levels was quantified on the Single molecule array (Simoa) HD-X platform by Janssen R&amp;D48. APOE genotyping was performed using the polymerase chain reaction amplification technique, followed by restriction enzyme digestion, standard gel resolution, and visualization processes. A more detailed description of the genotyping procedure is described elsewhere49.

Image acquisition and processing

T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo MRI data were acquired on a 3T Siemens Magnetom at the Montreal Neurological Institute (repetition time: 2300 ms; echo time: 2.96ms; flip angle: 9°, coronal orientation perpendicular to the double spin echo sequence; 1x1 mm2 in-plane resolution of 1 mm slab thickness)50. Brain atrophy was assessed with GM density on T1-weighted MRI using voxel-based morphometry. PET data were acquired on a brain-dedicated Siemens High-Resolution Research Tomograph at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Aβ-PET images were acquired 40–70 min after the intravenous bolus injection of the [18F]AZD4694 radiotracer, and scans were reconstructed with the ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm on a four-dimensional (4D) volume with three frames (3 x 600 seconds)51. Tau-PET images were acquired 90–110 min after the intravenous bolus injection of the [18F]MK-6240 radiotracer, and scans were reconstructed using the same OSEM algorithm on a 4D volume with four frames (4 x 300 seconds)51. Following each PET acquisition, a 6-min transmission scan with a rotating 137Cs point source was performed for attenuation correction. PET images underwent additional correction for motion, dead time, decay, and random and scattered coincidences. Non-uniformity and field distortion corrections were performed for T1-weighted MRI images. Next, PET images were automatically registered to the native T1-weighted MRI, and the T1-weighted MRI images were linearly and nonlinearly registered to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) template space. Using the transformation parameters from the PET registration to the correspondent T1-weighted MRI and the T1-weighted MRI registration with the ADNI space, PET images were then linearly and nonlinearly registered to the ADNI space. All images were visually inspected to ensure proper alignment with the ADNI template. Of note, tau-PET images were meninges-stripped in native space before transformations or blurring to minimize the influence of meningeal spillover in adjacent brain regions24. The PET images were spatially smoothed to achieve a final resolution of 8 mm full width at half-maximum. Aβ-PET SUVR maps were generated using the whole cerebellum gray matter as the reference region52. In accordance with previous longitudinal tau-PET studies53,54, tau-PET SUVR maps were generated using the cerebellar crus I gray matter (derived from the SUIT cerebellum atlas)55 as the reference region. A global neocortical Aβ-PET SUVR was estimated from the precuneus, prefrontal, orbitofrontal, parietal, temporal, and cingulate cortices56. According to a previously published threshold, Aβ positivity (Aβ+) was determined at baseline as global Aβ-PET SUVR &gt; 1.5557. A summary measure of tau-PET SUVR was estimated in a temporal meta-ROI comprising the entorhinal, hippocampal, fusiform, parahippocampal, inferior temporal, and middle temporal cortices56. Three Aβ+ individuals with AD dementia (mean [SD] age, 71.1 [2.3]; one male and two females) presented an extreme decrease in temporal meta-ROI tau-PET SUVR (values lower than the 25th percentile-1.5×IQR58). These participants were considered outliers and excluded prior to analysis because the excessive reductions probably reflect methodological factors (e.g., increase in off-target uptake in the reference region and variances in the delay from injection to scan acquisition at baseline and follow-up) rather than true biological changes in tau deposition54,59. A separate population of 10 CU Aβ− young adults (aged 20 to 25 years; demographic information reported in Supplementary Table 12) was assessed to establish the thresholds for baseline tau status and longitudinal tau accumulation status. Baseline tau positivity was determined as baseline tau-PET SUVR higher than mean + 2 SDs from the CU young population in the temporal meta-ROI60. Similarly, participants were classified as tau accumulators if the annual tau-PET SUVR change in the temporal meta-ROI surpassed 2 SDs from the mean of the CU young population60.

Statistics and reproducibility

Demographic differences were assessed using analysis of variance (continuous variables) and contingency χ2 test (categorical variables). The baseline associations of plasma p-tau217+ with Aβ positivity, tau positivity, and APOEε4 status was tested using linear regression models. Annualized measures of change for AD markers were calculated as the difference between follow-up and baseline divided by time. Analysis of covariance with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test assessed group differences. The relationship of tau accumulation status with APOEε4 and Aβ-PET was assessed using logistic regression. Voxel-wise and ROI-based linear regressions tested the interaction and main effects of APOEε4 and Aβ-PET on longitudinal tau-PET and plasma p-tau217+. To further test the adequacy of models with the interaction term, we used analysis of variance to compare the interaction model with a reduced model including APOEε4 status plus Aβ-PET SUVR. Linear regressions also assessed the associations of longitudinal tau accumulation as measured by PET with plasma p-tau217+, GM density, and CDR-SB score changes. In regression analyses, continuous predictors were standardized, and models were adjusted for age, sex, diagnosis (CU, MCI or AD), years of education (if assessing GM density or CDR-SB score), and baseline levels of the outcome being assessed (when appropriate). Multiple comparisons correction at P &lt; 0.05 was conducted using random field theory61 for voxel-wise analysis. Mediation models investigated the association between adjusted values of Aβ-PET, plasma p-tau217+, and tau-PET. Adjusted values were calculated as the residuals of the regressions between the raw biomarker level and the covariates of interest (age, sex, and diagnosis)50. The normality of the regression model residuals was inspected to verify the adequacy of the investigated associations. Our sample size was based on the availability of clinical, genotyping, and biomarker data, thus no statistical analysis was used to pre-determine the sample size. The collection and processing of biomarkers were performed blindly for clinical diagnosis. Data collection and analysis were not randomized. Imaging analyses were carried out using the R Package for Medical Imaging NetCD (RMINC) v1.5.3.062. Other statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.0.2 (http://www.r-project.org/). A two-tailed P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Only the concomitant presence of Aβ+ and APOEε4 carriership was associated with higher odds of being classified as tau accumulator (Aβ− APOEε4 noncarrier: reference group; Aβ− APOEε4 carrier: OR = 1.7 , 95% CI 0.2 to 9.9, P = 0.582; Aβ+ APOEε4 noncarrier: OR = 1.7 , 95% CI 0.3 to 9.6, P = 0.559; and Aβ+ APOEε4 carrier: OR = 21.4, 95% CI 3.7 to 159.8, P = 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 1b). (c) The scatter plot displays the association between global Aβ-PET SUVR and temporal meta-ROI tau-PET SUVR change in APOEε4 noncarriers (blue) and carriers (red). The error bands indicate the 95% CI. Density plots along the X and Y axes provide the data distribution. The β-estimate and P-value were computed from a linear regression model assessing the interaction of APOEε4 status and global Aβ-PET burden on longitudinal tau-PET. Regressions were two-sided and adjusted for age, sex, diagnosis, and baseline tau-PET burden. The interaction model also accounted for APOEε4 status and global Aβ-PET burden main effects. Analyses were conducted including individuals bearing the ε2 allele of the APOE gene who were excluded from the main analyses (70 CU older adults, 28 with MCI, and 9 with AD dementia). Abbreviations: AD = Alzheimer’s disease; APOEε4 = apolipoprotein E ε4; Aβ = amyloid-β; CI = confidence interval; CU = cognitively unimpaired; MCI = mild cognitive impairment; PET = positron emission tomography; ROI = region of interest; SUVR = standardized uptake value ratio.

The scatter plots display the longitudinal association of changes in (a) cortical GM density and (b) CDR-SB score with tau-PET SUVR change. The error bands indicate the 95% CI. The β-estimate and P-value were computed from two-sided linear regressions with standardized predictors accounting for age, sex, diagnosis, and baseline levels of the outcome (cortical GM density or CDR-SB score). Analysis assessing clinical decline was conducted in a subset of 87 individuals with longitudinal CDR-SB data (Supplementary Table 7). Tau-PET SUVR values were extracted from the regions showing APOEε4 and Aβ interaction effects on longitudinal tau accumulation as measured by PET. Brain atrophy was indexed with global cortical GM density using voxel-based morphometry.
