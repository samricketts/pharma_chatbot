Over the past few years, there has been growing excitement around the role of sleep in the neurodegenerative processes of Alzheimer’s Disease. Sleep disturbances including shorter sleep duration and lower sleep quality have been linked with amyloid (Ju et al., 2013; Spira et al., 2013) and tau pathology (Wang and Holtzman, 2020), with growing evidence of causal links to Alzheimer’s Disease development (Mander et al., 2016). Sleep problems in persons with Alzheimer’s Disease are not only common, but also contribute significantly to caregiver burden and subsequent institutionalization (Okuda et al., 2019). Unlike a number of Alzheimer’s Disease risk factors, sleep disturbances are modifiable and pose a novel target for primary prevention efforts. Throughout life, sleep is closely linked to mental, cognitive, and physical health and presents an opportunity to promote successful aging.

Examination of the underlying genetic links between sleep and Alzheimer’s Disease constitutes an important first step. The vast majority (90%) of patients with Alzheimer’s disease have late onset of disease (65+ years of age at diagnosis), which is 70–80% heritability (Gatz et al., 2006; Wingo et al., 2012) but also highly polygenic. Similarly, certain aspects of sleep including timing of sleep, total daily sleep requirement, impact of sleep deprivation, and certain EEG patterns have been shown to be heritable as well (Shi et al., 2017). Advent of next generation sequencing techniques (whole genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing), new bioinformatics approachs, and focus on epigenetic alterations increase the possibilities of identifying novel genetic variants and genes (Zhu et al., 2017).

The study by Yesavage and colleagues in this issue of International Psychogeriatrics presents important follow-up findings to their sentinel 2011 study of sleep genetics in Alzheimer’s Disease (Yesavage et al., 2011), the first investigation of the relationship between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and objectively-assessed sleep behaviors (wrist-worn actigraphy) in humans either with Alzheimer’s Disease or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The current study re-examines data from the original study cohort, now applying polygenic risk scores based on 2017 meta-analysis of Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) relevant to human chronotype or diurnal preference conducted by Kalmbach and colleagues (Kalmbach et al., 2017). The current study also added a second cohort with aMCI who had undergone whole genome sequencing and examined the role of variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs). While the authors did not find any significant relationships of polygenic risk score with actigraphy-assessed sleep disturbances (using wake after sleep onset or WASO) or any specific VNTR sites, the study provides an interesting insight into how circadian rhythm-related genes might related to real-world sleep disturbances in Alzheimer’s disease.

These findings raise further questions about the links between sleep, genetics, and Alzheimer’s Disease. Examination of genomic influences on real-world sleep behaviors is a novel approach that should be extended to several lines of inquiry.

First, deeper and larger genomic investigations including epigenetic alterations and other genetic factors are warranted. Such work would require very large samples of well-characterized (both in terms of cognitive functioning and sleep assessments) individuals with whole-genome sequencing. The development of such databases should consider racial and ethnic minority aging populations, given the increasing diversity in the older US population. Furthermore, the impact of environmental factors on epigenetic modifications warrant further examination, in hopes of improving outcomes for people with elevated genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s Disease and sleep problems.

The study reported wide heterogeneity in sleep behaviors among the Alzheimer’s Disease group, with mean Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO) ranging from 5 to 414 minutes and standard deviation of &gt;1 hour, thus at the extremes, there were individuals who were awake for a cumulative total of up to six hours at night. In addition to the inter-individual variability of sleep problems, the intra-individual patterns of sleep may differ greatly across the Alzheimer’s Disease group. Newer wearable sensors can capture individual-level sleep data in a free-living environment. Larger investigations of long-term sleep patterns using a wider range of objectively assessed sleep variables may shed greater light on the varied sleep-related issues in Alzheimer’s Disease.

The impact of depression on sleep disturbances should also be considered, as comorbidity rates with Alzheimer’s Disease near 40%. Studies have shown increased rates of sleep disturbances in people with psychiatric illnesses (Baglioni et al., 2016) as well as greater variability of objective sleep measures, compared to non-psychiatric comparison groups (Robillard et al., 2015). Due to the bidirectional relationships between sleep and psychiatric conditions, sleep interventions may have the potential to improve depressive symptomatology.

Also, given the high clinical concern for sleep disturbances in patients with dementia, persons with Alzheimer’s Disease are likely to receive sleep medications, medications with effects on sleep, and other interventions to improve sleep-wake disturbances. Sleep medications confer the risks of potential adverse side effects, requiring reassessment for appropriateness in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease. Similarly, a number of psychotropic medications used for behavior disturbances of Alzheimer’s Disease may have sedating or stimulating side effects that may also impact sleep and may require careful frequency and timing of doses to avoid daytime sedation or overnight awakenings. Day programs for people with Alzheimer’s Disease often focus on cognitively stimulating activities to engage the participants. One important consequence of such programs is the reduction of daytime napping, resulting in increasing the nocturnal sleep drive and consolidation of sleep at night. The impact of both sleep and Alzheimer’s Disease interventions on cognitive and overall functioning should be studied.

Other sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may also play an important role in how sleep disturbances are associated with Alzheimer’s Disease (Liguori et al., 2017). Other investigations in non-Alzheimer’s Disease populations have shown a link between OSA and cognitive impairments, that appears to be somewhat distinct from insomnia and cognitive impairments (Olaithe et al., 2018). OSA is underdiagnosed, especially among older adults and people with psychiatric disorders. The use and acceptability of treatments for OSA including oral appliances and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has not been fully explored in Alzheimer’s Disease.

This current study by Yesavage and colleagues highlights the importance of better understanding the biological mechanisms that link sleep and neurodegeneration. Sleep lies at the crux of aging, cognitive functioning, and quality of life. Sleep represents both a target for clinical intervention as well as an important biological process for further investigation. There is a critical need to improve health and well-being for older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease as well as for adults at high risk for cognitive decline. Targeted basic and clinical research are needed to examine specific underlying biological mechanisms of sleep and their impact on patient health and functioning. Identifying subpopulations who are more likely to benefit from sleep-related interventions will be important for larger-scale dissemination of interventions. Eventually, improving sleep quality may become a key way to reduce risk of cognitive decline in high-risk populations.
