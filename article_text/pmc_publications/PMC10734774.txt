The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/TrkB pathway plays a crucial role in neural plasticity and neuronal survival but is often deficient in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). CF3CN acts as a specific TrkB agonist that displays therapeutic effects in the AD mouse model, but its brain/plasma ratio (B/P ratio) distribution is not satisfactory. To increase its brain exposure, we synthesized several derivatives and employed nanoparticle (NP) formulation to optimize the most potent #2 derivative’s in vivo PK profiles. We generated stable #2-loaded zein/lactoferrin composite NPs (#2/zein/LF) using the antisolvent co-precipitation method. In vivo PK studies revealed that nanoencapsulation improved #2’s oral bioavailability by approximately 2-fold and significantly enhanced its plasma Cmax and t1/2, but the brain profiles were comparable. Pharmacodynamics showed that #2/zein/LF activates TrkB signaling that phosphorylates asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) T322 and decreases its enzymatic activity, resulting in reduced AEP-cleaved amyloid precursor protein and Tau fragments in the brains of AD mice, correlating with its PK profiles. After 3 months of treatment in 3xTg mice, #2/zein/LF decreased AD pathologies and alleviated cognitive dysfunction. Hence, zein/LF composite nanoencapsulation is a promising drug delivery method for improving the PK profiles of a potential preclinical candidate for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the world. Its hallmark pathological features include extracellular accumulation of the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, as well as the presence of hyperphosphorylated and cleaved forms of the microtubule-associated protein (Tau) inside neurons. These pathological features are accompanied by progressive memory and cognitive dysfunction. Aβ peptides are produced by amyloidogenic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is cut into smaller fragments by BACE1 (β-secretase 1) and γ-secretase in a sequential manner.1 Our previous research has demonstrated that asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), also known as legumain (gene name LGMN), acts as δ-secretase. It cleaves both APP and Tau protein simultaneously and promotes Aβ deposition and NFT pathologies in AD.2,3 AEP cuts APP at N373 and N585 residues and facilitates BACE1 access to the truncated APP C-terminal fragment (amino acids 586–695, C110), escalating Aβ peptide production. Inactivation of AEP from 5xFAD or APP/PS1 mice reduces senile plaque formation, improves synapse loss, enhances long-term potentiation, and protects memory.2 AEP cleaves Tau at N255 and N368 residues, abolishing its microtubule binding capabilities and facilitating its aggregation and neurotoxicities. Deletion of AEP in Tau P301S transgenic mice results in substantially reduced Tau hyperphosphorylation, less synapse loss, and rescue of impaired hippocampal synaptic function and cognitive deficits.3 Thus, these studies demonstrate that δ-secretase plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of AD.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the main members of the neurotrophic factor family and is the most abundant neurotrophic factor in the brain. BDNF mainly activates tyrosine protein kinase by specifically binding to its high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), which further activates three main downstream signaling pathways, PI3K/Akt, Ras/ERK, and PLCγ1/PKC,4,5 to exert its biological functions. BDNF can promote neuronal survival, growth, and differentiation during development,6-9 regulate synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in multiple brain regions of the central nervous system in adulthood, and improve cognitive function impaired by memory loss.10,11 Reduced level of BDNF is involved in the pathogenesis of AD.12 Levels of mRNA and protein expression of BDNF in AD patients are severely reduced in hippocampi, temporal, and frontal cortices.13-19 Upregulation of BDNF by the ERK/CREB signaling pathway can ameliorate Aβ-induced neuronal loss and dendritic atrophy.20 BDNF stimulation of neuronal cells leads to Tau dephosphorylation through activation of TrkB and PI3K signaling.21 Therefore, the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway may be used as a drug target for AD treatment. Recently, we reported that the BDNF/TrkB-mediated activation of Akt, which directly phosphorylates AEP on the T322 residue and blocks its activation, sequesters its lysosomal residency. BDNF scarcity in neurodegenerative diseases leads to reduction of phosphorylation, cytoplasmic translocation, and subsequent activation of AEP, eliciting its autocleavage and pathological substrate truncation.22 To search for a small molecular TrkB agonist, we performed a high-throughput screening (HTS) and identified that 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a selective TrkB receptor agonist that mimics the physiological functions of BDNF.23,24 A comprehensive lead optimization campaign through medicinal chemistry modification results in the synthetic derivative CF3CN. Moreover, it exhibits improved oral bioavailability and in vivo half-life (t1/2) profiles as it binds robustly to the LCM/CC2 motif on the TrkB extracellular domain (ECD). As a result of oral administration of CF3CN, TrkB receptors and downstream signaling are effectively activated, and therapeutic efficacy is demonstrated in 5xFAD mice in a dose-dependent manner.25 Additionally, CF3CN significantly enhances learning and memory in 3xTg mice.26 Though CF3CN is brain permeable, its brain/plasma concentration ratio is not optimal.

Encapsulating compounds in engineered nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery systems is an effective way to improve the oral bioavailability of difficult-to-absorb compounds.27-29 NPs usually improve oral bioavailability by increasing the stability of compounds in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and facilitating absorption.30 Modified NPs can enhance drug penetration through the BBB for AD treatment.31,32 For instance, Lei et al.33 developed a nanocleaner with a ROS-responsive PLGA core loaded with rapamycin and surface-modified with the KLVFF peptide and the acid-cleavable DAG peptide, which accelerates Aβ degradation and mitigates oxidative stress and excessive inflammatory response. Zein is a hydrophobic protein derived from corn seeds that is easily dissolvable in ethanol and other organic solutions.34 In addition to being generally recognized as safe (GRAS), zein is also an FDA-approved drug-inactive ingredient.35 The hydrophobicity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility of zein have been exploited in various fields, such as food coating and packaging36 and pills coatings,37 in addition to its applicability as a platform for drug delivery and in tissue engineering.38 Zein readily self-assembles into NPs with various structures depending on the solvents and processing conditions39 because there are abundant hydroxyl, amino, and carboxyl groups on the side chains of the zein molecule that can be chemically coupled with compounds by adding crosslinking agents. Nevertheless, when exposed to high ionic strength, high temperatures, and pH near isoelectric points,40 zein-based NPs are highly susceptible to aggregation or precipitation, which limits their application. To solve this problem, a common and effective approach is to use surfactants or biopolymers to stabilize zein NPs. Pectin,41 chitosan,42 and caseinate43 are common biopolymers. Lactoferrin (LF), an 80 kDa mammalian iron-binding glycoprotein formerly known as lactotransferrin, can serve as a stabilizer for NPs.44,45 Moreover, the presence of transferrin receptors on intestinal epithelial cells can promote the absorption of NPs by intestinal epithelial cells.46 To improve CF3CN brain permeability, we synthesized four derivatives (compound #1–4) that activated the TrkB signaling in a dose-dependent manner. Compound #2 showed comparable EC50 with CF3CN with high stability, yet with a high efflux ratio in Caco-2 assay, indicating poor oral bioavailability. In this study, we employed zein/LF NPs to improve the poor oral bioavailability of #2 and investigated the pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and therapeutic effects of #2-encapsulated NPs in the AD mouse model.

RESULTS

Cyanide Reductive Derivatives and Their Cellular EC50 in Activating TrkB Receptors.

To improve the B/P ratio of CF3CN, we modified the CN group in the B ring into alkyl amino or amide groups (Figures 1A and S1). Next, we quantitively analyzed these compounds’ pro-survival effects in human TrkB stably transfected SH-SY5Y cells and T48 cells, which are derived from mouse brain SN56 cells stably transfected with the rat TrkB receptor. These derivatives displayed antiapoptotic actions in a TrkB-dependent manner in both BR6 and T48 cells upon staurosporine (STS) treatment, with both #2 and #4 compounds’ pro-survival EC50 values comparable to CF3CN (Figure 1B). Immunoblotting analysis revealed that these compounds activate p-TrkB and its downstream effectors p-Akt and p-MAPK in a dose-dependent manner. Since PLCγ1 binds p-Y816 residues on the TrkB receptor and is subsequently tyrosine-phosphorylated by active TrkB, we monitored its tyrosine phosphorylation signals as well (Figure 1C). In vitro ADMET analysis showed that #2 demonstrated better in vitro PK features than other derivatives, though its Caco-2 permeability is poor (Table S1); hence, we chose #2 and attempted to improve its oral bioavailability for further study.

Characterization of Zein/LF NPs Containing #2.

Zein is a FDA-approved safe inactive formula ingredient.35 Zein can encapsulate some hydrophobic compounds including curcumin,47 resveratrol,48,49 folic acid,50 atorvastatin,51 and daidzin52 to increase their oral bioavailability. To increase the oral bioavailability of #2 and obtain the optimal mass ratios between cargo and zein, we prepared zein NPs with different mass ratios using the antisolvent co-precipitation method. Zein-based NPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The particle sizes, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PDI), turbidity of zein-based NPs and the encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading capacity (LC) of #2-loaded zein-based NPs were quantitatively measured (Figure S2). However, zein-based NPs are highly susceptible to aggregation or precipitation. Lactoferrin (LF), an iron-binding glycoprotein, can serve as a stabilizer for NPs.44,45 To obtain the best mass ratio between zein and LF, we tested different ratios and finalized the 1:1 ratio and generated #2-loaded zein/lactoferrin composite NPs (#2/zein/LF) (Figure S3). In the low pH range, zein /LF complex NPs are less salt tolerant.44 To stabilize the #2/zein/LF NPs, we used “the Maillard reaction” to modify LF proteins with glycosylation to yield #2/zein/DLF (Figures 2A and S4). Next, the NPs of #2/zein, #2/zein/LF, and #2/zein/DLF were quantitatively compared. The particle sizes, zeta potential, PDI, and turbidity of zein-based NPs are summarized in Figure 2B-E. The EE and drug LC of #2-loaded zein-based NP analysis revealed that glycosylated LF strongly decreased zein/LF’s EE and LC (Figure 2F and G). Both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that these particles were uniformly packed into the spherical shape (Figure 2H,I). We found that the #2/zein/LF NPs’ average size was about 136.7 nm when they were dispersed in the solution with low turbidity (&lt;0.22) and PDI (&lt;0.20) and high EE (above 99%).

For the NPs, it is essential to protect the encapsulated compounds from degradation in the GIT. Accordingly, we used an in vitro GIT model to investigate the digestive fate and bioaccessibility of #2-loaded NPs. The NP size increased significantly after 60 min of incubation in simulated gastric fluid (SGF), possibly due to the reduced electrostatic repulsion between NPs at low pH and ionic strength. In contrast, the NP size decreased after simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) digestion, likely because of the emulsifying effect of bile salts in SIF (Figure S5A). The bioaccessibility assay showed that the concentration of #2 in the nanomicelles in the #2/zein/DLF NPs was significantly lower than other groups (Figure S5B). FE-SEM confirmed that the NPs formed colloidal aggregates with a diameter of about 2000 nm after digestion (Figure S5C), suggesting that zein-based NPs are not absorbed by the small intestine as an individual NP but as nanomicelles that release compounds for intestinal epithelial cell uptake. Previous studies have shown that intestinal epithelial cells express transferrin receptors that can facilitate the uptake of LF-modified NPs. Consequently, we performed an in vitro Caco-2 cell uptake assay and found that the LF-modified NPs exhibited a higher A-B Papp value and a lower efflux ratio than #2/zein NPs and #2 (Figure S5D-F), indicating that LF-modification #2/zein might enhance the oral bioavailability of #2 by increasing its intestinal absorption. The detailed biochemical properties including particle size, PDI, zeta potential, turbidity, EE, LC, and bioaccessibility are summarized in Tables S2-S5. Notably, only the reconstituted #2/zein/LF NPs appeared transparent (Figure S6A). Based on the physicochemical properties of #2-loaded zein-based NPs, in vitro digestion, and Caco-2 cell uptake assay, we chose #2/zein/LF as the optimal NP for further in vivo study.

In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Study of #2 and #2 NPs (#2-NP).

To study the in vivo PK features of #2-NP, we resuspended the lyophilized zein-based NPs. Both the EE and drug LC were slightly but significantly reduced after lyophilization reconstitution (Figure 3A). To quantitatively compare the effect of NP system in #2 delivery into the circulation system and the brain, we performed the in vivo PK study using 2 months old ICR mice. Oral administration of #2 (5 mg/kg) showed that the half-life (t1/2) in the plasma was approximately 4.09 h, whereas i.v. injection displayed 0.84 h (2 mg/kg). The area under the curve (AUC) values were 2315.89 versus 405.15 ng/mL·h for i.v. and P.O. (per oral gavage), respectively. Notably, the plasma half-life (t1/2) for #2-NP was more than doubled from 9.91 vs 4.09 h for #2 at 5 mg/kg. Consistently, the CL rates (clearance: L/h/kg) were decreased from 13.36 (#2) to 7.06 (#2-NP). As a result, the AUC was enhanced from 405.15 (#2) to 756.76 ng/mL·h (#2-NP), and the maximal plasma concentration Cmax values were elevated from 90.81 to 112.67 ng/mL after zein–LF NP encapsulation. The oral bioavailability was augmented from 6.99% (#2) to 13.07% for #2-NP after zein–LF NP encapsulation (Figure 3B). In the brain, the Cmax levels of #2 were 164.38 ng/g for i.v. injection and 18.47 ng/g for P.O. administration with the AUC values 84.26 and 35.75 (ng/mL·h), respectively. The half-life (t1/2) values in the brain for these two routes were 1.41 and 3.49 h, correspondingly. By contrast, the NP system more than doubled with #2’s AUC of 74.64 vs 35.75 in the brain after oral administration of 5 mg/kg of #2-NP. The t1/2 and Tmax levels were comparable for both #2 and #2-NP (Figure 3C). The in vivo PK curves in both the plasma and the brain for 5 mg/kg dose are depicted in Figure 3D,E. The detailed plasma and brain distribution analysis of #2 kinetics are included in Figure S6. Though the zein/LF NP increases #2’s oral bioavailability and elevates its brain exposure, the B/P ratios of #2 were not significantly enhanced by the NP delivery method as compared to #2 alone (Figure S6G). However, it was substantially increased as compared to CF3CN, which displays approximately 1% B/P ratio due to extremely high plasma distribution due to its prominent oral bioavailability.25

In Vivo PK/PD Study of #2-NP.

To assess whether #2-NP administration engages the target TrkB receptors in the brain and triggers downstream AEP inhibitory phosphorylation, we employed APP/PS1 AD mice and analyzed AEP enzymatic activity and the TrkB signaling pathway in the brain lysates after oral gavage. #2 compound’s brain concentrations were quantitatively analyzed by LC-MS/MS, and the AEP enzymatic activities in the brain correlated with active AEP band levels, conversely related to escalated #2 concentrations in the brain (Figure 4A). Immunoblotting showed that p-TrkB Y816 was enhanced 1 h after oral administration, and this signal faded away at 4 h in the brain. Its downstream effector p-PLCγ1 Y783 exhibited a similar kinetic format. Remarkably, p-Akt activation lasted until 4 h, and AEP T322 was time dependently phosphorylated by active Akt and inversely coupled to its fragmentation that led to AEP enzymatic activation (Figure 4B). The immunoblotting was quantitatively analyzed (Figure 4C). We conducted a similar kinetic analysis with Tau P301S mice and made comparable observations: as #2 levels escalated in the brain, TrkB was subsequently activated, accompanied with the increase of p-AEP signals and enzymatic activity reduction (Figure 4D-F). To further interrogate the PK/PD relationship, we orally administrated 5 or 10 mg/kg of #2-NP into 3xTg mice and analyzed #2’s brain concentrations at 2 h. We found that the AEP enzymatic activities were dose dependently inhibited by #2 (Figure 4G,H). Immunoblotting revealed that p-TrkB signals were gradually elevated, as the doses of #2-NP were progressively increased, so were the downstream p-PLCγ1 Y783. Accordingly, p-AEP T322 signaling oscillated with the upstream p-Akt activities, associated with AEP cleavage reduction. As expected, the AEP downstream substrate APP N585 and Tau N368 fragmentation was steadily diminished as #2-NP dosage augmented (Figure 4I and J). Hence, the in vivo PK/PD studies support that #2 targets the TrkB receptor in the brain and blocks APP and Tau proteolytic fragmentation via phosphorylation of AEP.

#2-NP Improves Cognitions and Reduces Aβ Deposition and Brain Atrophy in 3xTg Mice.

To examine whether chronic treatment of 3xTg mice with #2-NP will alleviate the cognitive defects, we employed 3 mg/kg of #2 and #2-NP and 10 mg/kg of #2-NP (Figure 5A). Three months after drug treatment, novel object recognition assay showed that 3 mg/kg of #2 failed to improve 3xTg mice’s cognition, whereas #2-NP significantly alleviated cognitive impairment. The recognition index was dose dependently augmented by #2-NP (Figure 5B,C). However, the Morris Water Maze experiment showed that there is no statistical significance of time in platform quadrant among the four groups (Figure S7), suggesting that #2 might mainly protect the recognition memory rather than the spatial memory. MRI scanning showed that #2-NP significantly increased cerebral cortex volume as compared to vehicle control, whereas #2 alone displayed the elevation trend but was not statistically significant (Figure 5D,E). Immunohistochemistry staining the brain sections with anti-Aβ revealed that Aβ aggregation in the hippocampus was significantly decreased by both #2 and #2-NP with the latter exhibiting the dose-dependent effect (Figure 5F,G). In addition, Aβ PET signals were quantitatively analyzed with its specific ligand [18F]AV-45, which showed that 10 mg/kg of #2-NP significantly attenuated Aβ PET signals in 3xTg mice (Figure 5H,I). ELISA analysis showed that Aβ42 but not Aβ40 were substantially reduced by both #2 and #2-NP in 3xTg mice (Figure 5J,K). Therefore, #2-NP diminishes Aβ42 brain deposition and reduces brain atrophy, accompanied with alleviated cognitive defects in 3xTg mice.

#2-Np Activates TrkB in the Brains of 3xTg Mice and Inhibits AEP Protease Activity.

To explore whether #2 biochemically agitates the TrkB signaling pathway and inhibits AEP, we conducted immunoblotting with the brain lysates from 3xTg mice, which showed that #2-NP dose dependently activated p-TrkB Y706 and Y816 (Figures S8 and 6A), and p-PLCγ1 mirrored the upstream p-TrkB Y816 signals. Consequently, p-AEP T322 correlated with the upstream TrkB signaling, which was inversely coupled with the active AEP fragment. Both APP N585 and Tau N368 cleavage were progressively reduced. In alignment with Tau N368 truncation, p-Tau AT8 levels were gradually attenuated as well (Figure 6A). The AEP enzymatic assay showed that it was dose dependently inhibited by #2-NP, and immunoblotting was quantified. At the same dose, #2-NP exhibited significantly more robust biochemical activities than #2, alignment with elevated #2 brain exposure by the NP system (Figure 6B-I).

#2-NP Diminishes AD Pathologies in 3xTg Mice.

To further analyze #2-NP’s therapeutic efficacy toward AD pathologies, we conducted immunofluorescence (IF) staining with p-TrkB staining on the brain sections from drug-treated 3xTg mice. IF staining demonstrated that p-TrkB 816 were all significantly activated by #2 and #2-NP in the hippocampus (Figure 7A,E). As a result, p-AEP IF signals tightly correlated with the upstream p-TrkB activities (Figure 7B,F). Consequently, active AEP IF staining inversely coupled to the p-AEP activities, resulting in gradually attenuated APP C585 levels. In alignment with these findings, Tau N368 signals and AT8 IF intensities were closely associated with each other (Figure 7C,D). Quantification of the fluorescent intensities corroborated these observations (Figure 7G-J). Together, these results strongly support that #2-NP increases #2 brain exposure, escalates TrkB activation, and inhibits AEP in the brain, leading to amelioration of AD pathology and rescuing cognitive impairment in 3xTg mice.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In the current study, we synthesized different derivatives of CF3CN by reducing the cyanide group into alkylamine and amide moieties. Our previous structure–activity relationship study reviews that the electron-withdrawing group CN on the B ring on the flavone backbone stabilizes the derivatives from its plasma and liver microsomal metabolism. Hence, we keep the rest of the structure intact and only alter the CN residue. Though compound #2 and #4 reveal comparable TrkB agonistic activities, #1 and #3 compounds’ activities are substantially reduced. In vitro ADMET assays demonstrate that only #2 may exhibit higher free drug concentration in plasma than the parental CF3CN compound as the plasma protein binding showed that the fraction unbound (Fu) is 4.6% for #2 versus 0.1% for CF3CN. Nonetheless, Caco-2 permeability assay reveals that intestinal absorption efflux ratios are 193 vs 3.6 for these two compounds, respectively, indicating that #2 oral absorption may be a hurdle that needs to be circumvented during the P.O. administration (Table S1). In consequence, we employed NP delivery strategy to solve this challenge.

Zein is the major storage protein in maize and comprises approximately 45–50% of the total protein content in corn.53 Zein is an amphiphilic protein, possessing high percentages of hydrophobic amino acids.38 Hence, zein is insoluble in water; thus, the resulting devices (e.g., films and NPs) display a hydrophobic characteristic with interesting properties that control the release of the loaded compound.54 In addition, as for other nanocarriers of protein origin, these devices are biodegradable and can accommodate a great variety of compounds in a nonspecific way.55 Accordingly, zein has been utilized to encapsulate some hydrophobic compounds including curcumin,47 resveratrol,48,49 folic acid,50 atorvastatin,51 and daidzin,52 which can significantly increase the oral bioavailability of these compounds. After testing different mass ratios between #2 and zein, we finalized the 1:10 ratio based on PDI, particle size and turbidity, and EE and LC parameters (Figures 2 and S2).

However, when exposed to high ionic strength, high temperatures, and pH near isoelectric points,40 zein-based NPs are highly susceptible to aggregation or precipitation, which limits their application. To solve this problem, a common and effective approach is to use surfactants or biopolymers to stabilize zein NPs. LF has been used as a stabilizer for NPs.44,45 Moreover, the presence of transferrin receptors on intestinal epithelial cells can promote the absorption of NPs by intestinal epithelial cells.46 Recently, LF has been used as a stabilizer for zein NPs at high salt concentration and wide pH range compared with other proteins.44 Accordingly, we tested different mass ratios between zein and LF and chose 1:1 ratio as the optimal component based on PDI, particle size and turbidity, and EE and LC factors (Figures 2 and S3). However, at low pH range, the salt tolerance of zein/LF complex NPs was poor.44 To overcome these issues, LF is glycosylated by dextran via the Maillard reaction as a stabilizer to yield zein/glycosylated LF NPs and encapsulate 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF). Compared with zein/LF NPs, zein/glycosylated LF NPs further increases stability to ionic strength (0–500 mM NaCl) at low pH conditions. Zein/glycosylated LF NPs have a nanoscale spherical shape, and glycosylated LF changes the surface morphology of zein NPs.56 Nevertheless, we found that most of NP parameters including zeta potential, turbidity, and LC are drastically altered for glycosylated #2/zein/DLF as compared to #2/zein/LF, indicating that glycosylated #2/zein/DLF NPs are not stable (Figures 2, S4, and 5). Therefore, we focused on #2/zein/LF NPs for in-depth in vivo PK/PD studies.

As expected, the zein/LF NP significantly enhances #2 oral bioavailability and elongates its half-life in the plasma, leading to its brain exposure augmentation (AUC increased from 35.75 vs 74.64 ng/mL·h) (Figure 3). In alignment with this effect, oral administration of #2-NP temporally activates the TrkB receptor and inhibits AEP, coupling to its brain exposure in two different AD mouse models. Moreover, #2-NP triggers TrkB activation and AEP inhibition in the brain of 3xTg mice dose dependently (Figure 4), supporting that #2-NP effectively delivers #2 into the CNS and engages its target TrkB receptors. Chronic treatment of 3 months of age 3xTg mice with #2-NP robustly elevates p-TrkB and p-AEP signals in the hippocampus, conversely coupled to AEP activation and APP C586 and Tau N368 fragmentation, which diminishes Aβ42 and AT8 levels (Figures 6 and 7). These biochemical and pharmacological effects result in brain atrophy reduction and Aβ42 deposition attenuation, leading to restoration of cognitive functions in 3xTg mice (Figure 5). In vitro ADMET assays and in vivo PK comparison between CF3CN and its reductive derivative #2 reveal that these two compounds possess intrinsic advantage and shortcomings. For instance, CF3CN oral bioavailability is substantially higher than #2 due to the dramatic Caco-2 permeability efflux ratio difference, whereas #2 exhibits augmented brain penetration in BBB permeability assay compared to CF3CN, leading to improved B/P ratios after oral administration (Table S1). Hence, zein/LF nanoencapsulation is a promising drug delivery method for improving #2’s PK profiles, especially its oral bioavailability. Conceivably, further escalation of #2’s oral bioavailability with optimal NPs may ensure a preclinical candidate for treating neurodegenerative diseases including AD.

Zein (≥95%) and dextran (40 kDa) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri, USA). HPLC-grade methanol and ethanol were obtained from TEDIA (Ohioan, USA). Other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. (Shanghai, China).

Fabrication of Zein, Zein/LF, and Zein/DLF NPs.

Based on previous studies,43,57 zein and zein/LF NPs were prepared using the ASCP method with slight modifications. In brief, zein powder was accurately weighed and dissolved into 80% aqueous ethanol (1%, w/v). Then, the zein–ethanol solution was added drop by drop to the LF water solution at a 1:3 volume ratio using syringes. The solution was then continuously stirred (800 rpm) for 30 min at room temperature, while zein NPs were produced using deionized water as an antisolvent. After removing the ethanol with a rotary evaporator at 40 °C under reduced pressure, the dispersion was stored at 4 °C, and parts were freeze-dried for other experiments.

Preparation of #2-Loaded Zein, Zein/LF, and Zein/DLF NPs.

#2-loaded zein NPs (#2/zein) were prepared according to the method in the fabrication of zein, zein/LF, and zein/DLF NPs. Zein and #2 were dissolved at a mass ratio of 20:1, 10:1, or 5:1 in 80% (v/v) ethanol solution. #2-loaded zein/LF and zein/DLF NPs (#2/zein/LF and #2/zein/DLF) were prepared at a mass ratio of zein to LF 1:1. All the loaded samples were stored at 4 °C, and other parts of samples were freeze-dried for further analysis.

Particle Size, PDI, Zeta Potential, and Turbidity Measurement.

The particle size, PDI, and zeta potential were measured using a DLS instrument (Nano-ZS 90, Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, United Kingdom). The turbidity of fresh dispersions was measured at 600 nm absorbance with a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy HTX Multimode Reader, Agilent, California, USA) at room temperature.

Entrapment Efficiency and Drug LC Determination.

The NPs were centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min under 4 °C to remove free #2.58 The supernatant (containing loaded #2) was transferred to a new tube and diluted 5-fold with methanol. Total #2 was obtained by dissolving an equal volume of the initial suspension in methanol and diluted 5-folds. The entrapment efficiency (EE) and LC of #2 were then calculated according to the following equation EE(%)=encapsulated#2initial#2×100LC(%)=encapsulated#2weight of unloaded carrier×100

The encapsulated and initial #2 were determined by a HPLC system. The HPLC system was an LC-20A series instrument (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a double-solvent manager, an injection needle, a chromatographic column heater, and a DAD detector. Sample separation was performed using a Phenomenex HPLC column (Luna, 5 μm, C18, 250 × 4.6 mm, Phenomenex Ltd., Washington, USA). The flow phase contained methanol (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B). A gradient elution program is as follows: from 42 to 65% A (0–20 min). The flow rate was 1 mL/min, the injection volume was 10 μL, the temperature of column compartment was 40 °C, and the wavelength of the DAD detector was set to 254 nm.

Morphological Studies of the NPs.

Transmission Electron Microscopy.

NP dispersions were diluted 10-fold with distilled water, deposited on a formvar–carbon-coated copper grid and, allowed to dry in air. Following staining with 2% uranyl acetate, excess uranyl acetate was removed with filter paper. TEM experiments were performed on a HT7700 electron microscope (HITACH, Tokyo, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 80 kV.

Scanning Electron Microscopy.

NP suspensions were freeze-dried and coated with a gold layer using a sputter coater under vacuum to avoid charging. Then, the surface morphologies of freeze-dried NP samples were determined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (APREO S, Thermo Ltd, Massachusetts, USA) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV.

Novel Object Recognition Test.

Two identical cube objects with size 3 × 3 × 3 cm were placed in the opposite corners of an open field arena (40 X 40 cm) and 5 cm from the side walls. A test mouse was first habituated to the arena and objects for 5 min. After 1 h, one object was replaced with another novel sphere object, which was of similar size but different shape than the previous object. The same test mouse was placed in the arena to explore the arena and the two objects. The movement of mice was recorded by a camera for 5 min and further analyzed by the video tracking EthoVision XT 12 software (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands).

Aβ PET Assay.

After a 3 month drug treatment, 3xTg mice (n = 3 mice each group) were anesthetized with isoflurane and intravenously injected with [18F]AV-45 (200 ± 20 μCi) via the lateral tail vein in different groups. The 15 min static images were obtained by small-animal PET/CT systems (at 0.5 h after injection) and scanned at a 350–650 keV energy window with 20 min list mode acquisition and 3D rebinning, followed by OSEM-PSF reconstruction. PET images were analyzed and quantified by AMIDE software, and data were calculated in regions of interest (ROIs). Thereafter, regional [18F]AV-45 data were normalized by the [18F]AV-45 uptake in the cerebellum, which was taken as a control brain region (ratio to cerebellum).59

MRI Assay.

MRI sessions for 3xTg mice (n = 3 each group) were performed after the Aβ PET assay. Acquisitions were performed at the Institute of Biomedical and Health Engineering, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology. Experiments were conducted on a 9.4 T uMR scanner (Shanghai United Imaging Healthcare Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) equipped with a linear volume coil as a transmitter and a dedicated mouse brain surface coil as a receiver. Mice were anesthetized (1.5% isoflurane in 0.4 L/min oxygen) and introduced in the magnet. Animals were provided anesthesia continuously throughout the acquisition procedure via a nosecone. Data were acquired and processed using the U_VIEWER software (Shanghai United Imaging Healthcare Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).

AEP Activity Assay.

Tissue homogenates (10 μg) were incubated in 200 μL of assay buffer (20 mM citric acid, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 60 mM Na2HPO4, and 1 mM DTT, pH 6.0) containing 20 μM AEP substrate. AMC released by substrate cleavage was quantified by measuring at 460 nm in a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy HTX Multimode Reader, Agilent, California, USA) at 37 °C for 1 h in the kinetic mode for every 5 min.

Western Blot Analysis.

The mouse brain tissue samples or cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 40 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.4, supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors) for 30 min on ice and centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000g under 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred and boiled in SDS loading buffer. After running SDS-PAGE, the samples were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Then, the membrane was blocked with 1× TBST buffer containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, followed by the incubation with a primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, and with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system was used to detect the membrane.

Immunostaining.

The frozen sections were boiled in 10 mM citric acid (pH 6.0) for 15 min, followed by cooling down on ice for antigen retrieval. Then, the sections were treated with immunostaining permeabilization buffer with Triton X-100 (Beyotime Biotechnology, Beijing, China) for 15 min, followed by three times washing in 1× PBST and 1 h blocking in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After that, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with 1× PBST, the sections were incubated with a mixture of Alexa Fluor 488, 594, or 647 coupled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, California, USA) for detection. Images were acquired through a confocal microscope (ZEISS LSM 980, ZEISS Microscopy, Oberkochen, Germany).

Statistical Analysis.

All data collected from at least three replicate or more independent experiments were presented as the means ± S.D. The level of significance between two groups was assessed with using the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests. Data sets that involved more than two groups were assessed by one-way ANOVA. A value of p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
