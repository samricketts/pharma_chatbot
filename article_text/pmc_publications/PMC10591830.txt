Introduction

Misdiagnosis rate of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) remains high despite being second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia. To date, understanding of clinical profile of pathologically confirmed prodromal DLB remains limited. The main objective of this study was to describe and compare it with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Methods

We accessed the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center database from 2005 to December 2022 data freeze and included 111 and 501 prodromal DLB and AD patients respectively. First visit data was analysed.

Results

Clinician-determined memory impairment is common in prodromal DLB (&gt;70%) but associated with higher risk for AD diagnosis (OR 0.355, p=0.0003). DLB had a higher proportion of non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnoses but statistically insignificance in differentiating the two. Inattention (OR 2.273, p=0.0015), and neuropsychiatric features, such as visual hallucinations (OR 11.98, p&lt;0.0001), depressed mood (OR1.709, p=0.0292), apathy (1.824, p=0.0345), and night/REM sleep behaviours, are associated with DLB diagnosis. Hallucinations are infrequent (7-11%). Motor symptoms, particularly gait disorders (OR 4.570, p&lt;0.001), falls (OR3.939, p=0.0003), tremors (OR2.237, p=0.0154), slowness (OR3.573, p&lt;0.0001), and parkinsonism signs (OR2.443, p&lt;0.0001), are common. 32% showed no parkinsonism during initial presentation. Neuropsychological examination revealed less impaired memory and language but impaired executive function in DLB.

Conclusion

In clinical practice, it is important to note that memory symptoms although being higher risk associated with AD diagnosis, are prominent in prodromal DLB. Psychosis is infrequent, and non-amnestic MCI is not necessarily associated with higher risk of DLB diagnosis. A careful clinical approach is key to improve the diagnosis of prodromal DLB.

Prodromal
Dementia with Lewy Bodies
Alzheimer’s disease

pmcIntroduction

Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is the second most prevalent cause of neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1]. However, studies suggest a high misdiagnosis rate, with one in three patients being misdiagnosed [2], often as AD [2, 3]. Our recent study showed that in patients with pathologically confirmed early-onset DLB, misdiagnosis rates were as high as 50%, with most being diagnosed as AD [4].

Early diagnosis of the cause of dementia is essential for clinical management since DLB carries a significant care burden [5] and higher costs [6, 7] compared to AD. DLB is also known to be more sensitive to anti-dopaminergic and anti-cholinergic drugs due to hypersensitivity and encephalopathy concerns and should be avoided [8]. Studies have shown that compared to AD, prodromal DLB has more impaired non-memory domains [9, 10], prominent motor symptoms or signs [9-11], features of REM behavioral sleep disorder [10,11], or psychiatric features [11]. Prodromal DLB also has slower processing speed [12], motor symptom and signs [13], neuropsychiatric features of apathy, depression, anxiety [12, 13], visual hallucinations [13], and REM behavioral sleep disorder [13] compared to healthy controls. Differentiating between DLB and AD in the early stages of the disease is challenging in clinical practice due to overlapping clinical features [16] and mixed pathology [4, 17]. With the recent availability of anti-amyloid therapies like lecanemab for Alzheimer’s disease [18], early recognition and differentiation of the two etiologies has become increasingly paramount.

Clinical information on pathologically confirmed DLB is currently lacking. Jicha et al. analyzed 9 pathologically confirmed mild cognitive impairment with DLB patients and showed distinct clinical features compared to AD, indicating the feasibility of differentiating underlying pathologic processes responsible for cognitive decline in the preclinical disease state [14]. The main aim of our current study is to describe the early clinical profile of pathologically confirmed prodromal DLB and compare it with prodromal AD, the most commonly misdiagnosed etiology in clinical practice, to assist clinicians in early recognition of DLB for better patient management.

Methods

This study's data is based on the NACC Uniform Data Set (UDS), which comprises de-identified data provided with participants and informants' written informed consent, collected by Alzheimer's Disease Centers. The database is funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in the United States. Data collection is in accordance with NIA policies, and database research is approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board. Data access complied with relevant data use agreements [19]. A dataset was utilized for the current study, contributed by approximately 39 past and present Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) across the United States, and included 619 patients evaluated from 2005 to December 2022. This study is reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.

Study participants with abnormal cognition and behavior but not meeting the criteria for all-cause dementia were included in the study (Figure 1). Patients were divided into two pathologically-defined subgroups: (1) Lewy body disease, including patients with a high likelihood of DLB Clinical Syndrome due to DLB pathology or evidence of Lewy body pathology in the limbic (transitional) or neocortical (diffuse) regions, and stage IV and below of Braak stage for neurofibrillary degeneration. Patients whose only initial clinical diagnosis was Parkinson's disease dementia were excluded. (2) Alzheimer's disease, including patients who met NIA/Reagan Institute neuropathological criteria for a high likelihood of dementia being due to Alzheimer's disease or NIA-AA Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC): High ADNC.

Neurofibrillary degeneration of Braak stages V and VI were excluded in DLB pathological diagnosis, based on the Third report of the DLB Consortium [20]. This is due to its reduction in the probability that the neuropathologic findings will align with a DLB clinical syndrome, especially when considering both AD and Lewy Bodies (LB) pathology. The likelihood that DLB clinical syndrome is explained by the observed neuropathology is directly tied to the severity of Lewy-related pathology and inversely related to the severity of concurrent AD pathology [21-23].

Meanwhile, editorial recommendations from the NIA/Reagan Institute in 1997 highlight that AD is a heterogeneous clinicopathological entity. Thus, only probabilistic statements about the presence or absence of dementia can be made based solely on pathological findings; the likelihood that AD accounts for a dementia is high when the postmortem brain shows both neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in neocortex and stage V/VI according to Braak and Braak [24]. The 2012 guidelines from the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association state that AD neuropathologic change is assessed using a combination score of Aβ/amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangle stages, and neuritic plaque. Intermediate or High AD neuropathologic change is considered sufficient explanation for dementia [25]. Only cases with High AD neuropathologic changes were selected in this study to better ascertain the probability of dementia due to AD. Other major co-existing lesions like Lewy Bodies don't negate an AD neuropathological diagnosis. However, both consensus and guidelines necessitate that other lesions or disorders be listed alongside, since the exact contribution of co-existing lesions to clinical symptoms isn't always definitively known [24,25].

The variables analyzed in this study at the first visit included demographic information, health history, cognitive assessments, motor assessments, behavioral assessments, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Logical Memory IA and IIA, Trails A and B, Boston Naming test, and Clinician Diagnosis. The variables analyzed are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

Statistical analysis

Mean and standard deviation were reported for continuous variables, while frequency and proportion were reported for categorical data. Prodromal AD and prodromal DLB were compared using two-independent t-test (where the normality assumption was tenable due to the large sample size) and Fisher’s exact test for continuous and categorical variables. Univariate logistic regression analysis was then performed to identify the association of baseline variables and DLB vs AD as the binary outcome variable, followed by multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, gender and MMSE as clinical confounders. Results of the logistic regression analysis were reported as un-adjusted and adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Robustness of the logistic regression analysis was assessed via Hosmer-Lemeshow lack-of-Fit test. Firth's penalized likelihood approach is applied to address potential bias of the parameter estimates. Data analysis was performed using R software (R Core Team (2022). R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL https://www.R-project.org/). Statistical significance level was set at 0.05.

Results

A total of 612 participants were included in the study, with 111 diagnosed as prodromal Dementia with Lewy Bodies and 501 diagnosed as prodromal AD. Prodromal DLB showed relatively preserved global cognition, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (mean score 27.5 vs 26.4, p&lt;0.001). There was also a higher proportion of male participants in the prodromal DLB group compared to the prodromal AD group (75.7% vs 56.4%, p&lt;0.001). For AD group, 56.1% was absent from Lewy Bodies pathology, 25.7% was limbic (transitional) or amygdala-predominant, 12.0% of neocortical(diffuse), and only 0.4% was not assessed.

While the majority of prodromal DLB patients presented with amnestic symptoms (74.8%), prodromal AD patients had a significantly higher proportion of amnestic presentation (87.6%, p=0.0003), with the risk of being diagnosed with DLB about 65% lower. Prodromal DLB was also noted to have a higher prevalence of the presence of deficits in attention or concentration (31.5% vs 20.3%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.3, p=0.0015). In terms of neuropsychiatric features, a history of visual hallucinations carried an almost 12 times higher risk of being diagnosed with DLB (p&lt;0.0001) compared to AD. The recent presence of hallucination symptoms captured by the NPI-Q also showed a significantly higher proportion in prodromal DLB, with a consistent adjusted OR of 11.82 (p=0.0012). Symptoms of REM sleep disorders were significantly more prevalent in the prodromal DLB group (23.4% vs 4.35%, p&lt;0.001), but they could not be included in the multivariable analysis due to significant missing data. On the other hand, the NPI-Q reflected a higher prevalence of night behavior symptoms in the prodromal DLB group (31.2% vs 19.1%, adjusted OR 2.039, p=0.0061). The presence of symptoms of fluctuating cognition did not reach statistical significance (10.4% vs 5.6%, p=0.1556).

Regarding mood disorders, a significant proportion of prodromal DLB patients exhibited active depressive symptoms two years prior to the first visit (41.8%, adjusted OR 1.7, p=0.02) and reported lower mood based on the GDS (adjusted OR 1.1, p=0.0017). Prodromal DLB also had a significantly higher proportion of patients showing apathy symptoms compared to AD (23.9% vs 15.3%), with a 1.7 times higher risk of being diagnosed with DLB (p=0.03).

Prodromal DLB showed a significant proportion of impaired motor symptoms and signs. The proportion of motor symptoms ranged between 15.5% and 35.1%, compared to 5.22% and 10.7% in prodromal AD. The most prominent motor symptoms were gait disorder (35.1%) and slowness (32.4%), showing a 4-4.8 times higher risk of DLB diagnosis (p&lt;0.001). Prodromal DLB also showed a very high proportion of abnormal motor signs (68.5% vs 45.1%), associated with a 2.6 times higher risk of DLB diagnosis.

In terms of neuropsychological assessment, prodromal DLB demonstrated relatively preserved memory (logical memory tests IA and IIB) and language skills (Boston naming test), but more impaired executive function tests (Trail A and B). Prodromal DLB also exhibited a higher proportion of non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnoses compared to prodromal AD (28.4% vs 13.1%), although there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups.

Discussions

Our study findings align with existing literature, indicating that prodromal AD exhibits more significant memory impairments compared to prodromal DLB [9,14]. The results show that this difference is associated with about 65% lower risk of being neuropathologically diagnosed with DLB. However, clinicians should take note that even in the prodromal stage, more than 70% of DLB patients present with amnesia symptoms, which likely contributes to the frequent misdiagnosis as AD, as mentioned earlier [2-4]. While the presence of visual hallucinations significantly improves the diagnosis of DLB (adjusted odds ratio [OR] of almost 12), clinicians should be aware that only about 10% of patients exhibit this symptom in the prodromal state. Fluctuating cognition was not found to be significant during the prodromal stage, although this conclusion is limited by missing data. Eliciting fluctuating cognition can be challenging based on the method of questioning. Directly asking an informant about fluctuations may not reliably distinguish DLB from AD. However, inquiries about daytime drowsiness, lethargy, staring into space, or episodes of disorganized speech can [26]. Additionally, cognitive fluctuations may have lesser amplitude or frequency during the milder phases [27]. Instead, inattention symptoms are significantly associated with DLB diagnosis, which is consistent with existing literature on the dementia stage of DLB [28,29].

Despite prodromal DLB having a higher proportion of non-amnestic MCI diagnoses, in this cohort, the type of MCI diagnosis does not significantly differentiate the two groups, which contradicts some existing evidence [30] but is in line with others [31]. Therefore, clinicians should note that a non-amnestic MCI diagnosis is not necessarily associated with a higher risk of DLB etiology in clinical practice.

Second, it is important to highlight the high proportion of mood symptoms during the prodromal phase in DLB, particularly a history of apathy and depression, ranging between 24% and 36%. The prodromal DLB group also reported significant higher GDS scores, indicating a lower mood. However, when examining the neuropsychiatric features between the two groups based on the NPI-Q, which captures symptoms over the past month, all features, except hallucinations and nighttime behavior, were not statistically significant. This suggests the importance of obtaining a careful history over a longer period rather than focusing solely on recent symptoms. Another notable finding in our study is the high proportion of other neuropsychiatric features, such as agitation, irritability, and anxiety, in both prodromal AD and DLB patients, ranging between 14% and 30%, consistent with other studies on mild behavioral disorder [32].

In this cohort, we also observed a high proportion of nighttime behavior reported in the prodromal DLB group based on the NPI-Q (31.2%). This could be attributed to REM sleep disorders, which are not specifically reflected in the NPI-Q. This symptom is associated with an almost 2 times higher risk of DLB diagnosis and is consistent with the clinical symptoms of REM sleep behavioral disorders recorded in this study, which is a core clinical feature for DLB diagnostic criteria. However, due to a small sample size and missing data (57.7%), this variable was excluded from the multiple variable model analysis. It’s also important to take note that other potential sleep disorder features in DLB, such as poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness, may contribute to the excessive nighttime behavior observed in this study [33].

Another significant finding in our study is the presence of motor symptoms and signs of Parkinsonism. We observed that almost 69% of prodromal DLB patients exhibited Parkinsonism signs, which is consistent with the findings of Van deBeek et al. [9], whose team reported that 69% of MCI Lewy Bodies patients showed the presence of Parkinsonism, which was the most frequent feature. Additionally, motor symptoms were present in 15-35% of the prodromal DLB group, particularly gait disorders, as reported by Wyman-Chick et al [13], who demonstrated a gait disorder in 50% of their study cohort. At the same time, it is important to note that nearly 32% of prodromal DLB patients showed no signs of parkinsonism during their initial presentation, further complicating differentiating from AD.

Regarding the neuropsychological examination, our study is in line with current literature, showing more impaired executive function tests [31], relatively preserved memory [10,34], and language tests [12]. A similar profile is also observed in the clinical dementia stage, and the increased memory impairment is likely due to the coexistence of Alzheimer's pathology in DLB patients [4].

However, this study has a few limitations. Some variables had significant missing data, which limits the interpretability of the results. For example, the assessment of fluctuation of cognition, a core feature of DLB diagnostic criteria, had a missing value rate of 56.8%, which hinders the interpretation of this symptom. Additionally, while the strength of this study lies in the inclusion of pathologically confirmed cases, it does not provide clinical information for cases with mixed pathology, which is common in clinical practice.

In summary, based on our current study, there are a few important points that clinicians need to consider. Firstly, although prodromal DLB has a significant proportion of non-amnestic presentations compared to AD, the majority of patients still present with amnestic features, which often complicates clinical judgment. Secondly, behavioral changes and neuropsychiatric features are common in both prodromal DLB and AD, particularly long-term depression, apathy, and night behavior/sleep disorders, which are significantly more associated with prodromal DLB. Symptoms such as irritability, agitation, and anxiety do not differentiate between the two conditions. Thirdly, motor symptoms and signs are common and should be carefully assessed during consultations. Finally, prodromal DLB exhibits more impairment in executive function tests and relatively preserved performance in memory and confrontational naming tests. Through a more thorough and comprehensive clinical examination, clinicians should be able to better differentiate AD from DLB in the early stages.

Highlights

DLB is frequently misdiagnosed, even as the second most common dementia type.

Memory symptoms are prevalent in both prodromal AD and DLB.

Psychosis is infrequent, but motor symptoms, are indicative of DLB.

Non-amnestic MCI doesn't necessarily associate with higher risk of DLB.

A detailed clinical approach is crucial for accurate early DLB diagnosis.
