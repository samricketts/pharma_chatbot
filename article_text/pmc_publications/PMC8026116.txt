Our primary aim was to compare neuroinflammation in cognitively intact control subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by using positron emission tomography (PET) with translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO)-specific radioligand [18F]-FEPPA. [18F]-FEPPA PET scans were acquired on a high-resolution research tomograph in 21 patients with AD (47– 81 years) and 21 control subjects (49–82 years). They were analyzed by using a 2-tissue compartment model with arterial plasma input function. Differences in neuroinflammation, indexed as [18F]-FEPPA binding were compared, adjusting for differences in binding affinity class as determined by a single polymorphism in the TSPO gene (rs6971). In grey matter areas, [18F]-FEPPA was significantly higher in AD compared with healthy control subjects. Large increases were seen in the hippocampus, prefrontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortex (average Cohen’s d = 0.89). Voxel-based analyses confirmed significant clusters of neuroinflammation in the frontal, temporal and parietal cortex in patients with AD. In white matter, [18F]-FEPPA binding was elevated in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and the cingulum bundle. Higher neuroinflammation in the parietal cortex (r = − 0.7, P = 0.005), and posterior limb of the internal capsule (r = − 0.8, P = 0.001) was associated with poorer visuospatial function. In addition, a higher [18F]-FEPPA binding in the posterior limb of the internal capsule was associated with a greater impairment in language ability (r = − 0.7, P = 0.004). Elevated neuroinflammation can be detected in AD patients throughout the brain grey and white matter by using [18F]-FEPPA PET. Our results also suggest that neuroinflammation is associated with some cognitive deficits.


INTRODUCTION

Neuroinflammation is an important feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology.1 Post-mortem examinations of AD brains show clusters of activated microglia surrounding amyloid plaques.2–4 Microglia are endogenous key players of the brain’s immune system, providing a first line of defence against neuronal insults.5 Microglia activation is characterized by an increased expression of translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO).6 Post-mortem studies of AD brains have shown significant elevated TSPO expression in the hippocampus, frontal, temporal and parietal cortex.7,8

Neuroinflammation can be quantified in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) by using radioligands that target TSPO.6 Previous TSPO PET studies of AD using the prototypical TSPO radioligand, [11C]-PK11195, had mixed results.9–13 This discrepancy might be because of the known technical limitations of [11C]-PK11195. These limitations have fostered the development of second-generation TSPO radioligands with superior quality to quantify TSPO expression in vivo.14 Among these are [18F]-FEPPA, which has a high affinity for TSPO, good metabolic profile, high brain penetration and good pharmacokinetics.15,16 A single polymorphism in the TSPO gene (rs6971) causes variation in TSPO binding affinity in all second-generation TSPO radioligands ([11C]PBR28,17 [18F]FEPPA18 and [18F]PBR11119); and classifies individuals into high-affinity binders (HAB), mixed-affinity binders (MAB) and low-affinity binders (LAB).20,21

A meta-analysis of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies reported extensive white matter microstructural abnormalities in AD.22 Some of the areas affected include the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum bundle and internal capsule.22–27 These white matter abnormalities might be related to changes in myelin density, microglia activity levels and increases in reactive gliosis.28–30 Although an elevated TSPO density was detected in the post-mortem white matter tissue of AD patients,7 TSPO expression in specific white matter regions has never been evaluated in vivo. It is also unknown whether an increase in neuroinflammation in these white matter regions might be related to a cognitive impairment in AD. Finally, an increase in neuroinflammation in the cortical grey matter regions has been correlated with a poorer cognitive performance in some studies,10,31,32 but not in others.33

In this context, we conducted a study with the primary aim of comparing neuroinflammation in cognitively intact control subjects and patients with AD by using [18F]-FEPPA PET, adjusting for differences in binding affinity class in both grey and white matter regions. We hypothesized AD patients would show increased neuroinflammation, as indexed by [18F]-FEPPA binding. Finally, we explored the relationship between [18F]-FEPPA binding throughout the grey and white matter regions and specific neuropsychological measures to assess the impact of neuroinflammation on cognitive function.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants

Patients with AD were recruited from the memory clinics of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and the Sam and Ida Ross Memory Clinic at the Baycrest Geriatric Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada. Healthy control subjects were recruited from a local advertisement in the same geographic area. Twenty-one healthy controls and 21 patients with AD completed all study procedures. All participants underwent a medical and psychiatric assessment, including a urine drug screen. All participants with AD had a diagnosis of probable AD according to the criteria defined by the guidelines of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the AD and Related Disorders Association.34 Diagnoses of probable AD were made based on the consensus of neurologists and geriatric psychiatrists of the memory clinics (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and Baycrest). The exclusion criteria for AD and healthy subjects included: a current diagnosis of psychiatric illness, including diagnosis of definitive axis I disorder; the presence of significant medical illness, including cancer, head trauma, stroke and other neurological disorders; metal implants; history of claustrophobia; or any other conditions that would preclude PET or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was not allowed, except for 81 mg acetylsalicylic acid. Participants with AD could be treated with stable doses of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine and/or anti-depressants.

The protocol was approved by the Research Ethic Boards of Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and Baycrest Health Sciences. All subjects provided a written informed consent after all study procedures were fully explained. For participants with AD, a written consent was also obtained from the subject’s primary caregiver or substitute decision maker.

Neuropsychological assessment

The mini-mental status examination was administered to both healthy subjects and participants with AD to evaluate overall cognitive performance.35 Participants with AD underwent neuropsychological tests to assess impairments in more specific cognitive domains. These include: the Montreral Cognitive Assessment to evaluate general cognitive function;36 trail making test,37 Stroop test,38 letter number span39 and verbal fluency to evaluate executive functions, including processing speed, mental flexibility and cognitive organization; and the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status scale to evaluate memory, visusospatial skills, attention and language ability.40 Some participants with AD were not able to complete all tests and the number of subjects who completed each test is indicated in the relevant figures and tables.

Dementia severity was assessed by using the clinical dementia rating scale.41 Functional disability was evaluated with the Disability Assessment for Dementia.42 Duration of illness for the participants with AD was defined as the length of time since the earliest conclusive dementia symptoms were noticed by the caregivers. Depressive and other neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed by using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NP1)43 and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia.44

PET and MR image acquisition

[18F]-FEPPA was synthesized as previously described.15 All subjects underwent one [18F]-FEPPA PET scan and one MRI scan. The MRI scans of 14 healthy control subjects were acquired with a General Electric (Milwaukee, WI, USA) Signa 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner. The other 7 control subjects and all participants with AD had the T1 weighted images acquired on a 3-Tesla General Electric MR750 scanner. MRI acquisition parameters for both scanners have been described in detail elsewhere.45 The PD-weighted and T2 FLAIR scans were visually inspected for evidence of focal and vascular lesions including the presence of white matter hyperintensities, which was determined by following established criteria.46

The PET images were obtained for 125 min following the injection of [18F]-FEPPA using a 3D high-resolution research tomograph brain tomograph (CS/Siemens, Knoxville, TN, USA) as previously described.16 A dose of 181±15 mBq of intravenous [18F]-FEPPA was administered as a bolus for the PET scan. Blood samples were collected for genotyping of TSPO rs6971 polymorphism and for obtaining the arterial input function used for the kinetic analysis of [18F]FEPPA, as previously described.16

Regions of Interest (ROI)-based PET image analysis

The T1-weighted MRI scans were used for image co-registration with the PET image and for regions of interest (ROI) delineation. The differences in MRI acquisition parameters (1.5 T versus 3 T) did not have a significant effect on the [18F]-FEPPA outcome measure (data not shown).

The ROIs were automatically delineated as previously described.47 Grey matter ROIs known to be affected in AD were examined, including the temporal, prefrontal, occipital, parietal cortex and the hippocampus. We also explored the thalamus and cerebellum, which are typically affected only in the late stage of the disease.48 The definitions of these GM-ROIs were based on a neuroanatomical atlas of structural MRI and post-mortem tissue, as previously reported.49 The white matter ROIs (WM-ROIs) were defined according to the Johns Hopkins University DTI atlas in ICBM-152 space (ICBM-DTI81).50 Four relatively large WM-ROIs were selected for examination: the corpus callosum, the cingulum bundle, the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the posterior limb of the internal capsule.

The kinetics of [18F]-FEPPA were analyzed with a 2-tissue compartment model with total distribution volume (VT) as outcome measure16,51 by using PMOD software (PMOD Technologies, Zurich, Switzerland). A partial volume error correction (PVEC) method was applied to the time activity data of all subjects by using the Mueller–Gartner algorithm52 as previously implemented.53 The results of the study are reported by using dynamic PET images with and without PVEC.

Voxel-based PET image analysis

Parametric images of [18F]-FEPPA VT were generated by using the Logan graphical analysis method by applying a wavelet-based kinetic modeling approach that increases the signal-to-noise ratio without significantly affecting the resolution.54 Differences between diagnostic groups were tested using the two-sample T-test in statistical parametric mapping (SPM8- http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8). TSPO genotype and age were included as covariates. Significant clusters were thresholded at P &lt; 0.001.

DNA extraction and polymorphism genotyping

Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral leukocytes by using high salt-extraction methods.55 The polymorphism rs6971 was genotyped as described previously.18 Individuals with genotype Ala147/Ala147 were classified as HAB, Ala147/Thr147 as MAB and Thr147/Thr147 as LAB.56

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 17.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). Demographic variables and [18F]-FEPPA injected parameters were compared between the AD and healthy control groups using analysis of variance. Regional differences in [18F]-FEPPA VT between diagnostic groups were compared using factorial analysis of variance with TSPO genotype and age added as a covariate. The Cohen’s d for each GM- and WM-ROI was calculated to evaluate the effect sizes. Relationships between [18F]-FEPPA VT and clinical data were examined by using linear regression analyses; both genotype and age were added as covariates. As the analyses were performed with a number of cognitive measures, Bonferroni correction was applied (P&lt;0.005).

RESULTS

Study participants and TSPO binding affinity classes

Twenty-one participants with AD (age range: 47–81 years) and 21 healthy control subjects (age range: 45–82 years) completed all study procedures. Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1. The participants with AD were on average 7 years older than the healthy control subjects (F (1,40) = 5.54, P = 0.024). There were no significant associations between age and [18F]-FEPPA VT, as previously reported.45 Across the whole sample, anti-hypertensive and/or cholesterol lowering medications for the management of cardiovascular risk factors were taken by eight and six subjects, respectively. None had any history of significant medical illness, including hospitalization because of past cardiovascular events. Two participants with AD had severe white matter hyperintensities.46 Genetic analysis revealed 10 HAB, 8 MAB and 3 LAB in the AD group, and 14 HAB, 7 MAB and no LAB in the healthy control group. The three LABs were excluded from the analyses as their [18F]-FEPPA data were not quantifiable.18 The frequency of HAB and MAB was not significantly different between AD and healthy control group (X2 = 0.51, P = 0.48), even when the LAB were included in the analyses (X2 = 3.73, P = 0.15).

Differences in [18F]-FEPPA VT between the AD and healthy control subjects in the grey matter ROIs

Participants with AD had a significantly higher neuroinflammation than the healthy control subjects in the hippocampus, temporal, prefrontal, parietal and occipital cortex, after controlling for the effect of TSPO genotype and age (Table 2, Figure 1). The differences in [18F]-FEPPA VT were smaller and did not reach statistical significance in the cerebellum and thalamus, two regions that are typically affected in late phases of the disease (Table 2). In both groups, the effect of the rs6971 polymorphism was also significant in all grey matter ROIs, where HAB had a higher [18F]-FEPPA VT compared with MAB (Table 2, Supplementary Material Supplementary Table S1).

Differences in [18F]-FEPPA VT between the AD and healthy control subjects in the WM-ROI

Because of the lower uptake and slower washout of [18F]-FEPPA kinetics in the white matter regions, the TAC data from one healthy and two AD subjects could not be analyzed with the 2-tissue compartment model, and these subjects were excluded from these analyses.51

After controlling for the effect of both TSPO genotype and age, participants with AD had a significantly higher neuroinflammation than the healthy control subjects in the cingulum bundle and in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, but not in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, or the corpus callosum (Table 2, Figure 2). In both group, the effect of the rs6971 polymorphism was also significant, where HAB had higher [18F]-FEPPA VT compared with MAB in all the WM-ROI, except in the corpus callosum (Table 2, Supplementary Material Table S1).

Relationships between [18F]-FEPPA VT and disease severity, length of illness, neuropsychological scores and functional disability

The correlations between neuroinflammation in both GM and WM and severity or length of illness were not statistically significant. Across the grey matter ROIs, there were strong Bonferroni corrected significant negative associations between [18F]-FEPPA VT in the parietal cortex and repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status visuospatial scores (non-PVEC partial coefficient r (df = 12) = − 0.701, P = 0.005). However, the correlation did not survive Bonferroni correction in the PVEC images (partial coefficient r (df = 12) = − 0.682, P = 0.007; Figure 3a; Supplementary Material Supplementary Table S3). In addition, a significant negative Bonferroni corrected association was observed between the prefrontal cortex PVEC [18F]-FEPPA VT and visuospatial score (partial coefficient r (df = 12) = − 0.7, P = 0.005; Figure 3b; Supplementary Material Supplementary Table S3).

In the WM-ROI, there were significant correlations (Bonferroni corrected) between [18F]-FEPPA VT in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and both repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status language scores (partial coefficient r (df = 12) = − 0.718, P = 0.004; Figure 3c), and repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status visuospatial scores (partial coefficient r (df = 12) = − 0.766, P = 0.001; Figure 3d). With the non-partial volume corrected images, there was a correlation between [18F]-FEPPA VT in the temporal cortex and the planning subset of the Disability Assessment for Dementia scale (r (df = 12) = 0.523, P = 0.045). However, no significant correlations were seen between Disability Assessment for Dementia scores and [18F]-FEPPA VT in the WM-ROI (Supplementary Table S3).

Voxel-based analyses

Congruent with the ROI analyses, the voxel-based analysis revealed large clusters of increased neuroinflammation in AD in the temporal, prefrontal, occipital and parietal cortex. A summary of all significant clusters and the corresponding MNI coordinates regions, t-scores, z-scores and family wise corrected P-values from the t-statistical map is reported in the Supplementary Material.

DISCUSSION

Neuroinflammation, as indexed by [18F]-FEPPA binding to TSPO, was significantly higher in participants with AD than in healthy control subjects. In the grey matter, significant increases were observed in the hippocampus, prefrontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortex. In the white matter, significant increases were seen in the cingulum bundle and posterior limb of the internal capsule. Voxel-wise analyses confirmed the ROI-based results. Higher neuroinflammation in the parietal cortex was associated with greater impairment in visuospatial ability. Greater neuroinflammation in the posterior limb of the internal capsule was significantly associated with greater impairment in visuospatial, language, and memory function.

Our results are consistent with published histopathology studies, which found a elevated TSPO expression in the hippocampus, frontal and temporal cortex.7,57–59 The results are also consistent with findings from two previous PET studies using other second-generation TSPO radioligands,32,33 although there are notable differences in the methodology and demographic characteristic among the studies. In the study that used [11C]-DAA1106, the majority of patients with AD were not taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, and the results were not corrected for partial volume errors or adjusted for differences in binding affinity class.33 We do not have information on the biomarker evidence of AD pathology, such as the positive [11C]PIB brain uptake. However, another published TSPO PET study that had information about [11C]PIB binding reported a consistent magnitude of increase in [11C]PBR28 binding throughout the grey matter cortex in ‘PIB positive’ participants with AD as compared with ‘PIB negative’ healthy control subjects.32

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in vivo investigation of neuroinflammation using TSPO PET imaging in specific white matter regions in AD. A previous PET study using [11C]-PBR28 did not find an increase in TSPO binding in the whole brain white matter of patients with AD.32 However, a significant increase of activated microglia and inflammatory markers have been detected throughout white matter.60 A study in a transgenic mouse model of AD indicated that elevated microglia activation in the white matter might be associated with the absence of myelin basic protein.61 Although DTI studies have unequivocally showed that patients with AD have an extensive white matter microstructural damage,22 it is yet to be determined whether these white matter changes are related to increases in neuroinflammation. Consistent with our results, several studies have reported associations between the loss of integrity of white matter microstructure as measured by DTI and cognitive impairment in patients with AD.62–65 In some of these studies, a reduction in microstructural integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciulus and cingulum bundle were significantly correlated with lower performance on general cognitive tests, as well as performance on more specific cognitive domains, such as memory recall, verbal recognition and visuospatial function.62–66

The frequency and severity of white matter hyperintensities increase with age and are significantly higher in patients with AD.28,46 In our study, two AD patients (one HAB and one MAB) had severe white matter hyperintensities.46 The increase in [18F]-FEPPA binding in the AD group remained significant in both grey and WM-ROIs when these two AD subjects were excluded from the analysis (P&lt; 0.05). The associations between [18F]-FEPPA binding and scores of white matter hyperintensities are summarized in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary Table S4).

Previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding the relationship between neuroinflammation and severity of cognitive impairment.10,12,31–33 However, a recent study showed that a higher TSPO binding in the inferior parietal lobule, as measured with [11C]-PBR28 PET, was associated with an impaired performance on Block design, a test that measures visuospatial ability.32 We found consistent results in the visuospatial domain (Bonferroni corrected) although our study had somewhat different sample population, and the visuospatial function was assessed using a different scale. In addition, we also explored correlations between [18F]-FEPPA binding in other brain regions and cognitive functions. However, because we do not have the statistical power to test all of these correlations, we only considered correlations as true associations if they remained significant after the very strict Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (as shown in Supplementary Table S3). Previous PET studies measuring both beta-amyloid and TSPO in the same group of AD patients have generally shown significant associations between cognition and TSPO radioligand binding, but not [11C]-PIB binding.10,31 Thus, neuroinflammation may have a potential role as an imaging biomarker to predict cognitive impairment during the early phase of the disease. Future studies should test the associations between neuroinflammation and cognition in a larger sample along the continuum from normal to preclinical AD (that is, amnestic MCI) to AD dementia.

We did not detect significant associations between [18F]-FEPPA and severity or length of illness. The lack of association is consistent with the notion that elevated neuroinflammation is an early event in AD,9,67,68 which might increase with severity of dementia, but reach plateau in moderately affected cases.67 Similarly, elevated TSPO expression was detected in the early phase of AD9,12 before the occurrence of brain atrophy,9,69 or synaptic loss.70 Finally, the majority of our patients were in moderate stage of AD, a narrow severity range, which limits our ability to test the associations between [18F]-FEPPA binding and clinical severity.

As it is common with molecular imaging studies in humans, some caveats should be considered. First, as shown in Table 1, the amount of [18F]-FEPPA injected was significantly higher in participants with AD than healthy controls (F = 4.092, P = 0.05). However, there were no correlations between [18F]-FEPPA binding and the amount injected in all the GM and WM-ROI examined (r ⩽ − 0.1 and P&gt; 0.05 for all regions). Importantly, there were no differences in the specific activity and mass injected between the groups. Second, like many previous TSPO PET studies, we did not exclude patients with AD who were treated with a stable dose of memantine or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Although none of the participants with AD meet diagnostic criteria for mood disorders, almost half were taking anti-depressants. In-vitro evidence suggested that anti-depressants may have some anti-inflammatory effect on microglia response to inflammatory stimuli.71 However, there is so far no evidence on the effect of anti-depressants or donepezil on TSPO radioligand binding. Our post-hoc analyses showed that the group differences in [18F]-FEPPA binding remained significant for all grey matter ROIs (P &lt; 0.01) and WM-ROI (P &lt; 0.05), even excluding those who were taking anti-depressants. Finally, we did not estimate the plasma free fraction (fp) values for [18F]-FEPPA in the present study. However, VT values uncorrected for fp were still able to distinguish the AD group from controls. Further studies are required to determine if correcting VT values for fp further improve the ability of [18F]-FEPPA to distinguish increases in TSPO in AD.

In conclusion, AD patients have significantly elevated neuroinflammation throughout grey and white matter. The higher level of neuroinflammation was associated with greater cognitive impairment, especially in the visuospatial domain. Our ability to detect and quantify TSPO in the white matter regions will enable future examinations of the association between neuroinflammation and white matter microstructural abnormalities in AD. PET imaging with [18F]-FEPPA might be used in conjunction with other imaging biomarkers to evaluate the relationship between neuroinflammation and AD neuropathology, and possibly determine the consequences of neuroinflammation at different phases of the disease, particularly in patients at the preclinical stage.
