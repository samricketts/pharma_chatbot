Objectives

An increasing reliance on telemedicine for older adults with cognitive impairment requires a better understanding of the barriers and facilitators for this unique patient population.

Design

The study team queried PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov on May 1, 2020 for studies in English published from January 2010 to May 2020.

Setting and Participants

We conducted a systematic review of articles investigating the use of telemedicine among older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that focused on the patient and care partner perspectives.

Methods

Telemedicine encounter purpose, technological requirements, and findings regarding sensory needs were extracted. The Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias Tool was applied for quality assessment.

Results

The search yielded 3551 abstracts, from which 90 articles were reviewed and 17 were included. The purpose of telemedicine encounters included routine care, cognitive assessment, and telerehabilitation. All studies reported successful implementation of telemedicine, supported by patient and care partner satisfaction, similar results on cognitive assessment and diagnosis compared to in-person visits, and improvement in outcome measures following rehabilitation. 16 studies relied upon staff and care partners to navigate technologies. Six studies reported participants reporting difficulty hearing the provider during the telemedicine visits. Five studies excluded participants with visual or hearing impairment due to the potential difficulty of using telemedicine technology. No studies reported technological adaptations to account for sensory impairment.

Conclusions and Implications

Telemedicine is well-received among patients and care partners, but successful delivery incorporates support staff and the care partners to navigate technologies. The exclusion of older adults with sensory impairment, especially given that it is highly prevalent, in developing telemedicine systems may further exacerbate access to care in this population. Adapting technologies for sensory needs is critical to the advancement of accessible dementia care through telemedicine.

Introduction

Telemedicine has emerged as a rapidly expanding model of care for patients, including persons living with dementia and their care partners,1 especially in the setting of disrupted healthcare norms of the COVID-19 pandemic.2 Telemedicine via synchronous videoconferencing lends itself well to the clinical interview that is of primary importance in providing routine care for older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and allows clinicians a glimpse into the patient’s home environment3 while maintaining physical distancing to protect this high-risk group.4 The success of this model of care, however, is dependent on a patient’s reliable access to technology in addition to the ability to see, hear, and understand the clinician. 2,5 Telemedicine delivery in the home requires a smartphone, tablet, or computer, along with a stable internet connection and the ability to troubleshoot technological issues.2 From the user perspective, telemedicine requires patients to have adequate hearing and vision, along with motor and cognitive abilities to connect with providers and understand their treatment plan.5 These requirements pose a challenge for older adults with ADRD, who may have different needs when interacting with telemedicine systems due to age-related changes in sensory and cognitive abilities.5,6

Age-related hearing loss is highly prevalent, with a prevalence up to 90% in persons with dementia.7–9 However, age-related hearing loss often goes untreated. Hearing loss can complicate providers’ assessment of cognitive function,10,11 and these difficulties may be compounded in telemedicine encounters when patients are limited in their ability to optimize audio and visual quality in a novel situation.5 Telemedicine encounters that do not adequately account for hearing loss may risk inaccurate understanding of instructions and limit the patient or care partner’s ability to enact their treatment plan. In addition, cognitive impairment is a risk factor for non-use of technology among older adults.12 Visual impairment is also highly prevalent, with more than 30% of persons with dementia estimated to have vision impairment,13 and global population estimates for moderate/severe vision impairment at 2.1 million.14 Furthermore, 11.3% of older adults 80 years or older have dual sensory impairment, with significantly increased risk for dementia.15 Thus, age-related changes in sensory and cognitive abilities must be taken into account when delivering telemedicine.

Successful delivery of telemedicine also depends on the technological proficiencies of the care partner and the ability of the patient with ADRD to interact with the provider remotely. This added burden of technological proficiency that telemedicine requires may further limit the successful uptake of telemedicine as a modality for routine care among older adults with ADRD. Without the necessary adaptations to account for technological and sensory needs in this population, older adults with ADRD may be quickly left behind as telemedicine becomes increasingly relied upon in the future. Furthermore, accounting for technological and sensory needs in this population presents an opportunity to extend access to dementia care and reduce the burden of transportation, financial costs, and travel time for individuals and care partners.

Previous studies investigating the use of telemedicine for older adults with ADRD have largely focused on reducing the burden and stress of care partners, with relatively little focus on the patient experience.1 A closer examination of the unique issues regarding technological feasibility and sensory needs from a patient perspective may inform future efforts to support older adults with ADRD engaging in telemedicine. Given the growing population of older adults with dementia who face difficulty in navigating the health care system,16 improving telemedicine systems to adapt to the needs of this population is imperative. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review to understand the state of the literature on synchronous in-home or clinic video-based telemedicine visits for older adults with ADRD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and characterize technological barriers and facilitators in providing care that is responsive to their needs, including sensory related.

Methods

Literature Search Strategy

The study team queried PubMed via PubMed.gov, Embase via Embase.com, the Cochrane Library via Wiley, PsycINFO and CINAHL via EBSCOhost, and Scopus via Elsevier, and ClinicalTrials.gov on May 1, 2020 for studies in English published from January 2010 to May 2020. We chose 2010 as the starting point to understand how telemedicine technology has evolved in the past 10 years. This review adhered to the Primary Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Appendix 1).17 The team performed a pilot search in PubMed to identify key articles to build a search strategy that included relevant terminology. An informationist (CLP) trained in performing database searches for systematic reviews developed the search strategy of relevant terms that included both controlled vocabulary, where appropriate, and keyword terms for the concepts of ADRD or MCI and telemedicine. The complete search strategy is provided in Appendix 2. The initial search yielded 6414 studies, of which 2863 duplicates were removed, resulting in 3551 unique studies (Appendix 3).

Study Selection

Two reviewers (SJK and CP) independently screened the title and abstract for each article according to pre-defined criteria. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: 1) study population is focused on older adults with ADRD or MCI 2) intervention is a video-based synchronous telemedicine visit delivered at home or outside the home, 3) interventions and outcomes that involve direct participation by the older adult with ADRD or MCI, rather than the care partner alone, 4) published from 2010 to 2020, 5) written in English, and 6) full-text available. Studies were excluded if they met the following criteria: 1) study not written in English, 2) full-text unavailable, 3) wrong study design (review, not peer-reviewed), 4) wrong population (persons without MCI/ADRD, care partners are primary study population), 5) wrong intervention (mobile health apps, asynchronous telemedicine, primary focus on care partner support). Conference proceedings, abstract submissions, and graduate theses were excluded. All study desgns were considered as long as the manuscript included original data. Each title/abstract reviewed was categorized as “include for full-text review”, “maybe”, or “exclude.” Relevant systematic reviews or literature reviews were also included for the purpose of identifying additional articles. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion between both reviewers and adjudication by an independent third reviewer (CLN). Following title and abstract screening, the remaining studies underwent full-text screening. Two reviewers (SJK and CP) completed the full text-screen using a hierarchical method of exclusion with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer (CLN). Lastly, the reference lists of the included articles and systematic/literature reviews were examined to identify additional articles for inclusion.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

All study data were extracted using a standardized data collection form, which included the following: design (pilot study, randomization), study location, intervention location, sample size, recruitment method, participant inclusion/exclusion criteria, encounter purpose, intervention content, outcomes, staff/care partner requirements, technological requirements/issues, participant sensory impairment, and demographic characteristics. Significant methodological heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis of the included studies. Qualitative summary focused on intervention characteristics, technological requirements, and participant level characteristics.

The Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias tool was used for quality assessment as shown in Appendix 4. Criteria included random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias.18 Two reviewers (SJK and CP) independently assessed each of the included studies, rating them as ‘high’, ‘low’, or ‘unclear’ risk of bias for each criterion. Discrepancies in quality assessment were resolved by a third reviewer (CLN). For each domain, the support for judgment is detailed in Appendix 5. The full-text manuscripts for each study were used in summarizing the support for judgment. Among other domains included in the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, ‘blinding of participants and personnel’ as well as ‘other sources of bias’ were not included in this review. Blinding of participants and personnel was not possible given the nature of telemedicine interventions, and was therefore excluded from the assessment. All studies reported insufficient information to assess other sources of bias, so this domain was also excluded from Appendix 4.

Results

The initial search identified 3551 unique abstracts (PubMed 907, EMBASE 1947, Cochrane 527, PsycINFO 739, CINAHL Plus 755, Scopus 1498, Clinicaltrials.gov 41), from which 3461 were excluded in the initial title and abstract screen. Of the remaining 90 articles that underwent full-text review, 17 studies met inclusion criteria (Appendix 3).19

Appendix 6 summarizes key characteristics of the of the studies included in this review, which include 7 randomized pilot studies, 9 non-randomized pilot studies, and 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT).20 8 studies conducted telemedicine visits with participants at remote or satellite clinics connecting via video-conference with providers at hospitals or academic centers (e.g., university affiliated hospital, university affiliated clinic, or university research facilities).21–28 In 4 studies, both the participant and provider were located at hospitals or academic centers.29–32 A smaller number of studies conducted telemedicine visits in the home setting20,33,34 or at adult day care centers and nursing homes.35,36 Included studies were published between 2011–2020, with 8 studies published in the US,22,24,26–28,32–34 followed by Canada,21,25,29 Australia,20,31 Italy,30,36 Portugal,35 and South Korea.23 5 studies randomized participants to in-person visit vs. telemedicine,20,25,29,31,36 while 3 studies randomized the order in which participants underwent both in-person and telemedicine visits.26,32,33 The majority of studies recruited participants through outpatient clinics,20,26,27,30,33,34,36 health/clinic/study registries,23,32,35 or community-based organizations,20,29 while others required a referral or consultation request from a geriatrician21 or primary care provider.22,24,25,28,31 Sample sizes ranged from 6 to 427 with a median of 94.23,29 Among studies reporting study duration, studies lasted on average 23 months. Among studies reporting intervention duration, the intervention period lasted on average 3 months (Appendix 7).

Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was the most commonly used cognitive screening tool.20–22,30,32

Intervention Characteristics

In the majority of studies, the purpose of the telemedicine encounter was to provide routine care for participants with cognitive impairment (Appendix 6). Components of routine care included administering cognitive screening, medication review and initiation, follow up to therapy, assessing changes in symptoms, and providing care partner support and education.21–25,27,28,31,34 A minority of studies performed cognitive screening21,24,31 and measurement of vitals21,24,27 as part of an in-person check-in prior to the telemedicine visit.

Five studies administered cognitive screening via telemedicine where the primary objective was to assess the reliability or acceptability of these measures as an alternative to in-person assessment.26,30,32,33,35 The MMSE was the most commonly administered cognitive assessment via telemedicine.26,30,32

Three studies provided rehabilitation services through telemedicine focused on cognitive exercises and addressing care challenges with care partners.20,29,36

Outcome measures – feasibility, acceptability, reliability

Feasibility of telemedicine was a focus of 14 out of 17 studies, which reported feasibility of the telemedicine intervention (Appendix 7). Fourteen of 14 studies reporting feasibility found that the telemedicine intervention was feasible (Appendix 7). The most commonly used feasibility measure was participant satisfaction used in 7 studies.21,22,24,25,27,34,36 Acceptability was measured in 7 of 17 studies with all 7 studies reporting telemedicine was acceptable.24,25,29,30,32,34,35 Two of 7 studies administered acceptability surveys to participants,30,32 while 4 of 7 used participant satisfaction to measure acceptability,24,25,34,35 and 1 of 7 compared improvement in occupational performance measures after telerehabilitation vs. rehabilitation in-person.29 Four studies of 17 studies reported reliability measures by comparing cognitive assessment scores administered in-person vs. via telemedicine, with all 4 reporting telemedicine administration was reliable.26,30,33,35

Outcome measures – routine care and diagnosis

Among 9 studies focused on routine care, assessments via telemedicine allowed providers to diagnose cognitive impairment in participants in 6 studies.22,24,25,27,28,31 None of the included studies explicitly discussed misdiagnoses due to inability to examine a patient. In one study that employed telemedicine vs. in-person assessment for the purpose of diagnosis, the difference in agreement between the telemedicine group and in-person group was 1%, suggesting no substantial difference in diagnosis between the methods of assessment.31

Outcome measures – cognitive assessments

Among 5 studies administering cognitive assessments, all studies reported administering these measures via telemedicine was a reliable or acceptable alternative to in-person assessment with similar results on cognitive assessment comparing telemedicine to in-person visits.26,30,32,33,35

Outcome measures – telerehabilitation

Among 3 studies using telemedicine for rehabilitation, all studies reported improvement in outcome measures after completing the intervention via telemedicine.20,29,36 Outcomes included improvement in Canadian Occupational Performance Measure,29 increase in MMSE score and episodic memory,36 and improvement in the caregiving mastery index.20

Outcome measures – satisfaction rates

Thirteen out of 17 studies reported participant satisfaction with telemedicine, with favorable satisfaction ratings but overall low response rates (Appendix 8). Studies did not use a uniform scoring system for satisfaction questionnaires. One study reported 65% of patients and 91% of care partners responding to satisfaction surveys preferred to see the specialist via telemedicine than in person.24 Another study reported that among patients and care partners responding to surveys, 100% of patients and 100% of care parnters preferred not driving for their care.27 In this study, the estimated mean (SD) round trip distance saved in miles was 67.1 (39.7), and the estimated mean round trip on the road saved in minutes was 74.5 (43.2).27 In addition, another study reporting miles traveled for clinic vists found that the mean (SD) miles traveled was 48.8 (38.70) in the in-person group compared to 2.9 (7.24) in the telemedicine group.34

Technological Requirements

Technological requirements and the role of support staff and care partners varied across participant telemedicine locations (Appendix 9). Among telemedicine visits conducted at home,20,33,34 all included a pre-visit orientation with study staff to install software, conduct test runs, and troubleshoot technological difficulties through a home visit20 or phone conversation.33,34 In addition, 2 studies provided additional, real-time support during the telemedicine visit via telephone in case participants or providers experienced technological difficulties.20,34 Studies conducting telemedicine visits in adult day care centers and nursing homes incorporated support staff who assisted the patient in performing the physical exam under the guidance of the provider.35,36

Eleven studies required care partner participation during telemedicine visits (Appendix 9). For studies conducting telemedicine visits in participant homes, care partners played a key role in facilitating the telemedicine encounter.20,33,34 One study reported care partners were instructed on how to modify the home environment to minimize distractions and maximize sound quality.33

For in-home telemedicine, other participant requirements included having a computer, tablet, or phone with internet access capable of operating the telemedicine software.20,33,34 In cases where participants did not own the necessary equipment, study staff loaned tablets with the telemedicine software installed. One study reported that lack of access to computers and broadband in addition to limited experience with computers were among reasons for participants declining telemedicine.34 For studies conducted outside the home, all necessary equipment were provided by the healthcare facility (Appendix 9).

Among studies reporting technological difficulties, connection and audio issues were most commonly reported. Connectivity issues included images freezing, delay in sound, echoing, and static noises.21,24,25,29,30 Six of 17 studies, reported audio difficulties, with participants reporting difficulty hearing the provider during the telemedicine visits.21,24,25,27,29,35 One study reported visits being terminated due to hearing difficulties, and that problems with rural internet connectivity prevented delivery of in-home telemedicine.27 The visual quality of telemedicine visits was reported as an issue in 4 of 17 studies.24,25,29,35 Three out of 17 studies reported exclusion of participants due to technologic reasons [(n=1 of 210),31 (n=63 of 222),34 (n=2 dyads of 33 dyads)33]. One out of these three studies reported the specific reasons, which included not having a home computer (n=46 out of 222), not being comfortable with computers (n=12 out of 222), and computers being too old or lacking broadband service (n=5 out of 222).34

Participant Characteristics

Five studies excluded participants with visual or hearing impairment due to the potential difficulty of using telemedicine technology in this population (Appendix 10).22,26,30,32,33 These studies did not include details on how they defined visual or hearing impairment. 5 of 17 studies did not include any language on the potential role of sensory impairment in delivering telemedicine.20,23,29,31,34 Among studies that did not exclude participants on the basis of sensory impairment, 5 of 17 studies reported communication challenges due to hearing loss.21,24,25,27,35 No studies reported adapting telemedicine equipment with headsets or amplification devices to mitigate communication challenges due to sensory impairment. Two of 17 studies reported challenges due to visual impairment.24,35 No studies adapted for visual impairment.

Quality Assessment

Among the domains assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, the ‘incomplete outcome data’ domain had the greatest number of studies rated as “high risk” of bias (Appendix 4). Fourteen out of 17 studies had at least one domain with high risk of bias,21,22,33–36,23–28,30,32 while 2 out of 17 studies had low risk of bias across all assessed domains.20,31

Discussion

The purpose of this review was to understand the current state of the literature on the barriers and facilitators related to telemedicine use among older adults with cognitive impairment and their care partners with an emphasis on the technological requirements and accommodations for sensory needs, specifically hearing loss and visual impairment. Although substantial heterogeneity existed in the location of telemedicine encounters, participant characteristics, and measurement of outcomes, all studies demonstrated successful use of telemedicine for the purpose of routine care, cognitive assessment, or rehabilitation in older adults with ADRD or MCI. Significant barriers to telemedicine in this population included meeting technological requirements and adapting for sensory needs. Technological barriers included both the lack of equipment and the older adult’s ability to manipulate technologies independently. To address this difficulty, the majority of studies relied on support staff or the care partner as facilitators to set up the necessary equipment and troubleshoot technological issues. Sensory needs, such as hearing and vision-related communication difficulties, were highlighted in multiple studies as a barrier to successful uptake of telemedicine. However, strategies to mitigate these challenges were lacking. Further research is needed to develop solutions for sensory-related communication challenges in telemedicine encounters. Lastly, most telemedicine encounters occurred between healthcare facilities (provider at hospital connected to patients at remote clinics), likely due to difficulties in reimbursement for telemedicine visits. As in-home delivery of telemedicine has significantly increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be a growing need for continued research on improving in-home delivery of telemedicine, which will become a more routine part of clinical care.2,37

To facilitate the successful uptake of telemedicine technology among older adults with ADRD or MCI in the home, prior training and provision of equipment are key. In studies conducting telemedicine visits in the home, equipment set-up, orientation, and test-run prior to the telemedicine encounter helped familiarize users to the telemedicine environment. Individuals with dementia have progressive difficulty processing and responding to stimuli and stress may be caused by changes in routine and the environment.38,39 Care partners can play a key role in optimizing the home environment for telemedicine by minimizing clutter and background noise and simplifying tasks for the person with dementia. Orientation and training prior to the encounter can help set clear expectations for the care partner and reduce the novelty of the situation for the person with dementia. Patients and care partners can also provide valuable ideas for the development of new functions and services in telemedicine platforms to ensure the developments are user driven. Additional keys for success include loaning equipment such as tablets with software, arranging a backup plan through a phone conversation in case there are connection difficulties, and providing real-time assistance via telephone or a telemedicine platform that supports 3-way visits. For patients with hearing loss, the development of captioned services on telemedicine platforms can help to maximize communication accessibility, and captioning that uses automatic speech recognition is available through multiple videoconferencing platforms.40 Providers can aim to keep visits short35 and have a mechanism in place to deliver materials for the patient and care partner to review. For patients with visual impairment, electronic magnification and text to speech technology on smartphones or tablets may be used. Additionally, providers and care partners can modify the environment by improving lighting and reducing glare on screens.

Successful implementation of telemedicine systems for older adults requires consideration of user needs and their interaction with technology (Figure 1).5 One potential area for development in accommodating the needs of older adults is adapting technologies that account for sensory impairments. Potential adaptations for hearing loss may include integrating headsets, speakers, or personal sound amplifiers in the telemedicine system that patients and care partners can adjust according to their hearing needs as well as the default use of closed captions via automatic speech recognition.41–43 Additionally, support staff may benefit from specialized training in communicating with older adults with cognitive and sensory impairment. For visual impairment, support staff and providers can improve communication by using verbal descriptions without relying solely on gestures and facial experessions. Including a human factors engineer in the team can also be helpful in facilitating the adaptation of telemedicine technology.44 Given that hearing loss affects up to 90% older adults with ADRD and vision impairment affects more than 30% of persons with dementia,7–9,13 adapting telemedicine technologies to account for sensory changes has the potential to significantly improve the quality of telemedicine for these individuals. Increased satisfaction during telemedicine encounters, in turn, has the potential to better equip older adults to understand and enact their treatment plans. The exclusion of older adults with sensory impairment, particularly given that it is highly prevalent, in developing telemedicine systems limits the ability to optimize communication for these individuals and may further exacerbate access to care in this population. As in-home delivery of telemedicine continues to become a part of routine medical care, adapting technologies for sensory needs not only presents an opportunity to improve care for older adults with ADRD, but also improve care for older adults more generally experiencing sensory impairment.

Improving telemedicine in the near-term also has the benefit of reducing the burden of transportation and trips outside of the home for persons with dementia and their care partners. However, recent literature reporting the impact of physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted increased stress for care partners and discontinuation of regular cognitive and physical therapies for persons with dementia.45 Another study found that long periods of physical isolation seem to exacerbate neuropsychiatric symptoms for older adults living with dementia.46 In-home delivery of telemedicine also reduces the concern for exposure and spread of COVID-19. The conveniences of telemedicine may help alleviate these immediate difficulties and reduce care partner stress in part reducing barriers to seeking care by eliminating travel to medical appointments and other in-person therapies.

Several recent studies have also demonstrated the importance and benefits of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic.47 One study found that telemedicine by video conference was associated with improved resilience and wellbeing to both participants with neurocognitive disorders and care partners at home, highlighting the potential role of telemedicine as an acceptable approach to dementia care.47 Another study found that television-based telehealth support demonstrated potential for cognitive stimulation by providing access to COVID-19 information, recreational activities, and memory exercises.48 Benefits of telemedicine have been reported in dementia subtypes, including frontotemporal dementia, where telemedicine demonstrated validity as a triage tool to increase practice outreach and efficiency.49 Although telemedicine has demonstrated its many benefits during the current crisis, long-term considerations to address barriers to telemedicine care deserve equal attention in its potential to improve the accessibility of care for patients with dementia and their care partners.

Limitations and future research

There are several limitations in the current literature on telemedicine for older adults with ADRD. The majority of studies implemented telemedicine between healthcare facilities rather than in the home. Given that the technological and personnel requirements for conducting telemedicine visits are fundamentally different at a healthcare facility vs. in-home, further research is needed to better characterize technological barriers for older adults with cognitive impairment in the home. Additionally, this review included a focus on barrier and facilitiators to telemedicine with an emphasis on technological requirements as well as sensory needs, specifically hearing and vision. This review did not consider other potential individual-level barriers to telemedicine that can be experienced by persons with dementia, such as apraxia.

Regarding cognitive assessment, MMSE was the most commonly used instrument among the included studies. Given that individuals who appear to lack clinically significant cognitive deficits assessed by the MMSE may demonstrates deficits when assessed using other cognitive tests such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) or Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS),50 cognitive assessment to identify participants with MCI for inclusion may have been inadequate when limited to the MMSE.

An additional limitation is that among studies reporting race/ethnicity, education level, or socioeconomic position, participants were predominantly self-identified as white and were educated individuals from higher socioeconomic backgrounds familiar with using technology.22,28–30 No studies accounted for how factors that are known drivers of technology acceptance among older adults, such as eHealth literacy,51 technology self-efficacy and preferences and prior experiences,5,52–54 may influence the feasibility and acceptability of telemedicine. Given that minority and low-income adults have lower rates of high-tech device use,55–57 further research is needed to understand the unique barriers, needs, and facilitators to telemedicine in these populations and help ensure that strategies to implement telemedicine are responsive to the needs and preferences of diverse groups with varied preferences and experience with technology. An individualized user functional assessment may be used prior to the telemedicine encounter to better understand the specific sensory and technological needs of the patient and care partner. Using this knowledge of patient-specific barriers to care, members of the interdisciplinary care team may reach out in advance to address these specific barriers. This patient-specific plan might involve orienting care partners to telemedicine, providing necessary equipment or captioned services as outlined in Figure 1.

Lastly, given that response rates to satisfaction surveys were low as seen in Appendix 5, findings on high satisfaction with telemedicine among participants and care partners warrant careful consideration. A potential reason for non-response may have been lower satisfaction with telemedicine. Potential reasons for lower satisfaction may include the lack of in-person interaction with a provider which may be motivating and therapeutic. While telemedicine may reduce the need for travel, it also reduces social interactions outside of the home, which may have beneficial effects for the patient and care partner. In addition, patients may be concerned about the potential for missed diagnoses due to the inability to examine a patient in-person. Further studies may consider efforts to increase response rates to satisfaction surveys by administering questionnaires within the telemedicine encounter to understand further barriers to telemedicine use as well as targeting evaluations from non-responders or individuals who were unsatisfied to characterize the spectrum of patient and care partner experiences.

Conclusions and Implications

This systematic review characterizes the barriers and facilitators in providing care through telemedicine for older adults with cognitive impairment. Telemedicine is well-received among patients and care partners with high satisfaction rates. Successful in-home delivery of telemedicine relies upon support staff and the care partner to navigate technologies. Notably, technological adaptations for sensory needs among older adults is lacking. Technological adaptations, particularly those that respond to the unique needs of users, are critical to the advancement of accessible dementia care through telemedicine.58
