This study examined 5-year changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity, and sedentary time in mid-to-late aged adults. Fifty-seven participants completed baseline and follow-up treadmill exercise tests and physical activity monitoring. We observed a 14% decline in fitness (p &lt; 0.001), 12% decrease in physical activity (p = 0.010), and non-significant increase in sedentary time (p = 0.196). Age was negatively associated with 5-year change in physical activity (r = −0.31; p = 0.02) and this decline was strongest among APOE ε4 carriers (g = −0.75).

Novelty:

Cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity significantly declined from mid-to-late adulthood, these findings were most pronounced among older adults and those with genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease.

Résumé :

Cette étude a examiné les changements sur cinq ans de l’aptitude cardiorespiratoire, de l’activité physique et du temps sédentaire chez les adultes d’âge moyen à avancé. Cinquante-sept participants ont effectué des tests de base et de suivi consistant en un exercice sur tapis roulant et se sont soumis à une surveillance de l’activité physique. Nous avons observé une baisse de 14 % de l’aptitude physique (p &lt; 0,001), une diminution de 12 % de l’activité physique (p = 0,010) et une augmentation non significative du temps sédentaire (p = 0,196). L’âge était négativement associé à une variation sur cinq ans de l’activité physique (r = −0,31; p = 0,02) et cette baisse était la plus forte parmi les porteurs APOE ε4 (g = −0,75).

pmcIntroduction

There is increasing recognition that a physically active lifestyle may delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Work from our group has demonstrated cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity are associated with several indices of brain health (e.g., biomarkers of AD, cognition) (Dougherty et al. 2016, 2017a, 2017b, 2020, 2021) and exercise interventions have shown to have favorable effects on brain and cognitive outcomes (Gaitán et al. 2019; Erickson et al. 2011). Indeed, several working groups have concluded that exercise and physical activity show promise for therapeutic approaches to delay cognitive decline and AD progression (Livingston et al. 2020; Yaffe 2018). There is a need to better understand how these modifiable factors change over time, particularly as adults transition from mid-to-late adulthood, a period of aging where modifiable factors can be targeted in attempt to delay disease progression. Although studies have shown cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity decreases in older adulthood, the preponderance of available data are limited by reliance on self-reported questionnaires and use of cross-sectional designs to estimate age-related decline (Kaminsky et al. 2015; Troiano et al. 2008; Caspersen et al. 2000). The present study utilized repeat maximal exercise testing with metabolic measurement and accelerometry to investigate 5-year changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity, and sedentary time in mid-to-late aged adults. Further, we aimed to characterize the impact of age, sex, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 allele (APOE ε4) carrier status within our sample.

Materials and methods

Participants

Fifty-seven adults from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP) volunteered to participate. The WRAP is a longitudinal registry of mid-to-late aged community-dwelling adults with AD risk factors resulting in a higher prevalence of APOE ε4 carriage (~40%) than the general population (~20%) (Johnson et al. 2018; Rajan et al. 2017). For the current study, potential participants were determined to be eligible for inclusion if they were cognitively unimpaired, free of confounding medical conditions (e.g., neurological disease), and were deemed safe for exercise testing procedures [see: (Dougherty et al. 2018)]. Enrolled participants underwent baseline and follow-up maximal exercise testing and physical activity monitoring. APOE ε4 carrier status was determined through polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping and classified as carriage of at least 1 APOE ε4 allele. Trained staff administered all assessments following standardized protocols. The University of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures, and all participants signed written informed consent at each examination.

Cardiorespiratory fitness assessment

Exercise testing procedures have been previously described (Dougherty et al. 2018). In brief, the exercise tests were completed on a motor driven treadmill using a modified Balke protocol. During the exercise test, oxygen consumption (V.O2), carbon dioxide production (V.CO2), minute ventilation (V.E), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were measured using a metabolic cart (TrueOne 2400 Parvomedics, Sandy, UT) and a 2-way non-rebreathing mask. Heart rate (HR) was continuously measured through a 12-channel ECG device (Schiller CS-200 Exercise Stress System, Baar, Switzerland). Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and blood pressure (Welch Allyn DS-6601–300, Skaneateles Falls, NY) were recorded at 2-minute intervals throughout the exercise test. V.O2peak was defined as the highest V.O2 value recorded during the final stage of the exercise test when at least 2 of the following criteria were met: (1) RER ≥ 1.1, (2) change in V.O2 &lt; 200 mL with an increase in work, (3) rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 17 or greater, and (4) achieving at least 90% of age predicted maximal heart rate (220 – age). The oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES), a measure of exercise efficiency, was determined for each participant by calculating the regression slope from the linear relationship of absolute V.O2 (L·min−1) plotted as a function of log10 V.E (L·min−1) V.O2 = log10 (V.E + b) providing a measure of cardiopulmonary performance that integrates cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and respiratory function (Baba et al. 1996). We have previously shown that OUES is a valid and reliable measure that does not require achievement of maximal effort, therefore, it facilitates the inclusion of participants who do not meet the previously described standardized V.O2peak criteria (Dougherty et al. 2018). Normalized V.O2peak and OUES values adjusted for body mass (mL/kg/min) and body surface area (BSA), respectively, were the cardiorespiratory fitness outcome variables of interest.

Physical activity assessment

All participants wore a triaxial GT3X+ accelerometer (Actigraph, Pensacola, FL) on their hip for 7 consecutive days during all waking hours, except for when showering, swimming, or bathing. Standard accelerometry inclusion criteria consisted of at least 10 hours of valid wear time per day for a minimum of 3 weekdays and 1 weekend day (Troiano et al. 2008). Accelerometer data (in 1-second epochs) were processed using the validated Sojourn-3 Axis method, which uses an artificial neural net to identify boundaries between activities of different intensities and to estimate metabolic equivalents (METs) for each bout (Lyden et al. 2014). To calculate minutes spent in different intensity categories of physical activity, estimated METs were determined for each bout interval and then separated into physical activity categories accordingly: &lt;1.5 METs = sedentary, 1.5–2.99 METs = light, 3–6 METs = moderate and &gt;6 METs = vigorous. Consistent with public health recommendations, moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time were the physical activity measures of interest.

Statistical analyses

Participant characteristics were summarized with means, standard deviations, and frequencies. A repeated measures model was used to investigate 5-year changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity, and sedentary time. Hedge’s g effect sizes and bivariate correlations were used to examine the magnitude of changes and their associations with age. Exploratory analyses investigated effect size differences due to sex and APOE ε4 carrier status. Statistical significance was set at an alpha level of 0.05. All analyses were conducted in SPSS v 26.

Results

Fifty-seven cognitively unimpaired (MMSE = 24–30) participants underwent baseline (mean age 63.81± 6.1) and follow-up (mean age 68.52± 6.1) exercising testing and physical activity monitoring 4.7± 0.4 years apart (range: 3.10–5.16 years). Additional participant characteristics are detailed in Table 1. Seven participants were excluded due to exercise testing safety concerns (e.g., arrythmia, dyspnea, hypertension); resulting in an analytic sample of 50 participants with complete baseline and follow-up exercise testing data and 57 with repeat physical activity monitoring data. From the analytic samples, 80% (n = 40) of participants satisfied peak effort exercise testing criteria at baseline and follow-up and all participants (n = 57) met accelerometer wear-time inclusion at both visits. Baseline and follow-up exercise testing and physical activity data are described in Table 2. We observed a 14.5% decline in OUES (g = −0.88; p &lt; 0.001), 14.2% decline in V.O2peak (g = −1.21; p &lt; 0.001), 12.2% decline in MVPA (g = −0.35; p = 0.010), and non-significant 2.1% increase in sedentary time (g = 0.17; p = 0.196). Baseline age was negatively associated with 5-year changes in MVPA (r = −0.31; p = 0.02) but not sedentary time, OUES, or V.O2peak (all p &gt; 0.05). There were no baseline differences between APOE ε4 carrier status. APOE ε4 positive adults showed larger declines in MVPA (baseline hours/day= 1.58± 0.54, follow-up hours/day= 1.29±0.56; g = −0.75) than those without genetic risk (baseline hours/day= 1.39± 0.65, follow-up hours/day= 1.31± 0.58; g= −0.14). No other genetic or sex differences were observed.

Discussion

We examined 5-year changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity, and sedentary time in cognitively unimpaired mid-to-late aged adults. This study found that OUES, V.O2peak and MVPA significantly declined during the transition from late-middle age to older adulthood. Further, our preliminary data suggest physical activity decline may be most pronounced in older adults and APOE ε4 carriers. These data provide objective measurement of age-related declines in cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity over a critical period of aging when clinical symptoms of AD are absent, but pathophysiological brain changes are likely occurring. Because these modifiable factors have been linked to future AD risk and other age-related outcomes (e.g., physical frailty, activities of daily living) (Yaffe 2018; Livingston et al. 2020; McPhee et al. 2016), mid-late life appears to be a period of particular importance to maintain a physically active lifestyle as our data suggest that declines in cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity are expected.

At baseline, our subsample had an OUES value of 1.24, a V.O2peak of 28.26 mL/kg/min, engaged in 1.48 hours a day of MVPA and spent 10.9 hours a day sedentary, values that are representative of national normative data (Kaminsky et al. 2015; Hollenberg and Tager 2000; Matthews et al. 2018). Follow-up testing revealed a ~14% decrease in cardiorespiratory fitness (~3% decline per year), which is a faster rate of decline than the 10% per decade rate (~1% decline per year) routinely described in cross-sectional studies (Kaminsky et al. 2015; Hawkins and Wiswell 2003). With respect to physical activity behaviors, we observed a 12% decline in MVPA (~2% annual rate of change) and non-significant changes in sedentary time. The overall decline in self-reported physical activity with advancing age has been long observed (Caspersen et al. 2000); however, the advent of the accelerometer has led to more precise measures on intensity-specific physical activity (Matthews et al. 2018). In older adults, cross-sectional studies describe ~1% annual rate of change in self-reported physical activity (Caspersen et al. 2000) and around ~4% with respect to accelerometer-measured MVPA (Troiano et al. 2008). The dramatic declines we report are robust given the sophisticated accelerometry processing techniques, that OUES is an effort-independent measure, and that traditional V.O2peak criteria such as RER and RPE at follow-up exceeded values recorded at baseline.

Recent studies that utilize within-subject designs have reported similar rates of decline in cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity to that observed in the present study (Pentikäinen et al. 2019; Fleg et al. 2005; Pettee Gabriel et al. 2018). Our findings add to a limited body of research and objectively details the longitudinal changes in OUES, V.O2peak, and accelerometer-measured MVPA and sedentary time in mid-to-late aged adults including those with genetic risk for AD. Notably, these changes were observed over an important period of aging where targeting modifiable factors may mitigate pathophysiological brain changes and postpone the onset of clinical symptoms. Further, our preliminary data suggests APOE ε4 carriers may experience a greater decline in physical activity from late-middle age to older adulthood, suggesting physical activity may be an important modifiable risk factor to target as these adults are at greatest need for interventions to slow disease progression. Strategies aimed at promoting cardiorespiratory fitness (e.g., exercise training) and physical activity in mid-late adulthood are warranted.
