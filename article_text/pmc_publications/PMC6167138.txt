Objective

The presence of psychosis in Alzheimer disease denotes an Alzheimer disease phenotype with more rapid cognitive deterioration than that which is present in Alzheimer disease without psychosis. Discovery of novel pharmacotherapies which engage therapeutic targets for prevention or treatment of Alzheimer disease with psychosis would benefit from identifying the neurobiology of resilience to psychosis in Alzheimer disease.

Method

Quantitative immunohistochemistry was used to measure multiple neuropathologies in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from early and middle-stage Alzheimer disease subjects who differed based on psychosis status. Synaptic proteins were quantified by liquid-chromatography/mass spectrometry in gray matter homogenates from these subjects and from neuropathologically unaffected subjects. The synaptic proteome was similarly evaluated in cortical gray matter homogenate and postsynaptic density fractions from an APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mouse model of amyloidosis with germline reduction in Kalrn, which was previously shown to confer resilience to progression of psychosis-associated behaviors relative to APPswe/PSEN1dE9 alone.

Results

Alzheimer disease subjects without psychosis had higher levels of synaptic proteins compared to Alzheimer disease subjects with psychosis and to control subjects. Neuropathologic burden predicted less than 20% of the variance in psychosis status and did not account for the synaptic protein level differences between groups. Reduction of Kalrn in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice resulted in higher levels of synaptic proteins in cortical homogenate and normalized protein levels in the postsynaptic density.

Conclusions

Accumulation of synaptic proteins, particularly those which are enriched in the postsynaptic density, is associated with resilience to psychosis in Alzheimer disease. One candidate mechanism for this synaptic proteome compensation is alteration in levels of proteins which facilitate the transport of synaptic proteins to and from the postsynaptic density.


Introduction

Psychotic symptoms occur in ~40-60% of individuals with Alzheimer Disease (1). The occurrence of psychosis in Alzheimer disease is heritable (2), and identifies an Alzheimer disease phenotype in which patients experience more rapid cognitive decline and elevated mortality compared to Alzheimer disease patients without psychosis (3). In addition, Alzheimer disease patients with psychosis exhibit greater functional impairment, are more likely to be institutionalized during illness, and experience higher rates of additional neuropsychiatric disturbances including aggression, agitation and depression (3). Current empirically developed treatments for psychosis in Alzheimer disease have limited efficacy, do not alter the more rapid disease progression, and are associated with substantial toxicity, including excess mortality (3). Because the annual incidence of psychosis in Alzheimer disease is only ~10% (4), there is a window of opportunity to intervene to prevent psychosis onset. However, capitalizing on this opportunity first requires identifying the underlying neurobiology of resilience to psychosis in Alzheimer disease.

The hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer disease are fibrillar deposits of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau. A number of studies have examined the association of these measures with psychosis in Alzheimer disease, with most finding reduced phosphorylated tau burden to be protective (3). However, as a group these studies have several important limitations. For example, past investigations have over-relied on subjects with end stage disease, despite clinical evidence that the most rapid increase in rates of psychosis in Alzheimer disease occurs in early to middle stages (5, 6). In addition, studies often did not utilize uniform histologic procedures or unbiased quantitative measures of neuropathologic burden (7). Importantly, additional core processes contributing to Alzheimer disease, such as neuroinflammation and microglial activation (8, 9), or synapse dysfunction (10, 11), have been largely unexamined in relationship to Alzheimer disease with psychosis. This latter omission is particularly glaring given that multiple neuroimaging studies have indicated relative preservation of neocortical synaptic structure and function in Alzheimer disease without psychosis relative to Alzheimer disease with psychosis, including greater perfusion (12–14) and metabolism (15, 16), and higher gray matter density (17). Finally, only a subset of prior studies has considered the role of common comorbid pathologies such as the presence of Lewy bodies, TDP-43 inclusions, and vascular lesions.

We therefore used a combination of immunohistochemical and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approaches to assess levels of multiple neuropathologic and synaptic markers in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from early- and mid-stage Alzheimer disease subjects who differed based on psychosis status. We chose to examine dorsolateral prefrontal cortex based on findings from neuroimaging and neuropathologic studies which have detected increased metabolism and perfusion, and lower fibrillar tau aggregation in Alzheimer disease subjects without psychosis compared to Alzheimer disease subjects with psychosis in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (3). We determined that neuropathologic disease burden accounts for less than 20% of the variance in psychosis status, but detected a novel signature of resilience - accumulation of synaptically expressed proteins - in Alzheimer disease without psychosis compared both to Alzheimer disease with psychosis and to unaffected controls. Finally, we confirmed our proteome findings in a murine model of Aβ overproduction exhibiting resilience to progression of psychosis associated behaviors.

Method

Subjects

We studied 140 Alzheimer disease subjects and 12 Control subjects (Table 1, SA1). Psychosis was defined as the presence of delusions or hallucinations at any visit.

Sample collection and neuropathologic assessment

For all subjects, gray matter samples from the right superior frontal gyrus of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were dissected, frozen at −80°C and processed for LC-MS/MS. For Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) subjects, the corresponding left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was used for immunostaining and further processed for neuropathologic studies as described (SA2). Neuropathologic diagnoses of Alzheimer Disease were made according to CERAD criteria (18), although all Alzheimer disease subjects also met NIA-Reagan criteria (19) for intermediate to high probability that their dementia was due to Alzheimer disease lesions. For unaffected (control) subjects, an experienced neuropathologist reviewed sections from the frontal pole, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and cerebellum stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Bielschowsky silver stain, and amyloid β immunohistochemistry to confirm that there was no evidence of neurodegenerative disease (SA2).

Quantitative Immunohistochemistry

Five-μm-thick, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were immunostained on an automated stainer (Discovery Ultra, Ventana, Tucson, AZ) using the following primary antibodies as described (SA3): PHF-1, oligomeric tau T22, beta-amyloid NAB228, and microglial markers Iba1 and HLA-DR. All slides were developed using a multimeric HRP/DAB detection system (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). No counterstaining was performed to ease signal quantification.

Microscopy

Whole slide digital images of the immunostained sections were created using a Mirax MIDI slide scanner (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at 40x resolution (0.116 micron/pixel). Digital image analysis was performed using NearCyte software (Andrew Lesniak, University of Pittsburgh) as described (Figure 1, SA4). All analyses were done blinded to psychosis status.

Animals and tissue preparation for LC/MS-MS

APPswe/PSEN1dE9 males were mated to Kalrn+/− females at University of Pittsburgh to obtain four genotypes as previously described (20) (SA5): APPswe/PSEN1dE9/Kalrn+/+ (APP/PS1/KALRN(+/+)), APPswe/PSEN1dE9/Kalrn+/− (APP/PS1/KALRN(+/−)), Kalrn+/+ (wild type), and Kalrn+/−.

Samples from the right cerebral cortex of 5-6 month old mice were homogenized, the postsynaptic density enrichment obtained (SA6), and samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

LC-MS/MS

Tissue from 56 of the Alzheimer disease subjects and 12 control subjects (Table 1) had been previously prepared and examined via LC/MS-MS using a TSQ Quantiva triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with a Dionex UltiMate 3000 Nano HPLC (Thermo scientific) (21). Tissue homogenates were prepared from fresh frozen dorsolateral prefrontal cortex gray matter, total protein was extracted, quantified by BCA, mixed with a Lysine-13C6-labeled neuronal proteome standard, and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion as previously described (21). Samples were organized in a balanced block distribution throughout processing. Each block included Alzheimer disease subjects with and without psychosis, a control subject, and a pooled technical replicate.

The protein panel used in this study has been comprehensively described (22), and targets synaptically localized proteins, the majority of which have been demonstrated to be stable for 24 hours postmortem in an animal model. Specifically, the assay detects proteins involved in various aspects of synaptic activity including vesicular fusion, energy metabolism, protein trafficking, and cytoskeleton scaffolding, as well as glutamate receptors, kinases, and phosphatases.

For human samples, 311 peptides from 190 proteins were assessed. For mouse samples, 274 peptides from 174 proteins were assessed in protein homogenate, and 203 peptides from 138 proteins were assessed from the postsynaptic density fraction. Precision of the assay was high, with a mean peptide quantification coefficient of variation of 8.6% for human samples, and 12.5% in homogenate and 17.7% in postsynaptic density fraction for mouse samples.

Statistical Analysis

A univariate test was performed to compare Alzheimer disease with psychosis vs Alzheimer disease without psychosis for each demographic, clinical and neuropathologic measure. Since comorbid pathologies are often correlated, we then performed a stepwise logistic regression model using the presence of psychosis as a binary outcome variable and the demographic and neuropathologic measures as covariates. Variables retained in the final logistic model were considered as covariates for the synaptic proteomics data analysis.

Protein levels were derived by calculating the weighted average of all standardized (centered and scaled) peptide measures mapped to a protein, with weights inverse to the coefficient of variation of the peptide measures (21). ANCOVA (adjusted for assay block, postmortem interval and, when comparing Alzheimer disease without psychosis and Alzheimer disease with psychosis directly, variables retained in the stepwise logistic regression) was performed for each protein level to compare Alzheimer disease with psychosis and Alzheimer disease without psychosis. The covariate-adjusted protein ratios of Alzheimer disease without psychosis vs Alzheimer disease with psychosis were obtained (on log2 scale) and a one-sample t-test was performed to detect a significant shift in the distribution of ratios. In addition, protein levels of each Alzheimer disease group were calculated as a ratio to the control group (adjusted for assay block and postmortem interval) and tested for distributional shifts using one-sample t-tests. Similar analyses were performed on proteomics data from mouse samples (SA7).

Results

Tau and other neuropathologic measures in Alzheimer disease with psychosis

We first evaluated the association of psychosis in Alzheimer disease with measures of neuropathology (Table 2). Compared to Alzheimer disease without psychosis, Alzheimer disease with psychosis was characterized by significantly greater PHF-1 tau volume fraction (the fraction of gray matter containing PHF-1 tau labeling) and mean intensity. In contrast to PHF-1 tau, we detected only modest, non-significant elevations in oligomeric tau volume fraction. Alzheimer disease with psychosis did not differ from Alzheimer disease without psychosis on measures of Aβ volume fraction or intensity, nor on measures of microglial density (Iba1) or reactivity (HLA-DR). While we found no association of Lewy body pathology with Alzheimer disease with psychosis, we found a significant increase in TDP-43 pathology, and less severe vascular pathology in Alzheimer disease with psychosis compared to Alzheimer disease without psychosis. Sample distributions for all quantitative IHC results are contained in Figure 2, and relationships of the measures to synaptic protein levels are listed in Table ST6.

Because these comorbid pathologies are often correlated, we entered the demographic and neuropathologic measures into a stepwise logistic regression model using the presence of psychosis as the outcome variable. Approximately 18% of the variance in psychosis status could be explained by 5 neuropathologic variables that were retained in the model (Table 3). PHF-1 tau volume fraction was the single most significant predictor of psychosis in Alzheimer disease (7% of the variance in psychosis status, p=0.01). Significant independent contributions of TDP-43 pathology also persisted. In contrast, although contributing to the overall model, vascular pathology was no longer significantly associated with psychosis in Alzheimer disease.

Synaptic protein levels in Alzheimer disease with and without psychosis

As only a minority of the variance in psychosis status was explained by clinical and pathologic measures, we sought to determine whether there were alterations in the synaptic proteome that would further explain the occurrence of psychosis in Alzheimer disease. Few differences in levels of individual synaptic proteins were present in Alzheimer disease with psychosis compared to Alzheimer disease without psychosis, none of which were significant after consideration of multiple comparisons, with or without adjusting for covariates (Table ST2). However, we noted that the majority of synaptic proteins had higher levels in Alzheimer disease subjects without psychosis than in subjects with psychosis, a significant difference (Figure 3A; one-sample t-test of log2 ratio: mean(SD)= 0.21(0.24), p=&lt;0.001) Further analysis of the synaptic protein levels in each group relative to unaffected controls revealed a global increase in synaptic protein levels in Alzheimer disease without psychosis (Figure 3B; mean(SD)= 0.09(0.30), p=&lt;0.001) and no difference in the distribution of synaptic protein levels in Alzheimer disease subjects with psychosis (Figure 3C; mean(SD)= 0.02(0.32), p=0.36). When we used the covariate adjusted levels of each protein to create a synaptic protein score for each subject, the same trends were evident, although not reaching statistical significance [Alzheimer disease without psychosis mean(SD): 0.065 (0.53); Alzheimer disease with psychosis −0.004 (0.74); control −0.024 (0.25)]. Functional annotation analysis of the top 20 proteins that were increased in Alzheimer disease without psychosis versus control subjects revealed enrichment for proteins involved in vesicular function (Table ST3).

We then restricted our analysis to only those synaptic proteins whose levels are enriched in the postsynaptic density, a cellular compartment whose functional integrity directly contributes to maintenance of synaptic transmission (Table ST4). We found that the compensatory increase in postsynaptic density proteins in Alzheimer disease without psychosis was significantly greater than for the other synaptic proteins [postsynaptic density protein mean(SD) Alzheimer disease without psychosis: Alzheimer disease with psychosis = 1.25(0.22); other synaptic proteins Alzheimer disease without psychosis: Alzheimer disease with psychosis = 1.15(0.19); p= 0.01].

Synaptic protein distributions in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice with and without protection from psychosis-associated behavior

We recently reported that genetic reduction of Kalrn in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice [APP/PS1/KALRN(+/−)] confers resilience to psychosis-associated behaviors that otherwise increase between 6 and 12 months of age in APP/PS1/KALRN(+/+) mice (20). We examined whether similar evidence of resilience in the synaptic proteome was present in APP/PS1/KALRN(+/−) mice at 6 months, a time point preceding their behavioral divergence from APP/PS1/KALRN(+/+) mice. Six month old APP/PS1/KALRN(+/−) mice had elevated synaptic protein levels from cerebral cortex homogenates compared to APP/PS1/KALRN(+/+) mice (Figure 4A; one sample t-test of log2 ratio: mean(SD)= 0.09(.016), p=&lt;0.001) and to wild type mice (Figure 4B; mean(SD)= 0.12(0.13), p=&lt;0.001). In contrast, APP/PS1/KALRN(+/+) mice had only a modest shift in synaptic protein levels compared to wild type mice (Figure 4C; mean(SD)= 0.03(0.17), p=0.03). The synaptic proteins elevated in APP/PS1/KALRN(+/−) mice relative to APP/PS1/KALRN(+/+) mice significantly overlapped with the proteins elevated in Alzheimer disease without psychosis relative to Alzheimer disease with psychosis (X21= 33.83, p=6.00e-09, Table ST7).

We then asked whether synaptic protein compensation in cortical homogenates of APP/PS1/KALRN(+/−) mice conferred protection from loss of these proteins in the postsynaptic density. APP/PS1/KALRN(+/−) mice with increased synaptic protein levels in cortical homogenate were able to maintain synaptic proteins to wild type levels in the postsynaptic density compartment (Figure 4E; mean(SD)= 0.00(0.24), p=0.82), and contained elevated synaptic protein levels compared to APP/PS1/KALRN(+/+) mice (Figure 4D; mean(SD)= 0.07(0.32), p=0.01). In contrast, APP/PS1/KALRN(+/+) mice had overall deficient levels of these proteins in the postsynaptic density compared to wild type mice (Figure 4F; mean(SD)= −0.07(0.32), p=0.02). The effects of mouse genotype and cellular compartment on overall synaptic protein levels are summarized in Figure 4G (effect of genotype: F(1,623)= 20.83, p= &lt;0.001; effect of compartment: F(1,623)= 34.77, p= &lt;0.001; genotype × compartment: F(1,623)= 0.33, p= 0.57). When we restricted these analyses to postsynaptic density –specific proteins, such as glutamate receptors and postsynaptic density-95, which are normally enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction (defined here as a protein level ratio in postsynaptic density: homogenate of greater than 1.5 in wild type mice (Table ST3)), the same pattern was present (Figure 4H) (effect of genotype: F(1,151)= 6.22, p= 0.01; effect of compartment: F(1,151)= 9.16, p= 0.003; genotype × compartment: F(1,151)= 0.11, p= 0.74). Finally in an effort to ascertain whether other proteins in homogenate could contribute to the observed postsynaptic density preservation, we analyzed the top 20 non-postsynaptic density enriched proteins that were increased in homogenates of APP/PS1/KALRN(+/−) mice. We found significant enrichment for proteins involved in endocytic/vesicular protein transport (Table ST5), although the specific proteins contributing to this enrichment differ from those in Alzheimer disease without psychosis.

Discussion

In this study, we combined quantitative neuropathology and LC-MS/MS to identify significant predictors of the resilient Alzheimer disease without psychosis phenotype. We detected significant contributions from PHF-1 tau burden and from the presence of TDP-43 pathology to the prediction of psychosis status in Alzheimer disease. Independent of these neuropathologic contributions, we then demonstrated that Alzheimer disease subjects without psychosis have increased levels of synaptic proteins, particularly those which are enriched in the postsynaptic density, compared to Alzheimer disease subjects with psychosis. Finally, we recapitulated our human postmortem finding of elevated synaptic protein levels in Alzheimer disease without psychosis in a mouse model of Aβ overexpression which is protected from psychosis-associated behaviors which would otherwise progress between 6 and 12 months of age. Within the homogenate fraction, APP/PS1/KALRN(+/−) mice had elevated levels of postsynaptic density-enriched proteins compared to wild type and to APP/PS1/KALRN(+/+) mice, an effect which was associated with normalization of postsynaptic density - enriched proteins in the postsynaptic density compartment.

Previous studies exploring the neuropathologic correlates of psychosis in Alzheimer disease have yielded variable results and were often limited by low case numbers, focus on single pathologies or designed as retrospective database reviews. To our knowledge, our study is the most comprehensive evaluation of neuropathologic factors to date, based on a large, well characterized cohort from a single center, and using unbiased quantitative approaches to measure disease burden. We confirmed the association of psychosis in Alzheimer disease with higher phosphorylated Tau burden as previously reported by our and other groups (3). While previous studies suggested psychosis status to be linked with cerebrovascular disease and microinfarcts (23, 24), we did not detect a significant association between any of our vascular disease markers and psychosis in a logistic regression model. Contrary to previous reports, we detected less severe cerebrovascular disease in Alzheimer disease subjects with psychosis in univariate analyses. The significance of this observation is unclear. For the first time, we report a significant association between the presence of TDP-43 pathology and psychosis status. Concurrent TDP-43 is a frequent finding in Alzheimer disease brains, seen in &gt;50% of cases (25). While the presence of TDP-43 has been associated with worse cognition and memory impairment (25), no association with clinical subtypes has previously emerged (26). Our study provides the first link of TDP-43 pathology with a specific clinical phenotype.

The presence of a compensated synaptic proteome has not, to our knowledge, been previously associated with psychosis status in Alzheimer disease. Perhaps the most replicated clinical correlate of Alzheimer disease without psychosis is a slower rate of cognitive impairment, and therefore our findings of synaptic proteome compensation in Alzheimer disease without psychosis are congruent with previous studies suggesting that clinically evident Alzheimer disease onset is delayed by a period of synaptic compensation, during which cognitive ability is relatively maintained despite significant plaque and NFT pathology (27). Indeed, elevated synaptic markers during this period of mild cognitive impairment relative to both mild and severe Alzheimer disease have been previously described (28). Others have demonstrated in hippocampal tissue that the synaptic proteome has a biphasic expression pattern across pathologic stage (29) which is likely a compensatory effect early in disease. Further ultrastructural studies have suggested that there is morphologic evidence of compensation in the context of mild Alzheimer disease pathology, one of which demonstrated larger axospinous synapses within stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare, an effect which Nicholson and colleagues suggest represents increased synapse strength (30). Our findings extend these earlier observations, revealing that synaptic compensations may persist into more advanced disease stages within a subgroup of individuals defined by the resilient Alzheimer disease without psychosis phenotype.

An important question is what mechanism(s) might underlie the synaptic proteome compensation in Alzheimer disease without psychosis. A model in which resilience to psychosis in Alzheimer disease results from a shift in the proteostasis of forward and back trafficking of synaptic proteins to and from the postsynaptic density for function and degradation (Figure 5) would be consistent with our data indicating that Kalrn reduction protects the synaptic proteome in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice. Kalirin protein has been shown to regulate actin transport motors and trafficking of endosomes (31). Indeed, we found evidence of accumulation of endocytic vesicle trafficking proteins in the homogenates of APP/PS1/KALRN(+/−) mice in conjunction with normalization of postsynaptic density protein levels. Furthermore, we have recently identified a set of common SNPs which are associated with resilience to psychosis in Alzheimer disease (32). Among the consistently protective SNPs was rs8082590 on chromosome 17, the protective allele of which is associated with reduced expression of TOM1L2 (33), the gene encoding Target Of Myb1 Like 2 Membrane Trafficking Protein. TOM1L2 protein is required for maturation of autophagosomes and subsequent fusion with lysosomes (34). Autophagy pathways which regulate the turnover of endosomal material from the synapse have strong evidence for involvement in Alzheimer disease (35). Therefore, reduced TOM1L2 expression conferred by a common SNP may be a novel mechanism for increased synaptic protein levels and resilience to psychosis in Alzheimer disease. Autophagy pathways have also been shown to modulate the phosphorylation state of tau (36, 37), providing a putative link to the current and prior findings of reduced fibrillar tau in Alzheimer disease without psychosis (38) and others’ similar findings of reduced PHF-1 tau in synaptosomes from subjects protected from Alzheimer disease despite sufficient neuropathology for a postmortem Alzheimer disease diagnosis (39). Studies which examine the synaptic, morphologic and behavioral effects of reduced TOM1L2 expression may provide further insight into mechanisms underlying a resilient Alzheimer disease phenotype.

We have interpreted our synaptic findings as representing resilience in the context of equivalent pathologic stage, based on several methodologic considerations that deserve discussion. We used an automated immunostaining method to provide uniform measures of multiple pathologies across subjects. Nevertheless, mean intensity values for these pathologies were skewed to the right, an effect which was particularly evident for detection of PHF-1 tau intensity. This limitation could have hindered our ability to identify even greater increases in PHF-1 tau burden in our Alzheimer disease with psychosis cohort, possibly affecting the degree of correction of our synaptic measures for this pathology. In addition, we note that we did not use this parametric approach to quantify the presence of comorbid Lewy body and TDP-43 pathology, as the burden of these pathologies within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was too low, and would have resulted in nearly all subjects quantified at floor values.

Another potential concern regarding our synaptic findings relates to the control cohort used for LC-MS/MS. First, the controls were significantly younger in age in comparison to our groups of Alzheimer disease subjects with and without psychosis. This discrepancy resulted from our effort to obtain a neuropathologically unaffected cohort, minimizing the possibility for Alzheimer disease-related pathologies to influence the synaptic proteome within subjects who appeared clinically unaffected. Several considerations, however, make this unlikely for concern. A recent proteomics study of hippocampal tissue from subjects aged 22-96 years demonstrated an effect of age on only 60 of 4582 proteins assayed; only two of these 60, hippocalcin and vimentin, were contained in our synaptic assay (40). Moreover, we detected profound differences in global synaptic protein levels when only our precisely age-matched Alzheimer disease subjects with and without psychosis were considered. A second concern is that our control group had longer postmortem intervals. However, we have previously demonstrated that the majority of the synaptic peptides assayed exhibit stable detection for periods longer than the postmortem intervals of our subjects (22), and therefore, the differences we observed are unlikely to be an effect of postmortem interval.

In summary, we have demonstrated that increased levels of synaptic proteins are associated with protection from a more severe Alzheimer disease phenotype, Alzheimer disease with psychosis. This putative compensation exhibited by the synaptic proteome was independent of burden from multiple neuropathologies. While we have identified and described an analogous mouse model of Alzheimer disease without psychosis, both behaviorally and synaptically, further studies of animal models of resilience are necessary to detect protective mechanisms for psychosis in Alzheimer disease. One such future model is advised by our recent genetic findings suggesting an association between reduced TOM1L2 expression and protection from psychosis in Alzheimer disease. Neuropathologic, synaptic, and behavioral assessment of this model may inform prospective development of therapeutic targets to confer resilience to psychosis in Alzheimer disease.

Figure 1 Representative raw (upper row) and masked (lower row) images of DLPFC sections labeled with select antibodies from AD subjects

PHF-1 tau (A, B); oligomeric (T22) tau (C, D); fibrillar (NAB228) Aβ (E, F); Iba1 (G, H) and HLA-DR (I, J). All images were captured at 40× magnification.

Figure 2 Levels of tau, Aβ, and microglial markers in AD with and without psychosis

AD+P subjects exhibit significantly elevated PHF-1 tau volume fraction (A) and mean intensity (B) compared to AD-P subjects. In contrast, AD+P does not differ from AD-P on volume fraction of other neuropathological hallmarks of AD, including oligomeric (T22) tau or fibrillar (NAB228) Aβ (C,E), nor on intensity levels for these measures (D, F). Volume fraction and intensity levels of HLA-DR and Iba1, measures of microglial reactivity and density, respectively, also do not differentiate AD+P from AD-P (G, H).

Figure 3 Distribution of 190 synaptic protein levels in Alzheimer disease with psychosis, Alzheimer disease without psychosis, and control subjects

Distributions of log2 ratios are shown for all 190 proteins, adjusted for covariates from Table 3, postmortem interval, and assay block (A) or, for comparison to unaffected controls, postmortem interval and assay block alone (B, C). The dashed vertical line represents no difference in the ratio of protein levels between groups. Alzheimer disease without psychosis is characterized by a significant rightward shift in the distribution of synaptic protein levels compared to Alzheimer disease with psychosis (A). Alzheimer disease without psychosis subjects also exhibit elevated synaptic protein levels compared to controls (B) while Alzheimer disease with psychosis subjects exhibit no difference from controls (C), suggesting a lack of synaptic protein compensation in the Alzheimer disease with psychosis group.

Distributions of log2 ratios are shown for all 174 synaptic proteins assayed from cerebral cortex homogenates (A-C) and for all 138 synaptic proteins assayed from postsynaptic density fractions (D-F) in APP/PS1/KALRN(+/+) (n=5), APP/PS1/KALRN(+/−) (n=5), and wild type mice (n=4). The dashed vertical line represents no difference in the ratio of protein levels between groups. Summary of all (G) and postsynaptic density-enriched (H) synaptic protein levels from whole cell homogenates and postsynaptic density fractions from APP/PS1/KALRN(+/+) and APP/PS1/KALRN(+/−) mice, expressed as percent change from wild type mean. Error bars represent standard error of mean.

Figure 5 Model of resilience from psychosis in AD

The normal process of maintaining post-synaptic function involves forward trafficking synaptic proteins into spines where they can insert into the PSD. This process is counterbalanced by back-trafficking to the dendrite compartments. AD pathology and a mouse model of Aβ overproduction are associated with an imbalance in the processes contributing to maintain protein levels at the synapse (shown in red). Resilience to psychosis is hypothesized to result from processes that increase dendritic spine levels of synaptic proteins, for example reduced back trafficking for degradation due to reduced TOM1L2.

Two sample t-tests or ANOVA (when comparing Alzheimer disease without psychosis (AD-P), Alzheimer disease with psychosis (AD+P), and Normal Control groups) were performed for all continuous variables; chi-square (or as appropriate Fisher’s exact) tests were performed for all categorical variables. P values in [ ] reflect comparisons between AD-P, AD+P, and normal control groups examined by LC-MS/MS; all other p values reflect differences between only the AD-P and AD+P groups.

* APOE-4 status was unknown for 3 subjects in AD-P group and 1 subject in AD+P group.

Results for volume fraction are reported as “geometric mean [group range].” Results for remaining measures are reported as “mean (S.D.)” or as “n (% of group total)”. Two sample t-tests were performed for all continuous variables; chi-square (or as appropriate Fisher’s exact) tests were performed for all categorical variables. Significant p values &lt;0.05 are in boldface. More detailed classifications of Lewy body and TDP-43 pathology in Alzheimer disease subjects without psychosis (AD-P) and Alzheimer disease subjects with psychosis (AD+P) are included in ST1.
