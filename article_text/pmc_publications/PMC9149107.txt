Introduction:

Research addressing Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) must examine non-biological factors influencing the risk for and expression of ADRD. These factors address the interplay of cognition with lived experiences and social and structural determinants of health (SSDOH). However, coordinated measures of SSDOH are limited.

Methods:

The Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Washington University in St. Louis developed and piloted a comprehensive battery to measure SSDOH. One hundred and twelve participants, very mildly cognitively impaired or unimpaired, enrolled in memory studies completed the electronic SSDOH battery. The Clinical Dementia Rating® (CDR®) determined the presence or absence of cognitive impairment.

Results:

Four domains demonstrated above acceptable intraclass correlation (ICC) scores for test-retest reliability (≥0.70), including adverse childhood events, discrimination, social status, and early education. Twenty very mildly impaired participants completed the electronic pilot study.

Conclusion:

Our findings indicate that participants with early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD) are able to participate in electronic SSDOH data collection. In collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania ADRC, we replaced/modified certain assessments to increase ICC. The resulting battery, Social and Structural Life-courses Influencing Aging and Dementia (SS-DIAD), can serve as a SSDOH collection tool and is currently utilized in cognitively impaired and unimpaired research participants at both ADRCs.

While the number of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) continues to increase at an alarming rate, factors influencing the risk of ADRD are still not clearly understood. Increasing evidence suggests that lived experiences and environmental factors, collectively known as social and structural determinants of health (SSDOH), influence cognitive health outcomes.1-4 Contributing to health inequities around the globe, SSDOH encompasses a wide range of domains, including social and physical environments, literacy, stress, access to and quality of health care and insurance, and social support.4 The relationship between SSDOH and ADRD is being studied at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, and at other National Institute on Aging (NIA)-funded Alzheimer Disease Centers.

Measuring SSDOH in ADRD research permits a greater understanding of modifiers of ADRD incidence and prevalence rates in diverse demographic groups. It is particularly important in African Americans/Black (Black) individuals to elucidate the cultural and sociopolitical factors that impact cognitive health.1,2,5 Given that race is a self-defined social construct,6 it is appropriate to look beyond biological mechanisms when comparing Black, and non-Hispanic White (nHW) individuals as studies of the prevalence of ADRD in Black and nHW individuals yield mixed results. Although some studies find a higher prevalence rate of ADRD in Black individuals7,8 compared with nHW, factors such as biological sex, body mass index (BMI), and APOE ε4 status, notably influence prevalence rates and may result in less risk for ADRD in Black individuals.9 The relationship between ADRD and racial differences remains unclear, therefore, expanding investigation methodology to include SSDOH is logical. However, many research efforts that address possible racial differences in ADRD lack appropriate measures of SSDOH, thus limiting the generalizability of findings.1,10,11

Currently available instruments measuring SSDOH focus on one domain, such as stress or discrimination. Among SSDOH instruments, the Rush ADRC’s Minority Aging Research Study (MARS)12 and the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health’s Area Deprivation Index (ADI)13 address specific SSDOH domains of significance. The Rush ADRC’s MARS provides a research foundation for racial disparities by examining the influence of such factors as perceived discrimination and attending a segregated school on ADRD. 14 The ADI uses census-block data to determine objective neighborhood disadvantage across 17 domains. Each program focuses on important dimensions that may influence cognition. However, additional measures for SSDOH are necessary to capture the breadth of the participant’s lived experiences and impacts on their cognitive health.

Our primary aims were to 1) develop a comprehensive SSDOH battery to capture a wide range of domains influencing cognitive health, 2) pilot the battery to determine its psychometric properties to discern its Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for test-retest reliability, and 3) modify the battery as needed to create a tool for all to use. This paper describes the drafting of the battery, the results of the pilot study, and the subsequent improvements made.

Methods

All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Washington University in St. Louis’ Human Research Protection Office. All participants provided informed consent during the initial research visit.

Battery Development

In order to create a valid and reliable SSDOH battery that contained a broad range of culturally appropriate domains addressing lived experiences, several existing SSDOH assessments were considered. We sought recommendations from a National Institutes of Health and NIA-funded conference15 and conducted a literature review examining SSDOH that may affect cognitive health outcomes1 to prioritize the topic areas. We assembled a comprehensive battery of assessments measuring such domains as discrimination, stress, adverse childhood experiences, neighborhood, social support, and socioeconomic status, thus creating the initial Life-courses Influencing Aging and Dementia (LIAD) battery (Table 1).

After its initial development, the LIAD was presented to the Knight ADRC African American Advisory Board (AAAB). The AAAB, established in 2000, is comprised of ~15 persons in the St Louis community who are Knight ADRC research participants, caregivers, clinical and service providers, community leaders, and faith leaders. The board meets bimonthly to address diversity, equity, and inclusion matters for Knight ADRC research projects. AAAB members reviewed the LIAD for inclusivity, provided insight on the priority areas related to ADRD, completed an early draft of the battery, and provided feedback after completion. Their feedback indicated that the length of the LIAD did not result in participant fatigue or burnout but that clearer instructions were needed for completion of the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS)16 and the Life-course Socioeconomic Neighborhood Exposures Questionnaire (LS-NEQ) (L. Bessar, PhD, unpublished questionnaire, 2018). This feedback was used to appropriately modify the LIAD prior to the start of pilot study.

LIAD Battery Pilot Study

Sample

All participants were recruited from the Knight ADRC at the Washington University School of Medicine. The Knight ADRC conducts longitudinal studies of memory and aging with community members ≥45 years of age. Participants from these studies are assessed for absence or presence of cognitive impairment, and, when present, its severity, with the Clinical Dementia Rating® (CDR®).17 Only those rated cognitively normal (CDR 0) or very mildly impaired (CDR 0.5) at their last annual assessment were eligible to participate in the pilot study. Among other participant variables, age, years of education, biological sex, self-reported race and ethnicity, occupation18, and depression assessed using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)19,20 are collected during the assessment. After March 18, 2020, the participant’s CDR status was ascertained with a remote assessment while “stay-at-home” orders during the COVID-19 pandemic were in place.

Recruitment

Recruitment for the LIAD pilot study occurred between September 9, 2020, and November 30, 2020. Participants were invited by telephone to participate. Black participants and those who were very mildly impaired (CDR 0.5) were oversampled. A recruitment goal of at least 100 participants was determined to ensure an accurate estimate of the ICC between the test score and the retest score of the LIAD battery. Specifically, the sample size was determined to allow a 95% confidence interval (CI) estimate of the ICC to span no more than 0.15 if the actual ICC is 0.8 or above.21 After the initial agreement over the telephone, participants were asked to reply to an email sent by a LIAD team member to confirm their email address and their continued interest in the study. The LIAD was sent to the participant after the team member received the confirmation email.

Data Collection

The LIAD pilot battery was implemented electronically with all participants. Study data were entered and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) electronic data capture tools hosted at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine.22,23 Test-retest reliability was assessed by emailing an electronic version of the LIAD to the participant for initial testing and then again a second time for the retest approximately two weeks later. This approach has been used in other studies to measure test-retest reliability.24-26 Although all participants were emailed the retest arm of the pilot two weeks after completing the initial LIAD battery, not all participants completed it that day; therefore, time intervals between testing periods varied slightly. No feedback was provided to participants regarding their individual pilot study responses.

Statistical Analysis

Participant demographics were summarized individually by the mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and by counts and proportions for categorical variables (Table 2). Demographics were compared between participants who completed the LIAD pilot study (n=112) and those who refused to participate (n=24) and who were deemed lost to follow-up (n=33) by Student t test or Chi-squared test, as appropriate. For each domain score that was estimated by the Item Response Theory (IRT) model, the test-retest reliability was assessed by the ICC through a random effect one-way ANOVA, along with a 95% CI estimate. An IRT model was applied for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) scale27, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)28, and the EDS16. For domains whose total scores showed inadequate test-retest reliability, item-level test-retest reliability was further estimated to locate items that were not reliably assessed, and ICCs for the adjusted total scores were further estimated after removing the poor performing items. The analyses of ICCs were implemented in PROC NLMIXED/ SAS.

Results

Participants

Knight ADRC staff attempted to reach 213 participants by telephone to reach the recruitment goal of 100 participants who would complete the LIAD to determine their willingness to participate in the pilot study. Out of the 213 participants called, 169 (79%) participants answered the phone or returned the call after staff left a voicemail. Following a description of the pilot study and LIAD battery, 145 (86%) participants agreed to participate. Of these 145, 108 (74%) completed both the test and retest arms of the pilot study. Four additional participants completed the initial LIAD battery but as requested. Thus, 112 (77%) participants completed at least the initial LIAD battery. Although participants were emailed a link asking them to complete the retest two weeks after completing the initial test battery, only 25% completed the retest battery on the day they received the email, although 78% of participants completed it within three weeks of the initial LIAD assessment.

The demographic characteristics after participants’ last Knight ADRC assessment for the 112 LIAD pilot study participants are shown in Table 2. Participants were stratified by their cognitive status, either cognitively normal (CDR 0) or very mildly impaired (CDR 0.5). Approximately 58% self-identified as female and 35% self-identified as African American or Black. Additional data already collected during prior research visits, such as socioeconomic status reported as social position and years of education were also compared in Table 2.

Twenty-four (14%) of the 169 participants reached by telephone declined to complete the LIAD pilot study. As the Knight ADRC plans to obtain SSDOH information longitudinally, ascertaining the reason for refusals was important for future implementation. Sixteen (67%) of the 24 refusers cited a lack of access to or were uncomfortable with the necessary technology to complete the LIAD online. In an effort to increase future LIAD participation and respond to the needs of our participants, a paper version of the battery was created. The remaining 8 (33%) participants who refused participation in the pilot study indicated that they were uninterested or overwhelmed with other study participation.

In addition, we sought to determine what differences, if any, were noted between those who completed the pilot study and those who did not. Table 3 compares the demographics of those participants who completed the LIAD pilot study (n=112) with those who refused to participate (n=24) and those who were deemed lost to follow up (n=33). The lost to follow up cohort included those participants who agreed to complete the LIAD but did not do so (n = 21) or did not return the confirmation email (n=12). Those who refused were more likely to be older (p &lt;0.0001), to identify as Black (p=0.0017), and to be impaired (p=0.0107) compared to those who completed the LIAD. Of those participants who were deemed lost to follow up, significantly more impaired individuals were lost to follow-up then unimpaired individuals (p=0.0095).

Collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania ADRC

As a testament to the importance of investigating the relationship between SDDOH and ADRD, other NIA-funded ADRCs were simultaneously developing their own SSDOH projects. Specifically, the University of Pennsylvania ADRC (UPenn ADRC) developed a battery of SSDOH assessments (Supplement 1) with a planned collection with participants in their longitudinal Aging Brain Cohort (ABC) study. The LIAD was comparable to the UPenn ADRC’s battery; therefore, the decision was made to create one harmonized SSDOH battery, uniformly administered at both sites. Indeed, in collaboration with the investigators from the UPenn ADRC and as a result of the original LIAD pilot study data, both sites’ batteries were restructured to include core, overlapping measures now represented in the Social and Structural Determinants Influencing Aging and Dementia (SS-DIAD) battery (Supplements 2a and 2b, SS-DIAD Initial; Supplements 3a and 3b, SS-DIAD Follow up).

Based on the collaboration between the sites and the LIAD pilot study data, changes were made to the SS-DIAD to strengthen the battery as an SSDOH measure (Table 4). First, ACEs, EDS, the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (MacArthur SSS Scale)29, and the selected questions from the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS-modified)12 all demonstrated a satisfactory ICC (≥.80). The EDS and MacArthur SSS Scale are well-established scales used to measure discrimination and social status with high internal consistency.16,29 ACEs has not frequently been utilized with older adults30,31, so its ICC score of 0.92 is particularly encouraging.

Although the LS-NEQ is currently unpublished, some of its questions were taken from a previously utilized assessment32 and it is possible the poor ICC score can be attributed to an electronic formatting issue. The ten questions with the poorest scores asked the participants to rate statements about their neighborhood on a scale of one (strongly disagree) to ten (strongly agree). These statements were presented as a group in a matrix where the instructions and definitions of each number were only presented one time at the top of the page. As participants scrolled to each question, it is possible they forgot what each number on the scale represented. One example is the statement, “Vandalism and graffiti are a big problem in this neighborhood.” Several participants who indicated that they disagreed with the statement during the test reversed their answers, indicating they agreed or strongly agreed with the statement during the retest. Other researchers have found these questions to be valid and reliable as these questions are used in the Health and Retirement Survey.32 For these reasons, the LS-NEQ will remain in the LIAD with modifications to improve the clarity of the questions and responses on our online survey platform. Even with a sub-optimal ICC of 0.66, we decided to keep the PSS-10 in the SSDOH battery; an overall ICC of 0.82 has previously been demonstrated for the PSS-10 in older adults.33

The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)34 was the only assessment eliminated from the battery. This assessment’s low ICC score of 0.42 did not improve after removing the lowest scoring individual questions and reanalyzing the assessment. However, social support remains an important domain to measure as a relationship between social isolation and poor cognitive health may exist.35,36 Therefore, the established Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6)37-39 was substituted for the MSPSS as an alternative measure to collect social support.

Additionally, we calculated the internal consistency of the domains with a robust ICC by correlating the IRT domain score with such covariates as age, years of education, and GDS score (Table 5). No relationship was found between ACEs27 and higher years of education nor depression as measured by a GDS score of ≥6. The PSS-10 domain was negatively correlated with years of education, where less education was weakly associated with less perceived stress (r=−0.21). In addition, less education was correlated, albeit weakly, with lower levels of discrimination (r=−0.19).

Discussion

The current study aimed to develop a battery consisting of assessments to measure SSDOH, pilot test this battery with cognitively normal (CDR 0) and very mildly impaired (CDR 0.5) research participants, and modify the battery based on the pilot study’s results. In order to decide which SSDOH to investigate, we consulted with colleagues, conducted a literature review, and relied on an NIH/NIA-funded conference to guide our domain and assessment choices. Next, the newly formed battery was pilot tested with 112 participants who were enrolled in research studies about memory and aging at the Knight ADRC. The ICC scores of each assessment in the battery were reviewed to determine which assessments best measured our chosen SSDOH domains. Our findings confirm that very mildly cognitively impaired participants are able, if willing, to participate in electronic SSDOH data collection. The SS-DIAD battery represents a first step in developing a cohesive, internally consistent, uniform survey to collect SSDOH in cognitively normal and mildly cognitively impaired older adults.

Although the SS-DIAD battery contains the same core assessments, both ADRCs altered the SS-DIAD slightly in order to accommodate specific ADRC site goals. At the UPenn ADRC, the SS-DIAD is included as part of the annual ABC SSDOH assessment. The ABC SSDOH collects self-reported data on religion, health and financial literacy, participant and participant’s mother’s years of education, stressful life events, language acquisition and multilingualism, physical and learning disabilities, and sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). It collects the Occupational Cognitive Response Score (OCRS) as well. The Knight ADRC incorporated the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)40 to collect participants’ physical activity and time spent sitting over a seven-day period. The IPAQ Long Form is used in the SS-DIAD initial administration while the IPAQ Short Form is used during the longitudinal follow-up.

The Knight and the UPenn ADRCs share other similarities as well. Both sites use the SS-DIAD to capture data to facilitate estimating the ADI.13 Also consistent with the SS-DIAD, the UPenn SSDOH battery will later be piloted and routinely collected in cognitively normal and very mild impairment participants. Both sites have incorporated the SS-DIAD battery into the standard annual research participant evaluations. SS-DIAD implementation began in May of 2021 at both the UPenn and the Knight ADRCs.

Our study has several limitations. First, we utilized a convenience sample from a well-characterized participant group already enrolled in longitudinal studies at the Knight ADRC, thus limiting the generalizability of our results. In addition, the small sample size of Black participants hindered our ability to reliably estimate internal consistency by race. Next, the amount of time each participant spent completing the LIAD pilot study battery was not captured, nor could we capture breaks during the asynchronous completion of the battery. Participants reported anecdotally that the LIAD took approximately 30 minutes to complete, but a more accurate assessment of time is needed to help evaluate participant burden. Only participants who agreed to complete an electronic version of the battery were included in the pilot study, excluding those who were uncomfortable with or did not own a computer, tablet, or smartphone from the pilot study.

The SS-DIAD will continue to be evaluated and updated as data accumulates. Due to their similarities, we predict the psychometric properties of the LIAD will hold for the SS-DIAD. Feedback from participants and investigators will improve the SS-DIAD for cultural appropriateness, participant fatigue, clarity of items, and comfort level of questions. We plan to continue collecting data to enhance and condense the SS-DIAD, thus establishing the battery as an effective and efficient tool to collect SSDOH in cognitively unimpaired and very mildly impaired persons.
