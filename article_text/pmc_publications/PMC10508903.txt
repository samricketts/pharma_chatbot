This article reports a study that was designed to describe the incidence of pain among older hospitalized patients with dementia and to evaluate the factors that influence pain among these individuals. It was hypothesized that function, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, delirium, pain treatment, and patient exposure to care interventions would be associated with pain. Patients who performed more functional activities had less delirium. They also experienced higher quality-of-care interactions and were less likely to have pain. The findings from this study support the relationship between function, delirium, and quality-of-care interactions and pain. It suggests that it may be useful to encourage patients with dementia to engage in functional and physical activity to prevent or manage pain. This study serves as a reminder to avoid neutral or negative care interactions among patients with dementia as a strategy to mediate delirium and pain.

pmcPAIN is a common symptom for older hospitalized patients with dementia. Approximately 25% to 42% of hospitalized older adults have dementia,1,2 and approximately 40% of these individuals experience pain.3,4 There are a number of contributors to pain including the reason for admission (eg, fracture or traumatic event, or a cardiovascular event causing pain), chronic medical conditions (eg, constipation, urinary retention, or degenerative joint disease),3,5 immobility, poor positioning, and poor hygiene (eg, fungal infections, skin ulcerations, oral infections).6,7 Patients with cognitive impairment, who were older, male, Black older adult, or other ethnicity were less likely to verbally report having pain than those who had less impairment, were younger, female, and White older adult.8-10

There are 2 known neuronal networks or systems that influence pain.11 The medial pain system includes the amygdala, medial thalamus, hippocampus, anterior cortex cingula, and prefrontal cortex. This system or pathway mediates the cognitive-evaluative, motivational-affective, and the autonomic-endocrine components of pain. The lateral pain system includes the somatosensory areas and the lateral thalamic nuclei of the brain and influences the sensory-discriminative components of pain (eg, localization, intensity). The rostral pain system overlaps with the medial and lateral pathways with the exception of the ventral striatum. The striatum is affected in older adults with dementia, resulting in an increased activation of the striatum in response to pain.12 The third pathway influencing pain is the limbic area, and this impacts the behavioral aspects of pain such as agitation.12

For individuals with dementia, there are greater changes in the medial pain system than the lateral or limbic systems such that the motivational-affective aspects of pain are impacted more than the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain.11 Although not consistent, clinically this results in unchanged pain thresholds but higher pain tolerance among individuals with dementia.13,14 Because of changes in the striatum, individuals with mild to moderate dementia tend to have more behavioral responses to pain than those with more advanced dementia. Finally, for individuals with dementia, there is an altered response to pain medication due likely to damage in the connectivity between the prefrontal lobes and the rest of the brain.13 These individuals may actually need higher dosages of pain medication than those without dementia.

THE IMPACT OF PAIN IN HOSPITALIZED OLDER ADULTS WITH ALZHEIMER DISEASE

The impact of pain among hospitalized older individuals with dementia includes a slower overall recovery and longer length of stay, functional decline, behavioral symptoms (eg, agitation, aggression, depression, resistiveness to care), and delirium.3,15 Presentation of these signs and symptoms is not generally associated with pain, and pain is subsequently treated with antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and antidepressant medications. This increases the risk for inadequate pain management, polypharmacy, and drug side effects. Furthermore, in response to a decline in function, nurses will exacerbate care dependency by limiting the individual’s self-care and mobility rather than having him or her engage in the activity. This can exacerbate pain and result in a further decline in function.16

INTERVENTIONS KNOWN TO DECREASE PAIN AMONG OLDER ADULTS

There is some evidence to suggest that analgesics including acetaminophen, topical agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and opioids can decrease pain and the associated behavioral symptoms among older adults with dementia.17-19 Likewise, nonpharmacologic interventions such as heat, cold, massage, position change, and physical activity; psychological interventions such as distraction, relaxation techniques, and visualization techniques; and educational interventions such as training caregivers in strategies for pain management (eg, use of positive care interactions)19,20 are also effective interventions.

To expand on what is currently known about the incidence, management, and impact of pain among hospitalized older adults with dementia, the purpose of this study was to describe the incidence of pain among older hospitalized patients with dementia and evaluate the factors that influence pain among these individuals. Specifically, it was hypothesized that controlling for age, gender, race, and comorbidities, function (daily functional performance and participation in function-focused care activities), behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia, delirium, pain treatment (the use of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments), and patient exposure to care interventions (tethers [eg, pulse oximetry, urinary catheters] and quality-of-care interactions with staff) would be associated with pain among patients with dementia hospitalized for management of medical problems (eg, pneumonia, congestive heart failure). Understanding the factors associated with pain will help guide ways to prevent and manage pain in this population.

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN

This was a descriptive study using baseline data from the first 112 participants recruited into a randomized controlled trial testing the impact of an intervention, referred to as Function-Focused Care for Acute Care Using the Evidence Integration Triangle (FFC-AC-EIT). The study was approved by the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Institutional Review Board.

Sample and settings

Hospitals were eligible to participate in the study if they (1) had at least one unit dedicated to general medical patients; (2) identified 2 registered nurses to be champions (one for day and one for evening shifts); (3) enabled staff to access e-mail and Web sites via a phone, tablet, or computer; and (4) did not have a geriatric program (eg, Acute Care for Elders, Hospital for Elder Life Program/HELP) on the study units. Data for this study were from the first 6 hospitals participating in the study.

Patients were eligible to participate, if they (1) were 65 years or older; (2) admitted onto a medical unit for any medical diagnosis with the exception of COVID-19; and (3) screened positive for dementia based on a score of 25 or less on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)21; a score of more than 2 on the AD8 Dementia Screening Interview22; a score of 0.5 to 2.0 on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale23; and a score of 9 or greater on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ).24 Patients were excluded, if they (1) were enrolled in hospice; (2) on the unit for greater than 48 hours; (3) did not have a family member/caregiver to contact; (4) anticipated having surgery; or (5) had a major acute psychiatric disorder or significant neurologic condition associated with cognition other than dementia. Potentially eligible patients were given an evaluation to sign consent to determine capability to consent.25 If the patient passed this test by answering all questions correctly, he or she could self-consent. If unable to pass the evaluation to sign consent, assent was obtained to contact his or her legally authorized representative (LAR) to complete the consent process.

A total of 2401 patients were screened and 792 (33% of all screened) were not approached as they did not meet basic eligibility criteria, were not available, were unable to communicate, or were COVID-19 positive. Of the 1609 (67% of all screened) individuals approached, 133 (8% of the approached) were consented but not enrolled as they did not screen positive for dementia, the LAR withdrew consent, they were enrolled in hospice, or did not meet other eligibility criteria. A total of 250 (16% of approached) assented but were not enrolled as the LAR could not be reached to complete the consent process, 1114 (69% of approached) were approached for consent but not enrolled (refused, were transferred off the unit), leaving 112 (7% of approached) consented and enrolled.

Procedures

Following enrollment, data were obtained within 48 hours of admission based on medical record review, direct observation of the patient, and input from staff (see individual measures). All data were obtained by evaluators, blinded to the intervention, with expertise in assessments of individuals with cognitive impairment.

Measures

Descriptive data were obtained from medical record review and included age, gender, race, and comorbidities. Function was evaluated using the reliable and valid Barthel Index26 and the Checklist for Functional Activity. The Barthel Index is a 10-item measure focused on the individuals’ ability to perform activities of daily living (eg, bathing, dressing). Scores can range from 0 to 100, with 100 being total independence. Evaluators obtained verbal report from staff working with the patient on the day of testing. The patient Checklist for Function-Focused Care Activities is completed by observing patient/caregiver interactions over 30 minutes and evaluating 19 functional activities that patients engage in with staff (eg, bathing, dressing). Patients either do or do not perform the activity (eg, patient refuses to perform). If the item/activity is not observed, it is marked as not observed. Percentage scores are calculated on the basis of function-focused care performed/observed activities. Prior testing supported interrater reliability (r = 0.92) and validity based on correlations with function (r = 0.89).27

Delirium severity was measured with an additive score for the 4 items of the Confusion Assessment Method Severity (CAM-S) Short Form.28 Acute-onset and fluctuating course is scored as no (0) or yes (1). Inattention and disorganized thinking are each scored as “absent” (0 points), present in mild form (1 point), or present in severe form (2 points). The fourth item, altered level of consciousness, is scored as alert or normal (0 points), vigilant or lethargic (1 point), and stupor or coma (2 points). Scores range from 0 to 7, with a higher score indicating greater severity of delirium.29 Prior testing provided evidence of interrater reliability,30 overall sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 89%, and validity based on significant associations with important clinical outcomes including length of stay, functional decline, nursing home placement, and death.28

Behavioral symptoms associated with dementia were evaluated using the brief Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q).31 The NPI-Q is a 12-item, reliable and valid informant-based assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms.31 Each question reflects a behavioral or psychological symptom (delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, euphoria/elation, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behaviors, nighttime behavioral disturbances, and appetite/eating disturbances),32 and the evaluator documents if the symptom was present, the severity, and the impact on the caregiver over the past 24 hours. The informant was the nurse providing care to the patient on the day of testing. The measure has a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 80% and evidence of test-retest reliability (r = 0.99).31 In this study, the Behavior Severity subscale was used, with severity evaluated on the basis of a 3-point scale (1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe). The total NPI-Q severity score represents the sum of individual symptom severity scores and ranges from 0 to 36.

Treatments of pain included the use of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. The use of pharmacologic treatment was based on evidence of any regularly scheduled or as-needed pain medication during the hospitalization. The use of nonpharmacologic treatments included a sum total of 49 potential interventions such as ice, heat, physical activity, communication, and distraction techniques.

Patient exposure to care interventions included summing the number of tethers patients were exposed to and the completion of the Quality of Care Interactions Schedule (QuIS).33 Tethers included the use of indwelling urinary catheters, sequential compression devices, continuous intravenous, bed/chair alarms, cardiac monitoring, pulse oximetry, physical restraints, bed rest orders, or negative pressure wound therapy devices. The QuIS33 was used to evaluate care interactions and determine if they were Positive Social, Positive Care, Neutral, Negative Protective or Negative Restrictive. Prior testing supported the psychometric properties of the quantified scale, with scores ranging from 0 (poor quality-of-care interactions) to 7 (highest quality-of-care interactions).34

Pain was evaluated using the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) measure,35 which includes 5 behaviors commonly observed among individuals with dementia who have pain. Observations were done during activity such as transferring or ambulating. Items were scored from 0 to 2 for each specific pain behavior, and a total score of 1 to 3 was considered mild pain, 4 to 6 moderate pain, and 7 to 10 severe pain. Prior testing provided evidence of interrater reliability (κ = 0.74) and concurrent validity (P &lt; .001).36

Data analysis

Descriptive analyses were done using SPSS 23 to describe the sample. A linear regression analysis was done by entering each concept (eg, function, delirium, behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia (BPSD), pain treatment, and exposure to care) sequentially, with variables maintained in the model at P ≤ .05 and removed from the model if P ≥ .10. Changes in R2 adjusted were considered significant if P ≤ .05. Bivariate correlations indicated that there was no association between pain and age, gender, race, or comorbidities, so these were not controlled for in model testing. Assessment of collinearity was based on Collinearity Status Tolerance. If the value of tolerance was less than 0.2, it was considered to be indicative of a multicollinearity problem.37

RESULTS

As shown in Table 1, the majority of the participants were female (69%) and White older adults (68%), with a mean age of 83.54 (standard deviation [SD] = 7.89) and 2.34 (SD = 1.37) comorbidities. The mean score on the PAINAD was 6.41 (SD = 1.85), with 57 (51%) having no pain, 35 (31%) having mild pain, and 19 (17%) having moderate pain, and 1 patient (1%) having severe pain. Among all participants, 36 (32%) were prescribed pharmacologic interventions and 105 (94%) nonpharmacologic interventions for pain, with a mean of 2.95 (SD = 2.01) nonpharmacologic interventions prescribed. Table 2 provides a description of the nonpharmacologic interventions implemented and Table 3 a list of the pharmacologic medications prescribed either scheduled or as needed. Overall, 33 (42%) of all prescriptions were written as needed and the other 45 (58%) prescriptions for the 112 participants were scheduled medications. Of the 55 participants experiencing pain, 14 (25%) were being given pain medication regularly, an additional 5 (9%) were prescribed as-needed pain medication, and 50 (91%) of those with pain were prescribed at least one nonpharmacologic treatment of pain.

There was little evidence of behavioral or psychological symptoms associated with dementia with a mean severity of 1.19 (SD = 1.67) on the NPI-Q, some evidence of delirium with a mean severity of 2.76 (SD = 2.10) on the CAM-S, with 22 (20%) having no evidence of delirium and the remaining 90 (80%) having mild to severe delirium. Overall, the participants were exposed to 2.81 (SD = 1.71) tethers and generally positive quality-of-care interactions with a mean of 5.77 (SD = 1.68) on the QuIS. The participants engaged in a mean of 62% (SD = 38%) out of 19 possible functional activities with staff.

As shown in Table 4, function, delirium, and care-related activities were all significantly associated with pain. Function explained the greatest amount of the variance in pain with an R2 change of 0.29 (F = 22.04, P = .001). Following function was delirium with an R2 change of 0.26 (F = 29.75, P = .001) and then care interventions with an R2 change of 0.08 (F = 10.77, P = .001). Together, these variables explained 61% of the variance in pain. The pain-focused treatment interventions (pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic) did not enter the model.

Individual β coefficients are provided in Table 5 and showed that the following individual variables were significantly associated with pain: percentage of functional activities performed, delirium based on the CAM-S, and quality-of-care interactions. Those who performed more functional activities, had less delirium, and had higher quality-of-care interactions were less likely to have pain. There was no evidence of multicollinearity among the variables with collinearity statistics all less than 0.20.

DISCUSSION

The hypothesis in this study that there would be an association between pain and function, BPSD, delirium, pain treatment, and patient exposure to care interventions among hospitalized patients with dementia was partially supported. Function, delirium, and care interventions were significantly associated with pain, although pain treatment was not associated with pain. This lack of an association between treatment and pain may be due to lack of variance in treatment, as 105 (94%) of the 112 participants received at least one type of intervention (pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic) for pain.

Despite this high rate of some type of pain interventions, close to half (49%) of individuals were still experiencing pain. The lack of adequate pain management among older adults with dementia has been noted consistently in prior research,8,19,33 and reasons for this include measurement challenges and care philosophies on the part of providers and families among other issues. Concerns about the impact of pharmacologic interventions and associated side effects are prevalent among providers, and there is a strong emphasis to “start low and go slow” when prescribing pain medication. This may result in inadequate coverage for these individuals who in fact may need higher dosages for pain relief than those without dementia.13 There are also challenges to engaging older adults with dementia in nonpharmacologic interventions such as deep breathing exercises or cognitive behavioral interventions.19 As noted in Table 2, the majority of the nonpharmacologic interventions used to help manage pain were focused on positioning and physical activity such as prescribed exercises, ambulation or getting up out of bed, and sitting in the chair. The value of these interventions has been shown previously,38-40 and the findings from this study should serve as a reminder to all caregivers to increase physical activity to help alleviate pain.

The majority of medications prescribed were acetaminophen and then gabapentin, lidocaine patches, and tramadol. Opioids were ordered more infrequently (18% of all prescriptions), and use of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications was very limited (1%). This is consistent with recommended pharmacologic treatment approaches, particularly among those with cognitive impairment.41,42 A large percentage of the medications were ordered as needed, which is somewhat of a concern in that individuals with cognitive impairment may not be able to express a request for medication and are therefore dependent on the nurse to make that determination.42,43 We did not obtain data as to the actual administration of the as-needed medication, and it is possible that these individuals never received anything for pain or what they received was inadequate in terms of dosages given. This could also explain the large percentage of individuals with evidence of pain.

The associations noted between function, delirium, and quality-of-care interactions and pain were obtained using cross-sectional data and cannot be considered causational. As noted previously, multiple prior studies, however, suggest that physical activity is helpful for the management of pain, particularly for older individuals,6,7,44-46 as was shown in this study. Delirium may be due to the pain or may exacerbate the pain. Regardless of the direction of the relationship, noting this association should increase awareness of caregivers to focus on pain assessment and management among those who are delirious. The lack of an association between the scores on the NPI-Q and pain may be due to limited evidence of neuropsychiatric symptoms among this sample. Among all of these symptoms, depression is the one symptom that has repeatedly been associated with pain in older adults with and without dementia.45,47-49 In the future, it may be helpful to focus specifically on depression.

Finally, the finding that individuals exposed to fewer positive and more negative care interactions are more likely to experience pain should serve as reminder to the staff of the importance of each care interaction with a patient and ensure that all interactions with patients are positive. Positive interactions include those that are social and involve constructive beneficial conversations and companionship, particularly when providing care and getting tasks completed. Neutral interactions are those in which the interactions are brief and indifferent. Finally, negative interactions are those that are protective and focus on keeping the patient safe in a restrictive way or those that oppose or resist the patients’ freedom of action without a good reason. Caregivers should be monitored to provide positive versus neutral or negative interactions with all patients as way to help manage the pain experience as this can be an important nonpharmacologic approach.

STUDY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS

This study was limited by sample size and including only 6 hospitals from 2 states. By design, this was a cross-sectional study and thus causation cannot be assumed. Data were obtained from medical record review, observations, and reports from staff with regard to use of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. We did not obtain information, however, if as-needed medication was actually given during the hospital stay or if and how often nonpharmacologic interventions were provided. Furthermore, no patient or caregiver input was obtained to determine if treatments were effective in resolving the pain. Pain assessments were done at only one point in time and although evaluators were encouraged to evaluate pain during physical activity, we did not record what was being done when the individual experienced pain. Future research should consider addressing these limitations by evaluating pain during multiple different time points, obtaining more information about what was being done when pain occurred, documenting the actual use of all treatments, and the patient’s response to treatment.

CONCLUSION

Despite study limitations, the findings from this study support the relationship between function, delirium, and quality-of-care interactions and pain such that it may be useful to encourage patients with dementia to engage in functional and physical activity to prevent or manage pain, to carefully consider pain among those with delirium and treat the pain accordingly, and should serve as a reminder to avoid neutral or negative care interactions with these types of patients. Recognizing the many challenges to pain assessment and management of older adults with dementia future work needs to continue to develop optimal ways to measure and manage pain in these individuals.
