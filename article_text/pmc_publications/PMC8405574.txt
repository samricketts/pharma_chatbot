A series of novel 2-hydroxybenzylamine-deoxyvasicinone hybrid analogs (8a-8n) have been synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), and as inhibitors of amyloid peptide (Aβ1–42) aggregation, for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). These dual acting compounds exhibited good AChE inhibitory activities ranging from 0.34 to 6.35 µM. Analogs 8g and 8n were found to be the most potent AChE inhibitors in the series with IC50 values of 0.38 µM and 0.34 µM, respectively. All the analogs (8a-8n) exhibited weak BuChE inhibitory activities ranging from 14.60 to 21.65 µM. Analogs 8g and 8n exhibited BuChE with IC50 values of 15.38 µM and 14.60 µM, respectively, demonstrating that these analogs were greater than 40-fold more selective for inhibition of AChE over BuChE. Additionally, compounds 8g and 8n were also found to be the best inhibitors of self-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation with IC50 values of 3.91 µM and 3.22 µM, respectively; 8g and 8n also inhibited AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation by 68.7% and 72.6%, respectively. Kinetic analysis and molecular docking studies indicate that analogs 8g and 8n bind to a new allosteric pocket (site B) on AChE. In addition, the observed inhibition of AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation by 8n is likely due to allosteric inhibition of the binding of this peptide at the CAS site on AChE. Overall, these results indicate that 8g and 8n are examples of dual-acting lead compounds for the development of highly effective anti-AD drugs.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors

1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), featuring progressive and irreversible neurodegeneration.1 AD afflicts up to 5% of people reaching the age of 65, a proportion that increases to 20% in those over 80 years of age.2 Typical AD symptoms are progressive memory impairment, accompanied by behavioral disorders such as aggression, depression and paralysis.3 The most common early symptom is difficulty in recalling recent events. The cholinergic hypothesis suggests that decreased levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain lead to slowly worsening neurodegeneration.

Deposition of Aβ1–42 peptide aggregates also plays a significant role in AD neurotoxicity.4 The enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of several proteins associated with amyloid plaque and its expression is reduced in the brains of AD patients.5, 6 However, the activity of AChE increases around β-amyloid plaque.6 There is significant cross-talk between AChE and β-amyloid (Aβ).7, 8 Previous studies have shown that Aβ protein influences the physiological levels of AChE,7 and AChE has also been shown to promote the assembly of Aβ into amyloid fibrils.7

Inflammation mediated by IL-1 that leads to neuronal damage has also been shown to elevate AChE expression9 and cause non-cholinergic effects such as β-amyloid precursor protein processing and β-amyloid fibril formation and aggregation.7, 8

Small molecules directed against the activity of AChE inhibit the effect of this enzyme on amyloid fibril formation and improve cognitive function.5, 9–13 Thus, current pharmacotherapy studies have focused on increasing the level of ACh through inhibition of AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE).14–16 These two cholinesterase enzymes break down ACh, the neurotransmitter chiefly responsible for cognitive function in the CNS, to choline and acetic acid.17 AChE is able to accelerate the conglomeration of Aβ1–42 peptide into Alzheimer fibrils by decreasing the lag phase of peptide aggregation, suggesting a role for AChE as a chaperone for Aβ1–42 peptide assembly into oligomers of a high structural complexity18. These results suggested that AChE is acting through two possible mechanisms. First, AChE might increase the seeds necessary for the nucleation step, and second, the enzyme might stimulate fibril elongation.19, 20 It is known that amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by peptidases called β- and γ-secretases to release Aβ1–42 peptides, which aggregate as amyloid plaque causing synaptic dysfunction, neuronal cell death, impaired learning/memory and abnormal behaviors.21, 22

Due to the multiple factors involved in AD progression and their possible interactions, therapeutic agents with single targets are often insufficient to treat or ameliorate AD.23 This led us to consider developing multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs),24 a strategy involving logical and systematic modifications to the traditional approach to rational drug design, in order to achieve improved therapeutic efficacy for treatment of AD.

Recently, 2-hydroxybenzylamine-flurbiprofen hybrids (1, Fig. 1) have been reported as multifunctional agents for AD therapy.25 Similar 2-hydroxybenzylamine-tacrine hybrids (2, Fig. 1) have also been reported as multifunctional agents for AD26 (2, Fig. 1). The pyrrolo- or pyrrolidino-quinazolinone moiety is a critical scaffold in many biologically active natural products,27, including alkaloids vasicinone,28 deoxyvasicinone,29 tryptanthrin,30 and luotonins.31 The synthesis of analogs of vasicinone (3a, Fig. 1) and its dehydroxy analogue, deoxyvasicinone (3b, Fig 1) have previously been reported and such compounds have been shown to have anticholinesterase activity23, 32–36 as well as other different pharmacological activities.37 Deoxyvasicinone derivatives have also been developed as MTDLs that inhibit AChE, and BuChE, and Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation.36, 38

Based on the design of hybrid molecules 1 and 2,25, 26 and the observation that deoxyvasicinone MTDL derivatives inhibit both AChE, BuChE, and are also Aβ1–42 aggregation inhibitors,36, 38 the current study focuses on the synthesis and evaluation of hybrid molecules of 2-hydroxybenzylamine and deoxyvasicinone (8a-8n) as new pharmacophores designed as anticholinesterase therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease (Fig. 2).

AChE activity is influenced by Aβ1–42 peptide. This interaction was shown to promote fibrillary formation and aggregation of Aβ1–42 peptide.7 Some of the metal chelator analogues that inhibit Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation also inhibit AChE activity.39 Most of the reported inhibitors of AChE bind to the active site gorge consisting of two pockets; a catalytic active site (CAS) and peripheral anionic binding site (PAS), which lie adjacent to each other.40, 41 Studies suggest that ACh, the natural substrate of AChE, transiently binds to the PAS before diffusing into the CAS.42, 43 While this CAS/PAS region has been the common focus of medicinal chemists for targeting AChE with small molecule inhibitors, the discovery of a new allosteric pocket, termed Site B, by Marcelo et al., has opened up newer avenues for inhibition of AChE.44 With arginine and glutamine residues surrounding the pocket, site B is more polar than its CAS/PAS counterpart.44 Site B is an allosteric pocket and inhibitors binding to this pocket have only recently been reported.45 The 2-hydroxybenzylamine-deoxyvasicinone hybrids we report herein are predicted, based on computational studies, to bind to the allosteric Site B of AChE. This prediction has been substantiated by enzyme kinetics data, which shows clearly that these molecules are non-competitive inhibitors of AChE.

The AChE-Aβ1–42 peptide complex has been shown to be responsible for increased neurodegeneration compared to Aβ1–42 peptide alone. This combined interaction contributes to a greater amount of neurodegeneration and neuronal loss both in vitro in hippocampal neurons, and in in vivo studies, utilizing a rat model of AD, than either component alone.7 We speculated that designing drugs that can bind to AChE and hinder the interaction of Aβ1–42 peptide with this esterase might act as inhibitors of AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation. Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation assays, kinetic studies and molecular docking approaches were performed to test whether the most promising hybrid drug (8n) could inhibit AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation by blocking the interaction of AChE with Aβ1–42 peptide, and also to gain detailed mechanistic insights into the possible mode of action of these novel compounds with their biological targets.

2. Results and Discussion

2.1. Chemistry

Hybrid molecules 8a-8n described herein were synthesized and evaluated for inhibition against AChE and BuChE and for inhibition of β-amyloid aggregation. According to the cholinergic basis for neurodegeneration, the decline in levels of ACh in specific regions of the brain leads to cognitive and memory impairments in AD. AChE and BuChE are the two cholinesterases that can hydrolyze ACh, however, AChE has a 10-fold greater capacity to hydrolyse ACh when compared to BuChE. Thus, highly selective inhibition of AChE is desirable in AD therapy and is also beneficial for diminishing the peripheral cholinergic side effects of BuChE inhibition. 46

Deoxyvasicinone (3b) and 6-methyldeoxyvasicinone (4) were synthesized via literature methods.29 Nitration of 3b and 4 was followed by reduction with Na2S to afford 6-aminodeoxyvasicinone analogs 5 and 6.

Subsequently, intermediates 5 and 6 were condensed with the appropriate salicylaldehyde to afford a series of Schiff’s base derivatives 7a-7n, which upon further reduction with sodium borohydride afforded the target hybrid compounds 8a-8n in yields ranging from 78–93% (Scheme 1). Confirmation of the structure and purity of these analogs was obtained from 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and HRMS spectrometric analysis.

3. Biological Evaluation

3.1. In vitro inhibition of eeAChE and esBuChE

The inhibitory activities of compounds 8a-8n were evaluated against AChE (from electric eel) and BuChE (from equine serum) using the method of Ellman et al,47 with deoxyvasicinone as the reference compound. The IC50 values of the above compounds, and their selectivity indices for inhibition of AChE and BuChE, are summarized in Table 1. Data from this table clearly indicate that hybrid molecules 8a-8n exhibit inhibitory activity against AChE with IC50 values ranging from 0.34 to 6.35 μM. Among these analogs, compounds 8a, 8d, 8g, 8h, 8k, and 8n were found to be the most potent AChE inhibitors, with IC50 values of 1.53 μM, 0.9 μM, 0.38 μM, 1.58 μM, 0.83 μM and 0.34 μM, respectively; all of these inhibitory potencies are higher than that of the reference compound deoxyvasicinone (3, IC50 = 24 μM) (Table 1). In contrast, most of these compounds displayed weak inhibitory activity against BuChE (IC50 values ranging from 14.6 to 20.9 μM) but were slightly more potent than deoxyvasicinone (3, IC50 = 25 μM) in this respect (Table 1). Compounds 8g and 8n afforded the highest inhibitory activity and the highest AChE selectivity (40-fold and 43-fold over BuChE, respectively). Structure-activity analysis indicated that compounds that incorporated an aromatic methoxy group (8d, 8g, 8k and 8n) as a substituent on the 2-hydroxylphenyl moiety afforded the best AChE inhibitory activity.

3.2. Inhibition of Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation

The target compounds, 8a-8n, were also evaluated for inhibitory activity against self-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation at five different concentrations (0.3 µM, 1.0 µM, 3 µM, 9 µM and 27 µM) in the presence of 25µM Aβ1–42. Amyloid aggregation was quantified by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, using clioquinol as a positive control. The inhibition of self-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation results for all the above synthetic analogs from ThT fluorescence assays are shown in Table 1. Most of the compounds showed moderate inhibitory activity, with compounds 8a, 8d, 8g, 8h, 8k, and 8n exhibiting significant inhibition of Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation (IC50s of 4.69, 4.2, 3.8, 5.09, 4.26 and 3.22 µM, respectively) that was superior to the reference compound, clioquinol (IC50 = 9.8 µM).

3.3. Inhibition of AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation

Accumulating evidence indicates that AChE has non-cholinergic functions including the processing and deposition of Aβ1–42 peptide as amyloid plaque.48 AChE can accelerate Aβ1–42 peptide deposition via its peripheral anionic site (PAS), and compounds that bind to the PAS site of AChE can inhibit AChE-accelerated Aβ1–42 peptide deposition. Based on the above results from the studies with AChE and Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation, compounds 8a, 8d, 8g, 8h, 8k, and 8n were also selected for assessment of their abilities to inhibit AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation, quantified by the ThT assay. Fluorescence arising from AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation was significantly decreased in the presence of these six hybrid molecules (Fig. 3), indicating inhibition of AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation: i.e., 8a, 49.0%; 8d, 55.1%; 8g, 68.7%; 8h, 40.2%; 8k, 55.0%; and 8n, 72.6%. Each of these inhibitory values greatly exceeds those produced by compounds clioquinol (11.5%) and 3b (3.83%). In particular, 8g and 8n were substantially more inhibitory to AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation than compounds clioquinol and 3b. The results clearly demonstrate that these two hybrid molecules significantly interfere with AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation.

Based on the above results from the AChE and BuChE inhibitory studies, the most potent compound 8n was selected for kinetic analysis of its inhibitory activity against AChE. The reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 4) generated show increasing slopes (decreased Vmax) and increasing intercepts (increased Km) with increasing concentrations of inhibitor against AChE activity. This pattern characterizes a typical non-competitive/mixed-type inhibition and indicates that compound 8n is binding to an allosteric inhibitory site on AChE.

3.4. Molecular docking studies

Molecular docking of 8n in the crystal structure of AChE (PDB ID:1N5R) predicts that this inhibitor binds to a previously identified allosteric Site B, and not in the CAS/PAS gorge. It is well-known that ACh binds in the CAS pocket, which is distinct from Site B. The presence of Site B in AChE was reported by Marcelo et al44 in 2013. The first reported inhibitor to bind to this site was discovered by Chierrito et al45. The non-competitive enzyme kinetics observed for 8n is consistent with this molecule interacting with an allosteric site on AChE. All the structural features of 8n are involved in interactions at this site contributing to its binding.

The binding pose and key interactions predicted based on molecular docking of 8n at the allosteric site B are illustrated in Fig. 5. His405 forms two hydrogen bonds with the methoxy substituent of 8n and a π-π stacking interaction with the tricyclic core, thus anchoring the inhibitor into the Site B the pocket. The tricyclic core also forms several good contacts with Gln369 and Pro235, and the aromatic methyl substituent (R1) is involved in van der Waal’s contacts with Val367 and Leu536. The terminal phenyl ring forms very strong van der Waal’s interactions and polar contacts with Trp532 and Pro410, while forming moderately strong contacts with Asn233 and Gln413 (Fig. 5).

Previous studies have shown that Aβ1–42 peptide binds at the PAS site of AChE49 and that this binding increases the propensity of this peptide to form aggregates.49 In order to understand the binding mode of Aβ1–42 peptide with AChE, we performed protein-protein docking of this peptide with AChE using the Hex docking package. The results indicate that Aβ1–42 peptide binds at the PAS site and interacts with crucial amino acid residues, including Tyr 341 (Fig. 6).50 Based on our docking studies, we propose that lead compound 8n binds to allosteric Site B and causes structural perturbations at the PAS/CAS site that not only inhibit the binding of ACh, but also impede Aβ1–42 peptide binding at this site, curtailing AChE-induced aggregation of this peptide.

4. Conclusions

In summary, a series of novel 2-hydroxybenzylamine-deoxyvasicinone hybrid structures (8a-8n) was designed and synthesized as potential dual-acting ligands against AD by fusing the deoxyvasicinone molecule (3) to a 2-hydroxy- benzylamine moiety. Among the series of compounds synthesized, 8g and 8n exhibited significant inhibition of AChE activity, and also inhibited self-induced and AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation. Molecular docking studies provided evidence for the hypothesis that the more potent analog 8n binds to an allosteric binding site (Site B) on AChE, and does not bind in the PAS/CAS gorge. Kinetic analysis studies on 8n provided support for the docking studies, showing that this compound affords a classical non-competitive/mixed-type inhibition, which is consistent with the molecule binding to allosteric Site B on AChE. Interestingly, from molecular docking studies, the observed inhibition of AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation by 8n may be due to allosteric inhibition of the binding of this peptide at the PAS site on AChE. These data suggest that compounds 8g and 8n may have potential as multifunctional neuroprotective agents for development as anti-AD drugs.

5. Experimental Section

5.1. Pharmacological evaluation

5.1.1. Inhibition of eeAChE and esBuChE

The inhibitory activities of compounds 8a-8n were evaluated by Ellman’s method.47 All test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with the buffer solution A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH=8.0) to afford the corresponding test concentrations (the final concentration of DMSO was less than 0.5%). Enzyme solutions were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized powder in distilled water. The reaction mixture consisted of buffered solution B (containing 0.02% BSA, 30 µL), different concentrations of the test compounds (10 µL; 0.3 µM, 1.0 µM, 3 µM, 9 µM and 27 µM), 5,5’-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (2.4 mM, 10µL) and eeAChE or esBuChE (10 µL) in a 96-well plate format. The mixture was preincubated at 37°C for 10 min; then acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI) or butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTCI) (1.6mM, 10µL) was added. After incubation for a further 15 min at 37°C, SDS (0.4%, 30 μL) was added to terminate reaction. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader (TECAN, infinite m200 pro). IC50 values were calculated using graph pad prism. Deoxyvasicinone was used as a reference compound. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.

5.1.2. Inhibition of self-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation

The thioflavin T (ThT)-fluorescence assay was used to measure the inhibition of Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation.51 Aβ1–42 peptide (Adooq Bioscience, CA, USA) was pretreated with 1 mL of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) to afford a stock solution, which was aliquoted into small samples. The solvent was evaporated at room temperature, and samples were stored at −80°C. For Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation inhibition experiments, phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was added to the Aβ1–42 peptide stock solution to afford a 50 µM concentration before use. A mixture of the Aβ1–42 peptide (10 µL, 25 µM final concentration) with or without the test compound (10 µL; 0.3 µM, 1.0 µM, 3 µM, 9 µM and 27 µM) was incubated at 37°C for 48 h. Blanks using phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) instead of Aβ1–42 peptide, with or without test compound, were also assessed. Then glycine-NaOH buffer (50 mM; pH 8.0) containing ThT (5 µM) was added to 20 µL of the sample to afford a final volume of 200 µL. Fluorescence intensities were then recorded (excitation, 450 nm; emission, 485 nm).

5.1.3. Inhibition of AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation

Co-incubation of each of the novel hybrid compounds (1 and 5 μM) and Aβ1–42 peptide with AChE afforded inhibition of AChE-induced Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation (10 μM). The aggregation of Aβ1–42 peptide by ThT was monitored at 37 °C for 24 h. The excitation wavelength was 446 nm, and the emission wavelength was 490 nm.

5.1.4. Kinetic characterization of AChE inhibition by 8n

Kinetic studies were performed according to methods reported previously.52 Three different concentrations of compound 8n (0.16, 0.32, 0.64 µM) was added to the mixture of ATCI at 0.32, 0.48, 0.64, 0.96, 1.28 mM respectively and DTNB (0.5mM) in the wells. The inhibitory activity was measured for 10 min at an interval of 2 min in the presence and absence of test compounds. Lineweaver-Burk plots were obtained by plotting reciprocal velocity versus substrate. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.

5.2. General Chemistry

All reagents, solvents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Oakwood Chemicals, Fisher Scientific and Adooq Bioscience. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer equipped with a Linux workstation running on vNMRj software. Spectral analyses were carried out in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 for both 1H and 13C analyses. Chemical shifts were measured in δ parts per million (ppm) and coupling constants (J) were measured in hertz (Hz). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on an Agilent 6545 ESI/APCI TOF MS. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on pre-coated silica gel glass plates (F 254 Merck).

5.3. General procedures for the synthesis of compounds 8a-8n

To a stirred solution of 5 or 6 (0.5 mmol) in CH3OH (3.0 ml) and THF (3.0 ml) was added the appropriate salicylaldehyde (0.56 mmol) at room temperature. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred for 2–3 h to afford intermediate 7a-7n. After completion of the reaction (confirmed by TLC), the reaction mixture was quickly cooled to 0 °C without any further treatment. Then NaBH4 (2.5 mmol) was added, and the resulting reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h. After completion of the reaction (confirmed by TLC), the reaction mixture was quenched with 10% aqueous HCl solution and evaporated to dryness. The residue was basified with saturated NaHCO3 solution and extracted with DCM (3 × 10 ml). The combined organic layers were combined, washed with brine (20 ml), dried over Na2SO4, filtered, concentrated and purified using column chromatography (eluting solvent: hexanes/ethyl acetate, 3:7) to afford the target compounds 8a-8n. Yield were in the range 61–82%.

Fig 5. (A) Positions of the allosteric site B and the CAS/PAS gorge in the AChE crystal structure (PDB #: 1N5R). Hybrid molecule 8n binds to site B and not the CAS site, which explains the observed non-competitive inhibition (B). Key interactions of 8n at the site B allosteric site. Hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions are illustrated in blue and brown dashed lines, respectively.
