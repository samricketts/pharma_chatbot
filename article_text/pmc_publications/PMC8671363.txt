Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves are often used to evaluate the classification performance of continuous measures when considering time-to-event data. When one is interested in evaluating the predictive performance of multiple covariates, it is common to use the Cox proportional hazards model to obtain risk scores; however, previous work has shown that when the model is mis-specified, the estimand corresponding to the partial likelihood estimator depends on the censoring distribution. In this manuscript, we show that when the risk score model is mis-specified, the AUC will also depend on the censoring distribution, leading to either over- or under-estimation of the risk score’s predictive performance. We propose the use of censoring-robust estimators to remove the dependence on the censoring distribution and provide empirical results supporting the use of censoring-robust risk scores.

pmc1 Introduction

Biomarker discovery is crucial in many fields given the major role they play in understanding the mechanisms of disease, tracking disease development1 and, oftentimes, testing for treatment efficacy2. One area in which the discovery of biomarkers is of utter importance is in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) where diagnosis of AD requires post-mortem verification. AD leads to memory loss and to disruption of daily life as people lose the ability to perform daily tasks, impacting not only the person diagnosed with AD, but also everyone around them. It is estimated that 5.8 million Americans currently have AD3. Despite the number of lives impacted by the disease, there is currently no cure.

Previously, AD studies focused on late stages in an effort to treat the disease. More recently, however, research has shifted to earlier stages in an attempt to prevent the disease before it causes significant, irreversible damage. Existing biomarkers, such as the proteins amyloid beta (Aβ), total tau (T-tau) and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) help identify individuals who are more likely to develop AD4,5,6. While these biomarkers can distinguish dementia from other diseases, they do not perform as well when trying to distinguish Alzheimer’s disease from other types of dementia7, making the discovery of AD biomarkers critical. New biomarkers would further provide therapeutic targets, facilitating the discovery of new treatments. In this manuscript we focus on the importance of biomarker discovery in AD. As previously stated, however, the need for new biomarkers is not unique to AD, and it is critical that we develop reliable methods to aid in biomarker discovery.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are often used to evaluate the classification performance of continuous variables, such as potential biomarkers. If one is interested in evaluating the combined performance of multiple biomarkers, a common approach is to calculate a risk score. In the time-to-event setting, the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model is often used to estimate these risk scores. Previous work, however, has shown that under model mis-specification the estimand corresponding to the partial likelihood estimator will depend on the censoring distribution8,9. We hypothesized that the dependence of the risk scores on the censoring distribution could also lead to dependence in estimation of the ROC curve and corresponding AUC, making it difficult to assess relative classification performance of biomarkers evaluated in different samples and complicating the interpretation of time-dependent sensitivity and specificity measures when generalized to prospective populations. In settings such as AD, it is critical that we have reliable, reproducible, and interpretable methods for assessing predictive performance since the identification of new biomarkers can lead to large advancements in the treatment and prevention of the disease.

We begin this manuscript with a brief review of time-dependent ROC curves and the partial likelihood estimator, and discuss the implications of model mis-specification in these settings. In Section 3 we introduce a censoring-robust estimator for the time-dependent AUC, and show its performance empirically through simulation studies. We end with an application of the proposed methodology to data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

2 Background

In this section, we briefly review time-dependent ROC curves and the partial likelihood estimator. We also discuss the implications of model mis-specification when using the partial likelihood estimator and review existing methodology developed to help guard against model mis-specification in the time-to-event setting.

2.1 Time-Dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves

ROC curves are commonly used to evaluate the predictive performance of continuous measures and are generated by plotting estimates of the sensitivity vs. (1 - specificity) for all possible thresholds. Sensitivity represents the P(B &gt; k|disease) and specificity is the P(B ≤ k|disease) for a continuous biomarker, B, and threshold value k. While various summary measures exist for ROC curves, perhaps the most commonly used is the area under the curve (AUC), which is estimated by calculating the area under the ROC curve. The AUC can be interpreted as the probability that an individual with the disease will have a higher score of the continuous measure than someone without the disease10. Classic ROC curves assume that the disease status is fixed over time, which may not be true particularly in the time-to-event setting. Time-dependent ROC curves were therefore introduced for settings in which the disease status and risk sets may change over time. Many estimators have been proposed for the time-dependent setting, differing also in their definition of risk sets and events. In this manuscript, we focus on the estimator proposed by Chambless and Diao (2006)11, but similar results are observed for other estimators. We present parallel results for the Heagerty and Zheng (2005)12 estimator in supplementary material. In the setting considered by Chambless and Diao (2006)11, the sensitivity is defined as the probability that an individual’s biomarker value, Bi, exceeds some threshold value, k, given that the individual experienced an event before time t, or Sens(t, k) = P(Bi &gt; k|Ti ≤ t). The specificity is the probability that an individual has a biomarker value less than or equal to k conditional upon not having experienced an event up to time t, or Spec(t, k) = P(Bi ≤ k|Ti &gt; t)13,11.

It should be noted that the work of Chambless and Diao (2006)11 introduces several estimators including Kaplan-Meier type14 estimators and regression-based estimators of the sensitivity and specificity. The R function AUC.cd in the survAUC package implements the regression-based approach using a Cox PH model. We focus on this estimator in the current manuscript. In their work, Chambless and Diao (2006)11 write the sensitivity and specificity as (1) SensCD(t,k)=P(B&gt;k∣T≤t)=E[(1−S(t∣B))I(B&gt;k)]E[1−S(t∣B)]

and (2) SpecCD(t,k)=P(B≤k∣T&gt;t)=E[S(t∣B)I(B&lt;k)]E[S(t∣B)].

These are estimated using moment-based estimators. S(t|B), the survival function at time t, can be estimated using S^(t∣B)=S^0(t)exp(−γ^B)

where S0(t) is the survival function when all covariate values are 0, and can be estimated using S^0(t)=exp(−Λ^0(t)), with Λ^0(t) being the Breslow (1972)15 estimator. γ^ can be calculated using the Cox PH model11.

Up to this point, we have considered evaluating the predictive performance of a single biomarker. Investigators may be interested in evaluating the performance of multiple biomarkers, however, so the remainder of the manuscript focuses on this setting. A commonly used approach in these settings is to obtain a risk score using the Cox PH model. As seen throughout this section, estimation of time-dependent ROC curves may depend greatly on estimates resulting from the partial likelihood estimator. In Section 2.2 we briefly review the partial likelihood estimator and its performance under model mis-specification. We also discuss three censoring-robust estimators that have been proposed to guard against dependence of the censoring distribution when the model is mis-specified.

2.2 The Partial Likelihood Estimator

As previously noted, one may be interested in estimating the classification performance of a risk score rather than a single biomarker. This is done when comparing the classification performance of different models, or when it is believed that the predictive performance can be improved by combining several biomarkers. As previously stated, the Cox PH model is commonly used to obtain a risk score. In this section, we review the partial likelihood estimator as well as its performance under model mis-specification.

We first introduce some notation. Let Ti, Ci and Zi denote the true event time, censoring time, and covariate value for subject i, i = 1, …, n, respectively. Further, denote the observed time for subject i as Xi = min(Ti, Ci). δi = I(Ti &lt; Ci) is an indicator for whether the subject experienced an event, Yi(t) = I(Xi ≥ t) is the at-risk process, and Ni(t) = I(Xi ≤ t, δi = 1) is the event counting process. Using this notation, the estimating function under the Cox PH model takes the form (3) U(β)=∑i=1n∫t=0∞{Zi−n−1∑j=1nZjYj(t)exp(Zjβ)n−1∑j=1nYj(t)exp(Zjβ)}dNi(t).

Note that, as written, the coefficients are assumed to be constant over time.

2.3 Censoring Distribution and Model Mis-specification

A common assumption under the Cox PH model is the proportionality assumption. We may encounter issues, however, when this assumption is violated. Previous work has shown that under model mis-specification the estimand corresponding to the partial likelihood estimator depends on the censoring distribution8,9. This means that results will depend on study accrual and dropout patterns, which are usually not of scientific interest and vary from one study to the next.

Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9 show that the estimand corresponding to the partial likelihood estimator under a mis-specified model is the solution to (4) ∫0∞EZ(fT(t∣Z)SC(t∣Z)[Z−EZ{ZST(t∣Z)SC(t∣Z)exp(Zβ)}EZ{ST(t∣Z)SC(t∣Z)exp(Zβ)}])dt=0.

Here, SC(t|Z) represents the survival function for the censoring times, and fT (t|Z) and ST (t|Z) represent the density and survival functions for the event times, respectively. Note that the presence of SC(t|Z) indicates a dependence on the censoring distribution. Fortunately, several estimators have been proposed to remove this dependence16,9,17.

Xu and O’Quigley (2000)16 consider the scenario where the censoring distribution does not depend on covariate values, or SC(t) = SC(t|Z). As shown by Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9, in this case Eq. (4) simplifies to ∫0∞EZ(fT(t∣Z)SC(t)[Z−EZ{ZST(t∣Z)exp(Zβ)}EZ{ST(t∣Z)exp(Zβ)}])dt=0.

To remove the dependence on SC(t), Xu and O’Quigley (2000)16 propose using the estimating function (5) UXO(β)=∑i=1n∫t=0∞{WXO(t)(Zi−n−1∑j=1nZjYj(t)exp(βZj)n−1∑j=1nYj(t)exp(βZj))}dNi(t)

where WXO(t)=S(t)/∑i=1nYi(t) and S(t) can be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator14. The estimand corresponding to this estimator is the average covariate effect in the population16 and no longer depends on the censoring distribution.

In many scenarios, however, the censoring distribution will depend on the covariate values. Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9 consider the scenario where the censoring distribution depends on a single, binary covariate. They propose the following estimating function (6) UCR(β)=∑i=1n∫t=0∞WCR(t∣Zi){Zi−n−1∑j=1nWCR(t∣Zj)ZjYj(t)exp(βZj)n−1∑j=1nWCR(t∣Zj)Yj(t)exp(βZj)}dNi(t)

where WC𝑅(t|Zi) = SC(t|Zi)−1 and SC(t|Zi), the covariate-dependent survival function for the censoring times, can be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator14. The resulting estimator again recovers a censoring-independent estimand that can be interpreted as the average covariate effect. One scenario where the censoring distribution may depend on a single, binary covariate is in unblinded clinical trials where participants randomized to the control arm may be more likely to drop out of the study. Note that although the Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9 estimator allows for a covariate-dependent censoring distribution, it can also be used when the censoring distribution does not depend on other covariates.

Other times, the censoring distribution might depend on multiple, possibly continuous, covariates. Nguyen and Gillen (2017)17 proposed survival tree based estimators for these scenarios. Succinctly stated, the three estimators presented in this section allow us to recover an estimand that does not depend on the censoring distribution, therefore allowing us to replicate results across studies.

3 Censoring-Robust Estimation of ROC Summary Measures

In Section 2.3 we saw that under model mis-specification the estimand corresponding to the partial likelihood estimator depends on the censoring distribution. When these risk scores are used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity, the estimand corresponding to these estimators will also depend on the censoring distribution as will summary measures of the corresponding ROC curves. We present these results in more detail in the Appendix. In Section 3.1 we propose estimating the sensitivity and specificity using censoring-robust risk scores16,9,17 in combination with the estimators proposed by Chambless and Diao (2006)11. We empirically show that use of the partial likelihood estimator will lead to dependence on the censoring distribution, and that this dependence is removed when the proposed estimator is used. It should be noted that while we focus on the use of the Chambless and Diao (2006)11 estimator, other estimators of the sensitivity and specificity can be used, as is seen in the Supplementary Material.

3.1 Proposed Censoring-Robust Estimation of ROC Summary Measures

As previously stated, when the risk score model is mis-specified, the estimators for the sensitivity and specificity are consistent for a quantity that depends on the censoring distribution. Because this dependence arises due to mis-specification of the risk score model, we propose calculating risk scores using the censoring-robust estimators presented in Section 2.3. In this manuscript we apply the work of Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9, which can be used when the censoring distribution depends on a single covariate. In practice, one should select the appropriate estimator.

Let β^CR denote the censoring-robust estimator of Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9 and BCR=β^CRZ denote the risk score. Therefore, to obtain estimates of the sensitivity and specificity, we apply the censoring-robust risk score estimator to the estimators of Chambless and Diao (2006)11. The estimators become (7) Sens^CD,CR(t,k)=1/n∑i=1n(1−S^(t∣BCR,i))I(BCR,i&gt;k)1/n∑i=1n(1−S^(t∣BCR,i))

and (8) Spec^CD,CR(t,k)=1/n∑i=1nS^(t∣BCR,i)I(BCR,i&lt;k)1/n∑i=1nS^(t∣BCR,i)

where S^(t∣B)=S^0(t)exp(−γ^B), S^0(t)=exp(−Λ^0(t)), and the Breslow estimator15 can be used to estimate Λ0(t).

By removing the dependence of the risk scores on the censoring distribution, we are able to obtain censoring-robust estimators of the sensitivity and specificity. Because the estimands corresponding to the censoring-robust estimators9,16,17 do not depend on the censoring distribution, the estimators for the sensitivity and specificity will also be consistent for quantities that do not depend on the censoring distribution. We demonstrate this via simulation in Section 4. To obtain a censoring-robust estimator for the AUC, we must calculate the area under the ROC curve generated using the censoring-robust estimators of the sensitivity and specificity.

3.2 Bootstrap Variance Estimates

In practice, we will only observe one realization, and can estimate the variance of the AUC estimates using a bootstrapping approach. To obtain bootstrap estimates, we sample with replacement from our original sample and obtain estimates of the coefficients, risk scores, sensitivity, specificity, and the AUC. If a training and test set are used, bootstrap samples are required for both the training set and the test set. Bootstrap estimates of the variance can be calculated using the approach described in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Estimating the Variance

3.2.1 Interpretation of the Censoring-Robust Estimators of Sensitivity and Specificity

When the risk score model is mis-specified, current estimators of the sensitivity, specificity, and the AUC are consistent for quantities that depend on the censoring distribution. This gives rise to several issues. The first problem relates to replicability. Because the accrual and dropout patterns are likely to differ from one study to the next, different studies may indicate varying levels of predictive performance of the biomarker under investigation even if the predictive performance of the risk score has not changed. Replicability of these results is particularly important when investigating potential biomarkers, a setting for which ROC summary measures are often used. The other problem relates to patient care. In practice, biomarkers are often used to determine the appropriate treatment for a patient. Because the patient is currently receiving care, however, the quantities of interest are the sensitivity and specificity in the absence of censoring. If the estimated sensitivity and specificity depend on the study’s accrual and dropout patterns, they no longer provide relevant information for a particular patient.

The estimators presented here remove dependence on the censoring distribution and are therefore appropriate for both scenarios. When using a censoring-robust estimator of the hazard ratio, the estimand can be interpreted as an average covariate effect over time16. Similarly, the risk scores represent the average “risk” over time based upon measured biomarkers or risk factors. Because the risk scores are no longer dependent on the censoring distribution, neither are the sensitivity and specificity, allowing for replicability of results across studies. As previously stated, this is crucial when evaluating potential biomarkers since accrual and dropout patterns will likely differ across studies. Moreover, we consider our proposed estimators to be most relevant for informing patient care, since the assessment of future risk for a particular patient should not condition upon arbitrary censoring times that the patient will not experience from her/his perspective.

4 Empirical Results

In this section, we empirically show the dependence of the sensitivity, specificity, and the AUC estimates on the censoring distribution when the partial likelihood estimator is used to obtain the risk score. We consider two different settings. In the first, we show that the estimates of the AUC will depend on the censoring distribution when the risk score model is mis-specified. This relates to the issue of replicability discussed in the previous section. In the second setting, we show that when used with the partial likelihood estimator, the Chambless and Diao (2006)11 estimates of sensitivity and specificity estimate a different quantity than that which is clinically relevant (the sensitivity and specificity in the absence of censoring). We present the results for the Heagerty and Zheng (2005)12 estimator in supplementary material.

4.1 Assessing Performance for Replicability

We performed 2,000 simulations, each with 2,000 subjects. Two variables, Z1 and Z2, were used to estimate the risk score for the AUC. Half of all subjects had z2 = 0 and half had z2 = 1. Z1 ~ N(μ = 2+2 ∗ Z2, sd = 1). Under the non-proportional hazards scenario, the true hazard function takes the form λ(t) = exp { log(0.5)+log(0.85)Z1+log(0.05)⋅Z2⋅I(t ≤ 3)+log(2)⋅Z2⋅I(3 &lt; t ≤ 6)+log(1)⋅Z2 ⋅I(t &gt; 6) } with change points at times t = 3 and t = 6. Under the proportional hazards scenario, the hazard function takes the form λ(t) = exp { log(0.5) + log(0.85)Z1 + log(0.30) ⋅ Z2 }. Event times, Ti, were drawn from Exp(λ(t)). The observed times were taken to be Xi = min(Ti, Ci) and we applied different censoring distributions following the cumulative density function FC(c) = (c∕7)r, with r taking values from 0.25 to 4. The density curves corresponding to each of the censoring distributions can be found in the left-most image of Figure 1 where r = 0.25 corresponds to censoring scenario 1 (as labeled on the right side of the plot). The remaining censoring scenarios correspond to an increase of 0.25 in r, ending with r = 4 (scenario 16). Scenario 1 represents a study with higher accrual at later times, and therefore shorter follow-up times. Of the censoring scenarios presented here, scenario 16 (r = 4) is closest to the setting in which no censoring occurs other than administrative censoring at time t = 7.

The risk scores were calculated using a linear combination of the form β^1Z1+β^2Z2 where the coefficient estimates were obtained using the partial likelihood and censoring-robust estimators. Note that in the non-proportional hazards setting, the proportionality assumption is not satisfied, but the partial likelihood estimator assumes proportionality. Because the Chambless and Diao (2006)11 estimator requires a training set and a test set, we generated an additional 1,000 observations to use as the test set.

Figure 1 presents the density curves for the different censoring distributions considered (left plot). The two rightmost plots present the coefficient estimates for each of the censoring scenarios in the left plot. The coefficient estimates were obtained using the partial likelihood estimator and the censoring-robust estimator of Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9. The censoring scenarios on the right-hand side of the left plot correspond to the x-axis in the remaining plots of Figure 1. Note that, as discussed in Section 2.2, when the model is mis-specified the coefficient estimates obtained from the partial likelihood estimator differ depending on the censoring distribution. When censoring times are drawn using scenario 1 (r = 0.25), we find that the coefficient estimate corresponding to Z2 is approximately −1.21. When we consider censoring scenario 16 (r = 4), the coefficient estimate is approximately −0.7. The estimates obtained using the Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9 estimator, on the other hand, do not depend on the censoring distribution. In this case, the coefficient estimate corresponding to Z2 is approximately −0.61 for all scenarios. A similar pattern is observed for the coefficient estimates corresponding to Z1.

Figure 2 presents the estimates of the AUC under the non-proportional hazards (left) and the proportional hazards (right) scenarios. We present the AUC estimates based on the partial likelihood and censoring-robust risk scores at three different time points. Note that, as seen with the coefficient estimates, the estimates of the AUC differ depending on the censoring distribution when the partial likelihood estimator is used and the risk score model is mis-specified. Under censoring scenario 1, we find that the AUC is estimated to be approximately 0.71, and in censoring scenario 16 the AUC is estimated to be approximately 0.63. When using the censoring-robust estimator, however, the AUC is estimated to be approximately 0.62 regardless of the censoring distribution. Similar results are observed at times t = 4.5 and 5.5.

To ensure that the Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9 estimator still performs well when the model is specified correctly, we considered another simulation setting, this time satisfying the proportionality assumption. The right column in Figure 2 presents the AUC estimates under the PH setting. We find that when the proportionality assumption is satisfied, both the partial likelihood estimator and the Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9 estimator perform well under the methods proposed by Chambless and Diao (2006)11. The variability in the estimates (based on the empirical variance) of the AUC is similar regardless of which estimator is used to obtain the risk score.

4.1.1 Bootstrap Estimates of the Variance

In Section 4.1, we presented the AUC estimates along with the empirical standard deviation. In this section, we investigate the performance of the proposed bootstrap estimator. The simulation set-up is the same as that presented in Section 4.1. The only difference is that we ran 1,000 simulations with 1,500 subjects in each. This was done in the interest of time. The bootstrap estimates are based on 100 bootstrap samples for each simulation.

Figure 3 presents the empirical variance and the bootstrap estimates of the variance for the AUC under the partial likelihood and the censoring-robust estimators. We only present times t = 1.5 and 5.5, but the results at t = 4.5 were similar to those presented here. Note that the bootstrap estimator performs well regardless of the censoring distribution. This is true for both the partial likelihood estimator and the censoring-robust estimator. In the earlier censoring scenarios, the estimates of the variance are slightly lower than the empirical variance. We hypothesize that these differences are due to the smaller risk sets in these scenarios. Even in these settings, however, the difference between the variance estimates and the empirical variance are very small.

4.2 Assessing Performance for Patient Care

The second scenario that we investigated considers the performance of the estimators for the sensitivity and specificity. For this setting, we generated a training set and a test set. The results presented in Table 1 are based on 2,000 simulations. The training set was made up of 1,500 subjects and, as before, half of all subjects had z2 = 0, and half had z2 = 1. Z1 ~ N(μ = 2 + 2 ∗ Z2, sd = 1). Under the non-proportional hazards scenario, the hazard function takes the form λ(t) = exp { log(0.5) + log(0.85)Z1 + log(0.05) ⋅ Z2 ⋅ I(t ≤ 3) + log(2) ⋅ Z2 ⋅ I(3 &lt; t ≤ 6) + log(1) ⋅ Z2 ⋅ I(t &gt; 6) }, and under PH the hazard function takes the form λ(t) = exp { log(0.5)+log(0.85)Z1+log(0.30)⋅Z2 }. For the training set, we considered three different settings. In the first, there is no censoring other than administrative censoring. In the second setting, the censoring distribution corresponds to censoring scenario 1 from Figure 1, where the cumulative density function is FC(c) = (c∕7)r and r = 0.25. The third setting corresponds to censoring scenario 16 from Figure 1 where r = 4. As before, Xi = min(Ti, Ci). The test set also included 1,500 subjects, and event times were drawn as in the training set. The training set, however, did not have censoring other than administrative censoring at time t = 7. This was done to evaluate the performance under the setting of interest, which is the most clinically relevant.

We assess the performance of the estimators for sensitivity and specificity when the risk scores are obtained using the partial likelihood estimator and the censoring-robust estimator of Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9. The coefficient estimates were obtained using the training set. We also present the estimated specificity corresponding to an estimated sensitivity of 0.70 based on the training set. The columns for empirical sensitivity and specificity in Table 1 represent the proportion of true positives and true negatives in the test set based on the threshold for a model-based sensitivity of 0.70 in the training set.

Note that the model-based estimates of the specificity differ for the three censoring scenarios. Consider the first time point, t = 1.5, for example. When the partial likelihood estimator is used, the estimated specificity is approximately 0.5 under no censoring, 0.54 when r = 4, and 0.65 when r = 0.25. When the censoring-robust estimator is used to estimate the risk score, the estimates of the specificity remain at approximately 0.5 regardless of the censoring distribution. The same is true for the empirical estimates. The estimated sensitivity is approximately 0.961 under no censoring and 0.845 when r = 0.25, while the estimates under the censoring-robust estimator are 0.961 and 0.954 for no censoring and r = 0.25, respectively. Similar patterns are observed for the remaining time points. It should be noted that at time t = 1.5 the empirical estimates differ from the model-based estimates for both the partial likelihood and the censoring-robust estimators. Because the coefficient estimates were obtained using data with non-proportional hazards but the change point occurs after time t = 3, the risk scores do not accurately represent the data at earlier time points. Note that at the later time points, the estimates of the sensitivity and specificity are much closer to the model-based estimates.

5 Evaluating the Classification Performance of Aβ and APOE 4

As previously discussed, there is currently no cure for AD. In an attempt to prevent AD, research has shifted to earlier stages during which people have few or no symptoms. In these settings, it is important to consider early biomarkers to help identify people who are likely to progress. While biomarkers such as CSF Aβ exist, it is often difficult to distinguish AD from other types of dementia18. In order to develop treatments for AD, we must find new biomarkers, or combinations of biomarkers and other risk factors, to help identify subjects who are likely to progress to AD. Moreover, the discovery of new biomarkers could provide targets for therapeutic treatments.

There are currently several known biomarkers and risk factors for AD. One biomarker is amyloid beta, or Aβ, a protein that can be measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with low levels of CSF Aβ indicating increased AD pathology19. A threshold of 192 pg/ml has been proposed as a possible cutoff to distinguish between people with low levels of CSF Aβ and those not considered to have low levels of Aβ 20. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 allele is also associated with a higher risk of developing AD. People may have one or two alleles of this gene and the risk of developing AD increases with the number of alleles present21.

In this section, we investigate the performance of CSF Aβ and APOE 4 for distinguishing people who develop AD dementia from those who do not. Aβ was included as an indicator for whether the individual had low levels of Aβ at baseline. To increase the classification performance, we also included age and two cognitive assessments: the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Cognitive Subscale- 11 (ADAS 11)22 and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)23. We hypothesized that there would be a time-varying effect since all measures included were those at baseline, and these measures may no longer represent a participant’s state years later. Therefore, we developed risk scores using the partial likelihood estimator and the censoring-robust estimator of Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9 to compare the estimates of the AUC.

Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.

To be included as part of our analysis, participants from ADNI were required to have Aβ, ADAS-11, and MMSE at baseline, as well as their APOE 4 status. Participants could not have a diagnosis of dementia at baseline, and progression was defined as progressing from an earlier stage to a diagnosis of dementia. Table 2 presents the baseline demographics of participants in our study. We included 973 individuals with a mean age of 72.92 years and an average of 16.19 years of education. Approximately 40% of participants had at least one APOE 4 allele, and the average baseline measure of CSF Aβ was 182.14 pg/ml.

Table 3 presents the coefficient estimates used to obtain the risk score. These were calculated using the partial likelihood estimator as well as the censoring-robust estimator. Along with the coefficient estimates, we present the estimate of the AUC corresponding to each of the risk scores. To show how model mis-specification impacts the sensitivity and specificity, we also include the specificity corresponding to an estimated sensitivity of 0.70 for each of the risk scores.

Note that the coefficient estimates differ for the partial likelihood estimator and the censoring-robust estimator. Under the partial likelihood estimator, we estimate that the risk of progressing to AD dementia is 29% higher for people with at least one APOE 4 allele compared to those without any allele. The estimated hazard ratio is 1.92 under the censoring-robust estimator. The largest difference is observed when considering Aβ. The risk of developing AD dementia is estimated to be approximately 3.6 times higher for people with low Aβ compared to those who do not have low Aβ. When using the censoring-robust estimator, the hazard ratio is estimated to be 2.61. The differences in the coefficient estimates lead to differences in the AUC estimates. The AUC is estimated to be 0.787 when the risk score is calculated using the partial likelihood estimator and 0.740 when the censoring-robust estimator is used. The estimates of specificity corresponding to an estimated sensitivity of 0.70 are 0.727 and 0.658 for the partial likelihood and the censoring robust estimator, respectively.

As before, we notice a discrepancy between the estimates obtained using the partial likelihood and the censoring-robust risk scores. These differences are due to the dependence of the risk score on the censoring distribution. As seen in Section 4, the results obtained when using the censoring-robust estimator do not depend on the censoring distribution, and therefore allow for replicability of results when investigating potential biomarkers. Moreover, the interpretation of the results corresponding to the censoring-robust estimator is of clinical interest.

6 Discussion

It has been shown that under model mis-specification the estimand corresponding to the partial likelihood estimator will depend on the censoring distribution. Several estimators, including those of Xu and O’Quigley (2000)16, Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9, and Nguyen and Gillen (2017)17 have been proposed to remove the dependence on the censoring distribution. Most work in this area has focused on inference, but many estimators of the AUC allow for use of the Cox PH model to estimate a risk score. Therefore, it is important to consider how the censoring distribution impacts estimates of the AUC. In this manuscript, we show that when the risk score model is mis-specified, estimates of the AUC also depend on the censoring distribution. This dependence makes it difficult to accurately assess predictive performance of a set of biomarkers since the accrual and dropout patterns of the study could lead to over- or under-estimation of the predictive performance. Moreover, dependence on the censoring distribution makes it difficult to interpret results since these results are dependent upon specific accrual and dropout patterns. In practice, clinicians use estimates of the sensitivity and specificity to determine how accurate the diagnosis of a particular patient is. If results depend on study accrual and dropout patterns, these no longer make sense when treating a particular patient.

We present one way to remove the dependence on the censoring distribution using censoring-robust estimators to obtain the risk scores. We show that even when the model is mis-specified, using the censoring-robust estimators allows us to recover the same results regardless of the censoring distribution and also allows for a more clinically relevant interpretation. In practice, investigators use available estimates of the sensitivity and specificity to investigate predictive performance of continuous measures, but the true predictive performance is not impacted by study accrual and dropout patterns. Moreover, the censoring-independent estimators allow for a clinically relevant interpretation since the sensitivity and specificity are used when diagnosing patients that are currently being treated. The censoring distribution in this case becomes irrelevant. If risk scores will be used to inform patient care, it is important that these do not depend on the censoring distribution, so removing the censoring dependence of the risk scores may be more useful in practice than reweighting estimators of the sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, as seen in this manuscript, censoring-robust risk scores lead to censoring-robust estimators of the AUC. An added benefit of our proposed methodology is that it can be easily implemented in R using existing functions. It should be noted that while we have used the censoring-robust estimator of Boyd, Kittelson, and Gillen (2012)9, the estimators of Xu and O’Quigley (2000)16 and Nguyen and Gillen (2012)17 may also be used.

As seen in Section 3, the model-based estimators proposed by Chambless and Diao (2006)11 did not perform well compared to the empirical estimates at earlier times. We hypothesize that this is due to the presence of non-proportional hazards. Because the risk scores are obtained using all data but our change point occurred after the first time point, the risk scores were not representative of the data at earlier time points. We would like to remind the reader that this is possible for all model-based estimators of the sensitivity and specificity, and we recommend that when using any model-based estimator in practice, readers compare the model-based estimates to the empirical estimates using the training set.

Risk scores can be estimated using time-dependent coefficients along with the partial likelihood estimator24. Application would require specification of the change points, however, which is not usually known. Other works25,26,27 have proposed inverse probability weighted estimators where the sensitivity and specificity are calculated using a weighted Kaplan-Meier type estimator. In this manuscript, we consider regression-based estimators and reweight the risk scores rather than the estimators of the sensitivity and specificity. Our manuscript further explores the impact of the censoring distribution on estimates of the AUC when the risk score model is mis-specified. While Viallon and Latouche (2011)28 show that model mis-specification can lead to biased estimates of the AUC by comparing three censoring scenarios, it should be noted that the focus of their manuscript was to derive a relation between the AUC and the predictiveness curve.

In this manuscript, we have focused on the scenario in which full covariate information is available for all study participants. This is not always the case, however. When it is not possible to collect full covariate information for all study participants, investigators may rely upon efficient sampling designs such as the nested case-control design29,30,31. The nested case-control sampling framework has also been extended to estimate time-dependent ROC curves32. In the nested case-control design setting, it has been shown that under model mis-specification the quantity estimated by the partial likelihood estimator depends not only on the censoring distribution, but also on the number of controls sampled30, leading to dependence of AUC estimates on both. We therefore recommend the use of censoring-robust estimators30 in this case as well.

Appendix

Censoring Dependence of ROC Summary Measures under Model Misspecification

In the manuscript we show that when the risk score model is mis-specified, ROC summary measures will also be impacted by the censoring distribution. Here, we show how this dependence arises.

Consider a scenario in which the risk scores are made up of a linear combination of multiple covariates, and the linear combination is determined by the coefficient estimates resulting from the partial likelihood estimator, β^. The estimand corresponding to the partial likelihood estimator is denoted by βC which, under model mis-specification depends on the censoring distribution8,9. If the risk score is obtained using the coefficient estimates from the Cox PH model as described above, then by Mann Wald we have that β^Z→PβCZ(orB→PBC).

This gives us that the risk score is also consistent for a quantity that depends on the censoring distribution.

Recall that ROC curves are generated by estimating the sensitivity and specificity of the risk scores for all possible thresholds. In this section, we consider estimation of the sensitivity and specificity for the threshold k. Let S^(t∣B)=S^0(t)exp(−B)=exp{−Λ^0(t)exp(−B)}

where Λ^0(t) is the Breslow estimator15. We have that S^(t∣B)−S(t∣B)→P033andthatS(t∣B)−S(t∣BC)→P0,

so by the triangle inequality we have that S^(t∣B)→PS(t∣BC).

Then by the weak law of large numbers we have that 1/n∑i=1n[(1−S^(t∣Bi))I(Bi&gt;k)]→PE[(1−S(t∣BC))I(BC&gt;k)]

and 1/n∑i=1n(1−S^(t∣Bi))→PE[1−S(t∣BC)].

Application of Mann Wald gives us that 1/n∑i=1n(1−S^(t∣Bi))I(Bi&gt;k)1/n∑i=1n(1−S^(t∣Bi))→PE[(1−S(t∣BC))I(BC&gt;k)]E[1−S(t∣BC)],

or SPec^CD(t,k)→PP(BC≤k∣T&gt;t).

Using similar arguments we have that SPec^CD(t,k)→PP(BC≤k∣T&gt;t).

Notice that due to the dependence of the risk scores on the censoring distribution, the estimators of Chambless and Diao (2006)11 are consistent for quantities that also depend on the censoring distribution. Because the AUC estimates rely upon these estimators, we will also observe dependence on the censoring distribution in the AUC.
