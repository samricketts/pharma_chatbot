Aim:

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterised by extracellular deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) in amyloid plaques and intracellular aggregation and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Although several kinases have been identified to contribute to the pathological phosphorylation of tau, kinase-targeted therapies for AD have not been successful in clinical trials. Critically, the kinases responsible for numerous identified tau phosphorylation sites remain unknown. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) have recently been implicated in phosphorylation of non-GPCR substrates, for example, tubulin and α-synuclein, and in neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease. Accordingly, we investigated the involvement of GRKs in the pathophysiology of AD.

Methods:

We performed a comprehensive immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis of the ubiquitously expressed GRKs, namely, GRK2, 3, 5 and 6, in postmortem human brain tissue of control subjects and AD patients.

Results:

GRKs display unique cell-type-specific expression patterns in neurons, astrocytes and microglia. Levels of GRKs 2, 5 and 6 are specifically decreased in the CA1 region of the AD hippocampus. Biochemical evidence indicates that the GRKs differentially associate with total, soluble and insoluble pools of tau in the AD brain. Complementary immunohistochemical studies indicate that the GRKs differentially colocalise with total tau, phosphorylated tau and NFTs. Notably, GRKs 3 and 5 also colocalise with amyloid plaques.

Conclusion:

These studies establish a link between GRKs and the pathological phosphorylation and accumulation of tau and amyloid pathology in AD brains and suggest a novel role for these kinases in regulation of the pathological hallmarks of AD.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Neuropathological changes in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) occur decades before cognitive decline is observed in AD patients [1]. The primary neuropathological hallmarks of AD include extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are mainly composed of aggregates of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and the hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau, respectively [2, 3]. Notably, tau pathology correlates more precisely with the onset and progression of the symptoms of AD than Aβ accumulation [4, 5]. Moreover, specific tau phosphorylation sites correlate well with disease onset and progression [6, 7] and bear promise as diagnostic biomarkers [8–10]. Consequently, great effort has been dedicated to understanding the mechanisms driving tau phosphorylation and its causal role in AD.

Protein phosphorylation is a gatekeeper of cellular function and is tightly associated with both homeostasis and disease [11]. Tau has more than 80 putative phosphorylation sites and is overtly posttranslationally modified in disease, rendering tau aggregation-prone and impairing its clearance [12]. Several kinases have been implicated in both the physiological and pathological phosphorylation of tau, including protein kinase A (PKA), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and others (reviewed in [12, 13]). Levels of GSK3β and CDK5 are elevated in postmortem AD brains, and both kinases accumulate within NFTs in the somatodendritic compartment of hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons in AD [14–16]. Although GSK3β inhibitors, such as Tideglusib, have shown pathological, behavioural and cognitive amelioration in preclinical AD mouse models and good tolerability and safety in AD patients in phases I and II clinical studies [17], no significant cognitive improvement was observed in the larger phase II trial [18]. Significantly, the kinases involved in phosphorylation of numerous identified tau phosphorylation sites remain unknown [19]. Given that kinases are well established therapeutic targets [20, 21], the identification of novel tau kinases involved in AD pathogenesis bears tremendous therapeutic potential [22].

G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) are a family of seven serine/threonine kinases (GRKs 1–7) that regulate the phosphorylation and desensitisation of GPCRs [23, 24]. Recent evidence indicates that GRKs also phosphorylate non-GPCR proteins to modulate multiple cellular responses beyond GPCR-dependent mechanisms (reviewed in [23, 25]). GRKs 1, 4 and 7 display a tissue-specific expression pattern and are restricted to the visual system (GRKs 1 and 7) and the testis (GRK4) [23, 24]. However, GRKs 2, 3, 5 and 6 are ubiquitously expressed throughout the body [23, 24] and have been implicated in cancer progression [26], cardiovascular disease [27, 28], inflammatory processes [29, 30] and several neurological disorders, including addictive behaviours [31–33], pain [34, 35], mood disorders [36, 37], schizophrenia [38–40] and Parkinson’s Disease (PD) [41–45]. In AD, GRK2 has been postulated as a potential tau kinase [46, 47] and qualitatively associated with NFTs in AD patient brain samples [48]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in Grk5 alter its subcellular localisation and subsequent tau phosphorylation [49], possibly through modulation of GSK3β activity in vitro and in vivo [49, 50]. In vivo genetic deficiency of Grk5 has also been shown to lead to AD-like phenotypes, including axonal swelling [51, 52], Aβ deposition [53], gliosis [54] and selective neurodegeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons [55, 56]. In contrast to GRKs 2 and 5, GRKs 3 and 6 have not been associated with AD pathogenesis in any context thus far. Although previous studies support the putative involvement of one or more GRKs in the pathophysiology of AD, a precise characterisation of the expression and localisation of GRKs in AD-relevant brain regions and different cell types is lacking.

Here, we report the first comprehensive characterisation of the expression and distribution of the ubiquitously expressed GRKs in control and AD human brain samples. We hypothesised that changes in expression and localisation of the GRKs would shed light on their putative association with tau pathology in AD. Indeed, we identify a cell-type-specific pattern of GRK expression in neurons, astrocytes and microglia in the human brain. Moreover, we establish that GRKs 2, 5 and 6 are specifically downregulated in the CA1 of the AD hippocampus. Importantly, the CA1 is severely affected by tau pathology and is closely associated with cognitive impairments in AD patients [57, 58]. Finally, using a combination of biochemical and immunohistochemical approaches, we determine that the GRKs differentially associate with distinct pools of tau under physiological conditions and at the early and late stages of AD pathogenesis. Collectively, these studies establish the association between GRKs 2, 3, 5 and 6 and major hallmarks of AD pathophysiology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Human brain samples

All brain samples were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) brain bank at the University of Pittsburgh. The use of human samples was approved by the Committee for Oversight in Research Involving Decedents at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The demographic and clinicopathological details of the cases used in the study are specified in Table S1. Standardised pathological criteria were utilised for the postmortem diagnosis of AD pathology, including the stage of NFT pathology based on Braak and Braak [57], neuritic plaque density based on CERAD criteria [59], and level of likelihood that the patient’s dementia was due to AD as determined by the National Institute of Aging-Reagan Institute (NIA-RI) [60]. Only AD cases without evidence of concurrent TDP-43 pathology and no or minimal Lewy body pathology [61] were selected for the study (supporting information Table S1). Control cases were negative for neuritic plaques but may have had minimal to mild age-related tau pathology, consistent with Primary Age-Related Tauopathy (PART) [62]. PART is exclusively a neuropathological designation and is not accompanied by a clinical status of cognitive decline, such as in AD [63]. Control and AD cases were age- and sex-matched. Age and PMI equity was checked by unpaired t-tests between control and AD cases (Age: t = 0.5499; df = 18; p = 0.5891; PMI: t = 0.4682; df = 18; p = 0.6453).

Antibodies

All antibodies used in this study are listed in Table S2. Further, in-house validation of specificity for the GRK antibodies is provided in Figure S1. Briefly, antibodies were shown to recognise the major GRK isoforms in human control and AD brains and specifically recognise each GRK following expression in HEK293 cells (supporting information Figure S1). pcDNA-GRK bovine plasmids were a gift from Robert Lefkowitz (Addgene). The GRK antibodies recognise conserved amino acid sequences, between human and bovine sequences, of the C-terminus of each GRK.

Human brain homogenisation

Frozen tissue from the anterior hippocampus (Control = 10 and AD = 10) was obtained for biochemical analysis. A detailed diagram of the protocol used for extraction is outlined in Figure S2A. In brief, samples were first homogenised in extraction high-salt buffer (HS buffer) without detergent using a Beadbug® 3-position homogeniser (Benchmark). The initial homogenate was collected as a Total Homogenate (TH). Equivalent concentrations of the TH samples were transferred to fresh 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and sucrose solution (1-M final concentration) was added. Samples were centrifuged at 45,000g for 30 min at 4°C on a table-top ultracentrifuge (Beckman Counter). After centrifugation, the visible lipid layer was removed using a Q-tip. The remaining supernatant and pellet were rehomogenised, and a 10% Sarkosyl solution (Sigma Aldrich) was added (v/v) to reach a final concentration of 1% Sarkosyl. After 15-min incubation on ice, samples were probe sonicated (Fisher Scientific) and then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min at 4°C on a table-top ultracentrifuge (Beckman Counter). The resulting supernatant was collected as the Sarkosyl Soluble Fraction (SOL). The remaining pellet was rinsed twice with PBS and then homogenised in 200 μl of PBS containing phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma Aldrich). Samples were sonicated to clear the supernatant and kept as the Insoluble Fraction (INSOL). Aliquots of all fractions were prepared to avoid repeated freeze and thaw cycles and maintained at −80°C.

Western blot analysis

Equal protein amounts of extracted samples were loaded onto 4%–12% Bis-Tris Plus gels (Invitrogen) and ran at constant voltage (50 V) in 1X Tris-Glycine-SDS running buffer (Bio-Rad) for approximately 3 h. Due to the high number of cases, samples were divided into two groups. Five control and five AD cases were run on each of two gels that were further processed in parallel through the whole extent of the western blot protocol. Protein was transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), blocked in TBS-T (Tris-buffered Saline + 0.1% Tween 20) + 5% milk for 1 h at RT and incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. Signal was detected using species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Western blots were developed using the SuperSignalTM West Femto substrate (Fisher Scientific) and imaged on the Amersham ImageQuant 800 imager (GE Healthcare). Quantification was performed using the ImageLab software 6 (Bio-rad). The quantified values are presented as a ratio of the background-adjusted density of the main protein of interest normalised by the respective GAPDH-matched band intensity. Data are presented as a percentage change from the mean intensity of the control group.

Immunofluorescence staining

Slides containing 10-μm sections of paraffin-embedded tissue from the hippocampus at the level of the lateral geniculate body were obtained for each case (Control n = 5; AD n = 7). Sections were deparaffinised (100% Xylene; 2×5min) and dehydrated in serial ethanol dilutions (100%, 95%, 70%, 50% and ddH2O for 5 min each). Sections were incubated in antigen retrieval buffer (Tris-EDTA pH 9; Abcam) for 30 min in a water bath at 95°C. Slides were then blocked (10% Normal Goat Serum in 1XPBS) for 30 min at RT. Sections were then incubated sequentially with each primary antibody (overnight at 4°C) and Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibody (1 h at RT on the following day) pair. For the same species antibody combinations (i.e. mouse-on-mouse), sequential staining of each primary and secondary antibody combination was used to prevent antibody cross-reactivity, which we empirically tested (Figure S3). Following each incubation, slides were washed 3 × 5 min in 1XPBS at RT. DAPI was used for nuclei counterstaining. Thioflavin S (Sigma Aldrich) was prepared as a 0.05% solution in water. Slides were incubated in Thioflavin S for 20 min and washed 3 × 5 min in 70% ethanol. Slides were then incubated for 5 min in a Sudan black-based autofluorescence eliminator reagent (Millipore Sigma) at RT, washed 3 × 1 min in 70% ethanol, mounted (ProLong® Diamond Antifade mounting media; Fisher Scientific) and stored in the dark.

Confocal microscopy: Image acquisition and analysis

Images were obtained with a Nikon A1R HD25 confocal microscope. Acquisition settings (laser intensity, gain and offset) were kept constant for all images within a staining group. Collectively, 5760 z-stack images were acquired. Images were flattened to a 2D-view using maximum intensity projections (MaxIP) and saved for further processing and analysis. Stereological [64] and intensity-based analysis was conducted using the General Analysis 3 plugin in the NIS-Elements software. Before any quantification was assessed, all the channels collected within an image were corrected for background subtraction and potential uneven illumination using the “rolling ball” method (as shown in [65]). For all imaging quantification, we report either a Pearson colocalisation coefficient (PCC) displayed as values from −1 (lowest colocalisation) to 1 (highest colocalisation) [66] or mean intensity measurements in arbitrary units. Region-specific levels of each GRK were obtained from a whole field intensity analysis after background correction and normalised to total nuclei count. Additional information on imaging parameters, collection, processing and analysis is shown in Figure S2B.

Statistical analysis

Imaging and Western blot data were subjected to statistical analysis using the GraphPad Prism® 8 software. Outliers were first identified using the ROUT method [67] and excluded when applicable. The D’Agostino and Pearson and the Shapiro–Wilk normality tests were used to check for normal distribution of the data. Unpaired two-sided t-test or nonparametric Mann–Whitney test was used when comparing two groups. Ordinary one-way Analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparison test, or nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis, followed by the post hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test, was used when comparing more than two groups. Two-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Šidák’s multiple comparison test, was performed when comparing more than two variables across several groups. Linear regression was used to assess the correlation between variables of interest. For these cases, the goodness of fit (R2) is reported, along with a two-sided F-statistic to assess whether the slope of the regression is significantly different than zero. Data are presented as mean ± Standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was established at p &lt; 0.05. *p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01; ***p &lt; 0.001; ****p &lt; 0.0001.

RESULTS

GRKs are abundantly expressed in neurons and differentially expressed in microglia and astrocytes in the human brain

AD tau pathology primarily develops as intracellular inclusions in neurons in the hippocampus and associated cortices [68]. Accordingly, we first determined that all four GRKs are expressed in neurons (Figure 1A–D; top panels). To further investigate the complex multicellular nature of AD [69, 70], we determined the GRK expression pattern in astrocytes and microglia (Figure 1A–D; middle and bottom panels) relative to neurons. GRK2 is abundantly expressed in neurons and minimally expressed in astrocytes and microglia (Figure 1E). In contrast, GRK3 displays comparable levels of expression in neurons and astrocytes relative to microglia in AD brains (Figure 1F). Finally, GRKs 5 and 6 are expressed in neurons but are more abundantly expressed in microglia (Figure 1G,H). The GRKs display a similar pattern of cell-type-specific expression in control brains (Figure S4). GRKs 3 and 5 (Figure 1B,C) also display notable nuclear staining, a subcellular localisation that has been previously described for these kinases [71]. Importantly, a similar percentage of cells is positive for each GRK in control and AD brains (Figure S5), indicating that putative changes in cell-type populations in AD patient samples [72] do not affect the pattern of cell-type-specific expression of the GRKs in neurons, astrocytes and microglia.

Levels of the GRKs 2, 5 and 6 are reduced in the CA1 of the AD hippocampus

The hippocampal formation, specifically the CA1, and the EC are primary areas affected by tau pathology in AD [57, 73]. Biochemical analysis of total brain homogenates indicates that GRK protein levels are similar in control and AD brains (Figure S6A–D; upper panels and E–H). Importantly, we report levels of a noncanonical brain-enriched GRK6 55-kDa isoform in total homogenates (Figure S6D), an observation discussed in later sections. Interestingly, further region-specific immunohistochemical analysis demonstrates that expression of GRKs 2, 5 and 6, but not GRK3, is specifically decreased in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of AD brains relative to the CA3, DG, SUB and EC (Figure 2). Importantly, the analysed percentage of cells positive for each GRK is similar in control and AD brain samples (Figure S5), emphasising that the change in region-specific expression of the GRKs is not driven by putative changes in cell population characteristic of AD brains [72]. Taken together, these results indicate a specific and robust vulnerability of the CA1 to GRK downregulation in AD.

GRK localisation and expression differentially correlate with total tau in the human AD brain

Given that the GRKs are expressed in neurons (Figures 1 and S4) and that GRKs 2, 5 and 6 are selectively downregulated in the CA1 of the AD hippocampus (Figure 2), we then sought to investigate a putative association between the GRKs and tau expression in control and AD brain samples. First, we performed coimmunolocalisation studies with hippocampal and EC AD brain sections with GRK-specific antibodies and a total tau antibody (Figure 3), which recognises all tau species (i.e. monomers, oligomers, soluble and insoluble tau) (Figures S8 and S9). Relative to GRK2 (Figure 3A) and GRK6 (Figure 3D), GRK3 (Figure 3B) and GRK5 (Figure 3C) are more abundantly colocalised with total tau in AD brains (Figure 3E). GRKs 3 and 5 display a similar level of coimmunolocalisation with total tau (Figure 3E). Further biochemical analysis indicates that the GRKs display differential correlation trends with total tau protein levels in the control and AD brains (Figure S10). Specifically, GRK3 (Figure S10C) and GRK5 (Figure S10D) inversely correlate with total tau protein levels but display a similar degree of coimmunolocalisation with total tau in AD brains (Figure 3E). These results indicate that both GRKs 3 and 5 may display a pronounced, although possibly distinct, association with total tau under pathological conditions.

GRKs positively correlate with soluble tau levels in the human AD brain

Tau is predominantly a soluble, monomeric protein under physiological conditions [12]. Conversely, in pathology, hyperphosphorylation events lead to a decrease in tau solubility and an increase in the accumulation of insoluble pools of tau [74] (Figure S9A–D). To gain biochemical insight into GRK involvement in the pathological accumulation of tau, we extracted Sarkosyl-soluble and insoluble fractions from the hippocampus of control and AD brains (Figures S2A and S8A). First, we determined that soluble GRK levels are comparable in control and AD brains (Figure S6A–D; middle panels and I–L). Interestingly, we observed a statistically significant positive correlation with soluble GRK3 (Figure 4A,C) and a positive correlation trend with GRK2 (Figure 4A,B) and GRK6 (Figure 4A,E) and soluble tau in the AD brain samples. Accordingly, further analysis using median segregation [75] of soluble tau levels in AD patients (Figure S9E) shows that GRKs 2, 3 and 6 are more abundantly expressed in samples with high soluble tau relative to the low soluble tau levels (Figure 4F,G,I). For both analyses, GRK5 follows a similar trend, although the results are not significant (Figure 4D,H). Further, we determined that all four GRKs are also equally present in Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions in control and AD brains (Figure S6A–D; bottom panels and M–P) and do not significantly correlate with insoluble tau in AD cases (Figure S11). The early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) is a strictly soluble protein [76] and is only detectable in total homogenates and soluble fractions but not in insoluble fractions (Figure S9A), providing confidence that the presence of the GRKs in insoluble fractions is not due to an artefact of the extraction. Taken together, these data indicate a putative association between GRKs 2, 3 and 6 with soluble, but not insoluble, tau in AD brains.

For GRK6, the predominant isoforms A and B migrate at 66 kDa. However, we observed a higher abundance of a 55-kDa, noncanonical, GRK6 isoform (Uniprot D6RHX8) in the human brain (Figure S7A). Interestingly, although control and AD brain samples express similar levels of each GRK6 isoform (i.e. GRK6 A/B and the 55 kDa GRK6-D6RHX8) in total homogenate samples (Figure S7B,C), only the 55-kDa GRK6 isoform is detectable in soluble and insoluble human brain extracts (Figure S6D). Accordingly, we analysed expression of the more prevalent 55-kDa GRK6 isoform in soluble and insoluble human brain extracts (Figures 4, S6H,L,P, S10E and S11H,I). Interestingly, the 55-kDa GRK6 isoform is also enriched in in vitro differentiated human neurons relative to their neural progenitor cells (Figure S7D). These results highlight the specific detection of an unexplored GRK6 isoform in human neurons and the human brain. Future studies will determine the expression pattern throughout the brain and elucidate the functional implications of the enrichment of this GRK6 isoform in the human brain.

GRKs associate with phosphorylated tau pathology in the human AD brain

Given the correlation between GRKs 2, 3 and 6 with soluble tau (Figure 4) and the evidence indicating the increased susceptibility of soluble tau to changes in phosphorylation [77], we sought to determine the immunolocalisation of GRKs relative to an established marker of pathologically phosphorylated tau (p-Tau; PHF1+) in the AD brains (Figure S8B). GRK2 (Figure 5A) and GRK6 (Figure 5D) are highly colocalised with p-Tau+ NFTs (Figure 5E), relative to GRK3 (Figure 5B) and GRK5 (Figure 5C). Notably, GRK6 is more significantly colocalised with p-Tau+ NFTs relative to GRK2 (Figure 5E). Early stages of tau pathology are characterised by the accumulation of p-Tau in dystrophic neurites, which are structures that contain neuropil threads, enlarged axons and degenerating neuronal bodies [78, 79]. GRK6 also displays the highest level of colocalisation with p-Tau within dystrophic neurites (Figure S12D,E), relative to GRK2 (Figure S12A), GRK3 (Figure S12B) and GRK5 (Figure S12C). We did not observe differences in the mean number or area of dystrophic neurites assessed relative to the GRKs (Figure S13A,B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that GRK6 and, to a lesser extent, GRK2 are closely associated with p-Tau+ NFTs and dystrophic neurites, with the latter suggesting an early involvement of GRKs 2 and 6 in the tau pathological cascade in AD.

GRKs are colocalised with late-stage NFTs and amyloid plaques in the AD brains

Tau insolubility correlates with the progressive late-stage formation of Paired Helical Filaments (PHFs) and argentophilic NFTs [80]. Tau phosphorylation-specific markers label early intracellular stages of tau aggregation [81, 82]. However, as tau begins to form insoluble fibrillar filaments, many phosphorylation-specific epitopes become hidden in the fibril core [83, 84]. Thioflavin S (ThioS) is a fluorescent dye that recognises the amyloid-like β-pleated sheet structure of late-stage NFTs and amyloid plaques [80, 85]. Given the association between GRKs with total tau and p-Tau (Figures 3, 5 and S12), we sought to determine whether the GRKs are associated with late-stage ThioS+ NFT pathology in AD brains. Significantly, GRK3 (Figure 6B) and GRK5 (Figure 6C) are abundantly colocalised with ThioS+ NFTs (Figure 6E) relative to GRK2 (Figure 6A) and GRK6 (Figure 6D). These results suggest that these kinases contribute to the development of late-stage tau pathology. Interestingly, we observe a similar association between GRK3 (Figure 7B) and GRK5 (Figure 7C) with ThioS+ amyloid plaques (Figure 7E), whereas less association is observed with GRK2 (Figure 7A) and GRK6 (Figure 7D). There were no differences in the mean number or area of ThioS+ NFTs (Figure S13C,D) or amyloid plaques (Figure S13E,F) assessed relative to the four GRKs. Importantly, although ThioS also recognises the β-pleated sheet structure of Lewy bodies, which are composed of aggregates of α-synuclein, found in PD and other synucleinopathies [86, 87], amyloid plaques, NFTs and Lewy bodies can be regionally and morphologically distinguished in the human brain, as performed here. Taken together, these results indicate a strong association between GRKs 3 and 5 with ThioS+ NFT and amyloid plaque pathology, highlighting their putative involvement in modulating the two main pathological hallmarks of AD.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we investigated the association between the four ubiquitously expressed GRKs, that is, GRKs 2, 3, 5 and 6 and tau pathology in postmortem control and AD brain tissue. First, we sought to thoroughly characterise the cell-type- and region-specific expression of the GRKs in the human brain as a foundation to understand their putative involvement in AD pathogenesis (Figure 8). We identified GRK expression in neurons, the cell type most vulnerable to tau pathology in AD [88, 89]. The high degree of GRK2 neuronal expression is in agreement with the previously reported association of GRK2 with damaged mitochondria in neurons of the human AD hippocampus [90] and in postsynaptic densities in the rat brain [91]. Importantly, the diverse cellular nature of AD [69, 70] led us to further dissect GRK expression in other major cell types in the brain. We determined that GRKs 5 and 6 are preferentially expressed in microglia in control and AD brains relative to neurons and astrocytes. In accordance with these findings, GRK5 has been implicated in the hyperreactivity of murine microglia when challenged with subthreshold levels of Aβ in vitro [92]. Additionally, although GRK6 has been shown to mediate TNF-alpha-dependent inflammatory responses in peripheral macrophages [93, 94], the microglia-specific expression of GRK6 has not been reported to date and suggests the potential involvement of GRK6 in AD-related neuroinflammation. Nonetheless, the expression of GRK5 in neurons appears to play a fundamental role in dendritic arborisation through its interaction with F-actin [95]. Collectively, the determination of the cell-type expression pattern of the GRKs in neurons, astrocytes and microglia suggests that they are involved in different aspects of AD pathogenesis.

The expression of GRKs 2, 5 and 6 has been reported in the pre-frontal cortex of healthy human brains, with expression decreasing with age [96, 97]. However, under pathological conditions, GRK levels have been shown to be both decreased and increased in schizophrenia and PD, respectively [41, 97]. In AD, GRK2 expression data in the human brain have only been qualitative [98]. Nevertheless, GRK2 levels are elevated in peripheral lymphocytes [99] and in the brain of aged AD mouse models [92]. Although our biochemical data indicate that GRK protein levels are similar in the hippocampus of AD patients and control subjects, further region-specific immunohistochemical investigation reveals the specific decrease in levels of GRKs 2, 5 and 6 in the CA1 of the AD hippocampus. These results highlight the need for complementary biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis to fully characterise putative changes in expression and localisation of GRKs in AD. Importantly, CA1 is one of the first brain regions affected by AD pathology [57, 100] and the most vulnerable to consequent cell death [101, 102]. Interestingly, downregulation of CDK5, an identified tau kinase, in murine pyramidal neurons of the CA1 attenuates cell death, whereas CDK5 activation promotes apoptosis [103, 104]. These observations lend support to the hypothesis that, in contrast to CDK5, GRK deficiency might enhance or promote susceptibility of the CA1 to AD tau pathology and neurodegeneration. Whilst the downregulation of the GRKs implies decreased protein levels, it is possible that kinase activity is increased in AD brains as a compensatory measurement. Moreover, abnormal subcellular localisation of GRKs 2 and 5 has been observed as a consequence of ageing and AD progression in in vitro and mouse models [92], suggesting that this process might be happening within neuronal cells in the human AD brain, and thus impacting GRK activity. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether changes in GRK levels correlate with changes in kinase activity and subcellular localisation and if these events directly or indirectly influence their observed association with disease pathogenesis.

Phosphorylation plays a critical role in tau physiology and in the development and progression of tau pathology in AD brains [77]. Importantly, soluble tau is more susceptible to phosphorylation. In turn, phosphorylation can alter the solubility of tau [77]. As such, there is an intricate and complex balance between the physiological and pathological phosphorylation of tau that affects the solubility and aggregation of this protein [105]. We determine that soluble GRKs 2, 3 and 6 are more abundantly expressed in AD brains with high soluble tau levels. Furthermore, GRK3 displays a significant positive correlation with soluble tau levels in the AD brain. Accordingly, GRKs 2 and 6 are also primarily associated with p-Tau+ NFTs and dystrophic neurite pathology in AD brains. In accordance with these findings, GRKs 2 and 3 were identified as potential tau kinases in vitro [47]. Additionally, studies have implicated GRK2 in the direct binding and phosphorylation of tubulin [106–108], which may alter the association of tau with microtubules, changing its solubility state and thus promoting pathology formation. Our results and previous studies implicate GRKs 2 and 6 not only in the modulation of tau solubility but also in the potentiation of tau phosphorylation and accumulation in pathological inclusions.

In AD and other neurodegenerative tauopathies, pathological phosphorylation of monomeric soluble tau leads to its aggregation into detergent-insoluble PHFs and NFTs [109]. Here, we observe extensive colocalisation of GRKs 3 and 5 with late-stage ThioS+ NFTs. Accordingly, GRK5 has been shown to accumulate in Lewy body inclusions in sporadic PD patient brains, where it colocalises with α-synuclein [44]. GRK5 has also been shown to phosphorylate α-synuclein, contributing to PD pathogenesis [110, 111]. These findings suggest that GRKs 3 and 5, although not associated with the phosphorylated tau species assessed here, may become entrapped in NFTs at later stages of disease progression. Importantly, GRK5 has been implicated in the indirect modulation of tau phosphorylation via GSK3β, one of the major tau kinases [49, 50], highlighting a yet to be explored putative link between GRK5 and tau phosphorylation and aggregation. Additionally, we report the presence of the four GRKs in detergent-insoluble protein fractions from human brains. GRK2 has been previously shown to associate with insoluble PHFs in the frontal lobe of AD brains [48]. We present the first report of the presence of the four GRKs in insoluble protein fractions from the hippocampus of AD brains, which opens an unexplored avenue for the investigation of the disease-relevance of tau in modulating GRK insolubility and vice versa. Finally, we report a significant colocalisation of GRKs 3 and 5 within ThioS+ amyloid plaques. This observation indicates that GRKs 3 and 5 may contribute to the pathophysiology of both Aβ and tau in AD, possibly linking their respective pathological cascades.

In light of our results and previous studies, we hypothesise that GRKs might work in functional groups, with GRKs 2, 3 and 6, directly or indirectly modulating tau solubility and phosphorylation, whilst GRKs 3 and 5 may be more involved in later stages of the tau pathological cascade and, potentially, the formation of amyloid plaques. Accordingly, GRK functional redundancy has been observed for GPCRs. Specifically, one GRK from each subfamily (e.g. GRKs 2 and 5 or GRKs 2 and 6) can form a functional pair to establish receptor-specific phosphorylation signatures [112, 113]. Collectively, these observations suggest that GRKs may act cooperatively to modulate different stages of tau pathology.

The first limitation of this study is that the correlation between the GRKs and p-Tau is restricted to one dual phospho-site antibody, that is, PHF1. Although PHF1 is widely used in the pathological assessment of human AD brains, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the association of GRKs with tau phosphorylation. The second limitation is that our sample size is restricted to 20 cases (n = 10 for each group), which might compromise the power of regression analysis and prevents further statistical analysis of the data segregated by sex. Although a greater number of samples would increase the confidence of these findings, the depth of characterisation performed with these samples would not be feasible with a greater number of cases. Finally, most of the AD patients had secondary neurological pathologies, characteristics of elderly patients, which may have introduced an inherent, and potentially confounding variable to the study. Nevertheless, this variability is representative of disease manifestation in most elderly individuals.

In conclusion, our findings indicate that, although all four GRKs are expressed in neurons, the GRKs do indeed display a cell type-specific pattern of expression in the human brain in control and AD subjects. As excitatory neurons are more vulnerable to the development of tau pathology [88, 89], future studies should determine the cell subtype-specific GRK expression pattern (e.g. inhibitory and excitatory neurons). Additionally, the observed downregulation of GRKs 2, 5 and 6 in the CA1 suggests that the GRKs play a fundamental role in disease pathogenesis in one of the most pathologically vulnerable and compromised areas of the AD brain. Given the positive correlation between GRKs 2, 3 and 6 and soluble tau and their association with p-Tau, we hypothesise that these kinases may directly or indirectly [1] alter tau solubility, [2] tau phosphorylation and/or [3] tau aggregation. In fact, their putative implication in the pathological aggregation of tau is supported by the colocalisation of GRKs 3 and 5 with late-stage NFTs in the human AD brain. Furthermore, as AD is one of many tauopathies, the GRKs may also play a central role in the pathological phosphorylation and/or aggregation of tau in other tauopathies, such as Pick’s Disease, Corticobasal Degeneration, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Collectively, our results provide a foundation for further mechanistic investigation of GRKs in tau pathology, which could lead to the development of GRKs as potent drug targets for AD and other tauopathies.

FIGURE 8 Summary of findings for G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) expression and distribution in the human AD brain. The illustration summarises the major findings of our immunohistochemical and biochemical characterisation of GRK expression, distribution and association relative to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology in the human brain. The top right corner (1) shows the differential expression of GRKs in neurons (MAP2+), astrocytes (GFAP+) and microglia (IBA1+) in the AD brain. GRK2 is predominantly expressed in neurons, GRK5 and 6 in microglia and GRK3 displays a similar pattern of expression in neurons and astrocytes. The lettering size of the GRKs represents the degree of colocalisation with the respective cell-type-specific marker. The top left corner (2) highlights the decrease in expression of GRKs 2, 5 and 6 in the CA1 of the human AD hippocampus. The bottom left corner (3) summarises the association of each GRK with tau in different protein fractions from AD brains. The GRKs differentially correlate with total tau levels. GRKs 2, 3 and 6 positively correlate with soluble tau (+ sign). None of the GRKs significantly correlate with insoluble tau levels. Lastly, the bottom right corner (4) illustrates the association of GRKs with total tau, p-Tau, NFTs and amyloid plaques in AD. GRKs 3 and 5 are most abundantly colocalised and expressed with total tau. GRKs 2 and 6 are most abundantly colocalised and expressed within p-Tau NFTs. Remarkably, GRKs 3 and 5 colocalise with both late-stage ThioS+ NFTs and amyloid plaques. Illustration created with BioRender.com
