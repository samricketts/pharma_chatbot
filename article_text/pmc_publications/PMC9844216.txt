Preservation of genomic integrity is crucial for nervous system development and function. DNA repair deficiency results in several human diseases that are characterized by both neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Recent research has highlighted a role for compromised genomic integrity as a key factor driving neuropathology and triggering innate immune signaling to cause inflammation. Here we review the mechanisms by which DNA damage engages innate immune signaling and how this may promote neurological disease. We also consider the contributions of different neural cell types towards DNA damage-driven neuroinflammation. A deeper knowledge of genome maintenance mechanisms that prevent aberrant immune activation in neural cells will guide future therapies to ameliorate neurological disease.


pmc1 Introduction.

Living organisms maintain homeostasis by employing various strategies to detect, repair and respond to internal and external damage. An array of DNA damage response (DDR) pathways has evolved to protect the genome from various genotoxic agents. Likewise, the immune system senses stress and provides protection against infectious agents and tissue damage. Considerable crosstalk exists between DNA repair and the immune system. For instance, the adaptive immune system employs DNA repair machinery for the generation of immune cell diversity through V(D)J recombination and immunoglobulin class switch recombination [1, 2]. The DDR also triggers immune signaling through induction of many cell surface ligands that are detected by immune cells [3-6]. Over the last decade, several components of the innate immune system have identified that sense microbial or endogenous damaged DNA and initiate downstream signaling [7-10]. It is becoming increasingly clear that the interaction between the immune system and the DDR is tightly regulated to prevent excessive inflammatory response; its dysregulation leads to various inflammation-associated human disorders including, various neurological and age-related neurodegeneration.

Inflammation is an adaptive response to disrupted tissue homeostasis, including injury and infection, and its role is to clear pathogens or damaged tissues. This response involves interactions between various cell types, recruitment of immune cells, and release of inflammatory mediators. A controlled inflammatory response is beneficial to a host and allows it to repair damage and restores its original state. Conversely, uncontrolled persistent inflammation, is detrimental [11]. Notably, chronic neuroinflammation is widely recognized as an early pathological event in the majority, if not all, neurological diseases [12, 13]. The central nervous system (CNS) was once considered an immune privileged site. However, the nervous system interacts with immune cells to maintain homeostasis as many CNS cells express receptors for immune cells. Under physiological conditions, immune surveillance of CNS is closely monitored, while neuroimmune interactions are often altered in pathological conditions [14-16].

The sources and molecular mechanisms underlying inflammation in the brain remain unclear. DNA damage is now realized as a lesion that is capable of inducing inflammation. DNA species generated as a result of DNA damage, replication byproducts or retrotransposons are recognized by innate immune DNA sensors resulting in induction of an inflammatory signaling cascade [10, 17-22]. The link between inadequate DNA repair and neurological diseases is well known [23, 24], but why the nervous system is particularly susceptible to DNA damage is unclear. Genomic instability arising from DNA repair deficiency can compromise tissue and cell integrity and initiate an inflammatory response. Thus, it is likely that as a corollary to inadequate DNA repair, DNA damage-induced inflammation is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of many human neurological diseases (Table 1). In this review, we discuss connections between DNA damage and neuroinflammation and neurological disease.

2 The Neural DNA Damage Response.

The nervous system controls cognition, movement, multiple senses, and emotions. Numerous neuronal and glial cell types populate the nervous system. Broadly, neurons are considered functional unit of the nervous system that store and transmit information, while glia provide a framework to support neuronal functions. Various human congenital disorders that result from mutations in DNA repair genes and studies using mouse models indicate that the neural genome is particularly susceptible to endogenous DNA damage. Multiple endogenous DNA lesions occur in the nervous system, but it remains unclear why certain cell types are more prone to DNA repair defects [25-31].

While genome stability is particularly critical for nervous system function, it is nonetheless mediated by an interconnected network of DNA repair pathways found ubiquitously throughout other tissues of the body. These multiple biochemically distinct DNA repair pathways have been reviewed extensively; Base excision repair [32, 33], Nucleotide excision repair [34, 35], Mismatch repair pathway [36], Ribonucleotide excision repair removes ribonucleotides via the RNaseH2 complex [37-39] and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by two types of pathways, homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining [40, 41]. Thus, these pathways collectively prevent the accumulation of a broad range of deleterious DNA modifications that could impact cellular functions.

The requirement for specific DNA repair pathways is largely dependent upon the stages of nervous system development. For example, during neurogenesis, neuronal progenitor and stem cells divide to expand the pool of progenitor cells. At this stage, replication stress is the predominant type of endogenous lesion [42, 43]. DNA repair is critical during neurogenesis as exemplified by DNA repair-associated neurological diseases that present during early childhood, indicating that DNA damage impacts nervous system development [24, 44]. Although mature neurons do not divide, they do experience a barrage of DNA lesions. The brain has high oxidative metabolic demand and therefore oxidant species may be a major type of DNA damage causing DNA breaks and transcription disruption [45, 46].

The DDR detects DNA damage and orchestrates downstream signaling to repair DNA damage and mount an appropriate biological response including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or senescence. In the nervous system, members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinase (PIKKs) family; ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR), and the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) are central responders to DNA damage [47]. ATM and DNA-PK activation is via DSBs, while ATR is activated by the presence of RPA bound ssDNA and stalled replication forks [48]. Following their activation, a diverse set of mediator proteins are phosphorylated by these kinases [49-51]. The mediators further amplify the response by either phosphorylating or recruiting various effector molecules. For example, phosphorylation of CHK1 and CHK2 by ATR and ATM, respectively regulates cell cycle checkpoints by modulating CDK activity [52-56].

3 DNA damage-driven inflammation.

Engagement of the DNA repair machinery in response to DNA damage typically leads to either transient growth arrest, apoptosis or senescence. However, accumulating evidence suggests that compromised genomic integrity triggers inflammation in addition to these cellular outcomes (Figure 1). The following discusses various inducers of DNA damage-driven inflammation.

3.1 DNA damage-driven genomic instability and inflammation.

That DNA is immuno-stimulatory was first reported around 50 years ago, when it was shown that foreign nucleic acid triggers an interferon response in chick and mouse cells [57]. However, since genomic DNA is compartmentalized inside the nucleus, it was widely believed that self-DNA is protected from immune sensing. Notably, research in the last decade has challenged this paradigm and suggests that self-DNA generated because of DNA damage could engage immune signaling [10, 17-22]. Early evidence of DNA damage induced immune signaling came from human cells treated with etoposide that led to the induction of interferons [22]. Subsequent studies showed that DNA damage leads to accumulation of DNA in the cytoplasm, thereby triggering detection by cytoplasmic DNA sensors and innate immune signaling [18-21, 58]. For example, in various human cancer cell lines, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and dsDNA were found to constitutively localize in the cytoplasm. Treatment of cells with exogenous DNA damaging agents such as ionizing radiation or replication inhibitors, further increased the accumulation of these DNA species in the cytoplasm [21, 58]. Interestingly, depletion of the Bloom syndrome helicase or exonuclease 1 dramatically reduced cytoplasmic ssDNA accumulation in cells, suggesting a role of DSB end resection factors in generating these fragments [21]. Although the exact nature of these DNA fragments is not known, cloning of cytosolic DNA species accumulated after genotoxic agents suggests that these are derived from retroelements and form non-B DNA structures [58]. Importantly, these cytosolic DNA fragments induced type I interferon signaling [18, 20, 21, 58].

Pertinent to understanding the inflammatory role of DNA is knowing how DNA accumulates in the cytoplasm upon DNA damage. Micronuclei formation is one of the mechanisms that links self-DNA recognition to immune activation [59-61]. Micronuclei are small nuclear envelope bound extra-nuclear structures that arise during cell division when genome integrity is compromised. Micronuclei consist of chromosome fragments or whole chromosome(s) that lag behind during anaphase, as a result of unresolved genomic lesions [62]. Since their formation is strongly linked with genomic instability, they are often used as a sensitive marker to measure genotoxicity [63]. Although micronuclei are surrounded by the nuclear envelope, they lack key proteins required for the nuclear envelope and genomic integrity. This results in frequent and irreversible rupture of micronuclei nuclear lamina, leading to chromosome fragmentation and chromothripsis [64-67]. Studies have shown that the micronuclei nuclear envelope dissolution also exposes self-DNA into the cytoplasm, which is detected by cytosolic DNA sensors leading to activation of type I interferon signaling in the micronucleated cell [18, 59-61, 68, 69].

Additional evidence for DNA damage-mediated cytoplasmic DNA accumulation came from mouse models involving TREX1 and DNase II. TREX1 is a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic 3â€“5â€™exonuclease [70], while DNase II is a lysosomal DNase [71]. Mutations in TREX1 and DNASE2 in humans leads to autoimmune disease and activation of type I interferon signaling [72, 73]. Likewise, Trex1âˆ’/âˆ’ and Dnase2âˆ’/âˆ’ mice exhibit severe inflammation in a STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes)-dependent manner [74-79]. Accumulation of damaged DNA in the cytoplasm of nuclease-depleted cells has also been shown [75, 80, 81]. Thus, these two models of DNase deficiency further demonstrate that cytoplasmic self-DNA can be immunogenic.

3.2 DNA damage-driven senescence and inflammation.

Senescence is a state where cells exit the cell cycle irreversibly and enter permanent growth arrest without undergoing cell death [82]. Senescence results in many phenotypic changes in a cell including, chromatin reorganization, metabolic and transcriptional alterations. The limit of cell growth imposed by senescence ensures that the damaged or transformed cell does not transmit their genome. Thus, senescence plays a role in tissue homeostasis and is considered anti-tumorigenic [83]. Nonetheless, the accumulation of senescent cells also has detrimental effects and is associated with aging and age-related disorders [84].

Various stress-inducing stimuli such as telomere shortening, oncogene activation, and oxidative stress can lead to senescence. However, it is persistent DNA damage signaling at shortened telomeres, that is considered essential for initiating and maintaining senescence [85, 86] [87, 88]. Consistent with this, loss of p53 and p21 is sufficient to bypass the senescence of fibroblast cells in culture [89, 90]. In response to oncogene hyperactivation, initiation of DDR signaling coincides with the induction of a senescence phenotype [91-95]. Notably, the end of the proliferative phase is marked by the engagement of the DDR and the accumulation of DNA damage foci.

A key feature of senescence is the secretion of various inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and proteases, collectively referred to as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can recruit immune cells and modulate tissue microenvironment [96]. Although, the SASP is connected with the DDR, the molecular events that induce inflammation upon senescence are not well understood. Recent studies showed that senescent cells release chromatin fragments into the cytoplasm to activate immune signaling [18, 68, 97].Compromised nuclear envelope integrity including, reduced Lamin B1 expression is one of the hallmark features of senescent cells [98]. Interestingly, chromatin fragments release into the cytoplasm corelates with lower Lamin B1 expression and compromised nuclear integrity. Unlike micronuclei, these cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs) lack nuclear envelope, but are positive for DNA damage marker Î³H2AX [97, 99]. Furthermore, the CCFs are recognized by the cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase)/STING pathway, a signaling pathway that mediates recognition and response of cytoplasmic nucleic acids [18, 68, 69]. cGAS was found to colocalize with CCFs in senescent cells and inactivation of cGAS or STING led to accelerated cell growth and inhibition of senescence. Consistently, mice deleted for STING delay DNA damage-dependent aging. Moreover, secretion of various SASP factors was greatly compromised in cGAS or STING-depleted cells. Interestingly, the deletion of cGAS or STING in established senescent cells did not revert the senescent phenotype but reduced the expression of SASP factors [18, 68]. Taken together, these results imply that the engagement of cGAS-STING signaling by CCFs is required for inducing inflammation and the establishment of senescence.

3.3 DNA damage and induction of inflammatory molecules.

The DDR also engages the immune system by activating various proinflammatory factors. Activation of NF-kB in response to DNA damage is one such example. NF-kB belongs to a transcription factor family that plays a role in diverse biological processes, including immunity and inflammation. In resting cells, NF-kB is kept inactive in the cytoplasm through its interaction with a family of inhibitor proteins called IÎºBs (IKK) complex that consist of IKKÎ± and IKKÎ² and a regulatory subunit named NF-ÎºB essential modulator (NEMO). Upon stimulus, NF-kB is released from IÎºBs, translocates to the nucleus, and regulates transcription of its target genes [100, 101]. Early evidence of DNA damage mediated activation of NF-kB came from ATM-deficient cells that showed reduced NF-kB expression after IR [102]. Subsequent studies demonstrated a major requirement for the ATM kinase in activation of NF-kB in response to various DNA lesions. ATM phosphorylates IKK protein NEMO in the nucleus. This ATM-mediated phosphorylation along with SUMOylation of NEMO is a prerequisite for its ubiquitylation and subsequent NF-kB induction [102-106].

Like NF-kB, other interferon responsive factors (IRFs), are activated upon DNA damage. All nine IRF members share an N-terminal DNA binding domain that shares significant homology, while the C terminal is less conserved. The unique functions of IRFs are likely mediated by cell type-specific expression and/or their interaction with other IRF family members and protein factors. IRFs are required for various functions of immune cells [107, 108]. Similar to p53, Irf1âˆ’/âˆ’ mouse embryonic fibroblast did not undergo cell cycle arrest after DNA damage [109]. Interestingly, this DNA damage dependent expression of IRF1 requires ATM, but IRF1 induction in response to virus is ATM-independent [110]. Moreover, IRF1 was shown to involve the Fanconi anemia pathway via Fanconi anemia gene J and accordingly IRF1-depleted cells were hypersensitive to DNA crosslinking agents [111]. IRF3 is a crucial factor in inducing type I interferon signaling. IRF3 is also phosphorylated by DNA-PK resulting in nuclear retention and delayed protein degradation [112]. Finally, IRF5 mRNA expression is induced by p53 upon DNA damage and mediates immune signaling [113].

DNA damage also signals the immune system by overexpressing various ligands that are expressed poorly by normal cells. Natural Killer Group 2D (NKG2D) is a best-characterized receptor that responds to a distressed state of a cell including infection, cellular transformation and genotoxic damage. NKG2D is a C type lectin superfamily stimulatory receptor that is mainly expressed by natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T cells, Î³Î´ T cells, NK1.1+ T cells, and some myeloid cells. NKG2D recognizes a diverse type of ligands that allow activation of innate as well as adaptive immunity [114]. Stalled replication forks or DNA damaging agents are shown to induce overexpression of mouse and human NKG2D ligands. This appears to involve both ATM and ATR pathway as the silencing of these genes led to the downregulation of ligands [3].

4 Immune signaling and DNA damage.

The above evidence supports the concept that DNA damage induced self-DNA engages immune signaling. A key question is how is DNA damage sensed by the immune system? Research over the last decade has elucidated the molecular mechanisms involved in immune sensing of DNA including immune molecules that act as DNA sensors, the downstream signaling pathways and the cell types that mediate the immune response (Figure 2 and Figure 3).

4.1 Immune sensing and signal transduction induced by DNA.

The innate immune system uses pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for sensing the presence of non-self, microbial products such as pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMP) and self -by-products such as damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [115]. PRRs that sense DNA as PAMPs and DAMPs either detect lack of modifications commonly present in mammalian DNA or are sensing DNA present in the wrong place at the wrong time. For example, Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes DNA in endosomal compartments (Figure 2) [116]. It senses ssDNA containing hypomethylated CpG motif [117, 118]. ssDNA binding to TLR9 leads to recruitment of TIR domain-containing adaptor protein MYD88 that helps assemble a multi-protein complex containing IRAK4, TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1 and IKKÎ± [116]. This complex phosphorylates transcription factor IRF7 that translocates to the nucleus and induces expression of type I interferons. This signaling complex also activates NF-Îºb that leads to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [119].

In a healthy cell, the presence of DNA in the cytoplasm signals either damage to the cell or the presence of intracellular pathogens. Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) and cGAS are examples of DNA sensors that sense cytosolic DNA (Figure 3). cGAS is recognized as one of the key cytosolic DNA sensors that connect DNA damage to innate immunity. cGAS was first identified as a pathogen DNA sensor that activates interferon signaling by producing cGAMP second messenger [120-123]. DNA acts as a cofactor activating the enzymatic activity of cGAS to generate second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) [124-126]. Production of cGAMP leads to the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and NF-ÎºB through the adaptor STING [127]. STING is a transmembrane protein that localizes in ER. Upon cGAMP binding, STING undergoes a conformational change that triggers its relocalization from ER to Golgi [128-130]. This process is believed to recruit and subsequently activate TANK binding kinase (TBK1) and IÎºBs kinase complex. Activated TBK1 phosphorylates IRF3 leading to its nuclear translocation and expression of type I interferons [131, 132]. In the second loop of the cGAS-STING pathway, activation of NF-ÎºB leads to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL6 and TNF as well as type I interferons [133].

AIM2 is a dsDNA sensor in the cytoplasm. In contrast to cGAS, which leads to induction of type I interferon, DNA sensing by AIM2 results in assembly and activation of a multi-protein complex called the AIM2 inflammasome [134-137] (Figure 2). AIM2 Inflammasomes are a three-component system consisting of the AIM2 DNA sensor, an adaptor protein called ASC, and an effector enzyme Caspase 1 (CASP1) [138]. AIM2 has two domains, a pyrin domain that allows it to bind to the adaptor ASC and a HIN domain that binds to DNA. The AIM2 HIN domain can bind any dsDNA segment in a sequence-independent manner to recruit ASC, which in turn recruits CASP1, eventually leading to autoproteolytic cleavage and activation of CASP1 [139]. Once activated, CASP1 cleaves pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-18, generating their active forms. Matured IL-18 and IL-1Î² are released through a pro-inflammatory programmed cell death known as pyroptosis, which is controlled by CASP1 mediated proteolytic processing and activation of a pore-forming protein called Gasdermin D [140, 141].

Another DNA sensor that localizes both in the nucleus and cytoplasm is the DNA binding AIM2-like receptor, gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16). [142-144]. This sensor recognizes viral DNA in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus, thus challenging the view the foreign DNA could only be recognized in the cytoplasm [145-148]. Recently, IFI16 was shown to play a role in sensing self-DNA upon etoposide treatment. In association with ATM and PARP-1, IFI16 activated non-canonical STING signaling that resulted in NF-ÎºB activation (Figure 3). Interestingly, cGAS was not required for STING activation in this scenario [149].

Finally, various DNA repair factors have emerged as sensors of cytoplasmic DNA (Figure 3). For example, DNA-PK can play a role in the innate immune response. DNA-PK is a heterotrimeric complex composed of the DNA-PK catalytic subunit, KU70 and KU80. In addition to its role in adaptive immunity, DNA-PK in a kinase-independent manner was shown to recognize and bind foreign DNA in the cytoplasm leading to IRF3-dependent activation of cytokines and chemokines. The function of DNA-PK is independent of its kinase activity [150]. In another study, Ku70 is reported to induce selective IFN-Î»1 activation via the IRF1-IRF7 axis in response to linear DNA in mammalian cells [151]. Likewise, MRE11, a DNA damage nuclear sensor as part of the MRN complex that plays a role in HR and NHEJ pathway, can sense exogenous cytoplasmic dsDNA. Interestingly, it requires its binding partner Rad50 but not NBS1 for binding to cytoplasmic DNA and initiation of IRF3-STING-mediated type I interferon signaling [152].

4.2 Innate immune cell types involved in neuroinflammation.

Microglia:

Microglia are specialized tissue-resident macrophages in the brain that play a key role in nervous system homeostasis as well in immune defense [153-155]. In its role as an immune sentinel, microglia constantly survey and scan their environment for invading pathogens and dying cells, protein aggregates, soluble and particulate antigens and contribute to synaptic pruning and synaptic plasticity. Microglia respond to any pathological event or change in brain homeostasis through a diverse range of receptors that detect DAMP and PAMP molecules as well as neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Engagement of these receptors results in signaling that generates a variety of responses ranging from phagocytosis of microbes or injured cells, the release of various cytokines and chemokines that are involved in tissue repair, remodeling, and interaction with other cell types [155-160]. Thus, microglia can be activated to act as the first line of defense in response to internal and external threats [155, 161].

In the resting state, microglia appear as highly ramified structures with small soma and long processes that are in constant motion to survey large areas of their brain microenvironment [162]. Resting microglia are characterized by low expression of CD11c, CD45, CD80 and CD86 [163-165]. Perturbation in the brain results in a rapid multistage transformation of microglia resulting in shape alterations, gene expression changes, and alterations in functional properties. Activated microglia retract their long processes and become amoeboid in shape [156]. They may proliferate to increase their number to counter tissue damage or pathogen infection [155, 163, 166, 167]. The induction of many molecules such as Iba1, CD45, MHC-II, CD86, and TMEM119 also characterize microglia activation [164, 168, 169]. Initially, two different states of microglia activation were proposed: the M1 state that is considered as pro-inflammatory; the M2 state, an alternative anti-inflammatory state [170, 171]. Although we still do not fully comprehend the various stages of activation of microglia, recent studies indicate that microglia are more heterogeneous in nature [157, 158, 172-174]. Interestingly DNA damage can drive microglia to a primed state. In an Ercc1 mutant mouse model that is deficient in NER, microglia exhibited hypertrophic morphology, enhanced proliferation and phagocytosis, indicating genotoxic stress can alter the microglia state [175].

Astrocytes:

Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells and play an active role in maintaining CNS health by providing structural and functional support. Astrocytes provide metabolites and growth factors to neurons, modulate synaptic transmission and regulate the blood-brain barrier. Astrocytes also participate in immune and inflammatory responses in the nervous system by secreting various chemokines and cytokines and recruiting immune cells [176, 177]. Similar to microglia, astrocytes undergo a series of morphological and functional changes in response to CNS insults in a process known as astrogliosis. This process can lead to reversible changes in gene expression to a more long-lasting change such as glia scar formation [178-180]. Analogous to the M1 and M2 phenotypes of microglia, reactive astrocytes are also characterized into A1 and A2 classes. A1 astrocytes are pro-inflammatory in nature while A2 are considered anti-inflammatory and promote neuronal survival and tissue repair [181]. Astrogliosis is a complex reactive process that involves the interaction of astrocytes with other cell types such as microglia, neuronal and non-neuronal cell types [182]. Moreover, the nature, location, and intensity of insult determine the molecular changes in astrocytes associated with astrogliosis [183]. For example, reactive astrocytes in response to microbial endotoxins can exert an inflammatory response that results in the recruitment of immune cells and allow clearance of pathogens. During aging or in a disease state, astrocytes may change profile either through inappropriate gain or loss of functions that lead to neuronal cell death or exacerbates inflammation [176, 179, 184, 185]. Thus, astrogliosis is regulated by various signaling events in a context-dependent manner to exert neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects in the brain.

5 DNA damage and inflammation in neurological disease.

5.1 Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨res syndrome (AGS).

AGS is a rare childhood neuroinflammatory disorder that mainly affects the skin and brain. It is characterized by microcephaly, intracranial calcification, white matter abnormalities, and chilblain skin lesions [186, 187]. Enhanced interferon-alpha levels in the CSF and serum are a hallmark feature of this disease. Interferon-alpha levels decline in CSF over time, but patients frequently have upregulated expression of type I interferon-stimulated genes in the peripheral blood. AGS is an early onset disease with early mortality, however, cases have been reported where symptoms occurred after normal development, thus highlighting phenotypic variability of this disease [186, 188, 189]. AGS is a heterogeneous genetic disease as mutation of any of 7 genes have been linked with AGS; these are, TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, IFIH1, and ADAR1 (Table 1). While the majority of AGS cases are due to homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations leading to reduced expression of these genes, gain of function heterozygous mutations (TREX1, ADAR1 and IFIH1) have also been observed [72, 190-193].

A common theme among AGS-linked genes is that they all play a role in various aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. For example, RNaseH2, a heterotrimeric complex consisting of RNaseH2A, RNaseH2B and RNaseH2C, removes genomic ribonucleotides from DNA and resolves RNA-DNA hybrids [38, 194, 195]. RNaseH2-deleted cells in culture show enhanced misincorporation of genomic ribonucleotides, chronic DNA damage, and senescence [196]. Interestingly, micronuclei formation is enhanced in these cells that leads to cGAS recruitment [59, 61]. RNaseH2 deletion in mice is embryonic lethal, leading to a p53-dependent DNA damage response [196, 197]. In contrast, AGS-linked Rnaseh2aG37S/G37S and Rnaseh2bA174T/A174T knock-in mouse models are perinatal lethal or live a normal life, respectively. These mouse models show upregulation of type I interferon-stimulated genes that is dependent upon the cGAS-STING pathway [195, 198]. However, neuroinflammation or developmental defects are not observed in these mouse models.

SAMHD1 is a deoxynucleotide triphosphate hydrolase. It was first identified as the viral restriction factor that inhibits HIV replication in myeloid cells by reducing the cellular pool of dNTPs [199, 200]. SAMHD1 is recruited to DNA damage foci upon genotoxic agents [201] and also functions in DNA repair by promoting DNA end resection [202]. Recently, it was shown that SAMHD1 stimulates the activity of MRE11 nuclease. This led to the degradation of nascent DNA at stalled replication forks and limited the ssDNA accumulation in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting cGAS-STING mediated inflammation [203]. Similar to RNaseH2, Samhd1âˆ’/âˆ’ mice show cGAS-STING mediated inflammation but AGS-associated neurological phenotypes were not observed [204].

Unlike RNASEH2 and SAMHD1, ADAR1 and IFIH1 gene products function in RNA processing. ADAR1 is adenosine to inosine RNA editing enzyme. Adar1âˆ’/âˆ’ mice or AGS-linked Adar1E861A/E861A mice die embryonically and show aberrant interferon induction [205]. Interestingly, this phenotype is rescued by the inactivation of MDA5. It is proposed that ADAR1 hyper-editing prevents the self-recognition of dsRNA by MDA5, thus limiting self-immune response [206].

The IFIH1 gene encodes MDA5 protein and is a pattern recognition receptor for dsRNA in the cytoplasm. Mutations in IFIH1 are autosomal dominant in inheritance [191]. MDA5 binds to dsRNA in a cooperative manner and assembles into a filamentous structure. This allows oligomerization of signaling domain and downstream activation of the adaptor molecule, MAVS. MDA5-AGS variants form tighter filaments and exhibit high basal signaling [207, 208]. Additionally, MDA5-AGS variants assembled efficient filaments on imperfect dsRNA duplexes derived from Alu retroelements compared to wild type protein, leading to constitutive MDA5-dependent signaling and innate immune activation. Intriguingly, these RNA duplexes also activated wild type MDA5 in the absence of ADAR1, further highlighting the role of ADAR1 in RNA editing to allow identification of non-self from self [209].

These studies suggest that aberrant accumulation of nucleic acids, either due to-retrotransposons, DNA damage or replication intermediates-stimulate aberrant innate immune sensing. For example, a recent study suggests that moderate levels of genomic ribonucleotides triggers the immune response and causes perinatal lethality, while excess genomic ribonucleotides result in p53-dependent cell death and embryonic lethality in mice, suggesting a threshold effect of DNA damage [210].

Although AGS is considered a disorder of aberrant immune activation, it is unclear if type I interferon signaling alone is the underlying pathogenic mechanism in AGS. Interestingly, recent data showed that RNASEH2B depletion in the mouse nervous system resulted in an activation of p53-dependent DNA damage signaling. This mouse model recapitulated various neurological phenotypes of AGS, including neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation [210]. However, surprisingly, coincident depletion of cGAS and RNASEH2B did not rescue the neurological phenotype. This indicated that DNA damage independent of type I interferon signaling could drive neurodegeneration in a RNASEH2B-deficent mouse model. This points to genomic instability due to inefficient DNA repair in addition to DNA damage-induced inflammation as a main driver of pathogenesis in this disease. Figure 4 summarizes the key neural cell types implicated in DNA damage-induced pathogenesis and the concomitant diseases linked to defects in the regulation genome stability.

5.2 Ataxia-telangiectasia.

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a progressive autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease that is caused by mutations of ATM [211-213]. ATM-deficient cells show marked radio-sensitivity, chromosomal instability and premature senescence. In humans, A-T is characterized by cerebellar degeneration, abnormal eye movement and impaired motor coordination (ataxia). Characteristic neuropathology includes loss of Purkinje and granule cells and is an underlying reason for cerebellar atrophy [212, 214, 215]. A broad spectrum of extra neurological symptoms is also displayed by A-T patients such as cancer susceptibility, immune dysfunction and respiratory infections [216]. Defects in adaptive immunity are associated with various immunological symptoms of A-T disease. Affected individuals have reduced levels of B cells, T cells and one or more classes of the immunoglobins (IgG, IgM and IgA) [217-220]. These phenotypes are attributed to the role of ATM-mediated DSB DNA repair in V(D)J recombination and immunoglobin class switch recombination [221, 222]. Interestingly, despite the prevalence of immunological abnormalities linked to adaptative immunity, systemic bacterial or viral opportunistic infections are uncommon in A-T individuals [217, 223]. Moreover, individuals with A-T suffer from prolonged inflammation that is not entirely explained by defects in the adaptive immune response but suggests the possible involvement of the innate immunity [20, 224]. In Atmâˆ’/âˆ’ mice or ATM-deficient cells, enhanced accumulation of ssDNA in the cytoplasm leads to induction of cGAS-STING signaling followed by type I interferon activation [20]. Likewise, rats with a missense mutation in Atm showed accumulation of ssDNA and dsDNA in the cytoplasm of the cerebellum, hippocampus and spinal cord, type I interferon induction and neurodegeneration [225]. Thus, these studies imply that aberrant immune responses contribute to phenotypes associated with A-T.

5.3 Age-related neurodegenerative disorders.

Neurodegenerative disorders are a broad class of syndromes that involve neuronal dysfunction, protein aggregation, and cell death. A sustained inflammatory response is often seen in patients with neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer disease and Parkinsonâ€™s disease.

Alzheimerâ€™s disease:

Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting nearly 5 million people in the United States. The characteristic symptoms include dementia, cognitive impairment, and neuronal cell death. The hallmark brain pathology is the occurrence of extracellular beta-amyloid (AÎ²) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. The AÎ² plaques are formed by the misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The majority of AD cases (90â€“95%) are sporadic in nature. However, mutations in three genes, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, whose products alter amyloid precursor protein processing are associated with AD [226]. Although the etiology of AD is unclear, persistent neuroinflammation is characterized as one of the pathological features of AD. Several proinflammatory (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6, and NFÎºB) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-Î²1) are found in AD patients [227-231]. Activated microglia are localized near the AÎ² plaques in AD brains [232]. As the disease progress, microglia become enlarged and unable to process these plaques [233-235]. Similarly, reactive gliosis is observed in AD [236]. Astrocytes accumulate AÎ²42 and the amount of this correlates positively with the extent of local AD pathology [237]. Additional evidence from GWAS studies have identified around 20 susceptibility loci that are associated with AD risk. These loci encode for various genes that play a role in diverse processes including, neuronal development, synapse formation and immune response [238]. One such example is TREM2, a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in myeloid cells, including microglia. TREM2 signaling is associated with various cellular processes such as phagocytosis, proliferation, and inflammation [239]. Higher expression of TREM2 is observed in blood of AD patients [240, 241]. Variants of TREM2 or polymorphism confers a great risk of developing AD [242, 243]. Thus, these studies suggest innate immune response and inflammation have a causative role rather than being consequences in AD.

DNA damage and decline in DNA repair are associated with the progression of AD [24, 244-247]. The brain has higher energy consumption and reactive oxygen species are generated as a byproduct. Oxidative damage of nucleic acids is one of the most common lesions that affects the onset of AD. 8OHG, the most common type of oxidation product of guanine, is significantly increased in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in the AD brain [248, 249]. Oxidative damage occurs early prior to the onset of disease symptom thus implying a role in the pathogenesis of AD. In addition to BER defects, increased DSBs were observed in the brains of AD patients and DSB formation is proposed as an early event in AD [250]. An AD mouse model that expresses human APP also showed increased neuronal DSBs compared to control mice [251]. Furthermore, the DSBR factor BRCA1 expression is reduced in the brains of AD individuals and in hAPP transgenic mice. These mice also exhibit learning and memory deficits [252], suggesting DNA damage may feature in the pathogenesis of AD.

Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD):

PD is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. PD is characterized by tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. [253]. The neuropathology of PD is described by the presence of Lewy bodies (alpha-synuclein aggregates) in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain [254]. The cause of PD is unknown for most cases and the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors is involved in the etiology of this disease. Emerging studies suggest DNA damage and repair might play a significant role in the progression of PD disease [255]. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is compromised in dermal fibroblast cells derived from PD patients [256]. Moreover, partial inactivation of mouse Ercc1, a key NER enzyme, compromised dopaminergic neurons. These neurons showed increased Î³H2AX staining, enhanced oxidation, and astrogliosis [256]. PARP1 activation has also been identified as a key event in pathologic alpha-synuclein toxicity and inhibition of PARP1 prevented the transmission of toxic alpha-synuclein between cells; consistent with this, PAR levels were higher in the brains of PD patients [257]. A recent study also showed increased expression of alpha-synuclein protein within nigral dopaminergic cells that elicits ATM-dependent DNA damage response in a mouse model of PD [258].

Early evidence to support the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of PD comes from epidemiological studies that suggested that the use of NSAID delayed the onset of PD [259, 260]. GWAS studies have identified new PD risk gene loci linked with the innate and adaptive immune response [261, 262]. Polymorphism in proinflammatory genes TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² have also associated with increased susceptibility to PD [263]. In line with this, increased accumulation of proinflammatory cytokine such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha haven been observed in CSF and postmortem brains of PD [264-267]. Widespread microglia activation was observed in AD patients by positron emission tomography [268, 269]. Moreover, peripheral T cells infiltration has been found in brains of individual with AD [270, 271] Although the trigger for T cell recruitment is not fully understood, alpha-synuclein fibrils are able to recruit CD4 T cells, monocytes, macrophages and microglia [272, 273].

Taken together, the above evidence suggests that impaired DNA repair and inflammation can be central features of neurodegenerative disease. While a direct link between DNA repair and inflammation in these neurodegenerative diseases awaits further confirmation, accumulating evidence indicate that DNA damage and inflammation may be involved in the origin and progression of neurodegenerative disease.

6 Conclusions.

DNA is immunogenic in nature. This property is critical for the detection and clearance of pathogens and injured cells by the immune system. To prevent aberrant recognition of self-DNA, various cellular mechanisms are employed by cells to ensure that the immune system is not improperly activated. However, inadequate DNA repair results in genomic instability and senescence that could subsequently engage the immune system. Conversely, persistent DNA damage can result in chronic inflammation and inflammation, which, in turn further exacerbates genomic damage. Thus, the DDR and immune system interactions are closely monitored and coordinated to ensure an appropriate response in a context-specific manner. Although significant progress has been made in identifying the functional connections between the DDR and immune system, many questions still remain. For instance, it is unclear how damaged DNA is distinguished from genomic DNA in the nucleus? Although, it is widely believed that cytoplasmic nucleic acid accumulation is recognized by cytoplasmic DNA sensors, new studies suggest that these sensors are also found in the nucleus. This challenges the long-held view that DNA accumulation in the wrong place results in immune signaling; hnRNPA2B1 is one such example of a DNA sensor recently shown to recognize viral and self-DNA in the nucleus [274]. Moreover, cGAS can be recruited to the nucleus in response to DNA damage in human fibroblast cells [275, 276]. Another key question is whether different types of DNA damage-derived fragments engage similar innate immune sensors. Although DNA sensors usually recognize DNA in a sequence-independent manner, studies have suggested that DNA length could influence the specificity and response of a sensor [277, 278]. Moreover, not all sensors are expressed in all cell types and at similar levels. It is very likely that the nature and strength of stimuli along with the expression of a particular type of DNA sensor and signal transduction molecules may dictate the immune response in the normal and disease state. In line with this, the AIM2 sensor but not cGAS is upregulated in astrocytes and microglia during gliosis in a mouse model of neurodegeneration [279]. Finally, understanding key pathways regulating the neuroprotective versus pathogenic networks in the brain will enhance development of novel therapies for human neurological disorders.

Figure 1: DNA damage response and innate immune activation.

DNA damage signaling can result in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or senescence depending upon the type of DNA damage and strength of stimulus. Transient cell cycle arrest is beneficial as it pauses proliferation to allow cells to repair DNA damage. However, DNA damage-induced cellular senescence (e.g. telomere erosion) can cause inflammation through induction of SASP. Failure of DNA repair can result in micronuclei formation and accumulation of cytoplasmic DNA. DNA in the micronuclei is recognized by cGAS/STING pathway leading to activation of immune signaling and inflammation. TREX1 exonuclease and DNase2 nucleases suppress accumulation of DNA by degrading various DNA fragments and inhibiting inflammation.

Figure 2: Recognition of DNA by innate immune sensors.

TLR9 is an endosomal DNA sensor that recognizes CpG DNA commonly found in pathogens. Upon recognition of CpG DNA in endosomes, TLR9 interacts with adaptor protein MyD88. After TLR9 engagement, MyD88 acts as a platform to recruit IRAK family members, which leads to nuclear translocation of proinflammatory NF-ÎºB and IRF3 transcription factors and expression of various inflammatory cytokines and Type I interferons. Cytosolic DNA can be recognized by additional DNA sensors. For instance, IFI16 and DNA repair proteins such as, MRE11 and Ku70 can also recognize cytoplasmic DNA. These sensors can activate IRF3 mediated type I interferon signaling through the STING pathway.

Figure 3: Recognition of DNA by AIM2 and cGAS/STING.

DNA damage is recognized by a diverse set of innate immune sensors. AIM2 is a cytoplasmic sensor that detects double stranded DNA of host or microbial origin. Upon DNA binding, AIM2 assembles a multiprotein complex with the help of adaptor ASC and catalytic effector procaspase 1. This complex is known as an inflammasome, where procaspase 1 undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage for activation. Active Caspase 1 induces proinflammatory cell death called Pyroptosis by cleaving Gasdermin D. Caspase1 also cleaves cytokines IL1beta (and others) which are released through Gasdermin D pores to induce inflammatory signaling. cGAS is another type of DNA sensor that detects single and double stranded DNA and DNA-RNA hybrids. cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase) activation upon DNA binding results in the generation of second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which is a ligand of STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) an endoplasmic reticulum-localized protein. Activated STING translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and recruits Kinases TBK1 and the IKK complex, which phosphorylates the IRF3 transcription factor and NF-ÎºB inhibitor IÎºBÎ±, respectively. Phosphorylated IRF3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus resulting in the activation of type I interferon signaling. IÎºBÎ± phosphorylation activates NF-ÎºB resulting in activation of proinflammatory signaling.

Figure 4: Multiple neural cell types contribute to neuroinflammation.

DNA damage-induced inflammation can result from various types of DNA damage and can affect multiple neural cell types, which collectively impact neural homeostasis. Key responders to genome instability are glial cells; the microglia and astrocytes, which can also substantially impact neurons. The multifaceted effect of DNA damage in the nervous system can lead to complex outcomes involving different types of DNA damage and can affect different neural cells and/or tissues, and may contribute to a range of neurological diseases, including Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨res Syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, Alzheimerâ€™s and Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
