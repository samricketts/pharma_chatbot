IMPORTANCE:

Hospitalizations are associated with cognitive decline in older adults.

OBJECTIVE:

To determine the association between hospitalization characteristics and the trajectory of cognitive function in older adults.

DESIGN:

Population-based longitudinal study of cognitive aging.

SETTING:

Olmsted Medical Center and Mayo Clinic, the only centers in Olmsted County, Minnesota, with hospitalization capacity.

PARTICIPANTS:

Individuals without dementia at baseline, with consecutive cognitive assessments from 2004 through 2017, and at least one visit after the age of 60.

MEASUREMENTS:

The primary outcome was longitudinal changes in global cognitive z-score. Secondary outcomes were changes in four cognitive domains: memory, attention/executive function, language, and visuospatial skills. Hospitalization characteristics analyzed included elective vs non-elective, medical vs surgical, critical care vs no critical care admission, and long vs short duration admissions.

RESULTS:

Of 4,587 participants, 1,622 had ≥1 hospital admission. Before hospitalization, the average slope of the global z-score was −0.031 units/year. After hospitalization, the rate of annual global z-score accelerated by −0.051 (95% CI −0.057, −0.045) units, P&lt;0.001, resulting in an estimated annual slope after the first hospitalization of −0.082. The accelerated decline was found in all four cognitive domains (memory, visuospatial, language, and executive, all P&lt;0.001). The acceleration of the decline in global z-score following hospitalization was greater for medical compared to surgical hospitalizations (slope change following hospitalization=−0.064 vs.−0.034 for medical vs surgical, P&lt;0.001), and non-elective compared to elective admissions (slope change following hospitalization=−0.075 vs.−0.037 for non-elective vs elective, P&lt;0.001). The acceleration of cognitive decline was not different for hospitalization with ICU admission versus not.

CONCLUSIONS:

Hospitalization of older adults is associated with accelerated decline of global and domain-specific cognitive domains, with the rate of decline dependent upon type of admission. The clinical impact of this accelerated decline will depend on the individual’s baseline cognitive reserve and expected longevity.

Introduction

Hospitalizations for both critical and non-critical illness are associated with long-term cognitive decline in older adults.1–8 The public health implications of cognitive impairment in older adults after hospitalization are considerable. Understanding the magnitude of cognitive decline can inform patients, families, and providers regarding long-term expectations and contribute to health management and planning of independent living. If the etiology is better delineated, possible interventions could be developed to ameliorate this decline.

It is not clear whether events occurring during hospitalization are primary contributors to-post-discharge cognitive decline, whether cognitively impaired individuals are more likely to be hospitalized,9–12 or whether hospitalization is merely a marker for increased acuity of health conditions related to cognitive decline.1,2,13 A recent study utilizing administrative records to describe hospitalization characteristics demonstrated that emergent hospital admissions, compared to elective, were associated with greater cognitive decline, even after adjusting for other factors that could affect cognition.8 The type of admission could serve as a proxy for the acuity of illness or underlying disease or may be indicative of the intensity of the intervention received during hospitalization (e.g., emergency surgery or critical care admission). Furthermore, medical hospitalizations are frequently non-elective and associated with acute worsening of systemic diseases compared to surgical admissions, which are typically elective and most frequently performed to address a single anatomical issue (e.g., orthopedic surgery).

The purpose of this study was to determine the association between hospitalization and the trajectory of global and domain-specific cognitive decline in older adults and whether the characteristics of hospitalization (elective vs. non-elective, medical vs. surgical, critical care admissions vs. no critical care admission) impact this association. We used the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA), a large prospective, population-based longitudinal study of cognitive aging among Olmsted County, Minnesota residents.14,15 The primary outcome of interest was longitudinal changes in global cognitive z-score. Secondary outcomes were changes in four cognitive domains: memory, attention/executive function, language, and visuospatial skills.

Materials and Methods

This study conformed to the requirements of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement and was approved by the institutional review boards of Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center, Rochester, Minnesota. At enrollment, all participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study.

Participants and setting

Study participants were enrolled in a longitudinal population-based study that was initiated in 2004 in Olmsted County, MN, which studies patterns of cognitive aging, prevalence and incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, conversion rates from MCI to dementia, and risk factors associated with cognitive decline among County residents.14 The specifics of MCSA design, enrolment dynamics, participation, and follow-up are detailed in an earlier report.14 Residents of Olmsted County, MN, were randomly selected and invited to participate in the study. The original enrollment included individuals 70-89 years old. The cohort was subsequently expanded in 2012 by starting to enroll individuals age 50 and older. The present study included non-demented participants with study evaluation visits from November 1, 2004, through December 31, 2017, and at least one visit after the age of 60. We identified all hospitalizations at Olmsted Medical Center and Mayo Clinic, the only two institutions in Olmsted County with hospitalization capacity.

Assessments

In the present analysis, we included only assessments that were available for all MCSA visits, including baseline and subsequent visits at approximately 15-month intervals.14,15 Initial evaluations included assessment of demographic information, medical history, education, subjective memory complaints, family history of dementia, and APOE genotyping. Physician evaluation included the Short Test of Mental Status,16 a medical history review, and neurologic examination. Neuropsychological evaluation included nine tests to assess four cognitive domains.14,15 Cognitive scores were expressed as domain and global cognitive z-scores. To compute these scores, means and standard deviations of raw test scores for participants who were cognitively unimpaired at the baseline visit in the MCSA 2004-2012 enrollment cohort were weighted to reflect the 2013 Olmsted county population and then used as the reference distribution.14,17 Scores within a domain were averaged and scaled using the reference cohort to create domain z-scores. An expert panel reviewed each participant’s evaluation and adjudicated cognitive status as cognitively unimpaired, MCI, or dementia based on published criteria.18–20 MCSA procedures avoid testing in the temporal vicinity of procedures and acute illness to avoid the effects of transient postoperative cognitive decline.

Characteristics of hospital admissions

We reviewed the duration and nature of hospitalization, with categories including 1) elective vs. non-elective (defined as any admission through Emergency Department - even transfers from other hospitals for patients who need an elevated level of medical care occur through Emergency Department); 2) medical vs. surgical (any hospitalization where surgery occurred was classified as surgical admission), and; 3) non-critical care vs. critical care hospitalization (hospitalizations associated with ICU admission, which may be for surgical or medical indications). Surgical and medical diagnoses were identified through the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records linkage system21–23 using ICD-9 and ICD-10-CM codes.

Statistical analyses

Baseline demographics and comorbidities were summarized using median [25th, 75th percentiles] for continuous variables and percentage for categorical variables according to the hospitalization status during follow-up.

The primary aim was to assess whether the trajectory (slope, rate of decline) in global cognitive z-score accelerated following hospitalization. Linear mixed-effects models assessed the association between hospitalization and global cognitive z-scores.

Adjustment covariates for the analyses were specified a priori based on prior publications and potential confounding and included age at baseline, sex, years of education, APOE ε4 status, marital status, smoking status, and number of cardiometabolic conditions (CMC, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke). CMCs were proposed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2010 as indicators of vascular health.24 Also, three binary covariates were included in the analysis indicating any hospitalization in the 5, 10, or 20 years prior to baseline (Table 1).

Details of the statistical methodology are summarized in Supplementary Statistical Methods. Fixed effects included the baseline covariates listed above, and time in years after the MCSA baseline visit. The interaction of baseline covariates with time after the baseline visit, and time-dependent exposure variable for time in years after a post-baseline hospitalization were also included as fixed effects. All participants were included in the analysis, including those with no subsequent hospitalization following baseline. Time after baseline visit describes the slope of global cognitive decline following baseline without (or prior to) subsequent hospitalization. Time after post-baseline hospitalization describes the change in the slope of global cognitive decline following the hospitalization. Random effects included subject-specific random intercepts and random slopes. Domain-specific cognitive z-scores were analyzed as secondary outcomes. Many participants had multiple hospitalizations. We hypothesized that repeated hospital admissions might have an additive effect. However, the functional form of this effect was unclear (whether each subsequent hospitalization has an equal effect, increased effect, or diminishing effect relative to the prior). Under the primary outcome, we assessed several functional forms and chose the approach maximizing the model likelihood as detailed in the Supplementary Statistical Methods. The model that fit the data best was an effect multiplier of 0.7, indicating a 30% geometric reduction in effect for each subsequent admission. Three pre-specified secondary analyses were assessed to examine whether the type of hospitalization (surgical vs medical; elective vs non-elective; combinations of surgical vs medical and elective vs non-elective; and requiring ICU admission vs not) modified the relationship between hospital admission and change in the trajectory of global cognitive z-score. In these models, type of hospital admission was defined based on the first admission following enrollment, and follow-up was censored when subsequently hospitalized for a different indication (e.g., medical admission after previous surgical admission). An interaction P-value was calculated to assess whether the change in slope following admission differed between admission types. Finally, a model evaluated whether duration of hospitalization (1-3 days, vs 4-6 days, vs ≥7 days) modified the relationship between hospitalization and the trajectory of cognitive z-scores.

In sensitivity analyses, we first explored the potential impact of repeated testing in participants over time (i.e. practice effect) by including an indicator variable flagging the first MCSA visit in the model to account for ‘first-time’ testing. A second sensitivity analysis assessed the association of hospitalization and cognitive z-scores considering only the first hospitalization, with subsequent hospitalizations were ignored (assumed no further association with cognitive outcomes).

Results are summarized by presenting average slope estimate and the change in slope following hospitalization. The significance level was set at P less than 0.05, with the 2-tailed test. Analyses were performed with SAS statistical software (Version 9.3; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary)

Results

Hospitalization characteristics

Of 4,938 MCSA participants with at least one study visit after the age of 60, 351 were excluded (Supplementary Figure S1), so the present study included 4,587 participants. Of these, 2,965 had no hospitalization during follow-up (median [IQR] follow-up 2.6 [0.0-5.7] years), while 1,622 had a hospital admission (total of 3,447 admissions) with median [IQR] follow up of 2.0 [0.8-3.9] years prior to the first admission, and 3.2 [1.4, 5.7] years following the first admission (Supplementary Figure S1). Of the 1,622 participants hospitalized after their baseline MCSA visit, 793 (49%) had one, 366 (23%) had 2, 232 (14%) had 3, and 231 (14%) had ≥ 4 hospitalizations. Most participants (3,074 [67%]) were hospitalized at least once in the 20-year period prior to the index date, with the majority of these hospitalizations occurring in the 5-year period prior to the index date (Table 1). As expected, the baseline global cognitive z-score decreased with age (Table 1).

The median [IQR] hospitalization duration was 3 [2, 4] days (Table 2). The majority of hospitalizations were for medical indications, elective, and did not require ICU admission (Table 2). Among the 2,207 medical admissions, 1,113 (50%) were non-elective, and 274 (12%) required ICU admission. Among the 1,240 surgical admissions, 156 (13%) were non-elective, and 239 (19%) required ICU admission. Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 present additional hospitalization characteristics separately for surgical and medical hospitalizations.

Cognitive scores and hospitalization

From the adjusted linear mixed model, the mean decline in global z-score was −0.031 units per year prior to hospitalization. The parameter estimate for the change in the trajectory of cognitive global z-score associated with hospitalization was −0.051 (95% CI −0.057 to−0.045 units, P&lt;0.001). Thus, the estimated annual slope after the first hospitalization was −0.082 (−0.031 plus the change associated with hospitalization of −0.051). Using the model that fits the data best, after a second hospitalization, the average slope estimate was −0.118 (−0.082 plus an additional change of 0.7 x −0.051) units. The average slope and change in slope, following subsequent hospitalizations, are shown in Table 3. Full model results can be found in Supplementary Tables S3a and S3b.

Hospitalization was also associated with an increased rate of decline in all four cognitive domains. The estimated average slopes prior to and following the first hospitalization were 0.009 and −0.033 units per year for memory; −0.035 and −0.063 units per year for language; −0.009 and −0.028 units per year for visuospatial; and −0.060 and −0.101 units per year for attention/executive function, all P&lt;0.001 (Table 3).

Results from sensitivity analyses considering only the first hospitalization and accounting for potential practice effects are presented in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5. The pattern of results from these two sensitivity analyses was similar to those from the primary analysis.

Characteristics of hospital admission and changes in global cognitive z-scores

Table 4 summarizes secondary analyses assessing whether the trajectory of global cognitive z-score following hospitalization changed based on hospitalization characteristics. The acceleration of cognitive decline following hospitalization was more pronounced for medical compared to surgical hospitalization (estimated change in slope −0.064 vs. −0.034, interaction P&lt;0.001), and non-elective compared to elective admissions (estimated change in slope −0.075 vs. −0.037, interaction P&lt;0.001).

In further post-hoc analyses, for surgical admissions, accelerations in global cognitive decline were greater after non-elective surgical compared with elective surgical hospitalizations (estimated change in slope −0.068 [95% CI −0.107, −0.029] vs. −0.039 [95% CI −0.050, −0.027]). A similar pattern was seen for medical admissions, with greater declines after non-elective medical compared with elective medical hospitalizations (−0.064 [95% CI −0.079, −0.049] vs −0.050 [95% CI −0.065, −0.035]). The association of hospitalization with changes in cognitive decline did not differ for hospitalization requiring ICU admission vs not (interaction P=0.896) nor dependent on hospitalization duration (interaction P=0.202).

Discussion

The major findings of this study are that 1) hospitalization was associated with accelerated declines in global cognition and all four cognitive domains assessed (memory, visuospatial skills, language and attention/executive function); 2) multiple hospitalizations were associated with further accelerated cognitive loss, albeit at a reduced magnitude compared to the first admission, and; 3) medical and non-elective hospitalizations were associated with greater rates of cognitive decline compared to surgical and elective hospitalizations, respectively.

Declines were observed for all four of the assessed cognitive domains after hospitalization. However, more pronounced declines were noted for memory and attention/executive function, two domains primarily affected by normative aging, and less for visuospatial and language, which are relatively preserved with aging.25–28 These findings confirm prior reports that hospitalization is associated with accelerated global cognitive decline.5,7,8 In the present report we confirmed that the type of hospitalization was associated with the magnitude of cognitive decline. Similarly, James et al.8 examined cognitive scores after hospitalizations, and distinguished between elective and non-elective admissions, using longitudinal cognitive assessments (based on 19 tests) but following a somewhat different analytic approach. In contrast to our findings, they found that only non-elective, but not elective, hospitalizations were associated with cognitive trajectory changes. Similar results were observed for multiple hospitalizations, associated with further cognitive declines only for non-elective hospitalizations. For non-elective hospitalizations, they also found associations with several cognitive subdomains, with the exception (in discrepancy with our results) of visuospatial ability. The reasons that our results differed are not clear, but we do note that most elective hospitalizations in the James et al.8 study were surgical (82%), whereas 50% of elective hospitalizations in our study were surgical. As we found that surgical admissions were associated with less acceleration in cognitive decline, the high proportion of surgical patients in the James et al.8 elective hospitalization group could explain the difference in findings. Nonetheless, we found in secondary analyses that even within categories of surgical or medical indications for admission, non-elective hospitalization was associated with a greater acceleration in cognitive decline than elective hospitalization. The general direction and magnitude of these associations was similar in sensitivity analyses that consider only a first hospitalization and when accounting for a practice effect.

The reasons that non-elective hospitalizations were associated with greater acceleration in cognitive declines are unknown. One explanation may be that such hospitalizations presumably reflect more acute, serious disease compared with elective hospitalizations. However, we did not find an association of ICU admission, a measure of illness acuity, with changes in trajectory. It is also possible that events during hospitalization which do not necessarily require ICU admission could accelerate cognitive decline after hospitalization.3,29 For example, delirium during hospitalization is associated with increased risk for long-term cognitive impairment following discharge.29 We did not have reliable data regarding delirium for all patients, thus could not include this as a factor in our analyses.

Medical hospitalization was associated with a greater acceleration in decline compared with surgical hospitalization. The fact that the proportion of non-elective hospitalizations was greater among medical patients may be an important contributor to this observation. Also, the most common indication for medical admission was cardiovascular disease, a known risk factor for cognitive decline.30–32 Finally, most of the surgical indications were associated with correction of specific acute conditions (knee replacement, hernia repair etc.). These patients may have a lower burden of severe systemic disease compared those with chronic medical conditions who require hospitalization, such that cognitive decline may be more pronounced in patients admitted for medical indications.

Animal studies suggested that exposure to general anesthetic agents may induce neuropathology implicated in Alzheimer dementia33,34 raising concerns regarding similar effects in humans.35 Indeed, in a series of prior analyses we found that undergoing anesthesia and surgery was associated with a modest, but statistically significant, acceleration in the rate of cognitive decline.3,36,37 However, the association between exposure to anesthesia and accelerated decline was seen for both general and regional anesthesia, arguing that confounding factors other than exposure to general anesthesia (comorbidities, stress of hospitalization, etc) are responsible.37,38 The current finding that cognitive decline was greater following medical compared with surgical admission does not support the concept that exposure to anesthesia itself causes acceleration in long-term cognitive decline.

Clinical significance of cognitive decline

In our cohort, the estimated global cognitive z-score before hospitalization declined at a rate of −0.031 unit per year, corresponding to a 5-year estimated decline in global z-scores of −0.16 units (−0.031 units per year x 5). For an individual who has a single hospitalization, the 5-year estimated decline in global z-score would be increased by −0.25 (−0.051 units per year x 5). Taking into account the type of hospital admission is also important. The additional decline over a 5-year period following a medical admission would be −0.32 (−0.064 units per year x 5) compared to an additional decline of −0.17 for surgical admissions (−0.034 units per year x 5).

The clinical implications of this accelerated cognitive decline will depend on an individual’s cognitive reserve and expected years of life following hospitalization. Figure 1 A shows simulated paths of two hypothetical 75 year-old participants (Participant 1, above-average cognitive baseline function and Participant 2, below-average cognitive baseline function) with escalating risks for cognitive decline and 3 possible hospitalization scenarios (no hospitalization, single hospitalization at 2 years, hospitalization at 2 and 4 years). For each participant, the slope of cognitive decline is accelerated following the first hospitalization with an additional, albeit attenuated, decline following the second hospitalization. If hospitalizations occur for Participant 1 at 2 and 4 years, the cognitive decline trajectory will remain well above the threshold for cognitive impairment after 8 years of follow-up, at which time the participant would be 83 years of age. However, if Participant 2 has a single hospitalization at 2 years, the associated accelerated cognitive decline will reach the threshold for cognitive impairment at approximately 5 years, age 80 years, which is 3 years earlier than would have been expected without hospitalization. Similarly, Figure 1 B. shows simulated paths for global cognitive trajectories of the same two hypothetical participants under scenarios of no hospitalization, a single medical hospitalization at 2 years and a single surgical hospitalization at 2 years. The interpretation of the clinical implications of hospitalization for these patients is similar to that described in Figure 1 A, although for participant 2, the time at which he reached the threshold for cognitive impairment is more accelerated following medical vs. surgical hospitalization.

The clinical implications of cognitive impairment after hospitalization are likely to be minimal for older adults with preserved cognitive reserve at the time of hospitalization, and will likely impose a minimal impact on their cognitive activities of daily living.

Study limitations

Our large study uses the resources of the MCSA, a prospective, population-based study of cognitive aging among Olmsted County residents. Retrospective information about hospitalizations is obtained through the REP medical records linkage system which contains accurate information of all health issues for the entire population. An important limitation is the possibility of unmeasured confounding, including time-dependent confounding arising after baseline. Although cognition is assessed every 15 months, the timing of the MCSA visits did not correspond to consistent time intervals surrounding hospitalization. Aging is associated with cognitive decline,40 and older individuals have an increased likelihood to be hospitalized.41 Therefore, hospitalization could be a contributor to cognitive decline or only a marker for comorbidities that are independently associated with cognitive loss. For modelling purposes, we estimated the slope of cognitive trajectory prior to hospitalization using data from all participants, including those who had no hospitalizations during follow-up. Although numerous covariates are included in our modelling, we cannot rule out that unmeasured confounders exist and that those who ultimately required hospitalizations may differ from those who did not. Although statistical adjusting accounts for diagnostic entities, it cannot consider the variable acuity of the given condition.

Conclusion

In conclusion, hospitalization of older adults is associated with acceleration of decline in multiple cognitive domains. This decline is more pronounced after non-elective compared to elective hospitalizations, and after hospitalizations for medical compared to surgical indications. The clinical implications of this acceleration will depend on the individual’s baseline cognitive reserve and expected longevity. Future studies are needed to better understand the factors underlying this association.

Figure 1 A and B simulate cognitive trajectories for 2 hypothetical participants (Pt), each with and without hospitalizations during follow-up. Pt 1 is a highly functional 75-year-old college-educated female, married, with no other comorbidities. Pt 2 is a 75-year-old male with high-school diploma, former smoker, moderate comorbidity burden (cardiometabolic conditions = 3), never married, and APOE-ε4 positive. Figure 1 A shows simulated paths of 3 possible hospitalization scenarios (no hospitalization, single hospitalization at 2 years, hospitalization at 2 and 4 years). In each case, the slope of cognitive decline is accelerated following the first hospitalization with an additional, albeit attenuated, decline following the second hospitalization. It is notable that in Participant #1 (Pt 1) who has above average cognitive function at baseline if hospitalizations occurred at 2 and 4 years, the trajectory of cognitive decline remained well above the threshold for cognitive impairment at the end of 8 years of follow-up. However, for Pt 2 who had below average cognitive function at baseline (indicating less cognitive reserve), a single hospitalization at 2 years was associated with an accelerated decline in cognitive function resulting in them reaching the threshold for impairment at approximately 5 years which is 3 years earlier than would have been expected had they not required hospitalization. Similarly, Figure 1 B. shows simulated paths for global cognitive trajectories of the same two hypothetical individuals under scenarios of no hospitalization, a single medical hospitalization at 2 years, and a single surgical hospitalization at 2 years. The interpretation of the clinical implications of hospitalization for these patients is similar to that described in Figure 1 A, although for Pt 2, the time at which they reach the threshold for impairment is more accelerated if they required medical vs. surgical hospitalization.

* Slope estimate presented is for the average slope among all participants. Although not all participants had a hospitalization during follow up, all are considered to be at risk for hospitalization, and therefore are included in the calculation of this estimate.

† Results are from multivariable linear mixed effects models. All models are adjusted for age at baseline, sex, education, marital status, APOE-ε4 genotype, smoking status, and cardiometabolic conditions (see Methods) and three binary covariates were included in the analysis indicating any hospitalization in the 5, 10 and 20 years prior to baseline. Unknown marital status and APOE ε4 status were included as separate categories. Models also adjusted for the interaction of covariates and time since first z-score. A complete case analysis assuming missing completely at random was conducted with respect to other missing baseline covariates - excluding just one subject with missing cardiometabolic conditions. Longitudinal dropout from the MCSA was assumed missing at random.

‡ As a result of the model specification, the magnitude of the change in slope following hospitalization is decreased by 30% for each subsequent hospital admission. For example, for the calculation of the estimated change in slope of the global z-score the change following first admission is −0.051, following a second admission, the change is 0.7 × −0.051= −0.036, resulting in a cumulative change in slope from pre-hospitalization of (−0.051) + (−0.036) = −0.087, and following a third admission the change is 0.72 × −0.051= −0.025 resulting in a cumulative change in slope from pre-hospitalization of (−0.051) + (−0.036) + (−0.025) = −0.112, Similar calculations can be used for 4th, 5th etc. admissions whereby for the ith hospitalization the change in slope is 0.7(i-1) × −0.051.
