Abnormal calcium homeostasis, activation of protease calpain, generation of p25 and hyperactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurogenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease. We have recently shown that extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) induces Cdk5 activation via p25. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which eCIRP regulates calcium signaling and calpain remains to be addressed. We hypothesized that eCIRP regulates p25 via Ca2+-dependent calpain activation. eCIRP increased calpain activity and decreased the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin in Neuro 2a (N2a) cells. Calpain inhibition with calpeptin attenuated eCIRP-induced calpain activity and p25. eCIRP specifically upregulated cytosolic calpain 1, and calpain 1 silencing attenuated the eCIRP-induced increase in p25. eCIRP stimulation increased cytosolic free Ca2+, especially in hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells, which was attenuated by the eCIRP inhibitor Compound 23 (C23). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) inhibition using 2-aminoethoxy-diphenyl-borate or xestospongin-C (X-C), interleukin-6 receptor alpha (IL-6Rα)-neutralization, and phospholipase C (PLC) inhibition with U73122 attenuated eCIRP-induced Ca2+ increase, while Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane remained unaffected by eCIRP. Finally, C23, IL-6Rα antibody, U73122 and X-C attenuated eCIRP-induced p25 in HT-22 cells. In conclusion, the current study uncovers eCIRP-triggered Ca2+ release from ER stores in an IL-6Rα/PLC/IP3-dependent manner as a novel molecular mechanism underlying eCIRP’s induction of Cdk5 activity and potential involvement in neurodegeneration.

pmcIntroduction

Dysregulation of calcium and the calcium-activated nonlysosomal neutral cysteine protease calpain have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurogenerative diseases, particularly in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1–5]. The calpain proteolytic system includes a large catalytic calpain subunit, a small regulatory subunit, and the endogenous calpain-specific inhibitor calpastatin, and is very tightly regulated [6]. Calpain is primarily activated by increased intracellular calcium and plays a significant role in a broad variety of calcium-regulated cellular processes by proteolytic cleavage of diverse substrates, including signal transduction proteins, transcription factors and cytoskeletal and plasma membrane-associated proteins [3,4]. Calpain-mediated cleavage of p35, a regulator of the neuron-specific serine/threonine kinase cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (Cdk5), generates a truncated carboxy-terminal fragment p25 which forms a stable and hyperactive complex with Cdk5 [7–9]. The Cdk5 acts on microtubule-associated protein tau, and its hyperactivation results in tau hyperphosphorylation, aggregation and accumulation accelerating the progression of neurodegeneration [10–12].

Calcium signaling controls synaptic plasticity, learning and memory formation in the brain [13,2]. Regulation of cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) levels is spatiotemporally complex and involves Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane, Ca2+ storage in the intracellular stores (mainly the endoplasmic reticulum, ER), Ca2+ mobilization from the ER and Ca2+ buffering [14,15,5]. Calcium homeostasis can be disrupted by mechanisms such as decreased calcium buffering capacity, excitotoxicity or deregulated calcium channels [2]. Ca2+ mobilization from the ER happens via activation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) or ryanodine receptors (RyRs) [16]. ER Ca2+ release in the cytosol is linked to the activation of Ca2+-sensitive kinases and phosphatases [14,2].

Extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) is a neuroinflammatory mediator typically released by microglial cells in response to physiologic stressors such as cerebral ischemia, alcohol exposure and AD-associated neuronal amyloid-β [17–21]. Interestingly, eCIRP has been shown to be involved in alcohol-induced memory impairment [22,23]. Recently, we showed that eCIRP induces generation of neurotoxic p25 via IL-6Rα/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/Cdk5 pathway [21]. Interestingly, interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling pathway in neurons deregulates the calcium and Cdk5/p35 pathway [24,25]. But the detailed molecular mechanism by which eCIRP modulates intracellular calcium levels and calpain activity to regulate p25 induction remains to be identified. Also, IL-6 has been reported to activate phospholipase C (PLC)-inositol triphosphate (IP3) pathway in pancreatic cells [26]. We therefore hypothesized that eCIRP activates the PLC-IP3 mediated calcium release from ER in neurons, in turn activating calpain to generate Cdk5 hyperactivator p25.

To test this hypothesis, we investigated regulation of the calpain activity and expression by eCIRP to induce p25 using mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells stimulated with eCIRP and calpain inhibition with calpeptin and small interfering RNA (siRNA). We then examined if eCIRP triggers increase in cytosolic levels of free Ca2+ [Ca2+]i by extracellular influx or release from intracellular stores in mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 in addition to N2a cells using eCIRP antagonist 15-mer peptide Compound 23 (C23). We further dissected the role of IL-6Rα/PLC/IP3 pathway in neuronal [Ca2+]i induction downstream of eCIRP using specific inhibitors and confirmed its effect on eCIRP-induced p25 in HT22. Thus, we revealed IL-6Rα/PLC/IP3-mediated ER Ca2+ release as the novel mechanism linked to eCIRP-induced calpain 1 activation and p25 generation implicating eCIRP as a promising novel target in neurodegenerative pathologies including AD.

Cell Culture

Mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a (N2a) cells were obtained from Dr. G. Thinakaran (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). N2a cells were cultured in 1:1 Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)/Opti- minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin (PS) at 37 °C in 5% CO2, as previously described [28,29]. Mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells were provided by Dr. D. Schubert (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). HT-22 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL PS, and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37°C in 5% CO2, as previously described [29]. 0.25 % Trypsin was used for N2a and HT22 cells detachment. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.

Calpain Activity Assay

Calpain activity was determined in N2a cells at 400/505 nm using a fluorometric Calpain activity assay kit (Abcam) as per instructions. Briefly, N2a (1 × 105 cells/well) seeded in 12-well plate were cultured untreated or treated with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP for 48 h, with or without 30 min pretreatment with calpeptin (20 μM) or C23 peptide (25 μg/ml). Following eCIRP stimulation, protein was extracted from the cells using the extraction buffer provided with the kit, and the protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford Assay, as per manufacturer’s protocol. 20 μg protein per sample was transferred to a black clear-bottomed 96-well plate and calpain activity measured as fluorescence at excitation at 400 nm and emission at 505 nm using a Biotek Synergy/Neo2 multi-mode microplate reader.

Western Blotting (WB)

N2a (1 × 105 cells/well) or HT22 (0.5 × 105 cells/well) cells were seeded in 12-well plates and left untreated or treated with either 0.1, 1 or 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP, or with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP with or without 30 min pretreatment with calpeptin (2 or 20 μM) or C23 peptide (25 μg/ml) or U73122 (2 μM) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, vehicle) for 16 h for calpain 1 and 2 levels and 48 h for p25 levels. After eCIRP treatment, the cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Na-orthovanadate, protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitors and total protein was extracted. After centrifugation of cell lysates at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, the total protein concentration was determined. For cell fractionation, the harvested cells were extracted as per manufacturer’s instructions to obtain whole cell lysates and cytoplasmic, membrane and nuclear fractions. Calpastatin, Cdk5 activator p25 and calpain 1 and 2 levels were determined by WB analysis using calpastatin, p25, calpain 1, calpain 2 and β-actin antibodies. Anti-GAPDH, Histone H3 and Na-K-ATPase antibodies were used to check the purity of the cellular fractions. Protein extracts were loaded (20 μg/well) and fractionated on NuPAGE™ 4%–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 0.1% casein in TBS for an hour at room temperature (RT), the membranes were incubated in respective primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The target bands were detected using infrared dye-labeled secondary antibodies in an Odyssey Clx Imaging system with Image Studio 5.2 software (Li-Cor Biosciences) and subjected to densitometric analysis using ImageJ software.

Calpain-1 siRNA Transfection

N2a cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in 12-well plates and grown to 80% confluence. Next day, cells were transfected with 50 nM non-targeting control pool or calpain 1 SMARTpool siRNA using DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent as per manufacturer’s protocol. Following 24 h transfection, cells were either harvested for RNA extraction, or treated with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP for 24 h or left untreated and harvested for protein extraction.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) Analysis

Illustra RNAspin mini kit (GE Healthcare) was used to extract total RNA from transfected N2a cells. The RNA quality was assessed by an RNA Nano Chip using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and the RNA samples with 260/280 ratios between 1.8 and 2.1 were reverse transcribed into cDNA using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). A PCR reaction was carried out in 20 μl of a final volume containing 0.06 μM of each forward and reverse primer, cDNA, and 10 μl SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Amplification was conducted in StepOnePlus real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) under the thermal profile of 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min. GAPDH mRNA was used to normalize the amplification data and relative expression of mRNA was expressed as the fold change compared to the control quantified using comparative cycle threshold (CT) method of 2(−ΔΔCT). The sequences of the primers used for this study are: Capn1-F: 5’-AGACCATGTTCCGGTTTTT-3’ and Capn1-R: 5’-CTTCAGGCAAACATAGTCAG-3’; Capn2-F: 5’-TTCGGCATCTATGAGGTT-3’; Capn2-R: 5’-CGGAGGTTAATGAAGGTATC-3’; GAPDH-F: 5’-CATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGACTG-3’ and GAPDH-R: 5’-ATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAG-3’.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy

N2a cells (3 × 104 cells/well) were plated in 8-well chamber slides and grown overnight to 80% confluence. Cells were treated with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP for 16 h followed by three Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) washes and the membrane stained with Biotium MemBrite™ Fix 488/515 using the staining kit. Next, cells were washed, fixed for 15 min by 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 10 min with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked with 1% BSA, 100 mM glycine in PBS for 30 min at RT. The slides were incubated overnight at 4°C with 1:100 diluted calpain-1 antibody, washed and incubated for 1 h at RT with donkey anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 594 and Hoechst 33342. After washing three times with PBS, slides were mounted immediately on Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). The images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Observer equipped with LSM880 confocal microscopy system (Zeiss). The images obtained by confocal microscopy were merged and combined using FIJI ImageJ.

Ca2+ Measurements and Ca2+ Add-back Assays

The free cytosolic Ca2+ was measured with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4 AM using Fluo-4 NW Ca2+ Assay Kit (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, N2a or HT-22 (3 × 104 cells/well) cells were seeded in black clear-bottom 96-well plates and grown overnight. Cells were left untreated or pretreated for 30 min with C23 (25 μg/ml) or 2-APB (50 μM) or X-C (10 μM) or U73122 (2 μM) or DMSO or anti-IL-6Rα (3 μg/ml) or control IgG (3 μg/ml) followed by 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP stimulation for 3 h. The medium was removed from the plate and Fluo-4 AM dye solution in 1X Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer containing 2.5 mM probenecid was loaded by incubating plates at 37°C for 30 min and additional 30 min at RT. The fluorescence was measured at 485/535 nm using Biotek Synergy/Neo2 multi-mode microplate reader. Fluorescence images were taken using EVOS FL Auto Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed with FIJI ImageJ. For Ca2+ add-back assays, HT-22 (5 × 104 cells/well) cells were seeded in 12 well plate and grown overnight. Cells were left untreated or stimulated with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP for 3 h and loaded with Fluo-4 AM dye. Cells were washed with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS and incubated for 10 min in Ca2+/Mg2+-free HBSS with 20 mM HEPES buffer, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.4 mM MgSO4. Ca2+ was then added back to a final concentration of 1.4 mM. The fluorescence kinetics were measured at 485/535 nm at RT using a Tecan GENios Pro plate reader.

Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 7.0 graphing and statistical analysis software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) and presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests were performed for multigroup analysis. All data were tested for normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test. For comparing two groups, we performed unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. The differences in values with a p &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

eCIRP Triggers Calpain Activation to Induce p25

We have previously shown that eCIRP upregulates the expression of p25 – a neurotoxic truncated form of the Cdk5 regulator p35, in primary neurons and N2a cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner [21]. The Cdk5 hyperactivator p25 is generated through the proteolytic cleavage of p35 by the calcium-activated protease calpain [30]. To determine whether eCIRP activates calpain, we evaluated the calpain enzymatic activity in N2a cells stimulated with 0, 0.1, 1 and 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP for 48 h. eCIRP stimulation significantly increased the calpain activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a). After 48 h of eCIRP treatment, 1 μg/ml eCIRP increased the calpain activity by 1.2-fold, and 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP further increased the calpain activity by 1.4-fold (Fig. 1a). The endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin is an important regulator of brain calpain activity [31,32,6]. To determine whether the eCIRP-induced increase in calpain activity affects neuronal calpastatin, we treated N2a cells with increasing concentrations of eCIRP for 48 h and analyzed calpastatin protein expression by WB. We found that eCIRP significantly decreased calpastatin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1b). Stimulation with 1 μg/ml eCIRP decreased N2a cell calpastatin levels by 22.7%, and 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP further decreased calpastatin levels by 44.8% (Fig. 1b). Moreover, to further confirm the eCIRP-induced calpain activity in N2a cells, we blocked eCIRP with 25 μg/ml peptide inhibitor C23 or calpain with 20 μM pharmacological inhibitor calpeptin by 30 min pretreatment followed by stimulation with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP or vehicle for 48 h. N2a cells responded to eCIRP stimulation with a 1.4-fold induction of the calpain activity. The eCIRP-induced calpain activity was completely abrogated by calpain inhibition with calpeptin, as well as by eCIRP inhibition with C23 (Fig. 1c). To evaluate if eCIRP-induced calpain activation regulates p25 generation, we inhibited calpain using pharmacological inhibitor calpeptin at 2 and 20 μM or an equivalent amount of DMSO as vehicle control followed by 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP stimulation for 48 h and evaluated p25 protein levels. Stimulation with eCIRP increased p25 protein in N2a cells by 11.7-fold, which was dose-dependently suppressed by calpain inhibition, with 2 μM calpeptin pretreatment decreasing p25 by 21.1% and 20 μM calpeptin further decreasing p25 levels by 43.8% (Fig. 1d). As seen in our earlier study, there no p25 was detected in unstimulated control N2a cells (Fig. 1d). These findings indicate that eCIRP triggers calpain activation, which then cleaves p35 to generate the Cdk5 hyperactivator p25.

eCIRP Specifically Targets Calpain 1

There are two major isoforms of calpain in the brain: calpain 1 and calpain 2 [33], distinguished by their unique 80-kDa subunits. Being intracellular proteases, calpain activity is strictly regulated through varied complex mechanisms that include their expression and subcellular localization [34]. First, we determined the relative expression of calpain 1 and calpain 2 mRNA in N2a cells. The mean CT value for calpain 1 mRNA expression was 26.3 ± 0.6, whereas the mean CT value for calpain 2 mRNA expression was 35.2 ± 0.8 (Fig. S1a). The resulting mean ΔCT = 8.8 corresponds to a calpain 1 mRNA expression level 456-fold higher than that of calpain 2. Since eCIRP stimulation increased calpain activation and decreased calpastatin protein levels, we next assessed the effect of eCIRP stimulation on calpain 1 and calpain 2 protein levels in N2a cells. Stimulation with eCIRP for 16 h induced calpain 1 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner, with 0.1 μg/ml eCIRP inducing a 1.2-fold increase, and 1 μg/ml eCIRP further increasing it to 1.5-fold (Fig. 2a). Stimulation with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP resulted in 1.6-fold induction compared to control, which was very similar to 1 μg/ml eCIRP (Fig. 2a). Of note, the calpain 1 protein levels were not significantly different between N2a cells stimulated with vehicle or eCIRP for 48 h, demonstrating that the eCIRP-induced upregulation of calpain 1 is transient (Fig. S1b). Interestingly, unlike calpain 1, protein levels of calpain 2 showed no change after 16 h stimulation with eCIRP (Fig. S1c).

To assess whether eCIRP also affects the subcellular localization of calpain 1, we treated N2a cells with vehicle or 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP for 16 h followed by staining with plasma membrane marker membrite (green), calpain 1 antibody (red), and nuclear dye Hoechst (blue) for immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. In control N2a cells, calpain 1 was distributed in cytosol as well as some on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2b). After eCIRP stimulation, calpain 1 was still detected on the membrane but there was an increase in the cytosolic staining of calpain 1 compared to control (Fig. 2b). To verify the increase in cytosolic fraction of calpain 1, we fractionated the protein lysates from N2a cells culture with and without eCIRP into whole cell lysate and cytoplasmic, membrane and nuclear fractions, which we then immunoblotted for calpain 1 levels. After eCIRP stimulation, calpain 1 levels increased in whole cell lysate by 1.7-fold compared to control, which was attributed to a 1.5-fold increase in calpain 1 levels in the cytoplasmic fraction that showed over control (Fig. 2c–d). Calpain 1 was undetectable in the membrane and nuclear fractions irrespective of eCIRP stimulation, suggesting the major proportion to be cytosolic (Fig. 2c). Taken together, these results reveal that eCIRP induces increase in neuronal calpain 1 expression in the cytosol suggesting cytosol as the site for eCIRP-induced calpain activation.

Calpain 1 Inhibition Attenuates eCIRP-Induced p25 Generation

To evaluate if eCIRP-induced p25 generation was calpain 1-dependent, we silenced calpain using calpain 1 siRNA or transfected non-targeting siRNA in control N2a cells. First, we confirmed the degree of calpain 1 knockdown by looking at calpain 1 mRNA levels 24 h post-transfection. Calpain 1 siRNA transfection decreased the calpain 1 mRNA levels in N2a cells by 67.1% compared to non-targeting siRNA transfection control (Fig. 3a). Next, we looked at calpain 1 and p25 protein levels with or without 24-h stimulation with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP at 24 h post-transfection with non-targeting or calpain 1 siRNA pool. In control N2a cells with no eCIRP stimulation, calpain 1 siRNA knocked down calpain 1 baseline protein expression by 34.5% compared to non-targeting siRNA after total 48 h of transfection (Fig. 3b). As expected, non-targeting siRNA transfected N2a cells showed 1.3-fold increase in calpain 1 protein levels with 24-h eCIRP stimulation (Fig. 3b). In N2a cells stimulated with eCIRP, calpain 1 siRNA further reduced calpain 1 protein expression by 53.3% compared to non-targeting siRNA (Fig. 3b). This further confirmed the transfection efficiency at protein levels as well. Similar to controls shown in Fig. 1d, in the absence of eCIRP stimulation p25 was neither expressed in non-targeting siRNA nor in calpain 1 siRNA transfected N2a cells (Fig. 3c). Stimulation with eCIRP resulted in 9.9-fold increase in p25 expression in non-targeting siRNA control (Fig. 3c). Calpain 1 silencing resulted in a 47.3% decrease in the eCIRP-induced p25 levels, markedly suppressing the increase from 9.9-fold down to 5.2-fold (Fig. 3c). These results demonstrate that eCIRP upregulates the Cdk5 hyperactivator p25 via eCIRP’s induction of calpain 1 activity.

eCIRP Increases Neuronal Intracellular Calcium Concentration [Ca2+]i

As calpain is a calcium-activated protease, we next interrogated the effect of eCIRP stimulation on neuronal cytosolic free intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i levels. For this purpose, we pretreated N2a cells for 30 min with 25 μg/ml C23 or vehicle followed by stimulation with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP or no eCIRP for 3 h. [Ca2+]i concentration was measured as fluorescence of Ca2+ fluorescent dye Fluo-4. The eCIRP stimulation increased [Ca2+]i levels by 15.7% (relative to unstimulated control N2a cells). Pretreatment with eCIRP inhibitor C23 nearly completely abrogated the increase in [Ca2+]i fluorescence, bringing the levels down by 13.5% which was comparable to the baseline control (Fig. 4a). The fluorescence images of the Fluo-4 AM loaded N2a cells also showed similar increase in [Ca2+]i after eCIRP stimulation, which was attenuated with C23 treatment (Fig. 4b). The analysis of images with FIJI ImageJ also showed subtle yet significant 1.4-fold increase in the mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of eCIRP-stimulated compared to control N2a cells (Fig. 4c). C23 pretreatment decreased the eCIRP-induced MFI by 29.4% bringing it down closer to control baseline (Fig. 4c).

The mouse hippocampus derived neuronal HT22 cell line is widely used as a model system for glutamate-induced toxicity [35,36] and calcium-signaling [29]. Therefore, we examined [Ca2+]i levels in HT22 to compare the response to eCIRP with N2a cells. To test if HT22 responds to eCIRP, we stimulated HT22 cells with 0, 0.1, 1 and 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP for 3 h and then measured [Ca2+]i as fluorescence of loaded Fluo-4 AM dye solution. eCIRP stimulation significantly increased the [Ca2+]i levels in a dose-dependent manner in HT22 cells. The [Ca2+]i levels increased by 16.4% with 0.1 μg/ml, 29.8% with 1 μg/ml and 39.4% with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP stimulation compared to baseline control (Fig. S2). Then, we pretreated HT22 cells for 30 min with 25 μg/ml C23 or vehicle followed by stimulation with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP for 3 h. The amplitude of eCIRP-induced increase of [Ca2+]i levels was higher in HT22 cells (Fig. 5a) than that in N2a cells (Fig. 4a). eCIRP stimulation increased the [Ca2+]i levels by 47.3% compared to control (Fig. 5a). Like N2a cells, C23 pretreatment also attenuated the eCIRP-induced [Ca2+]i levels in HT22 cells bringing them down by 33.2% to near-baseline levels (Fig. 5a). The images of the Fluo-4 AM loaded HT22 cells also showed Ca2+ fluorescence increased with eCIRP stimulation and turned down with C23 treatment (Fig. 5b). Consistent with the microplate readings (Fig 5a), MFI calculated from images of the eCIRP stimulated HT22 cells showed significant increase by 1.5-fold compared to no eCIRP control HT22 cells (Fig. 5c). C23 pretreatment decreased the eCIRP-induced MFI by 25.9% bringing it closer to control baseline (Fig. 5c). These results provide direct evidence that eCIRP increases the intracellular levels of free cytosolic neuronal Ca2+ to explain the eCIRP-induced increase in calpain 1 activation by potential modulation of intracellular Ca2+ flux by eCIRP.

eCIRP Induces [Ca2+]i via IP3-Mediated ER Ca2+ Release, not Extracellular Ca2+ Influx

The increase in [Ca2+]i could be either attributed to the opening of Ca2+ channels on the plasma membrane or to release of Ca2+ from intracellular storages – mainly ER [5]. To evaluate extracellular Ca2+ influx, [Ca2+]i measurements were performed in HT22 cells under extracellular “Ca2+ add-back” conditions obtained after a transient Ca2+ depletion to generate a driving force for extracellular Ca2+ entry. eCIRP stimulation did not induce any changes in intracellular fluorescence after extracellular Ca2+ add back (Fig. S3), suggesting that eCIRP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is not due to the opening of plasma membrane calcium channels but, rather, due to release from intracellular calcium stores.

ER is the major intracellular Ca2+ store and ER Ca2+ release is driven mainly by inositol-1,4,5,-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) [14]. To examine if IP3R mediates eCIRP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i levels, we pretreated HT22 cells for 30 min with IP3-mediated Ca2+ release inhibitors 50 μM 2-APB or 10 μM xestospongin-C or DMSO followed by stimulation with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP or no eCIRP for 3 h. As established, eCIRP stimulation increased Fluo-4 AM fluorescence by 63.3% compared to unstimulated control HT22 cells set as 100% (Fig. 6a). The 2-APB and xestospongin alone at the doses used showed Fluo-4 AM fluorescence comparable to control baseline (Fig. 6a). However, pretreatment with 2-APB followed by eCIRP stimulation attenuated the increase in [Ca2+]i levels down by 60.1%, and xestospongin-C also decreased it by 46.4% (Fig. 6a) rendering [Ca2+]i levels comparable to those of control baseline. The images of Ca2+ fluorescent HT22 cells also visually confirmed the increase with eCIRP stimulation and attenuation with both IP3R inhibitors (Fig. 6b). Taken together, these results show that the increase in [Ca2+]i levels induced by eCIRP is not due to extracellular Ca2+ influx but rather due to IP3-mediated release of Ca2+ from ER stores.

eCIRP-Induced [Ca2+]i is IL-6Rα/PLC-Mediated

We have recently shown that eCIRP can bind to IL-6Rα and activate its downstream STAT3 pathway [37], leading to increased neuronal levels of p25 [21]. As such, we sought to evaluate if IL-6Rα activation by eCIRP plays any role in IP3-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i levels. To test that, we pretreated HT22 cells for 30 min with control IgG or IL-6Rα neutralizing antibody followed by stimulation with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP or no eCIRP for 3 h. As previously shown, Fluo-4 AM fluorescence increased by 51.7% after eCIRP stimulation along with control IgG pretreatment compared to unstimulated control HT22 cells (Fig. 7a). However, pretreatment with IL-6Rα neutralizing antibody followed by eCIRP stimulation attenuated the increase in Fluo-4 AM fluorescence by 37.9% bringing down the [Ca2+]i levels to nearly those of the unstimulated control (Fig. 7a). The increase in Fluo-4 AM fluorescence with eCIRP stimulation and decrease with IL-6Rα inhibition were also replicated in the images of Ca2+ fluorescent HT22 cells (Fig. 7b).

IL-6 has been reported to act via phospholipase C (PLC)-inositol triphosphate (IP3) in pancreatic cells [26], and eCIRP can activate IL-6 signaling [37,21]. Since we found the eCIRP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i to be IL-6Rα-dependent and IP3-mediated in HT22 cells, we wanted to further explore the involvement of PLC in this pathway. For evaluating the role of PLC, we pretreated HT22 cells for 30 min with 2 μM PLC inhibitor U73122 or DMSO, followed by no stimulation or stimulation with eCIRP. eCIRP stimulation of HT22 cells increased the [Ca2+]i by 53.1% and U73122 pretreatment decreased it by 30.7% (Fig. 8a). The fluorescence of unstimulated cells pretreated with U73122 was similar to that of the unstimulated control. The fluorescent microscope images of the HT22 cells were consistent with the microplate readings (Fig. 8b). Collectively, the data show that eCIRP activates PLC in an IL-6Rα-dependent manner, resulting in IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from ER stores.

eCIRP-Induced p25 Generation is Mediated by PLC/IP3 Pathway

It is known that eCIRP activates IL-6Rα/STAT3 pathway to induce p25 in N2a cells which is calpain 1-dependent. Since eCIRP activates PLC via IL-6Rα to cause IP3-mediated increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ in HT22 cells, we wanted to demonstrate that this would ultimately result in increased generation of p25. For determining that HT22 cells generate p25 in response to eCIRP, we stimulated HT22 cells with 0, 0.1, 1 and 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP for 48 h and determined p25 levels by immunoblotting. eCIRP stimulation significantly increased p25 levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 9a). After 48 h of eCIRP treatment, HT22 cells showed 1.5-fold induction of p25 at 0.1 μg/ml eCIRP, 5.5-fold induction of p25 at 1 μg/ml eCIRP, which further increased to 7.9-fold on stimulation with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP (Fig. 9a). To further confirm eCIRP-mediated p25 generation, we pretreated HT22 cells for 30 min with 25 μg/ml C23 or vehicle, and then stimulated with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP or no eCIRP for 48 h. Inhibition of eCIRP by C23 peptide attenuated the 10.7-fold p25 induction down to 5.6-fold, resulting in a decrease of 47.8% (Fig. 9b). For demonstrating that eCIRP-induced p25 was IL-6Rα-mediated, we pretreated HT22 cells for 30 min with 3 μg/ml control IgG or IL-6Rα neutralizing antibody, followed by stimulation with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP or no eCIRP for 48 h. IL-6Rα inhibition attenuated the 15.1-fold p25 induction down to 5.6-fold, resulting in a decrease of 62.9% (Fig. 9c). Next, we examined if p25 generation by eCIRP in HT22 cells is PLC-mediated pathway dependent. To prove this, we pretreated HT22 cells with 2 μM U73122 or vehicle for 30 min prior to stimulation with 2.5 μg/ml eCIRP or no eCIRP for 48 h. Stimulation with eCIRP increased the p25 levels by 12.3-fold, and pretreatment with U73122 decreased this increase by 52.1%, bringing down the p25 induction to 5.9-fold (Fig. 9d). As expected, pretreatment with 10 μM X-C inhibitor for IP3-mediated Ca2+ release showed a similar attenuation of eCIRP-induced p25 decreasing it by 45.2% (Fig. 9e). These data show that eCIRP generates p25, implicated in neuronal damage, through activation of the IL-6Rα/PLC/IP3/Ca2+/calpain 1 pathway in neurons.

Discussion

Clear understanding and detailed investigation of novel molecular targets is vital for addressing the challenges impeding breakthrough therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders. Calcium dysregulation and aberrant calpain activation are well studied disease mechanisms in the neurodegeneration field [1–5]. Interestingly, both calpain and eCIRP exacerbate inflammation, specifically in arthritis [38,39] and sepsis [40,27], suggesting a potential connection between the two molecules. Despite having been implicated in neuroinflammation, neuronal injury, and memory impairment in diverse contexts [22,23,17–21], the molecular pathways eCIRP targets in the brain and the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Elucidation of such biochemical pathways could lead to novel targeted therapies, such as inhibiting eCIRP, capable of mitigating the effects of p25/Cdk5 pathway on neurofibrillary tangles in AD and other tauopathies.

The current study links eCIRP to calcium dysregulation and calpain activation in neurons as a mechanism by which eCIRP upregulates the Cdk5 coactivator p25 (Fig. 10). First, we confirmed that eCIRP-induced calpain activation regulates p25 generation, by demonstrating that eCIRP increased the calpain activity, decreased calpastatin and calpain inhibition attenuated eCIRP-induced p25. Next, we identified that eCIRP specifically modulated calpain 1 and confirmed calpain 1 regulation of eCIRP-induced p25 by calpain 1 siRNA inhibition. We then illustrated that eCIRP increased neuronal levels of free cytosolic Ca2+ [Ca2+]i which was attenuated by eCIRP inhibition with C23, IP3R inhibition with 2-APB or xestospongin-C, IL-6Rα-neutralization with antibody or PLC-inhibition with U73122. Furthermore, we demonstrated that eCIRP-induced p25 is attenuated by pretreatment with PLC-inhibitor U73122. Thus, here we elucidate that eCIRP triggers intracellular Ca2+ release from ER stores via the IL-6Rα/PLC/IP3 pathway, resulting in calpain 1 activation and generation of Cdk5 activator p25 (Fig. 10).

Abnormal activation of Ca2±dependent protease calpain due to unusually higher Ca2+ levels has been critically implicated in various neurodegenerative pathologies [4,3]. Increased calpain activity has been reported in brains from AD patients [41], in neuronal ischemia [42], in traumatic brain and spinal cord injury [43,44], multiple sclerosis [45,46] and Parkinson’s disease [47]. Calpain-mediated protein cleavage regulates the activity of crucial proteins associated with tauopathies such Cdk5, major contributor to pathological tau phosphorylation [11]. We have previously shown that eCIRP induces the generation of p25 fragment from the Cdk5 regulator p35 [21]. Indeed, as we hypothesized, eCIRP stimulation increased neuronal calpain activity. Conversely, the endogenous inhibitor of calpain calpastatin is markedly depleted in neurons from AD patients [48]. Additionally, calpastatin overexpression to inhibit calpain in various animal models protects from neurodegeneration [44,48,31,49]. Interestingly, eCIRP also cause a significant decrease in calpastatin protein levels, which is consistent with the eCIRP-induced increase in calpain activity. Apart from calpastatin, calpain activity is regulated by other mechanisms including local calcium levels, and reversible association with membranes [6]. Our data show that at the lower eCIRP concentration there is relative increase in calpain activity but no decrease in calpastatin levels. This could be explained by subtle increase in cellular calcium levels by low dose eCIRP resulting in an increase seen in calpain activity even in the presence of calpastatin. The other explanation could be that the increase in cellular calpain levels observed at low eCIRP doses (Fig. 2a) would change the relative ratio of calpain and calpastatin allowing increase in calpain activity. Calpeptin is a cell permeable peptide aldehyde inhibitor of calpain protease activity. It binds to the active site of calpain to reversibly inhibit its activity. Calpeptin inhibited the eCIRP-induced calpain activity as well as the attenuated the eCIRP-induced increase in p25 levels. Of note, the eCIRP-induced p25 data suggests induction of calpain activity at higher levels than reflected by the activity assay data. The commercially available calpain activity assay kit used detects only activated calpain in cytosol and is designed to prevent autoactivation of calpain during the extraction procedure. However, the extraction buffer provided with the kit contained EDTA/EGTA and being cytosolic calpastatin would be also extracted along with calpain. The metal ion-chelating effect of EDTA/EGTA and calpain inhibitor calpastatin could have contributed to the underestimation of calpain activity. This warrants further validation in future studies using diverse techniques such as calpain activity assay in live cells to circumvent the limitations of the fluorometric assays.”

Brain calpain 1 or μ-calpain is mainly located in neurons and to a lesser extent in glial cells, whereas calpain 2 or m-calpain is mainly found in glia and some in axons [6]. Calpain 1 requires micromolar levels of intracellular Ca2+ for activation, whereas calpain 2 requires much higher (millimolar) levels. Both calpain 1 and calpain 2 can generate p25. We found that N2a cells expressed 450-times more calpain 1 than calpain 2. eCIRP upregulated protein levels of calpain 1 in a transient manner. The confocal imaging showed calpain 1 in the cytosol along with some membrane localization, but eCIRP increased calpain 1 mainly in the cytosol. Of note, we were not able to detect calpain 1 in the membrane or nuclear fractions in the cellular fractionation studies based on differences in detergent concentrations for protein extractions from different compartments. Nevertheless, the increase in calpain 1 protein limited to the cytosol suggests that eCIRP did not affect subcellular localization. Calpain 1 and calpain 2 are known to play contradictory roles in neuronal death and damage, with calpain 2 being more strongly associated with neuronal death [33,50,51]. However, our data showed that eCIRP only modulated calpain 1 in N2a cells. Additionally, we have implicated eCIRP in the induction of the tau kinase Cdk5, but not in neuronal apoptosis. Calpain 1 specific knockdown by siRNA silencing attenuated the eCIRP-induced p25 generation at comparable levels to calpain inhibition by calpeptin further supporting our data. Nevertheless, the calpain 2 involvement could not be completely ruled out in the neuronal settings based on current findings. Future studies dissecting regulation of specific calpain isoforms in detail using isoform specific inhibitors and in vitro and in vivo gain- and loss-of-function approaches will be of great interest.

The timing for different experiments is based on the order of relevant targets in the signaling. Intracellular calcium induction being the earlier event in the cascade, we arbitrarily chose 3 h stimulation with eCIRP for its evaluation. As hypothesized, eCIRP induced an increase in intracellular levels of free calcium in the cytosol, which was particularly prominent in HT22 cells. Interestingly, the eCIRP inhibitor peptide C23 attenuated this increase in Ca2+ levels confirming the specificity of eCIRP. We have previously shown that C23 inhibits eCIRP binding to IL-6Rα, which is critical for p25/Cdk5 pathway deregulation [21], thus strengthening the potential for eCIRP activation of IL-6Rα to also be involvement in the calcium increase. The calcium add-back experiment showed no change in cytosolic calcium levels with eCIRP stimulation, negating the role of eCIRP in promoting the influx of extracellular Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. This is important considering that HT22 cells are susceptible to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity which can activate both ionotropic and metabotropic plasma membrane receptors [52]. However, we found that inhibiting IP3R in HT22 cells attenuated the eCIRP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. Stimulation of the IP3R in the ER membrane is known to induce release of Ca2+ from ER to cytosol and has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases [1,2]. ER has additional Ca2+ homeostasis mechanisms such as ryanodine receptor (RyR) mediating Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, sarcoendoplasmic reticular Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) mediating Ca2+ transport back to the ER lumen [16]. Further studies will be needed to dissect the relative contribution and the interplay among these receptors.

The IP3R activates via binding of IP3 which is phospholipase C-dependent. eCIRP triggers activation of IL-6 signaling in neurons via binding to IL-6Rα inducing STAT3 phosphorylation. Of particular interest is that similar to eCIRP, IL-6 also increases the calcium influx and deregulates Cdk5/p35 pathway in rat hippocampal neurons causing tau hyperphosphorylation [25,24]. IL-6 induces extracellular calcium influx through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors mediated by Janus kinase/STAT pathway [24]. However, in contrast to IL-6, eCIRP-induced intracellular calcium increase was not due to extracellular influx but explained by IP3R-mediated release of Ca2+ from ER stores. IL-6 can also activate phospholipase C (PLC)-inositol triphosphate (IP3) pathway in pancreatic cells [26]. Phospholipase C (PLC) plays a key role in regulating various neuronal functions including neuronal development, synaptic transmission, and plasticity in the brain [53]. Inhibiting PLC using N-aminosteroid homologue of N-ethylmaleimide, U-73122, downregulated eCIRP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. This supports our data connecting eCIRP to IL-6Rα/PLC/IP3-dependent ER-calcium release. Finally, inhibition of eCIRP, IL-6Rα, PLC and IP3- mediated Ca2+ release pathway, each resulted in decrease in p25 levels due to eCIRP stimulation, further establishing the signaling mechanism by which eCIRP activates Cdk5. Further studies will be needed in more physiological neuronal systems in vitro and in vivo showing the effect of relevant pathway blockers to validate the outcome of the described signaling mechanism.

In conclusion, our study has identified that eCIRP initiates the IL-6Rα/PLC/IP3-dependent calcium pathway in neurons activating calpain resulting in Cdk5 hyperactivator p25 induction. Specifically, the small eCIRP inhibitor peptide C23 abrogates the eCIRP-induced increase in neuronal intracellular Ca2+ and calpain activity by antagonizing eCIRP’s binding to IL-6Rα. These results highlight the eCIRP-triggered IL-6Rα/PLC/IP3-dependent ER Ca2+ release and calpain activation as a potential mechanism in neuronal dysfunction and suggest that eCIRP may be a promising new target for treating neurodegenerative diseases including AD.

Fig 10. Mechanism of eCIRP’s modulation of intracellular calcium levels and calpain to regulate p25 induction.

eCIRP triggers IL-6Rα-PLC-IP3- dependent release of Ca2+ from ER stores. This increase in intracellular Ca2+ activates calpain 1 to induce Cdk5 hyperactivator p25. Inhibition of eCIRP by C23, IL-6Rα by neutralizing antibody, PLC by U73122 and IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release by 2-APB and X-C reverses the eCIRP-induced ER Ca2+ release. In addition, inhibition of eCIRP, IL-6Rα, PLC and calpain 1 attenuates the eCIRP-induced p25 expression
