Objective:

Elevations in blood pressure (BP) and associated white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are chronic comorbid conditions among older Black adults. We investigated whether WMHs modify the association between late-life BP and cognition within older Black adults.

Methods:

167 Black adults (age~75yrs; non-demented at baseline) participating in neuroimaging studies at the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center were evaluated for BP markers of cardiovascular health including systolic BP, diastolic BP, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and hypertension and assessed for global and domain-specific cognition at baseline and annually for up to 8 years. WMHs adjusted for intracranial volume were quantified at baseline.

Results:

Models adjusted for relevant confounders and the interaction of these variables with time revealed differential associations between BP markers and baseline cognition, however, only elevated diastolic BP predicted faster cognitive, i.e., episodic memory, decline [estimate=−0.002, SE=0.0009, p=0.002]. While WMH burden did not modify the association between diastolic BP and episodic memory decline, it did interact with diastolic BP to lower episodic memory at baseline [estimate=−0.051, SE=0.012, p=0.0001], i.e., greater WMHs combined with higher diastolic BP resulted in the lowest baseline episodic memory scores. A similar profile was noted for WMHs, MAP, and baseline episodic memory. Hypertension was neither associated with cognition nor modified by WMH burden after multiple comparisons correction.

Conclusion:

Late-life diastolic BP was associated with faster rates of episodic memory decline in older Black adults; together with higher WMH burden it (and MAP) lowered the point at which individuals begin their course of decline toward pathological aging.

pmcIntroduction

Accumulating evidence suggests that it may be important to consider the interaction between late-life cardiovascular risk factors and brain health; particularly within populations that experience significant cardiovascular disease, often over the entire life course. According to the American Heart Association, elevations in blood pressure and the presence of hypertension are some of the most potent risks to the overall health of older Black adults (1). One area where this is clear is within brain health where older Black adults with mid- as well as late-life elevations in blood pressure (BP) suffer from accelerated cognitive decline (2, 3); in part, because of the adverse effects that elevations in BP have on the brain including the accumulation of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden regardless of race or ethnicity (4, 5). In fact, because WMH burden has been most consistently related to cognition and dementia in diverse populations when compared to other markers of white matter brain health (including global fractional anisotropy derived from diffusion tensor imaging) (6), it has been described as “the best summary measure of cerebrovascular-related brain injury” in diverse populations (5). WMH burden has also recently been associated with accelerated epigenetic aging in older Black adults (7), and so may serve as a proxy for accelerated aging in this population. Thus, we sought to determine which specific critical late-life BP markers of cardiovascular health (i.e., systolic BP, diastolic BP, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, and/or hypertension) interact with WMH burden, a potent biomarker of brain health and a proxy for accelerated aging, to modify baseline levels of cognition and/or rates of cognitive decline in older Black adults without known dementia participating in Black cohort studies at the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center (RADC).

Methods

Participants

Participants for this neuroimaging ancillary study were recruited from either the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) (8) or the RADC African American Clinical Core (9). MARS, begun in 2004, is an ongoing community-based, cohort study of aging in older Blacks. The African American Clinical Core, a cohort study of the transition from normal aging to dementia began in 2008. As described elsewhere (8), participants in these two cohorts are recruited from a variety of community-based settings that cater to minority seniors in the metropolitan Chicago area and outlying suburbs. Both studies have a rolling admission. Participants enroll without known dementia and agree to detailed annual clinical and cognitive evaluations. Follow-up evaluations, identical in all essential details, are performed annually by examiners blinded to previously collected data. 3T MRI was first introduced into MARS and the African American Clinical Core in 2012. The Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center approved these studies and participants gave written informed consent for all study procedures in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

At the time of these analyses, 3T neuroimaging data were available for 254 participants who, at the time of their MRI, did not have dementia (10) based on uniform structured clinical evaluation (8) and NINDS/ADRDA criteria (11). Of these 254 participants, 194 had the necessary 2 or more visits with complete cognitive data required for longitudinal analyses. We excluded 27 individuals who were missing data on any non-neuroimaging variable of interest. This left 167 individuals with baseline and an average 4.5±2.2 years of cardiovascular and cognitive follow-up (range of 2 to 8 years) in our analyses. Please note, given both studies rolling admission, all available time points of data per participant were used; thus, some participants had the minimum of 2 visits while others had the maximum of 8 visits contributing to statistical analyses.

Late-life Blood Pressure (BP) Markers of Cardiovascular Health

As previously described (12), BP was measured in the right arm using an Omron automated BP machine by trained research assistants at participants’ annual evaluation. Two seated readings were taken at 30-second intervals following a 5-minute rest period; 1 minute after being requested to stand, a standing BP was taken. Systolic and diastolic BP were calculated separately by averaging all three readings. Pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were also calculated. Pulse pressure is an index of the discrepancy between the maximum pressure applied during a heartbeat (systolic BP) and the pressure in the arteries between heartbeats (diastolic BP). It is calculated as the difference between systolic and diastolic BP and thought to represent arterial stiffness. MAP, an index of the steady component or average of pressure in the arteries during a single cardiac cycle, was approximated using the following formula: [systolic BP + (2*diastolic BP)]/3. MAP is often considered a critical hemodynamic factor because it is a better marker of perfusion to vital organs than systolic BP (13).

Participants were initially asked if they had ever been told by a doctor, nurse, or therapist that they had high BP; subsequent study visits reiterated the question with the caveat ‘since your last interview’. Thus, hypertension status was deemed positive for the current analyses based on a self-report history of hypertension at any evaluation (14).

White Matter Hyperintensities

Whole brain MRI data were acquired using a Phillips Achieva 3T MRI scanner following standard procedures to maximize comfort and minimize movement (15). High resolution T1-weighted images were obtained using a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence: echo-time (TE) = 3.7 ms, repetition time (TR) = 8 ms, minimum inversion time (TI) = 955 ms, flip angle = 8°, parallel imaging acceleration factor = 2, 181 sagittal slices, acquired voxel size 1×1×1mm3. Scanning also included a 2D fast spin-echo T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence: TE = 90 ms, TR = 9,000 ms, TI = 2,500 ms, parallel imaging acceleration factor = 1.6, 35 axial slices, acquired voxel size 0.9×1.1×4mm3.

In post-processing, bias field correction (16) was first applied to each participant’s MPRAGE and FLAIR data. MPRAGE images were segmented using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat) and the intracranial volume was calculated. MPRAGE data were registered to FLAIR data using rigid body registration and the MPRAGE brain mask was applied to the FLAIR data. WMH were automatically segmented based on masked FLAIR data using the Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm (17) (FMRIB, University of Oxford, UK). Total WMH volume was then divided by the participant’s corresponding intracranial volume and subsequently log 10 transformed given the skewness of the data.

Neuropsychological Assessment

All participants underwent an annual cognitive evaluation administered in an identical fashion at annual visits (8). Nineteen tests were selected to assess five specific cognitive domains: episodic memory (immediate and delayed story recall; word list recall and recognition), semantic memory (confrontational naming, word reading, and verbal fluency), working memory (digit span and digit ordering), perceptual speed (Stroop subtests, symbol digit modality, and number comparisons), and visuospatial ability (line orientation and progressive matrices). Raw scores were converted to standard z-scores using the baseline mean (SD) of the entire cohort, and the z-scores of all tests for each domain were then averaged for the five cognitive domains. A global cognitive function score was also derived averaging a person’s standard scores across all test scores. Psychometric information on these summary scores has been deemed adequate (8).

Covariates

In addition to age, sex, and years of education, we adjusted for baseline body mass index (BMI) and history of diabetes at any evaluation given the impact of these conditions on cognition (18, 19) and WMH burden (19, 20). For this study, baseline was considered the first evaluation with 3T MRI and accompanying cardiovascular health and cognitive data. Baseline BMI was calculated based on height and weight, determined by direct measurement to the nearest inch and pound, respectively. Diabetes status was deemed positive for the current analyses based on a self-report history or by information that the participant was taking diabetes-related medications at any evaluation as identified and coded according to the Master Drug Data Base System. We similarly coded anti-hypertension medication use.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive summaries of all variables including covariates were conducted. We used linear mixed effects regression models to examine the associations of elevations in BP and hypertension status with level of, and longitudinal change in cognition. Briefly, in these linear mixed effects regression models two random effects are specified: a random intercept, representing the heterogeneity between participants in initial level on the outcome variable, and a random effect for slope, representing the heterogeneity across participants with regard to the rate of change in the outcome variable over time. BP measures (i.e., systolic and diastolic, pulse pressure and MAP, separately) were continuous predictors, hypertension status was a dichotomous predictor (0=absence, 1=presence), and each cognitive measure (i.e., global cognition and the 5 individual cognitive domains, separately) was a continuous longitudinal outcome. Models included terms for time (years since baseline), age, sex, education, BMI, diabetes, and interaction terms of each of these variables with time. In a second series of analyses these models were augmented with the addition of terms for log-transformed WMH volume, its interaction with time, and the 3-way interaction of WMH, time, and each cardiovascular health measure, separately. We further adjusted for anti-hypertensive medication use, however, since this additional covariate did not alter results (data not shown), we do not report results of these models.

Analyses were programmed in SAS/STAT software, Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Linux (SAS Institute, Cary, NC); statistical significance was determined via 95% confidence intervals (CI) and a multiple comparisons corrected p-value specific to each set of cognitive analyses, i.e., p≤0.010 for the global cognitive score (derived using the quotient .050/5 for the 5 BP markers of cardiovascular health) and p≤0.002 for the domain-specific cognitive scores (derived using the quotient .050/25 for the 5 BP markers of cardiovascular health multiplied by the 5 cognitive domain scores).

To aid interpretation, BP level estimates were multiplied by 10 to represent the unit value higher of cognition associated with each 10 mmHg increment of BP; change values were multiplied by 100 to represent the unit change in cognition over the course of a decade associated with each 10 mmHg increase in BP. In WMH models, level interactions multiplied by 10 represented the unit value higher of cognition associated with each 10 mmHg BP increment and 10-fold higher WMH volume combination, while 3-way interactions multiplied by 100 represented the unit change in cognition over a decade associated with each 10 mmHg BP increase and 10-fold higher WMH combination.

Results

Participants were 75.6±6.4 years of age at baseline, reported 15.5±3.3 years of education, and were 85.6% female which precluded an evaluation of sex difference in the current study. Average raw scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination, a global cognitive screener, (28.23±1.83) suggested that our participants overall level of cognitive functioning was within normal limits at baseline. We also include baseline raw scores for the 19 test items that contributed to our global cognitive composite and the five cognitive domain scores as Supplemental Table S1 (Supplemental Digital Content).

Average systolic BP was within the hypertensive range while average diastolic BP was at the cut-point for hypertension (Table 1). Average pulse pressure fell approximately 10 mmHg below normal and average MAP was at the high-end of normal. Approximately 78% of our sample reported late-life hypertension. Table 1 has additional information. Supplemental Table S2 displays the unadjusted correlations between BP and WMH indices with baseline cognition as well as person-specific slopes of cognitive change over time.

Late-Life BP Markers of Cardiovascular Health and Cognition

In linear mixed effects models including terms for time, age, sex, education, BMI, diabetes, and interaction terms of each of these variables by time, systolic BP and MAP were associated with level but not change in global cognition; however, neither result met our p≤0.01 threshold for significance (systolic BP level estimate=−0.004, standard error(SE)=0.002, 95% CI=−0.007, −0.0004, p=0.026; MAP level estimate=−0.006, SE=0.002, 95% CI=−0.011, −0.0005, p=0.037). Neither diastolic BP, pulse pressure, nor hypertension was associated with level or change in global cognition (data not shown).

When considering the five cognitive domains, several BP markers were differentially associated with levels of specific cognitive domain scores (Table 2), however, these associations did not meet our corrected threshold for significance, i.e., p-value≤0.002. Only the association between higher diastolic BP and faster rates of decline in episodic memory (p=0.002; Figure 1) met our corrected threshold for significance. Thus, a 10 mmHg increase in diastolic BP over 10 years was associated with a −0.27 unit faster rate of decline in episodic memory. For all estimate details see Table 2. Hypertension was not associated with level or change in any cognitive variable (data not shown).

Effect Modification of WMH

To investigate whether the associations of BP markers of cardiovascular health with baseline levels of cognition and/or rates of cognitive decline were modified by WMH burden, we added a term for WMH volumes, its interaction with time, and with each BP measure or hypertension status (separately), as well as the 3-way interaction of WMH*time*late-life cardiovascular health marker to our previously tested models. The previously reported association between diastolic BP and declines in episodic memory remained significant (Table 3). Briefly, regardless of the BP measurement in the model, higher WMH volumes were consistently associated with lower levels of global cognition, semantic memory, and visuospatial ability and faster decline in perceptual speed performance (Table 3). Higher WMH volumes was also associated with faster episodic memory decline in the hypertension model (WMH*time estimate=−0.20, SE=0.07, 95% CI=−0.35, −0.05, p=0.009).

WMH volumes significantly modified the effects of diastolic BP as related to level of global cognition and level of episodic memory and MAP as related to level of episodic memory (all p-values≤0.002). As detailed in Table 3, the most robust WMH effect modification was seen for elevations in diastolic BP and lower levels of episodic memory (Figure 2). Specifically, a 10-fold higher WMH volume and 10 mmHg higher diastolic BP level at baseline combined was associated with a −.51 units lower episodic memory performance at baseline. While other interaction terms of WMH volume and these BP markers as well as systolic BP and pulse pressure were nominally significant for levels of cognition at baseline they did not meet our threshold for significance (see Table 3 for details). Additionally, while WMH volumes interacted with hypertension status as related to change in episodic memory over time, it did not reach our corrected threshold for significance (WMH*hypertension*time estimate=0.22, SE=0.09, 95% CI=0.41, 0.04, p=0.014).

Discussion

In this study of approximately 170 older Black adults without dementia at baseline, we investigated whether potent late-life BP markers of cardiovascular health interacted with WMH burden, a potent biomarker of brain health in this population, to influence baseline levels of cognition and/or rates of cognitive decline. Our decision to consider accumulated WMH burden, a reflection, at least in part, of the consequences of mid-life cardiovascular disease risk (4, 5), as an effect modifier of the relationship between cardiovascular and cognitive health tests an emerging hypothesis that early effects on white matter integrity may confer a vulnerability across the lifespan (21). Our most consistent pattern of results indicates that higher levels of diastolic BP at baseline were associated with faster rates of decline in episodic memory independent of WMH burden, although the magnitude of this this association was small. In addition, it was found that WMH burden significantly modified the association between baseline DBP with baseline episodic memory performance. Thus, diastolic BP and WMH burden may lower the point at which an individual begins a course of decline toward pathological aging as it pertains to baseline episodic memory performance, and diastolic BP may accelerate the process of episodic memory decline toward meeting criteria for dementia in older Black adults.

This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, studies investigating BP and cognition often focus on select BP markers of cardiovascular health or hypertension in isolation. In contrast, we assessed multiple aspects of BP including steady and pulsatile components as well as hypertension. Furthermore, we not only outlined the specific cognitive domains involved in these associations, but also investigated WMH burden as a potential effect modifier of these associations given its particular relevance in older Black populations (4, 5). While many associations did not meet threshold for significance after multiple comparison correction, WMH burden modified the effect of associations between two of four BP indices investigated (i.e., diastolic BP and MAP) and baseline levels of episodic memory. The relationship of diastolic BP with episodic memory decline confirms a previous meta-analytic report that episodic memory, a cognitive domain intimately linked with Alzheimer’s dementia, may be particularly vulnerable to BP elevations (22). Thus, we extended these findings to a within race study of older Black adults as well as to another BP marker of cardiovascular health, i.e., MAP. In contrast, while some (23), but not all (24) studies have reported a relationship between BP and processing speed (e.g., motor speed), we did not find a relationship between any of our BP measures, or hypertension, and perceptual speed as defined in our study. Differences in results may be due, in part, to the type of speeded task(s) administered and/or covariates included in analyses (22), as well as differences in analytic samples.

While beyond the scope of the current investigation, underlying mechanisms to explain our results may be found in the literature. Sustained elevations in BP may lead to cerebrovascular remodeling which over time results in adverse vascular resistance, vessel wall stiffness, and increased pressure pulsatility (25, 26). Ultimately, this creates a mismatch between required levels of continuous perfusion for brain function and allowed levels, resulting in neuronal death and demyelination that promotes adverse cognitive outcomes. The fact that WMH burden was a significant effect modifier of diastolic BP as well as MAP associations with cognition may suggest particular involvement of small penetrating arteries perfusing the white matter (one hypothesized mechanism of WMHs (27)). Specifically, WMHs may be the result of low-grade white matter hypoperfusion due, in part, to evidence suggesting that select white matter regions (e.g., periventricular white matter), rely almost exclusively on small vessels &lt;100 μ in diameter (28). Additionally, however, elevations in BP – diastolic BP in particular – have also been associated with more pronounced a-beta burden in vivo (29, 30) as well as greater tau tangles in the hippocampus at autopsy (31). Several reasons for these associations may exist including BP-related disruption to the blood-brain barrier, angiotensin system, and endothelium (29, 32); however, not all studies report associations between diastolic BP and Alzheimer’s related neuropathology (33) or extend them to include elevations in MAP (34). Nonetheless, these studies speak to the potential effect of elevated diastolic BP on compromised vascular integrity generally, and the downstream effects of such compromise on increased WMHs as well as Alzheimer’s disease related neuropathology.

Results of this study should be interpreted with knowledge of its limitations. We note the importance of mid-life cardiovascular disease risk to late-life WMH burden, a well-documented association in the literature; however, increasing age is also a key determinant of WMH burden. Thus, we cannot rule out the fact that the age of our analytic sample, although adjusted for in all statistical models, may have influenced results. Furthermore, the relative paucity of significant results relating BP measures to cognitive change, regardless of WMH burden, may reflect the possibility that the association is not linear, but possibly a U- or J-shaped curve (35). While such non-linear profiles are less apparent for older Blacks (36), cognitive decline in older Blacks with hypertension (~78% of our participants) may be more robustly associated with cardiovascular biomarkers of systemic arterial structure like pulse wave velocity than BP (37). It may also reflect the fact that we did not explicitly test an executive function domain score but instead had cognitive tasks reflecting this ability interspersed among other domain scores. Despite these limitations, several strengths should be noted. The longitudinal nature of our study allowed for an investigation of level and change in cognition. The comprehensive nature of our consideration of BP, combined with our comprehensive cognitive assessment allowed us to discuss multiple BP measures and distinct cognitive domains. Furthermore, our decision to include WMH burden as an effect modifier follows the literature suggesting the importance of considering the interaction between late-life cardiovascular and brain health and used “the best summary measure of cerebrovascular-related brain injury” for diverse populations (5). In fact, null results of analyses investigating the possibility that WMH burden mediated relationships between BP markers and cognition (data not shown) only confirmed our decision.

In summary, this study suggests the potential benefit of considering the interaction between cardiovascular and brain health risks known to exert a significant and often lifelong effect in older Black adults when considering cognition and cognitive decline within this population. More specifically, it suggests that elevations in diastolic BP not only interact with WMH burden to influence baseline levels of episodic memory, but alone may hasten the trajectory of episodic memory decline toward meeting criteria for dementia. Studies have reported the associations between BP, small vessel disease, as well as Alzheimer’s pathology (38); however, less work has been conducted within Black adults who come to autopsy and how these relationships may underlie the associations reported herein. While it may seem unnecessary to some to conduct this work given it has already been conducted in primarily non-Latino White cohorts, we would argue that many associations seen in non-Latino Whites do not hold in communities of color (the impact of APOE for example) and that until such findings are confirmed in all communities we cannot assume they apply throughout. Finally, future studies should also investigate the race-conscious socio-environmental context in which these effects operate (39) to exacerbate health in Black adults (40) including systemic racism and inequities in access to quality medical care. In-depth investigations that include social determinants of health in Black adults spanning multiple age decades will inform ways of mitigating health disparities and promoting health equity in this population.

Note. Values are unstandardized coefficient (standard error), [95% Confidence Intervals, CI], and p-value results for level of (represented in the table as individual blood pressure terms) and change in (represented in the table as the interaction of time with individual blood pressure terms) cognition from linear mixed effects regression models including additional terms for age, sex, education, BMI, diabetes, time, and the interaction of each of these covariates with time. Bolded black font values denote significance determined via 95% CI and a multiple comparisons corrected p≤0.002 (derived using the quotient of .05/25 for the 5 blood pressure markers of cardiovascular health – hypertension status results not shown in this table – multiplied by the 5 cognitive domain scores).

Rows of interest are highlighted in black font with effect modification results further highlighted by shading. Bolded values denote significance determined via 95% CI and a multiple comparisons corrected p-value specific to each set of cognitive analyses, i.e., p≤0.01 for the global cognitive score (derived using the quotient .05/5 for the 5 BP markers of cardiovascular health) and p≤0.002 for the domain-specific cognitive scores (derived using the quotient .05/25 for the 5 BP markers of cardiovascular health multiplied by the 5 cognitive domain scores
