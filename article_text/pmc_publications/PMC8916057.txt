Introduction:

Our objective was to determine whether non-standardized testing of olfaction may provide useful information for predicting cognitive dysfunction and decline in patients with neurobehavioral disorders.

Methods:

We conducted cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of 82 patients who presented to a Memory Clinic with a chief complaint of cognitive deficits using non-standardized odor identification testing (nSOIT). Each patient was classified as having intact or impaired olfaction based on the ability to identify and name the odor of coffee grounds. The cross-sectional study used Student’s T-test to examine whether nSOIT results were related to cognitive dysfunction as approximated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. The longitudinal study used mixed effects multiple regression with an interaction term to investigate whether nSOIT results were predictive of cognitive decline over a period of follow-up testing (0.4 to 4.0 years [mean 1.4, SD 0.8]) to compare patients who exhibited cognitive decline over the evaluation period (decliners) and those who did not (non-decliners).

Results:

Analysis of the initial use of nSOIT in the cross-sectional study demonstrated no association between nSOIT performance and objective cognitive dysfunction. In the longitudinal study, impairment in follow-up nSOIT testing was found to be a sensitive but nonspecific predictor of cognitive decline.

Conclusion:

These results suggest that routine olfactory testing may serve as a convenient and readily available method that can be used by clinicians to better predict cognitive dysfunction and decline in patients with a variety of neurobehavioral disorders.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Early detection of neurocognitive disorders can decrease care costs and improve patient quality of life 1. Differentiating between neurodegenerative and non-progressive forms of cognitive decline remains difficult, however 2. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and amyloid imaging are costly, invasive, and may be difficult to obtain 3. The development and validation of clinical inventory screens 4 and olfactory dysfunction testing hold promise but are not widely used in clinical practice.

Studies have shown that the inability to identify common odors is an early and sensitive finding in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 5–11 and other neurodegenerative diseases that affect brain structures involved in olfaction 2, 12–16. Despite the diagnostic value of olfactory testing, current studies have relied on standardized odor identification testing (SOIT) kits, such as the University of Pennsylvania Smell Inventory Test (UPSIT)17, which are rarely integrated into clinical practice. In this retrospective study, we performed the following analyses: 1) In a cross-sectional study, we compared Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores between those who could or could not name the smell of coffee grounds. 2) In a longitudinal study, we assessed: (A) whether the rate of change in MoCA scores differed between those who could or could not identify the smell of coffee grounds, and (B) whether olfactory dysfunction as determined using coffee grounds as an nSOIT can be used to predict cognitive decline at follow-up. We hypothesized that the MoCA scores at initial presentation would differ based on nSOIT screening results, and that nSOIT performance would predict different courses of future cognitive changes.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Study design and participants

A total of 82 patients were included in this single center, retrospective cross-sectional and then longitudinal study (Table 1). All of the patients in this convenience cohort presented to a Memory Clinic with a chief complaint of cognitive deficits between November of 2013 and January of 2018. Inclusion criteria included physician concern for possible neurodegenerative pathology (usually due to some suggestion of clinical progression), documented nSOIT with coffee grounds during the patient’s first visit (as part of the standard neurological evaluation by two neurologists), as well as having a MoCA at the first visit and then at subsequent visits (overall evaluation times 0.4 to 4.0 years [mean 1.4, SD 0.8]). There were no formal exclusion criteria, though neurologists in these evaluations usually performed OI testing when there was some concern for potential future progression, and not for conditions that were deemed unlikely to progress. As we lacked biomarker support for underlying AD pathology, and as olfactory testing is meant as a screen for more detailed evaluation rather than as a diagnostic tool specific for any particular underlying pathology, our emphasis was not on specific diagnoses, but on overall cognitive prognosis. Percentages of those with suspected AD pathology are provided in Table 1. For this study, significant cognitive decline was defined as a MoCA score decline by three or more points over the course of each patient’s evaluation period, a cutoff we selected based on clinical experience and supported by previous studies 18, 19.

Data Collection

Patient information, including sex, age, years of education, and smoking history (as a dichotomous variable) was collected. MoCA tests were performed by a physician or by an advanced practice provider.

Assessment Protocol

Odor identification testing using nSOIT was performed by a behavioral neurologist on all participants at the time of their first visit to the Memory Clinic. Odor identification was assessed by having each participant close their eyes while the provider waved a small jar containing coffee grounds under the participant’s nose between two and five inches away while announcing the presence of the odor. The participants were then asked to identify the smell by free verbal response and without cueing. This procedure combines both olfactory detection sensitivity and free identification, which is different from SOITs. The resulting score was binary—either the odor was identified correctly when requested on the first attempt, or it was not.

Standard Protocol Approvals and Participant Consents

This study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB) as a retrospective chart review. In accordance with COMIRB ethical standards, no consent was obtained from study participants.

Statistical Analyses

Demographic characteristics, including age, sex, smoking history, and educational level in years, were analyzed using student t-tests and chi-square tests to assess for significant differences (alpha=0.05) between participants with intact olfaction (OI+, able to identify the smell of coffee grounds) and participants with impaired olfaction (OI−, unable to identify the smell of coffee grounds) for inclusion in subsequent analyses. Parametric distributions of demographic characteristics between OI+ and OI− were visually confirmed using histograms. We also tabulated patients we considered likely to have underlying typical AD pathology (i.e., amnestic MCI or typical, late-onset amnestic predominant clinical AD), as well as “Other” diagnoses. The “Other” diagnostic category was comprised of approximately 16% atypical AD (e.g., young onset, posterior cortical atrophy, logopenic primary progressive aphasia), cerebrovascular disease (16%), patients with multiple medical problems and/or medications impacting cognition (9%), frontotemporal dementias (9%), major neurocognitive disorder not otherwise specified (9%), and smaller numbers of primary psychiatric disorders, post-concussion syndrome, Lewy body dementia, autoimmune disease, and HIV-associated dementia. In Analysis 1, differences in initial MoCA scores between OI+ and OI− were analyzed using a student t-test. When investigating for subsequent cognitive decline in the longitudinal study, “decliners” were defined as having a three point or greater decline in their MoCA score over the entire evaluation time, with a mean of 1.4 years). In Analysis 2A, mixed effects regression with an interaction between nSOIT status and time between subsequent visits was performed to assess the relationship between change in MoCA score over time and olfaction status at the initial clinic visit. Age and the initial MoCA scores (as a proxy for disease severity) were considered as possible covariates, and analyses were done with and without those covariates. We also repeated these analyses after only focusing on patients whose follow-up times were under three years to ensure that differences in overall follow-up times were not driving group differences, as those who did not worsen tended to be followed for less time overall. In Analysis 2B, logistic regression with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the relationship between baseline nSOIT performance determined at the initial clinic visit and “decliner” status at follow-up visits.

RESULTS

Analyses of demographic characteristics between OI− and OI+ participants showed no differences based on sex, smoking history, or evaluation time (Table 1). Contrary to prediction, in Analysis 1, MoCA scores at the initial clinic visit did not differ between OI− and OI+ participants (p=0.11). Additionally, decliners and non-decliners did not differ by age, sex, smoking history, or evaluation time (Table 2).

Mixed effects regression analysis in Analysis 2A demonstrated that poor baseline nSOIT performance was associated with greater future decline in MoCA scores in unadjusted analysis (β^=2.7, p&lt;0.001, CI[1.2; 4.1], Figure 1). This effect remained statistically and clinically significant after including age and baseline MoCA as covariates (β^ = 3.7, p = 0.008, CI[0.98; 6.43]), and after including only those with follow-up times under three years (β^ = 3.44, p=0.041, CI[0.15; 6.74]).

Subsequent logistic regression (Analysis 2B) showed that baseline nSOIT performance could predict whether an individual’s MoCA score would worsen significantly over the course of the longitudinal study (β^=2.1, p=0.001, CI[−3.4; −0.9]), and the ROC AUC was 0.63. Inclusion of age and baseline MoCA retained significance (β^=2.1, p=0.018, CI[−3.0; −0.28]), with an ROC AUC of 0.72 (Figure 2). When comparing decliners and non-decliners vs. nSOIT performance, the sensitivity was 88.5%, with a specificity of 42.9%. The positive predictive value was 41.8%, and the negative predictive value was 88.9%.

DISCUSSION

AD and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases are widespread, and pose a major challenge to medicine and society 20. Significant numbers of studies have focused on developing disease-modifying therapies 21 and on improving early detection in an attempt to reduce the impact on patients, on their family members and caregivers, and on the healthcare system 1, 22. There is therefore an urgent need for feasible, rapid, and sensitive screening tests to predict the chances of a patient’s subsequent cognitive decline. We found that nSOIT performance, consisting here of correctly identifying coffee grounds after smelling them with closed eyes, was associated with higher risk and rate of subsequent cognitive decline. These results highlight the potential utility of a relatively simple, widely accessible nSOIT as a rapid screen for patients at risk of progressive cognitive decline.

While our study is limited by a lack of biomarkers to help establish the underlying histopathological diagnoses, an ability to predict cognitive decline is of clear prognostic value regardless of clinicopathological correlation. The results of our retrospective, longitudinal cohort study demonstrate that the use of coffee grounds as an nSOIT may predict future cognitive decline regardless of underlying pathology. This longitudinal approach is a relative strength of our study. Participants with relatively stable or resolving forms of cognitive dysfunction, including those associated with medications (e.g., sedatives, chemotherapy, etc.), psychiatric illnesses, sleep disorders, post-concussion syndrome, or metabolic conditions, tended to have preserved odor identification abilities. Performance of this nSOIT is comparable to published validation studies utilizing SOIT that have attempted to differentiate between normal older adults and those with pure amnestic disorders, where ROC AUCs, sensitivities, and specificities typically range from the high 70s to the low 80s 5–10.

Our nSOIT protocol using coffee grounds is simple, quick, and inexpensive, but still appears to perform comparably to standardized tests. Another strength of this study is that the testing was performed in a Memory Clinic population, which improves ecological validity compared to studies utilizing healthy adult patients as controls. Nevertheless, limitations of the study and difficulty making direct comparisons to validated SOIT-based studies necessitate further study. Our sample size is small compared to other studies, and the data were derived from a single Memory Clinic where testing and evaluation were performed by only a few clinicians. We believe this small sample size, as well as studying clinical rather than well-defined research cohorts, likely contributed to our inability to detect a difference between MoCA scores at baseline. Additionally, external validity in a primary care setting would need to be established, as the prevalence of patients with non-neurodegenerative forms of cognitive impairment may be higher outside of behavioral neurology clinics. Future studies replicating these findings in other centers with different, larger patient populations and different care providers will help ensure the generalizability of the results. There is also a question of sample bias—due to time constraints, clinic flow, and for a variety of other reasons inherent to a non-research environment, not all potentially eligible patients in our chart review were offered olfaction testing. While we have not identified non-random reasons for selection bias, the possibility of such bias is difficult to definitively exclude. However, a strength of our approach is that the test was more often offered in a situation in which a clinician judged that it may be clinically useful, thereby reducing spectrum bias. There are also clear challenges in using any non-standardized test. The use of coffee grounds for odor identification may be seen as questionable because coffee ground odor varies based on freshness, roast, brand, and strain of the coffee plant. However, such non-standardization cannot completely negate the usefulness of the test. Although our results are similar to those of published SOIT studies, a prospective two-armed study will be necessary to conduct a proper test of non-inferiority. A separate study may also be needed to investigate sensitivity to decline in atypical forms of dementia in which the olfactory cortex is less involved.

This study does not specifically investigate how olfaction differs based on underlying disease pathology, and it did not explore the myriad other possible causes of failing an nSOIT (e.g., recurrent upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, prior nasal surgery, deviated septum, medications, and more). Among those who fail nSOIT testing, the reason could be true olfactory dysfunction, anomia, or even inattention. We would predict the specificity of the nSOIT to increase if we had more carefully ruled out other potential causes of being OI−. However, we do not envision this as being the primary clinical use of an nSOIT. As imaging, CSF, and serum tests for AD pathology become more specific and commonplace, we envision a greater need for inexpensive, sensitive screening tests, such as the nSOIT, to suggest that additional, more expensive testing may not be needed.

We also emphasize that unlike some prior studies, we did not specifically investigate diagnostic potential of odor identification in early disease stages, but rather at all stages at which a patient may first present to a Memory Clinic. It may be that a relatively simple NSOIT such as this is sufficient in a clinically advanced population, but a longer or more complex olfactory identification task would be needed in earlier disease stages. If so, this may also help explain why we did not detect baseline associations between OI and cognition or age at baseline.

We believe nSOIT holds promise for aiding primary care and referring physicians in the screening and timely referral to memory clinics. It may also help triage patients in memory clinics with larger patient referral volumes, without the need for more expensive biomarker testing involving CSF or PET scans. In line with previous research, our results suggest that nSOIT testing with coffee grounds is more sensitive than it is specific—that is, a passing nSOIT result may offer some reassurance against future progression of cognitive impairment, but a failing nSOIT result does not necessarily predict future symptomatic decline. In isolation, a single odor testing approach to screen all adult patients, including those without cognitive complaints, would likely result in a large number of unnecessary referrals and a large cost to the healthcare system. However, routine olfactory testing, even if non-standardized, in conjunction with other physical examination techniques may offer a readily available and convenient method to improve screening for future cognitive decline, particularly for patients with concerns about amnestic disorders such as typical AD.

Highlights:

Olfaction is thought to be a sensitive indicator of many neurodegenerative conditions.

Even a non-standardized assessment of olfaction using coffee grounds correlated with different trajectories of subsequent cognitive decline.

Assessment of olfaction using coffee grounds had a sensitivity of 88% in predicting cognitive decline, but specificity was much lower.
