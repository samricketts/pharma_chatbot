INTRODUCTION:

TNF inhibitors are widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and their potential to retard AD progression has been reported. However, their long-term effects on the dementia/AD risk remain unknown.

METHODS:

A propensity scored matched retrospective cohort study was conducted among 40,207 patients with RA within the US Veterans Affairs healthcare system from 2000 to 2020.

RESULTS:

A total of 2510 patients with RA prescribed TNF inhibitors were 1:2 matched to control patients. TNF inhibitor use was associated with reduced dementia risk (hazard ratio: 0.64, 95% confidence interval: 0.52–0.80), which was consistent as the study period increased from 5 to 20 years after RA diagnosis. TNF inhibitor use also showed a long-term effect in reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (hazard ratio: 0.57, 95% confidence interval: 0.39–0.83) during the 20 years of follow-up.

CONCLUSION:

TNF inhibitor use is associated with lower long-term risk of dementia/AD among US veterans with RA.

pmc1. Background

Dementia is a global health problem with an aging population in the world. No disease-modifying therapies are available.1 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 50–80% of cases; other forms of dementia include vascular, Lewy-body, and frontotemporal dementia.2 A growing body of evidence indicates that cerebrovascular inflammation plays an important role in dementia, particularly in the pathological processes associated with amyloid-beta and tau accumulation in the brain of AD patients3. A sustained inflammatory response, mediated by over-activation of microglia and other immune cells, has been shown to exacerbate both amyloid and tau pathology.4,5 TNF is a key proinflammatory cytokine in the initiation and control of inflammatory processes.6 Multiple lines of evidence indicate that TNF may trigger or amplify aberrant microglia signaling in the brain and thereby contribute to AD pathogenesis.7–10 TNF produced systemically may enter the brain through receptor-mediated transcytosis.11 Elevated soluble levels of TNF have been previously reported in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients in association with disease progression.12

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune systemic inflammatory disease affecting approximately 1% of the population worldwide.13 The overall prevalence of dementia in RA patients is 0.79% according to a recent study.14 RA may represent a good model to study the role of inflammation in the development of dementia since TNF plays an important role in both conditions,15 and because TNF inhibitor drugs are effective treatments for RA. Therefore, studying the effect of anti-TNF treatment on the dementia risk in RA patients may provide an opportunity in repurposing TNF inhibitors for the treatment of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

Inflammatory pathways have been targeted for dementia/AD treatment for many years. Numerous epidemiological studies of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reported that NSAIDs are associated with reduced dementia/AD risk. However, most of these studies had small sample size16 and eventually, most NSAIDs-based randomized trials failed to show benefit for dementia/AD patients.17 Currently, conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) are used as the first line drugs for RA treatment. Two studies have reported that an association of cDMARDs with dementia/AD risk but with opposite results.18, 19. A recent clinical trial examined the effect of hydroxychloroquine on progression of dementia in early AD in patients and showed no beneficial effects.20

Several observational studies have been conducted to investigate the association of TNF inhibitor use with dementia in RA patients. A retrospective case-control study using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2000 to 2011 showed no significant associations between TNF inhibitor use and dementia incidence (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.46–1.10, 957 matched patients).18 A nested case-control study using health insurance claims data from 2000 to 2007 showed that TNF inhibitors as a class were associated with lower AD risk (adjusted OR 0.45; 95 % CI 0.23–0.90, 165 eligible AD patients). For individual TNF inhibitors, only etanercept showed decreased AD risk (adjusted OR 0.30; 95 % CI 0.08–0.89).14 However, these two studies were limited in sample size. Our recent study using nationwide electronic health record (EHR) database of 56 million adults including 514,440 RA patients also showed significant association of TNF inhibitor use and lower AD risk.21 All previous studies had limited study periods (7 and 11 years respectively) and the actual patient follow-up times were not clear, so the long-term effects of TNF inhibitor use on the risk of dementia and AD remain unknown.

In the present study, we utilized the nationwide Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) electronic medical record (EHR) from 2000 to 2020 to investigate the association of TNF inhibitor use with dementia risk in RA patients. The VA is the largest integrated health care systems in the United States, providing care to more than nine million patients annually. The VA serves a population of patients who are frequently under-represented in clinical trials, especially a large portion of older patients.22 In addition, the VA operates an EHR system for which records are aggregated in a centralized database regardless of VA site of care, enabling a longer follow-up study in a mobile real-world population. The large sample size, concentrated on older patients, and long follow-ups make the EHR data from the VA a unique resource to study the effects of TNF inhibitors on the risk of dementia and AD. In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the association of TNF inhibitors with dementia risk among patients with RA with follow-ups up to 20 years.

2. Methods

2.1 Data source

The patient data used in this study were obtained from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), which is a centralized database of electronic health records (EHR) for patients seen at VA facilities nationwide.23 The CDW contains comprehensive patient information, including demographics, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision (ICD-9 and ICD-10) diagnoses, procedures, prescription fills, and laboratory tests, which has been intensively used in observational studies.24 We used both ICD-9 (before October 2015) and ICD-10 (after October 2015) codes to obtain patient diagnosis. All ICD codes used in this study were included in Table S1 in Supporting information-1. The study period was from January 1, 2000 to August 24, 2020.

2.2 Study design

2.2.1 Study population

We used a cohort study to investigate the association of TNF inhibitors, as a whole or individually, with dementia risk in RA patients in the entire study period as well as different lengths of study periods after RA diagnosis (5, 10, 15, 20 years). Since patients with RA were often prescribed more than one TNF inhibitor in the clinical practice, we also compared the dementia risk between a combination of TNF inhibitors and single TNF inhibitor use in the entire study period.

Patients with RA were identified as patients with two or more RA diagnostic codes at least 6 months apart as described previously.25 The date of RA diagnosis was defined as the date of the first RA diagnostic code. The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) We excluded patients with dementia diagnosis occurring before the first RA diagnosis. (2) We excluded patients with less than 6 months of VA utilization prior to RA diagnosis, in order to avoid capturing new VA patients with a prior diagnosis of RA outside the VA. (3) We excluded patients with less than one year of VA utilization after RA diagnosis. (4) We excluded patients younger than 18 years old. (5) We excluded patients diagnosed with dementia/AD within 120 days of RA diagnosis, in order to ensure sufficient temperal sequences in clinical practice, as previously described14. (6) We excluded patients diagnosed with dementia/AD within 3 months after TNF inhibitor use, for the same reason.

Individual TNF inhibitor use group was defined as the RA patients who were prescribed a single TNF inhibitor during different lengths of study periods respectively. A TNF inhibitor combination use group was defined as the patients with RA who were prescribed more than one type of TNF inhibitors during the entire study period. Patients with short-term TNF inhibitor use (less than 3 months) were excluded. Patients whose TNF inhibitor treatment took place after a dementia diagnosis were considered as a non-TNF use group.

A propensity-score based matching strategy was used to select control patients, i.e., non-TNF inhibitor use group, both in the entire study periods and different lengths of study periods. The propensity score, a predicted probability of each RA patient to be treated with TNF inhibitor, was computed using logistic regression on TNF inhibitor use (outcome) with covariates including all potential confounders mentioned below (Potential confounders section), and other anti-RA drugs (Drug exposure session). Each TNF inhibitor user was matched to two control patients with the nearest propensity score within a certain amount of standard deviation (caliper width of 0.25 on the logit of the propensity score).26,27, Choosing the optimal matching ratio is a trade-off of variance and bias,28, 29 we provied a sensitivity analysis using different matching ratio (from 1:1 to 1:4) in Figure S15 in supporting information-5. Matching was implemented using the R MatchIt package (Version 4.1.0).30 Covariate balance was checked after matching according to recent guidlines.31

2.2.2 Drug exposure

The drug exposure information was obtained from pharmacy data in the CDW, including the drug name, issue dates of prescription and order records. We considered the commonly used RA treatments according to the treatment guidelines.32 Five TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab) were included, and patients with RA were considered both by the individual TNF inhibitor, and as a class. Since conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) are used as the first-line drugs for RA, we included four commonly used cDMARDs (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide). In addition, we collected drug use information for prednisone and 18 commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) (indomethacin, sulindac, diclofenac, aceclofenac, piroxicam, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diflunisal, ketorolac, tiaprofenic acid, tenoxicam, meloxicam, celecoxib, rofecoxib, etoricoxib, nabumetone, mefenamic acid). Since many of these drugs were used transiently, we considered NSAIDs as a class to facilitate analysis. We did not consider non-TNF inhibitor biologics due to their low frequency of use (Table S2 in supporting information-2).

2.2.3 Potential confounders

Baseline variables included age, sex, race, marital status, year of diagnosis, geographic region, rurality, and known risk factors for dementia, including cardiovascular disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, depression, axiety, alcohol use disorder, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).33 Obesity was defined using body mass index at the time of RA diagnosis. Other baseline risk factors were defined using data within three years prior to the RA diagnosis as described previously.34

2.2.4 Outcomes

The outcome of interest was the diagnosis of dementia during the study period. Patients with dementia were identified as patients having two or more dementia diagnostic codes with 12 months, a criterion was previously shown with high accuracy in using EHR data35. The date of onset of dementia was defined as the date of patients’ first medical encounter for their diagnosis of dementia in the database. We examined the association of TNF inhibitors with dementia in general and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in particular. Other subtypes of dementia including vascular dementia, Lewy-body, and frontotemporal dementia were not examined due to limited sample sizes (Table S2 in supporting information-2).

2.3 Statistical methods

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to investigate dementia risk over different lengths of study periods. The index date was the first RA diagnosis date. Time to first dementia/AD diagnosis was our outcome of interest, and patients were censored by the end of the study period, death, or last visit to VA, whichever came the first. TNF inhibitor use was coded as a time-dependent variable in the Cox regression. That is, only time after initiation of TNF inhibitor use was coded as being part of the TNF inhibitor exposure group, while time prior to initiation of TNF inhibitor use was coded as time in the control group. By using time-dependent variables, we avoid improperly ascribing immortal time to the treated group, since patients in the treated group cannot experience the event (dementia/AD) before TNF inhibitor use, while no such requirement exists in the control group. The proportional hazard hypthesis was examined and appeared valid.

For all analyses, a 2-sided p &lt; .05 was regarded as statistically significant. All data analyses were performed through the Veterans Affairs (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), where R (version 4.0.3) was used for statistical analysis.

3 Results

3.1 Characteristics of the study population

We identified 40,207 patients with RA in the VA system from January 1 to August 24, 2020. Among them, 20, 994 patients met our eligibility criteria (see details in methods) and 3,446 patients received TNF inhibitor treatment. The majority of patients were more than 65 years old, especially in the non-TNF inhibitor use group (80.1%). In addition, the majority of patients were male (90.5% and 85.9% in TNF non-treatment and treatment group, respectively). Before propensity score matching, baseline variables including demographics, comorbidities, and RA drug use, showed significant differences between the two groups (Table S2 in supporting information-2). After propensity score matching as described in Methods, these variables became more balanced (SMD &lt; 0.1) Average age was 66.4 (SD:13.9) years old in non-TNF inhibitor use group and 65.6 (SD: 13.4) years old in TNF inhibitor use group. Median follow-up times were 13.7 (±5.2) years and 13.8 (±5.2) years in patients with and without TNF inhibitor treatments, respectively. (Table 1 and Figure S1–S7 in supporting information-3)

3.2 TNF inhibitor use is associated with lower risk of dementia in adult patients with RA

The incidence of dementia was 5.0% and 6.0% in US veterans with RA with and without TNF inhibitor treatment, respectively (Table S2 in supporting information-2). After adjusting for age, sex, race, region, rurality, comorbidities and non-TNF drug use, patients on TNF inhibitors had significantly lower risk for dementia compared with individuals not prescribed with TNF inhibitors (HR: 0.64, CI: 0.52–0.80), which is consistent with those reported in other populations with RA.14, 21 Two commonly used TNF inhibitors, adalimumab and etanercept, were associated with significantly lower risk for dementia with a hazard ratio of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.41–0.80) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.52–0.98), respectively. Certolizumab and golimumab were not individually analyzed due to small sample sizes (Table S2 in supporting information-2). No significant difference in the dementia risk was found between patients on a combination of TNF inhibitors and those on a single agent (HR: 1.21, 95%CI: 0.79–1.83) (Figure 1).

3.3 Association of TNF inhibitor use with dementia risk at different lengths of study periods

We evaluated the association of TNF inhibitor use with dementia risk with different study periods (5, 10, 15, and 20 years after RA diagnosis). TNF inhibitor use as a class were associated with lower risk for dementia in patients with RA (HRs ranging from 0.67 to 0.72 over 20 years of study period, p &lt; 0.05). For individual TNF inhibitors, adalimumab showed consistent association with lower dementia risk over 20 years of study period (HRs ranging from 0.35 to 0.57, p &lt; 0.01). With longer study periods and more patients developing dementia, significant association of etanercept with reduced dementia risk emerged in 20 years of study period (HR: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.54–1.00). (Figure 2).

3.4 Association of TNF inhibitor use with dementia risk in elderly RA patients

Since age at onset of RA determines severity and choice of treatment,36 and is therefore a critical confounder by indication, we next examined the association of TNF inhibitor use with dementia risk in elderly patients with RA. A total of 817 elderly patients (&gt; 65 years old) with RA taking TNF inhibitor were matched to control patients. The average age was 71.4 (SD:5.3) years old in non-TNF inhibitor use group and 71.3 (SD: 5.1) years old in TNF inhibitor use group. Median follow-up times were 14.2 (SD: 5.0) years and 14.1 (SD: 5.1) years in patients with and without TNF inhibitor treatment, respectively (Table 2 and Figure S8–S14 in supporting information-4). The elderly patients treated with TNF inhibitors had lower risk for dementia compared with matched elderly patients not treated with TNF inhibitors (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.48–0.95) (Figure 3A). This significantly reduced dementia risk in elderly patients on TNF inhibitors was consistent in longer study periods (HRs were 0.67 and 0.69 for 15 and 20 years of study periods respectively, p &lt; 0.05) (Figure 3B–D). Elderly patients on individual TNF inhibitors adalimumab and etanercept had decreased risk for dementia, with overall hazard ratios of 0.50 (CI: 0.28–0.90) and 0.60 (0.36–0.99) respectively (Figure 3A).

3.5 Association of TNF inhibitor use with AD development in RA patients

We then examined the association of TNF inhibitor use and AD development. Patients with RA treated with TNF inhibitors as a class had significantly lower risk for AD development compared with matched control population (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.39–0.83) (Figure 4A), which was also observed in elderly patients with RA (age &gt; 65 years) (HR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.33–1.00) (Figure 4B). Individual TNF inhibitor drugs didn’t show associations with AD development in elderly patients with RA.

4 Discussion

In the present study, we used nationwide database of patient EHR from the US Veterans Affairs healthcare system to investigate the association of TNF inhibitor use with dementia/AD risk in patients diagnosed with RA. We not only showed that TNF inhibitor use is associated with reduced dementia/AD risk in US veterans, but further provided evidence that TNF inhibitor use may have a long-term effect on decreased risk of dementia and AD in patients with RA.

Our study has two strengths. One is the long patient follow-up in the VA system. The median follow-up was 13.7 (±5.2) years and 13.8 (±5.2) years in TNF inhibitor-treated and untreated patients with RA, respectively, which allowed us to study the long-term effect of TNF inhibitor use on dementia risk. We observed that the associations of TNF inhibitor use with reduced dementia risk were consistent over study periods from 5 to 20 years, while the median time of patients with RA on TNF inhibitors was only 4.1 years, suggesting that TNF inhibitor use has long-term effect on dementia. Another strength is that we used propensity score matching for patient cohort selection, which allowed us to better control confounders than traditional covariate adjustment methods.37 We noticed differences in age, race, drug use, and prevalence of comorbidities between TNF use and non-TNF use groups before propensity score matching. RA patients receiving TNF inhibitors tended to be younger, have a lower prevalence of comorbidities, and a higher percentage of cDMARDs and NSAIDs use (Table S2 in supporting information-2). All these observations in our study were consistent with current clinical usage since cDMARDs are considered as the first-line treatment for RA. To address this confounding by indication, we used a propensity score to match each patient receiving TNF inhibitor to non-TNF use patients on a wide range of confounders, including age, sex, race, marriage status, region and rurality, comorbidities, and in particular, drug use, such as commonly used cDMARDs and NSAIDs. After matching, two groups of patients were balanced in all these variables.

The overall hazard ratios of dementia risk both in adult and elderly patients with RA receiving TNF inhibitors were similar (0.64 and 0.67 respectively), which was little higher than a cohort study (HR: 0.48, 95%CI: 0.39–0.58).38 However, that study examined the association of all DMARD use on dementia risk probably due to limited study period (2000–2005). The overall hazard ratio of AD risk was 0.57 (95%CI: 0.39–0.83), which is comparable with a nested case-control study (OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.23–0.90) using patient claim data from 2000 to 2007.14 The larger sample size and longer follow up enabled us to examine the effect of use of the individual TNF inhibitors on dementia risk. We showed that both adalimumab and etanercept were associated with lower risk to develop dementia over longer study periods, while they were not significant in shorter study periods (Figure 1 and 2).

Drug combinations are commonly used in RA patient treatment. According to current RA treatment guideline32, combination of traditional DMARDs or TNF inhibitor/MTX combination are recommended for patients with moderate or high disease activity. While this drug combination is usually achieved optimal outcome for RA39,40, an interesting question is that how this drug treatment scheme affects dementia/AD risk. We did not observe that TNF inhibitor combinations further lower dementia risk beyond the TNF inhibitor itself. Since these TNF inhibitors have the similar mechanism of action (targeting TNF-mediated inflammatory pathways), they may not provide additional effect on further reducing dementia risk. For other non-TNF inhibitor anti-RA drugs, including traditional DMARDs and NSAIDs, epidemiological studies and randomized clinical trials don’t show significant associations with dementia/AD risk, although some contradictory evidence exists.16–20 Hence, we don’t expect that order/timing of TNF inhibitors and other non-TNF inhibitor use has a significant impact on dementia/AD risk. However, we hypothesize that initial timing of TNF inhibitor is important for preventing dementia/AD risk given that inflammation is a major contribution to dementia/AD development. This hypothesis predicts that earlier treatment of RA patients would achieve a better outcome in terms of delaying the onset of dementia/AD, and needs to be further investigated.

The potential long-term effects of TNF inhibitors on dementia/AD could be related to the role of neuroinflammation in the development of dementia/AD. A growing body of evidence suggests that inflammation can occur early in patients with dementia and AD, independent of amyloid deposition.41–43 Therefore, early reduction of neuroinflammation may have a profound impact on the pathogenesis and progression of dementia/AD. Our findings support suggestions that TNF inhibitors could be tested as a preventive drug to delay the onset of dementia/AD in patients with RA.45,46,47 Encouraging results have recently been reported for etanercept, showing that the drug is well-tolerated44 and improved cognitive function.45, 46 An ongoing interventional study is examining the effect of a TNF inhibitor on improving memory and cognitive abilities in patients with mild cognitive impairment without any rheumatic disease.47

Confounding by indication is common in observational studies. To control potential confounding effects by RA itself, we used propensity score to match the exposure group and non-exposure group by drug use, age and other co-variates. we tested several different RA drug classes, which may partially reflect different degree of RA severity. Based on a recent study showing that age is a main determinant for RA severity and types36, we matched the patients based on age at RA diagnosis. All these patient matching strategies are expected to mitigate this confounding by indication. However, we can’t exclude the possibility that RA in patients on TNF inhibitors may be still different from RA in patients not on TNF inhibitors, both in disease severity and underlying pathophysiology of the disease, especially given that RA is a highly complex and heterogeneous disease. Recently, a self-controlled cohort design, originally developed for the study of the association of acute outcomes with transient exposures48,49, has been used to study the association of drug treatment with chronic diseases.50,51 The advantage of this method is that all fixed confounders are implicitly controlled, which provided an alternative approach to handle this confounding. However, this method has strong assumptions and not easy to control the time varying co-variates such as age, a major risk factor for dementia/AD52,53. In addition, the non-exposure period is difficult to establish for the study of the long-term effect of the drug due to limited follow-up time in the electronic health record. Despite these limitations, ability to self-control fixed co-variates is particularly attractive and is an interesting future direction when sufficient data are available.

Our study has several limitations. First, information on drug usage duration, dosage and patient adherence is limited in the EHR database. We assumed that patients on TNF inhibitor started at the time of the first prescription and stopped at the last prescription. However, in clinical practice, patients may continue to use TNF inhibitors after the last prescription, or prescriptions may be obtained from a non-VA provider. In addition, we could not assess compliance with the prescribed drugs. Due to these limitations, we could not evaluate how the duration, dosage and compliance of drug use affect the observed inverse association of TNF inhibitors with dementia risk. Second, patients in the VA EHR database are predominately men (90.4%), and 25.5% of population lacked information on race, which prevent generalizability of these results to women and diverse ethnic groups. Third, we were unable to control some known risk factors for dementia/AD, such as education and APOE4 status, due to lack of this information in the database. In addition, data on smoking, a potential risk factor for dementia/AD, was often missing (50.7%). Fourth, dementia and AD diagnosis were solely based on ICD codes, which may lead to under-, mis- or over-diagnoses, especially for prodromal early stages of the disease.54 An additional limitation may come from propensity score matching. Though patient matching can make distributions of covariates more balanced to avoid many confounders, we still could miss some unobserved and unmeasured confounders due to the observational nature of the study design itself, which could lead to increase the data imbalance and bias instead.55 Fifth, while our study used standard statistical analyses for cohort studies, it will benefit from additional sensitivity analysis as well as negative control analysis. Finally, this study is associational, not causal. Validation of our findings in other population is needed and mechanistic understanding of this potential long-term effect may identify new drug targets for dementia/AD.

5 Conclusions

In summary, our study provides further evidence that TNF inhibitor use is associated with reduced dementia/AD risk in patients with RA. More importantly, our findings indicated that TNF inhibitor use may have a long-term protective effect on dementia/AD development. Further investigation of the mechanism and potential therapeutic use of TNF inhibitors in delay of dementia/AD is warranted.

Research in Context

Systematic review:

We reviewed the literature using PubMed up to 2021 and identified several studies examining the association between TNF inhibitor use and incidence of dementia. These studies showed overall benefit of TNF inhibitor use on dementia, but were limited in short follow-up time. Long-term effects of TNF inhibitor use on dementia/AD risk remains unknown.

Interpretation:

We leveraged the long follow-up available for patients in the US Veterans’ Health Affairs. In this population, TNF inhibitor use is associated with reduced dementia/AD risk during up to 20 years of follow-up, suggesting that TNF inhibitors have long-term effect and supporting the rationale for studying their therapeutic potential in reducing dementia/AD risk in patients with RA.

Future directions:

Validation of our findings in other population is needed. Understanding the mechanism of this long-term effect may identify new drug targets for dementia/AD.
