Senescent cells accumulate in various peripheral tissues during aging and have been shown to exacerbate age-related inflammatory responses. We recently showed that exposure to neurotoxic amyloid β (Aβ1–42) oligomers can readily induce a senescence phenotype in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). In the present work, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to further characterize the morphological properties such as cell membrane roughness and cell height and nanomechanical properties such as Young’s modulus of the membrane (membrane stiffness) and adhesion resulting from the interaction between AFM tip and cell membrane in Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescent human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Morphological imaging studies showed a flatter and spread-out nucleus in the senescent HBMECs, both characteristic features of a senescent phenotype. Furthermore, the mean cell body roughness and mean cell height were lower in senescent HBMECs compared to untreated normal HBMECs. We also observed increased stiffness and alterations in the adhesion properties in Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescent endothelial cells compared to the untreated normal HBMECs suggesting dynamic reorganization of cell membrane. We then show that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) knockdown or overexpression of Rho GTPase Rac 1 in the endothelial cells inhibited senescence and reversed these nanomechanical alterations, confirming a direct role of these pathways in the senescent brain endothelial cells. These results illustrate that nanoindentation and topographic analysis of live senescent brain endothelial cells can provide insights into cerebrovascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.

1. Introduction

The term cellular senescence describes a condition in which the cells undergo irreversible cell cycle arrest in response to various stresses (1). Senescent cells have been shown to accumulate predominately in peripheral tissues during the aging process and in certain age-related conditions such as atherosclerosis and cancer (2, 3). And elimination of these senescent cells has been shown to improve age-related phenotypes (3). Cellular senescence results from damage to the DNA and from extensive cell passaging (4, 5). Both DNA damage response generated by the damage to telomeres and damage at non telomeric sites can induce senescence (6–8). Furthermore, mitogenic signals induced by high expression of certain proliferative genes, such as p53,p21 or p16INK4a can also activate cellular senescence (9, 10). Characteristic features of senescent cells include an increase in cell size and shape due to alterations in organelles such as mitochondria (11–13); modification in chromatin organization (14); increased accumulation of pH-dependent β-galactosidase in lysosomes (15, 16) and upregulation of specific markers of senescence, including p16Ink4a, p53, p21, macroH2A, phosphorylated p38MAPK, and various pro-inflammatory cytokines (4, 17–21).

While senescence has been extensively studied in peripheral tissues, the contribution of senescence in the aging brain and in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has only been recently appreciated. A recent report showed that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells showed a senescent phenotype in the vicinity of deposited amyloid plaques both in AD brain tissues and in brain sections using an AD mouse model (22). Similarly, in tau transgenic mice, a model for human tauopathies, the authors demonstrated cellular senescence specifically in tau bearing microglia cells and astrocytes (23, 24). Using either genetic approaches or senolytic drugs, these studies showed that removal of the senescent glial cells improved pathology and behavioral deficits (22–24). Although aggregation and deposition of amyloid β peptides and tau in the brain are pathological hallmark features of AD, studies have shown that soluble amyloid β oligomeric peptides are highly neurotoxic in the AD brain (25, 26). We recently showed that exposure to the amyloid β (Aβ1–42) oligomers can readily induce a senescence phenotype in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs)(27). Furthermore, we showed that VEGFR-1 is highly upregulated in HBMECs following exposure to Aβ1–42 oligomers and overexpression of VEGFR-1 in HBMECs readily induced senescence by itself, whereas small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of VEGFR-1 expression reduced the induction of senescence after Aβ1–42 oligomer treatment, suggesting a direct role of VEGFR-1 expression and signaling events in this paradigm (27). To our best knowledge, AFM characterization of Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescent brain ECs has never been studied before.

AFM has been an attractive tool to characterize high resolution cellular structures and processes. AFM has been previously used to characterize nanomechanical properties that can serve as a distinguishing signature between cancer and normal cells (28, 29). Although different techniques have been utilized to identify senescent cells (30, 31), these techniques require staining and fixation of cells, which may alter the cellular integrity. On the contrary, AFM needs no additional staining and fixation, allowing live cell analysis while maintaining cellular integrity. In the present study, we induced senescence in HBMECs using Aβ1–42 oligomers as described previously (27) and then used AFM to further characterize morphological changes in and the nanomechanical alterations in the cell membrane of the senescent HBMECs. We used peak force quantitative nanomechanical mapping (PFQNM) and nanoindentation technique to study the morphological and nanomechanical changes, respectively. We further quantified the morphological properties such as cell membrane roughness and cell height as well as nanomechanical properties such as Young’s modulus and adhesion. We observed a significant reduction in cell height and membrane roughness in the senescent HBMECs compared to the untreated normal HBMECs. We also showed that senescent HBMECs were stiffer than the untreated normal HBMECs. Furthermore, nanomechanical characterization of the senescent HBMECs in these studies confirmed the role of VEGFR-1 and Rac 1 in Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescence.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Cell culture

The human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs, #ACBRI 376), attachment factor and cell culture media were purchased from the Cell Systems (Kirkland, WA, U.S). HBMECs at an early passage (p4) with cell confluency upto ~70–80% were used for all experiments. Aβ1–42 oligomers were prepared and characterized as previously described (32–35) and were a kind gift from Dr. Rosenberry (Mayo Clinic, Florida). For Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescence experiments, HBMECs were treated with 5 μM Aβ1–42 oligomers and incubated in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 maintained at 37°C for seven days. For Rac 1 inhibition studies, HBMECs were cultured with Rac 1 inhibitor (NSC 23766, Sigma Aldrich) overnight in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 maintained at 37°C.

2.2 Retrovirus transfection

Retroviruses expressing LacZ was prepared and used as previously described (36). To overexpress Rac 1, HBMECs were transfected with retrovirus containing the constitutively active form of small GTPases Rac 1 (Rac 1 QL) for twenty-four hours. After twenty-four hours of transfection, cells were treated with 5 μM Aβ 1–42 oligomers for seven days. The cells were then fixed and subjected to senescence specific β-galactosidase staining as described earlier (27).

2.3 Senescence associated β-galactosidase

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity in HBMECs was monitored according to the manufacturer’s protocol (#9860S, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA, U.S). Briefly, cells were fixed using the fixing solution provided with the kit and stained with the β-galactosidase solution. To quantify the cells stained for senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, we imaged all cells by keeping the imaging parameters constant and counted them using ImageJ software. Phase contrast image was acquired by using the EVOS microscope purchased from Life technology (Carlsbad, CA, U.S.) All the images were acquired using 40X objective. The experiment was conducted three different times. Percentage of senescent cells was the total number of senescent cells divided by the total number of cells counted (n=200 cells/well, 5 different wells/experimental group were used).

2.4 Real time PCR

Total RNA was extracted from the cells using RNAesy kit (Qiagen, MD, U.S.) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. One μg of total RNA was reversely transcribed, and cDNA was synthesized using cDNA synthesis kit with varying reaction conditions: 25° for 5 minutes, 46° for 20 minutes and 95° for 1 minute (iSscript, Biorad). One μL of the cDNA was used as a template and the PCR reaction was performed using Power Sybr Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), on the 7500 PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 40 cycles of amplification at 95°C for 15 seconds and 55°C for 1 minute.

2.5 Western blot

The cells were collected and lysed in the ice cold lysis buffer (NP40) mixed with protease inhibitor (Boston Bioproduct, MA, U.S.). Total protein was extracted and stored in −80°C. The extracts were mixed with 6X sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer and boiled for 5 minutes. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. Membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 hour at room temperature and then washed with TBST, and probed with primary antibodies including Flt-1 (sc-316, Santa Cruz biotech, Dallas, Texas, U.S. and Rac 1 (sc-95, Santa Cruz biotech, Dallas, Texas, U.S.) overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed again with TBST and incubated at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies including anti-rabbit IgG (#7074, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA, U.S) and anti-mouse IgG (#7076, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA, U.S.) for 1 hour. The proteins were visualized using ChemiDoc ™ Touch (Bio Rad) with an enhanced chemiluminesence detection kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories. Hercules, CA, U.S.). Actin was used as a gel loading control (A2228, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.). Three independent experiments were conducted with cell lysates collected from three independent cell based assays.

2.6 The siRNA sequences designing and Transfection

Four different human VEGFR-1 siRNA purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany), bearing the following sequences: 5’-TCGCCGGAAGTTGTATGGTTA-3’, 5’-CTGCCGGGTTACGTCACCTAA-3’, 5’-ACCGCATATGGTATCCCTCAA-3’ and 5’-TAGACCTTTCGTAGAGATGTA-3’. Each siRNA was resuspended in double distilled water and the stock solutions (20 μM) were stored at −20°C. Six-well plates were used to culture 4×105 HBMECs. For each well, 20 μL of siRNA was mixed with 150 μL of Opti-MEM medium. This mixture was then combined with a solution of 6 μL oligofectamin in 30 μL Opti-MEM medium followed by vortex and 20 minutes incubation at room temperature. The mixture was then applied to the cells. After incubation for 4–6 hours at 37°C, Opti-MEM medium was replaced with complete medium. Cells were then cultured for an additional forty-eight hours at 37°C before analysis. After forty-eight hours of transfection, cells received 5 μM Aβ1–42 oligomers treatment for an additional seven days and then harvested for further analysis. This experiment was performed three different times to confirm the consistency in our results.

2.7 Atomic Force Microscopy

AFM was used to characterize the nanomechanical properties of normal and senescent HBMECs, pre- and post-treatment, using Dimension Icon head scanner with Scanasyst (Bruker Corp). For morphological experiments, PFQNM, a Bruker patented technology (Bruker Corp), was used to study the cellular surface topography of live HBMECs. Scanasystfluid probe with pyramidal tip (nominal tip raidus 20 nm) was employed for morphology studies. Such a sharp tip provided a low surface area for tip-cell interaction, thus the consequence of cell surface adhesion on the tip was minimal. For this study, calibration of the probe is not mandatory. However, the laser was aligned accurately on the reflective surface of the cantilever, which improved the tip’s response to the sudden topographic changes occurring on the cell membrane. For accurate tracking of the morphological features, a scan rate of 0.1 Hz was used along with a low-force set point of 200 pN to avoid damage to the live cell and to minimize the probability of tip contamination. A total of 4 cells were chosen for each treatment to study the morphological characteristics.

The nanoindentation procedure was performed on the live cells with a PFQNM-LC-A-CAL probe, which was calibrated before the experiments. The spring constant and deflection sensitivity of 0.0172 N/m and 31.4 nm/V, respectively, were determined by ramping on an empty surface of a 60 mm cell culture plate filled with Milli-Q water. This calibration step also compensated for hydrodynamic resistance exhibited by the fluid on the tip. Poisson ratio for soft-cell samples was assumed to be 0.3 and used for the purpose of analysis (37). Nanoindentation technique was used to characterize nanomechanical properties of cells corresponding to various treatments. For nanoindentation experiments, peak force tapping amplitude sensitivity was calibrated at 1 kHz. To achieve homogeneity, we chose a 500 × 50 nm2 scan region over the nuclear membrane for indentation. Each ramping experiment on a cell enabled acquisition of 10 individual data points, corresponding to individual locations within the 500 × 50 nm2 scan region. In ramp mode, optimization of ramping parameters such as ramp size, ramp rate, samples per ramp, and applied force was accomplished before collection of the relevant force-separation curves (38). This allowed us to acquire accurate force-separation curves resulting from the tip-sample interaction and to ascertain that the deformations resulting from indentation were within the acceptable limits. Thus, an optimal ramp size of 4 μm, ramp rate of 1 Hz, 2,048 samples per ramp and an applied force of 50 pN, were used to indent the nuclear membrane region. For studying the nanomechanical properties, a sample size of 12 cells was chosen. All experiments were performed at 37°C, maintained with use of a temperature monitor (Lake Shore Cryotronics, Inc), to mimic the in vivo conditions.

2.8 Data analysis

Bruker’s Nanoscope Analysis 1.9 software was used to quantify the force curves. At such a low indentation force, a considerable noise was observed. To minimize the noise in force-separation curves, boxcar filter was implemented, followed by baseline correction. Hertzian fit model was selected on the retrace curve resulting from the retraction of the tip from the cell surface to evaluate nanomechanical properties. Origin Pro Lab software was used for statistical analysis and graphical plots. For statistical significance, the original sample set failed to meet normal distribution criteria and hence, we employed nonparametric Kruskal Wallis test followed by Bonferroni correction for paired dataset. For AFM experiments, nanomechanical properties were evaluated from a sample dataset of 12 cells, each cell was indented 10 times accumulating a total of 120 force-separation curves for each treatment. Surface roughness and height of the cells corresponding to each treatment was evaluated from a sample set of 4 cells. The nanomechanical properties and morphology quantification is represented in the form of box plots. All non-AFM related tests were done in triplicates and the corresponding results were explained as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The results were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA, USA). Students’ t-test was performed on western blot data, qRT-PCR and β-galactosidase staining to compare between two different groups. Statistical differences were determined to be significant at P, &lt; 0.05.

3. Results

3.1 AFM morphology studies on untreated HBMEC and Aβ1–42 oligomer treated HBMECs

We we had previously reported that exposure to high molecular weight Aβ1–42 oligomers readily induced a senescent phenotype in brain endothelial cells (27). Furthermore, we showed that VEGFR-1 was highly upregulated in HBMECs following treatment with Aβ1–42 oligomers and knockdown of VEGFR-1 significantly reduced Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescence in the HBMECs, suggesting a key role of VEGRF-1 expression and signaling in this paradigm. In this present work, HBMECs were treated with 5 μM high molecular weight Aβ1–42 oligomers for seven days to induced senescence and we then performed morphological and nanomechanical characterization of the senescent HBMECs using AFM. Untreated HBMECs were used as control group. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1A and S1B, HBMECs exposed to Aβ1–42 oligomers showed increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining (&gt;60% compared to ~23% in controls), confirming a senescent phenotype. To further examine the role of VEGFR-1 in senescence induction, we then performed siRNA mediated VEGFR-1 knockdown as before (Fig. S2A and S2B) and confirmed that the siRNA mediated VEGFR-1 knockdown reduced senescence in the Aβ1–42 oligomer-treated HBMECs as measured by β-galactosidase staining (Fig. S1C and S1D). Using optical microscopy, we observed that the morphology of β-galactosidase positive Aβ1–42 oligomer treated HBMECs displayed a mixed population of normal appearing cells as well as enlarged cells with a flatter and spread-out nucleus, the latter being a characteristic feature of senescent cells (39, 40). Fig. 1A – 1D shows representative images of the cell morphology of the HBMECs from all groups. The color scheme for all the morphology images was kept constant and various shades indicate various heights ranging from - 2.5 μm to +2.5 μm with bright color indicating +2.5 μm as seen from Fig. 1A – 1D. Additional representative images are shown in Fig. S4. A total of 4 cells were chosen for each treatment. We then analyzed the mean cell body roughness resulting from membrane ruffling over the nucleus with Nanoscope analysis software and plotted as shown in Fig. 1E. The mean cell body roughness over the nucleus was found to be the lowest in Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescent HBMECs, compared to all other groups (Fig 1E). We then analyzed the overall cellular height in the Aβ1–42 treated senescent HBMECs and observed the height to be the lowest as shown from the height profile quantification in Fig. 1F, compared to all other groups. We also show that, there was no significant change in cell body roughness, between VEGFR-1 knockdown HBMECs and VEGFR-1 knockdown followed by Aβ1–42 oligomer treated HBMECs, However, we observed a significant change in cell body roughness in VEGFR-1 knockdown HBMECs and VEGFR-1 knockdown followed by Aβ1–42 oligomer treated HBMECs compared to untreated HBMECs. On the other hand, we see a significant reduction in peak cell height between untreated and Aβ1–42 oligomer treated HBMECs as well as VEGFR-1 knockdown HBMECs and VEGFR-1 knockdown followed by Aβ1–42 oligomer treated HBMECs. However, we observed no significant change in cell height in VEGFR-1 knockdown followed by Aβ1–42 oligomer treatment compared to untreated HBMECs. Taken together, these results show that VEGFR-1 knockdown inhibits the flattening of HBMECs nucleus suggesting that VEGFR-1 knockdown reduces senescence in HBMECs.

3.2 Force-separation curves

AFM’s nanoindentation technique involves bringing the tip close to the sample; thereupon it overcomes the Van Der Wall’s force of attraction to make contact with the sample. The force applied on the piezo causes it to indent into the sample and retract. One cycle of extension into the sample and retraction from the sample yields a force-separation curve. Each indentation results into a distinct force-separation curve. For accurate account of nanomechanical properties, 12 cells each with 10 force-separation curves were acquired from 10 different regions over the cell membrane covering the nucleus were considered for various treatments. Fig. 2A – 2D shows a representative force-separation curves resulting from a single cell for each treatment. Optimization of the ramping parameters is absolutely essential in acquiring force-separation curves based on accurate tip-sample interaction as we have shown in our previous study (38). PFQNM LC A CAL probe bearing a spherical tip was employed to provide more surface area and to accurately yield a force-separation curve. A force of 50 pN was sufficient to yield a force-separation curve with complete retraction as evident from the y-axis. The x-axis represents the separation of the z-piezo from the cell surface controlled by ramp size. The complete retraction was evident from the overlap between the trace and retrace baseline values. The hysteresis between the trace and retrace curve was minimal indicating very minimal energy dissipation and the tip closely follows its path during trace and retrace proceedings. Right before the tip retracts from the sample surface, it experiences an adhesive force indicated by the sudden drop in force value yielding adhesion as can be seen from Fig. 2A – 2D. Moreover, the double slope as seen from Fig. 2D suggests two different membrane layers interacting with the tip when it is retracting. We also observed identical nature of these force-separation curves corresponding to a particular treatment (data not shown) indicating homogeneity in indentation region within a single cell.

3.3 Young’s modulus evaluation in HBMECs for various treatments

Young’s modulus, a measure of membrane stiffness is a characteristic property exploited by researchers from the force-separation curves. A 500 × 50 nm2 region was chosen over the membrane covering the nucleus region to minimize the variations in the tip-sample interaction due to the variable nature of cyto-membrane. Very less deviation from the mean value for all the treatments confirm the compact nature of the force-separation curves resulting from various indentations. The Hertzian contact model was used to analyze the retrace curve to calculate the membrane elasticity. Untreated HBMECs exhibited an average Young’s modulus of 618.19 ± 44.28 Pa as shown in Fig. 3A. We then performed nanoindentation experiment using AFM on Aβ1–42 oligomer treated normal appearing cells and the flatter appearing cells. We observed distinct segregation in the Young’s modulus between the flatter HBMECs and normal HBMECs. There was no significant variation in Young’s modulus between the normal appearing Aβ1–42 oligomer treated HBMECs (Fig. S3) and the untreated HBMECs (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the Young’s modulus of the flatter cells was distinct compared to the normal appearing HBMECs (Fig 3). Taking into consideration these characteristic differences in Young’s modulus, we chose the flatter cells for further AFM studies. Fig. 3B – 3D represents Young’s modulus distribution for 12 cells in each treatment. The indentation by spherical probes caused an average deformation of 175.84 ± 28.78 nm in untreated HBMECs, less than 10% of the cellular height as seen from Fig. S5A. Untreated HBMECs exhibited an average adhesion of 7.25 ± 2.61 pN as shown in S6A. The Young’s modulus value bodes well with the already published literature (41). The Young’s modulus value and the deformation together, provide a true measure of elasticity values of nuclear membrane region of HBMECs. These cells were treated to knockdown VEGFR-1 to serve as a positive control set. We observed the average Young’s modulus to be 597.21 ± 13.17 Pa and adhesion to be 5.1 ± 0.91 pN as seen from Fig. 3B and S6B, respectively. In order to cause senescence, HBMECs were treated with Aβ1–42 oligomers. These cells were then subjected to nanoindentation process. The senescent cells exhibited Young’s modulus and adhesion values to be 716 ± 26.45 Pa and 5.27 ± 1.33 pN respectively as seen from Fig. 3C and S6C. Further, VEGFR-1 knockdown HBMECs were treated with Aβ1–42 oligomers and were subjected to nanoindentation technique. These cells manifested an average Young’s modulus and adhesion of 649.19 ± 7.70 Pa and 3.72 ± 0.66 pN, respectively as seen in the Fig. 3D and S6D.

3.4 Rac 1 dependent senescence in HBMECs

Rac 1 is a signaling protein belonging to the Rac subfamily of the Rho GTPases. Rac 1 predominantly occurs in plasma membrane as mentioned in the earlier studies and its alteration leads to changes in actin cytoskeleton (42, 43). Furthermore, AFM studies coupled with confocal microscopy relate increased membrane stiffness to cytoskeletal reorganization of membrane proteins (44, 45). Herein, the expression of Rac 1 in Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescence cells with or without VEGFR-1 knockdown was determined with western blot analysis as shown in Fig. 4A. Quantification of the western blot showed a significant reduction in Rac 1 protein levels in the senescent HBMECs (~40–50% reduction compared to untreated controls (Fig. 4B). We then determine whether VEGFR-1 knockdown can rescue Rac 1 expression levels in the senenscent HBMECs. As shown in Fig. 4B, we monitored Rac 1 levels in the HBMECs treated with both VEGFR-1 siRNA and Aβ1–42 oligomer, and observed ~20 % rescue in the expression of Rac 1 whereas no rescue was observed in the control siRNA treated HBMECs as seen from Fig. 4B. This data demonstrates that without VEGFR-1, Aβ1–42 oligomer treatment alone cannot reduce Rac 1 expression and hence protect the HBMECs against senenscence induction. To further examine the role of Rac 1 expression in sencenscence, we then treated HBMECs with 50 μM Rac 1 inhibitor NSC 23766 and performed β-galactosidase staining after seven days. Quantification of β-galactosidase positive HBMECs showed a significant increase in β-galactosidase staining following Rac 1 inhibition (~25% compared to untreated control group as shown in Fig 4C and 4D), suggesting that Rac 1 inhibition plays a critical role in senescence induction in the HBMECs. We then examined the Young’s modulus of Rac 1 inhibited cells based on the force-separation curves as shown in the Fig. 4E and Fig. 4F. The force-separation curves exhibited a complete retraction of the tip from the cell membrane. The adhesive force experienced by the tip from Rac 1 inhibited senescent cell surface membrane is clearly visible during the retraction phase in Fig. 4E. The homogeneity in force-separation curves was confirmed by consistency in the measured Young’s modulus within a cell for all 12 cells as seen from Fig. 4F. Fig. S7A ensured that the 2–10% deformation of the overall cell height criteria was met to avoid any permanent damage to the cell. The average Young’s modulus measured for Rac 1 inhibited HBMECs was calculated to be 901.73 ± 27.97 Pa and the average adhesion was 7.31 ± 2.58 pN as seen in Fig. S7B. The stiffness values are similar to the Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescence cells with minor discrepancy, which could be due to the different passages of cells. We also determined whether the force-separation curve and corresponding nanomechanical properties of Rac 1 inhibited HBMECs is Rac 1 concentration dependent. With 25 μM concentration of Rac 1 inhibitor, no significant change in the average Young’s modulus (911.51 ± 25.60 Pa) acquired from the force-separation curves (a representative curve shown in Fig. S8A) was observed as seen from Fig. S8B. The deformation limit of 2–10% was strictly followed while analyzing the force-separation curve as shown in Fig. S8C. However, we observed a decrease in average adhesion (4.05 ± 1.19 pN) compared to 50 μM as shown in Fig. S7B and S8D.

3.5 Overexpression of Rac 1 in HBMECs reduces senescence

To further define the role of Rac 1 in Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescence in HBMECs, we conducted a Rac 1 rescue experiment. HBMECs were transfected with LacZ (control) for twenty-four hours followed by Aβ1–42 oligomer treatment for seven days. To overexpress Rac 1, HBMECs were transfected with retrovirus containing the constitutively active form of small GTPases Rac 1 (Rac 1 QL) for twenty-four hours followed by Aβ1–42 oligomers treatment for seven days Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Rac 1 as shown in Fig. 5A – 5B. For control, HBMECs transfected with LacZ retrovirus was subjected to β-galactosidase staining as shown in Fig. 5C. Fig. 5D shows a representative image of β-galactosidase stained HBMECs transfected with LacZ for twenty-four hours followed by Aβ1–42 oligomer treatment for seven days. Fig. 5E shows a representative image of β-galactosidase stained HBMECs overexpressed with Rac 1 and followed by Aβ1–42 oligomer treatment for seven days. We further quantified the percentage of β-galactosidase positive stained cells in Rac 1 overexpressed and control cells (Fig 5C – 5E) as shown in Fig. 5F. More than 50% cells were positive for β-galactosidase staining in HBMECs treated with LacZ followed by Aβ1–42 oligomers compared to LacZ alone. On the other hand, only 33% positive β-galactosidase staining was observed for Rac 1 overexpressed and Aβ1–42 oligomer treated HBMECs indicating reduction of senescence upon Rac 1 overexpression.

3.6 Comparative analysis of the nanomechanical properties for various treatments

The comparative analysis of the nanomechanical properties such as the Young’s modulus, adhesion and deformation is shown in Fig. 6A – 6C. The calculated change in Young’s modulus was not significant between untreated HBMECs and the VEGFR-1 siRNA treated HBMECs (Fig 6A), however, there was a significant change in adhesion values in the HBMECs post VEGFR-1 knockdown compared to untreated HBMECs (Fig 6C). The Aβ1–42 oligomer treated senescent HBMECs were observed to be stiffer compared to the normal HBMECs (Fig 6A). Interestingly, Rac 1 inhibited HBMECs were found to be significantly stiffer compared to all other groups (Fig 6A). On the other hand, there was no significant change in the adhesion values between Rac 1 inhibited HBMECs and Aβ1–42 oligomer treated senescent HBMECs (Fig 6C). Decrease in adhesion in the VEGFR-1 knockdown HBMECs treated with Aβ1–42 oligomers compared to untreated HBMECs was observed to be highly significant (Fig 6C). Although the Young’s modulus exhibited by VEGFR-1 knockdown followed by Aβ1–42 oligomer treatment displayed significant change from the untreated HBMECs, the cells were not observed to be as stiff as the senescent cells (Fig 6A) VEGFR-1 knockdown in the Aβ1–42 oligomer treated senescent cells on the other hand, showed a significant change in Young’s modulus compared to VEGFR-1 deficient Aβ1–42 oligomer treated senescent cells (Fig 6A). We observed a significant change in adhesion levels for VEGFR-1 knockdown followed by Aβ1–42 treated senescent cells and VEGFR-1 knockdown HBMECs. During the force-separation curve analysis, special focus was given to the deformation values in each indentation experiment and was observed to be less than the cautioned value of 2–10% of the overall cell height as shown in Fig. 6B. These findings suggest (Fig. 6A and 6B) inverse relationship between Young’s modulus and deformation.

4. Discussion

To date, identification of a senescence phenotype in cells has relied on morphological changes as visualized with optical microscopy, staining for increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (16), and increased expression of several senescense-associated markers, such as p16, p21 and p53 (3, 46–48). High-resolution topography with nanometer level accuracy using AFM can provide additional information about the abnormal cellular morphology of senescent cells. We used AFM to study the morphological characteristics of Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescent HBMECs such as cell body roughness over the nucleus region and the cell’s overall height. The mean cell body roughness and the mean overall cell height were observed to be lowest in senescent HBMECs compared with all other treatments. Moreover, the recovery in cell height in VEGFR-1 knockdown cells exposed to Aβ1–42 oligomers suggests a direct role of VEGFR-1 expression in the morphological alterations seen in Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescent HBMECs consistent with our previous study (27). We further characterized these cells on the basis of their nanomechanical properties by using the force-separation curves, which measures Young’s modulus (stiffness), deformation and adhesion resulting from the tip-cell membrane interaction. We observed that the cell membrane of Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescent HBMECs were stiffer than untreated HBMECs. Interestingly, no significant change was observed in the adhesion levels between untreated normal and Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescent HBMECs, suggesting that the attractive force exerted by the cell membrane on the AFM tip as the tip was retracted was more or less similar. Further, we evaluated the role of Rac 1 in HBMEC senescence because Rac 1 is known to affect the cytoskeletal reorganization, which could increase the stiffness of cell membranes. We observed Rac 1 downregulation in Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescent HBMECs. Force-separation curves confirmed an increase in cell membrane stiffness of the Rac 1-inhibited HBMECs, suggesting an alteration in the cytoskeleton in senescent HBMECs. We also saw a significant decrease in membrane adhesion values in Rac 1-inhibited HBMECs compared to untreated HBMECs, suggesting a correlation with the stiffer membrane in Rac 1-inhibited senescence. We then showed that Rac 1 over-expression was able to rescue Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescence in HBMECs, further confirming direct role of Rac 1 in the induction of senescence in HBMECs. Our work demonstrates that AFM is an important tool to study the morphology and nanomechanical properties changes such as cell surface roughness, cellular height, Young’s modulus and adhesion in live senescent cells without any fixation or additional labeling.

To obtain well resolved morphology, selection of the AFM probes is essential. Pyramidal tip geometry is the most acceptable choice because it possesses a sharper tip radius and stiffer cantilevers that assist with accurate tracking of surface topography and overcoming hydrodynamic resistance (38, 49, 50), respectively leading to a better quality of morphology image. On the contrary, the choice of pyramidal probe can be detrimental to maintain integrity of heterogeneous cell surface (38). Moreover, during scanning, the interaction between the AFM probe and cell surface can contaminate the probe. This can effectively reduce signal to noise ratio and result in poor image acquisition. A perfect balance between force set point and feedback gain is essential to obtain the underrepresented membrane topography details. Besides membrane morphology, this technique enables us to extract cellular height and cell body roughness of the membrane over the nucleus region. The roughness corresponds to mean square root value of the height variations in membrane topography. Previously it was shown that surface membrane proteins and lipid layer contribute to the dynamic heterogeneity in the plasma membrane of living cells (51) and form membrane ruffles (52), which is one of the key contributors that influence the cell body roughness. Similarly, dynamic alteration in plasma membranedue to actin filaments and microtubule reorganization in aging cells have been previously reported (53, 54). Our data suggests that senescence can regulate dynamic reorganization of HBMEC membrane. A significant reduction of cellular height over the nucleus was recorded in senescent cells compared with untreated cells and this could be attributed to the degradation of DNA. Previous studies have shown that senescence cells exhibit DNA damage with chromatin alterations (55). Both the VEGFR-1 knockdown HBMECs and the VEGFR-1 knockdown HBMECs treated with Aβ1–42 oligomers had similar morphological traits with normal untreated HBMECs, suggestive that VEGFR-1 knockdown by itself had no effect on morphological changes. Moreover, the recovery in cell height and reduced stiffness in VEGFR-1 knockdown cells followed by Aβ1–42 treatment clearly suggests a role of VEGFR-1 expression in Aβ1–42 oligomer–induced senescence, as we described previously (27). These results establish a strong case for AFM as a topographic scanning tool to distinguish between normal and senescent HBMECs.

To acquire the nanomechanical properties such as Young’s modulus and adhesion from the force-separation curves, an admissible nanoindentation isrequired. During this process, sharp tips of pyramidal geometry are not recommended as it often damages the cells and influence the measurement of nanomechanical properties (38, 56, 57). On the contrary, probes with spherical geometry have a large surface area, resulting in equal distribution of the force as the tip comes in contact with the cell surface and avoid any further damage to the cell membrane (38). In the present study, we employed Hertzian model on the retrace curve because the indentation in the cell surface was comparable to the tip radius. The Hertzian model (58) is described as the following: (1) F=(43)(YM1−ϑ2)Rδ32

F equals force that corresponds to the applied trigger threshold on the z-piezo. ϑ refers to the Poisson ratio, R to the radius of the tip, and δ to indentation and YM is the Young’s modulus. We further optimized ramping parameters to maintain indentation depth or deformation within the 2–10% of the cell height (a criteria to use Hertzian model) and a complete retraction of the tip from the cell surface post indentation was allowed (59, 60). Some minimal hysteresis was observed in the force-separation curves and can be attributed to the viscoelastic nature of the cells (60, 61). Nanomechanical property such as Young’s modulus is often extracted from the force-separation curve and is a measure of stiffness of the membrane. In this work, senescent cells subjected to Aβ1–42 oligomer treatment were observed to be significantly stiffer than the normal HBMECs. This behavior is consistent with aging cells that tend to become stiffer with time (2, 62, 63).

The use of AFM to study endothelial cell biology is well documented. AFM has been used to evaluate leukocyte egress through EC and in tumor cell-EC interactions (64–66). Studies of human aortic endothelial cells with AFM have shown an increase in elasticity over time; ultimately reaching a steady state, a phenomenon caused by shrinkage of the endothelial cells cytoskeleton (57). Increased membrane stiffness has been attributed to cytoskeletal reorganization (67, 68). This reorganization includes dynamic changes in actin and vimentin filaments, as well as microtubule reorganization, all of which can affect membrane stiffness (62, 69). Deletion of Rac 1 by gene targeting has been shown to result in early senescence in human embryonic fibroblast cells (70). Another AFM study confirmed the role of Ras homologue RhoA in senescent monkey chorioretinal endothelial cells (71). The researchers observed an increase in membrane stiffness in senescent chorioretinal cells and this increased stiffness was reduced with treatment with Y27632, a pharmacologic inhibitor of Rho/ROCK activity. In addition, AFM was used to demonstrate increased rigidity/stiffness in senescent human foreskin epithelial cells in response to aging (72). In this study, the researchers used a force-volume technique, to study the elasticity changes. The force-volume mode procedure involves force-separation curves corresponding to each pixel in the selected region of interest. At times, these force-separation curves can provide inaccurate data because of erroneous tip-sample interaction (73). A follow-up study by Sokolov’s group determined that inhibition of F-actin microfilament polymerization with cytochalasin B restored the elasticity in human foreskin epithelial cells (74). A previous study described the role of Rac 1 in promoting cell survival and regulation of cell cycle and also their contribution in cell fate determination by apoptosis (75). In our study, we show that in Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescent HBMECs, Rac 1 protein levels were reduced compared to untreated HBMECssuggesting a potenital role in Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced scenescence. To confirm whether Rac 1 plays a role in senescene, we treated Aβ1–42 oligomer HBMECs with NSC 23766, a pharmacologic Rac 1 inhibitor and showed that in the Rac 1 inhibited senescent cells, there was increased β-galactosidase staining, again suggesting a direct role of Rac 1 in Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescence in HBMECs. We then used AFM to analyze morphological and nanomechanical changes in the Rac 1 inhibited senescent cells and showed that Rac 1 inhibited HBMECs had increased stiffness and decreased adhesion values, similar to Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescenct HBMECs. To further deliniate the role of Rac 1 in Aβ1–42 oligomer-inducedsenescence, we performed a Rac 1 rescue experiment, where we showed that overexpression of Rac 1 can significantly reduce the Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescence in HBMECs. Our results show, for the first time, that Aβ1–42 oligomer induces senescence in HBMECs through a Rac 1 dependent pathway.

Previous neuroimaging studies in individuals with mild cognitive impairment have shown blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in the hippocampus (76). These studies were validated recently by the same group using a novel cerebrospinal fluid biomarker, namely, soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β and they measured BBB permeability using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. In this study, individuals with early cognitive impairment showed brain capillary damage in the hippocampus irrespective of Aβ and/or tau changes (77). These studies indicate BBB breakdown as a potential early pathologic event in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), however the mechanisms or initiators of the BBB breakdown remain unclear. Multiple studies have examined potential neuronal toxicities associated with soluble Aβ oligomers isolated from the AD brain (65, 78–80). Soluble Aβ oligomers have been shown to inhibit long-term potentiation through excessive activation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors (78). Aβ oligomers have also been shown to bind to the cellular prion protein (PrPc) and disrupt synaptic function in neurons (81). Aβ oligomers have also been shown to directly interact with cell membranes, causing the formation of pores and disrupting membrane permeability leading to cellular toxicities (65). Other studies have demonstrated channel formation on the cell membrane due to Aβ oligomer binding, resulting in elevations of cytosolic calcium levels (82). However, the detrimental effects of Aβ oligomers on endothelial cell function are not well documented. One study showed that endothelial cells exposed to Aβ peptides had anti-angiogenic effects and this effect was attributed to direct binding of the Aβ peptide to VEGFR-2, thus antagonizing VEGFR-2 signaling (83). Thus, it is possible that direct binding of Aβ oligomers to VEGF receptors on the endothelial cell membrane could alter the nanomechanical properties of the endothelial cell membrane observed in our study. In addition, a previous report showed that in senescent vascular cells, tight junction protein expression and coverage in endothelial cells was altered (84), suggesting that these changes could lead to endothelial cells dysfunction. Indeed, a recent paper showed that tight junction protein levels, such as claudin-5 and occluding are reduced in AD brain compared to aged matched normal controls (85). Thus, one possible consequence of the nanomechanical alterations seen in the senescent endothelial cells is aberrant tight junction protein coverage on the cell membrane, potentially leading to endothelial cell dysfunction. Our data provide mechanistic insight related to endothelial cell dysfunction/senescence and BBB dysfunction in AD. According to our data, presence of toxic soluble Aβ oligomers during the disease process could bind and activate aberrant VEGF receptor expression in endothelial cells, leading to brain endothelial cell senescence and nanomechanical alterations, ultimately leading to endothelial cells dysfunction and BBB failure.

5. Conclusion

We have successfully used AFM for the first time to characterize Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescent HBMECs. Characteristic senescence features, such a flatter and well-spread nucleus were observed through topographic mapping with the use of AFM. Further, the nanomechanical property such as the Young’s modulus was observed to be significantly more in the Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced senescent cells than the normal HBMECs. Our findings indicate a possible direct role of both VEGFR-1 and Rac 1 expression and corresponding signaling events in mediating cellular senescence in the Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced HBMECs.

In summary, our data provides mechanistic insight related to early endothelial cell dysfunction/senescence and BBB dysfunction in AD. According to our data, in addition to other comorbid factors including age related factors, presence of toxic soluble Aβ oligomers could activate aberrant VEGF receptor expression in brain endothelial cells and alter Rac 1 signaling, leading to endothelial cell senescence and nanomechanical alterations in the endothelial cell membrane, ultimately leading to endothelial cell dysfunction and BBB failure.
