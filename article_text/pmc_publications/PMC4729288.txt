Background and Purpose

Cerebral microbleeds are associated with aging, hypertension, and Alzheimer’s disease. Microbleeds in a lobar distribution are believed to reflect underlying amyloid angiopathy, whereas microbleeds in the deep gray matter and infratentorial brain are commonly seen with hypertension. However, it is unknown how microbleeds in either distribution are related to Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. The purpose of this analysis was to test whether lobar and deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds demonstrate differential associations with CSF beta-amyloid, CSF p-tau, and longitudinal cognitive decline.

Materials and Methods

626 subjects - 151 cognitively normal, 389 with mild cognitive impairment, and 86 with Alzheimer’s disease - from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative who had 3 Tesla MRI scans and a lumbar puncture were included in the analysis. The number and location of microbleeds were visually assessed. Associations between lobar or deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds with levels of CSF beta-amyloid, abnormal CSF p-tau, and longitudinal cognitive decline were assessed using ordinary least squares, logistic, and mixed-effects regression models, adjusting for covariates.

Results

Having three or more lobar microbleeds are associated with lower levels of CSF beta-amyloid (p=0.001). Adjusting for CSF beta-amyloid, lobar microbleeds are independently associated with a higher likelihood of having an abnormal CSF p-tau level (p=0.004). Lobar microbleeds are associated with accelerated longitudinal cognitive decline (p=0.007). Deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds demonstrated no significant associations.

Conclusion

Microbleed distribution demonstrated different associations with amyloid, tau, and cognition. Lobar and deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds should be considered separately with regards to Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis.


Background and Purpose

Cerebral microbleeds are common findings on gradient-echo (GRE) and susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, typically associated with aging, hypertension, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Approximately 36% of people over the age of 80 have microbleeds, compared to only 7% of people who are 45–50 years old.1 Hypertensive individuals are four times more likely than the general population to have microbleeds,2 particularly in association with other signs of small vessel disease, such as white matter hyperintensities and lacunar infarcts.3,4 People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have microbleeds with a reported prevalence of 20–43% in MCI and 18–32% in AD, compared to 0–19% in cognitively normal individuals.5 In the setting of AD, microbleeds are associated with global brain amyloidosis, seen with increased uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) scans using 18F-florbetapir (PiB)6 and decreased levels of CSF beta-amyloid.5

The anatomical distribution of microbleeds is believed to reflect their underlying pathology. Microbleeds located in the deep gray matter and infratentorial brain are typically seen in hypertensive individuals2,7 and correspond to foci of hemosiderin leakage from abnormal small blood vessels.8 Conversely, microbleeds in the setting of aging and AD are typically lobar, at the cortico-subcortical junction2,7 and correspond to beta-amyloid deposition along vessel walls,9 also known as amyloid angiopathy. However, it remains unclear whether microbleeds, either from hypertension or amyloid angiopathy, relate to tau pathology or cognitive changes leading to Alzheimer’s pathogenesis,10 independent of global brain amyloidosis.

The purpose of our analysis was to determine whether the distribution of microbleeds, either lobar or deep gray/infratentorial, may have differential associations with downstream events in Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. Specifically, using data from the multicenter Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (adni.loni.usc.edu),11 we tested the hypotheses that lobar microbleeds (1) are associated with brain amyloidosis, reflected by lower levels of CSF beta-amyloid, (2) predict the presence of tau pathology, adjusting for overall brain amyloidosis, and (3) predict greater longitudinal cognitive decline.

Materials and Methods

Subjects

The subjects of these analyses were ADNI participants who had 3 Tesla MRI scans and a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, resulting in 626 individuals - 151 cognitively normal, 389 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 86 with AD. The ADNI is a longitudinal, multicenter observational cohort study designed to identify imaging and biochemical biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of AD [12]. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all of the participating institutions. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants at each site. Subjects who enrolled in ADNI-2 and ADNI-grand opportunity underwent a T2* GRE sequence, which was used to enumerate the number of microbleeds in the brain. Subjects were between the ages of 55 and 90, without clinical or structural evidence of a significant neurological or psychiatric disease, and without systemic medical illness or laboratory abnormalities that would interfere with follow-up. Cognitive function was assessed using the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS),13 which is the most widely used measure for clinical trials.

The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California – San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2.

MR Image Acquisition

The 3 Tesla MRI protocol included T2* GRE and T1-weighted three-dimensional MPRAGE sequences, which have been described previously (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/documents/mri-protocols/). Microbleeds were quantified visually by a board-certified neuroradiologist with subspecialty certification (GCC). Microbleeds were defined as hypointense lesions within the brain parenchyma, measuring less than 10mm on the GRE sequence. Only microbleeds that were considered definite were included in the analysis.

Microbleeds were visually classified by location as (1) deep gray matter/infratentorial, if they involved the basal ganglia, thalami, brainstem, or cerebellum, or (2) lobar, if they involved other regions of the brain parenchyma.

CSF biomarkers

Subjects included in this analysis underwent lumbar puncture to obtain CSF samples for quantifying levels of CSF beta-amyloid (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau).14 Briefly, lumbar puncture was performed with a 20- or 24-gauge spinal needle at the baseline visit after an overnight fast. The CSF samples were then transferred into polypropylene transfer tubes, frozen on dry ice within an hour after collection, and shipped on dry ice overnight to a single designated laboratory. After thawing for 1 hour at room temperature and gentle mixing, 0.5 ml aliquots were prepared from these samples. The aliquots were then stored in bar code-labeled polypropylene vials at −80°C and measured using the xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX) with Innogenetics (INNOBIA AlzBio3, Ghent, Belgium) immunoassay kit-based reagents. Monoclonal antibodies specific for Abeta and p-tau were used as reagents, which have been found to be useful in predicting AD.15 CSF total tau was not included in this analysis because this value was not available for some of the participants. In addition, p-tau has a higher specificity and negative predictive value in ruling out the presence of AD with 90% probability.16

APOE genotyping

All participants underwent APOE genotyping at the baseline visit. Approximately 6 ml of blood were obtained from each participant in an EDTA tube, gently mixed by inversion, and shipped at ambient temperature to a single designated laboratory within 24 hours of collection for analysis for genotyping.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were programmed in STATA version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Comparisons of baseline variables among groups were performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fisher exact test, Kruskal Wallis test, and Chi squared test, depending on number of groups and type and distribution of variables.

To test the hypothesis that lobar microbleeds are associated with overall brain amyloidosis, we used ordinary least squares regression with age, gender, years of education, APOE2 and APOE4 status, and diagnostic group (NL, MCI, or AD) as covariates. CSF Abeta values were log-transformed for normality and included as the outcome variable. Lobar microbleeds was first dichotomized as 0 or 1, indicating presence or absence, and used as the predictor. The number of lobar microbleeds was then categorized as an ordinal variable of 0, 1, 2, 3, or greater than 3, to determine whether increasing numbers of lobar microbleeds were associated with greater brain amyloidosis, reflected by decreased CSF Abeta. The regressions were then repeated using deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds, categorized as dichotomous or ordinal variables, to differentiate between microbleeds that may be associated with hypertension and those associated with amyloid angiopathy.

To determine whether lobar microbleeds are associated with tau pathology, we used logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender, years of education, APOE2 and APOE4 status, and diagnostic group. CSF Abeta was also included as a covariate, dichotomized as normal or abnormal based on the previously published cutoff of 192 pg/ml,17 to determine the effect of microbleeds independent of global brain amyloidosis. We then dichotomized abnormal CSF p-tau using the cutoff of 23 pg/ml,17 which was used as the outcome variable. Lobar versus deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds were again included as the predictor, either as a dichotomous or ordinal variables.

To determine whether lobar microbleeds are associated with longitudinal change in cognition, we used a linear mixed-effects model: ADASij = (B0 + β0) + β1 MCHii + (β2 + β3 MCHii) tij + covariates + ɛij. ADASij represents the ADAS score of subject i at timepoint j, MCHi represents the presence or absence of lobar microbleeds in each subject, and tij represents the time interval between ADAS tests. (B0 + β0) are the coefficients for the random and fixed variations in baseline ADAS scores. The coefficient β1 represents the fixed effects of having lobar microbleeds at baseline. Finally, (β2 + β3) are the coefficients for time-dependent changes in ADAS scores, irrespective (β2) and respective (β3) of presence of microbleeds. The error term ɛij represents random noise.

Results

Subject characteristics are presented in Table 1. Four hundred and seven of the 626 (65%) subjects had no microbleeds, whereas 219 (35%) had at least 1 microbleed. Of the 219 subjects with microbleeds, 192 (87%) had at least 1 lobar microbleed and 27 (12%) had only deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds. As expected, subjects with microbleeds were older in age (p&lt;0.001).1 In addition, those with lobar microbleeds, either alone or in combination with deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds, had a greater proportion of APOE4 carriers (p=0.03), which has also been previously described.1

Having 3 or more lobar microbleeds are associated with levels of CSF Abeta, whereas deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds are not

Adjusting for covariates, having at least 1 lobar microbleed was associated with greater brain amyloidosis, reflected by lower CSF Abeta, although this association did not reach statistical significance (coeff=−0.04, p=0.08). However, accounting for increasing numbers of microbleeds, having three (coeff=−0.30, p=0.001) or more than three (coeff=−0.18, p=0.001) lobar microbleeds was also associated with lower levels of CSF Abeta (Table 2). Deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds were not associated with CSF Abeta (p=0.60), and increasing numbers of deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds also were not associated with CSF Abeta (p=0.27–0.99).

Lobar microbleeds are associated with a higher likelihood of having an abnormal CSF p-tau level, independent of CSF Abeta. Deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds are not associated with abnormal CSF p-tau levels

Using logistic regression, adjusting for the CSF Abeta level, having at least 1 lobar microbleed was associated with more than double the odds of having an abnormal CSF p-tau level (p=0.004). On the other hand, having deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds was not associated with abnormal CSF p-tau levels (p=0.97). Unlike with CSF Abeta, no dose-response relationship was visualized; having one lobar microbleed was most associated with an abnormal CSF p-tau level, with an odds ratio of 2.8 (p=0.001) (Table 3).

Lobar microbleeds are associated with accelerated longitudinal cognitive decline

Using a linear mixed-effects model and adjusting for covariates, including CSF Abeta level and diagnostic group, having at least 1 lobar microbleed was significantly associated with accelerated longitudinal change in ADAS scores (p=0.007) of 1.4 points per year compared to 0.8 points per year for those without lobar microbleeds. Furthermore, having more than 3 lobar microbleeds was significantly associated with an increase of 2.3 points per year (p&lt;0.001) (Table 4). Deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds were not associated with change in ADAS scores (p=0.31).

Discussion

The major findings of our analysis are: (1) having 3 or more lobar microbleeds are associated with global brain amyloidosis, whereas deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds are not, (2) lobar microbleeds, unlike deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds, are associated with elevated CSF p-tau, although without a dose-response relationship, and (3) lobar microbleeds, unlike deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds, are associated with accelerated longitudinal cognitive decline. Taken together, our analysis suggests a differential association of lobar versus deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds with Alzheimer’s pathogenesis, suggesting the importance of lobar microbleeds in prognostication, independent of CSF Abeta levels.

The first major finding that lobar microbleeds are associated with greater overall brain amyloidosis is concordant with prior studies that have shown lower CSF Abeta levels3,18,19 and higher uptake on PET amyloid scans5,6 in people with microbleeds. Prior papers have also suggested that microbleeds that are lobar in location are more suggestive of underlying amyloid angiopathy2,7,9, which is seen concomitantly in 78–98% of Alzheimer’s disease brains postmortem.20 The finding that only higher numbers of lobar microbleeds were found to be associated with CSF Abeta suggests that severe amyloid angiopathy is more related to overall brain amyloidosis and may contribute to the disease process. On the other hand, deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds, which are more typically associated with hypertension, were not associated with CSF Abeta. Prior work has also demonstrated that deep gray, not lobar, microbleeds are associated with small vessel disease.21 Taken together, hypertension may produce deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds and small vessel changes, but is likely involved in Alzheimer’s pathogenesis from a non-amyloid pathway, such as decreased cognitive reserve.

The second major finding is that having at least 1 lobar microbleed, unlike deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds, was associated with greater odds of having an abnormal level of CSF p-tau, adjusting for CSF Abeta levels. A recent study in a memory clinic population found a similar association between microbleeds and CSF total tau, but not CSF p-tau, in nondemented individuals.19 The fact that they did not find an association between microbleeds and p-tau may reflect technical differences in the assay or the fact that p-tau is more specific for neurodegeneration in a cohort with more comorbid vascular disease. Nonetheless, both of our studies demonstrated an association between microbleeds and elevated levels of forms of CSF tau. One hypothesis is that microbleeds could reflect damaged microvasculature, resulting in decreased blood flow to neurons, ischemia, neuronal degeneration, and increased tau pathology. Post-mortem, p-tau does appear to have increased aggregation around arteries and arterioles with Abeta in the vessel walls.22 Alternatively, microbleeds could induce enough inflammation, without duration, to cause elevated CSF p-tau. In an animal model, microhemorrhages were seen to trigger inflammation and activated microglia, macrophages, lymphocytes,9,23 rather than cell death or ischemia. This inflammation may be sufficient to produce neuronal release of tau into the extracellular space. This inflammation may also contribute to further Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. Finally, the presence of lobar microbleeds, reflecting amyloid angiopathy, may suggest that the patients are farther along in the Alzheimer’s disease cascade.10 In this case, lobar microbleeds, in addition to abnormal CSF Abeta, may signal more severe underlying disease.

The third major finding is that having at least 1 lobar microbleed is associated with accelerated longitudinal cognitive decline. The literature evaluating the association between microbleeds and cognitive decline has been variable, depending on the cohort studied – community-based populations,24–27 people with a history of or suspected stroke,28–31 or memory clinic MCI/AD subjects3,32–36 – and whether cognition was being evaluated on a cross-sectional24, 28–30, 32, 33 or longitudinal basis. 25,31,34–37 The majority of these studies demonstrated an association between microbleeds and either global or executive impairment3, 24, 26, 28–30 cross-sectionally, as well as increased progression of memory impairment,36 greater longitudinal change in MMSE,34 higher likelihood of MCI conversion to AD,25 and increased risk of developing incident dementia.37 One study also found cognitive improvement after stroke if no microbleeds were present,31 suggesting a detrimental role of microbleeds on cognitive recovery. However, none of these studies adjusted for concomitant Alzheimer’s pathology, which may have driven the longitudinal changes in cognition. In our study, the association between lobar microbleeds and accelerated cognitive decline persisted after adjusting for CSF Abeta levels, which suggests that microbleeds alone, perhaps reflecting underlying amyloid angiopathy, lead to cognitive impairment. This mirrors a postmortem study that demonstrated that moderate-to-severe amyloid angiopathy is associated with perceptual speed and episodic memory, even after adjusting for concomitant AD pathology.38 We also found that having 3 or more lobar microbleeds were more associated with decreasing cognition, similar to prior studies that found greater cognitive decline with 2 or more37 or 5 or more.26 The finding that deep/infratentorial microbleeds were not associated with cognitive decline is concordant with a prior study,30 although differs from another study that found mixed, not strictly lobar microbleeds, were associated with cognitive decline.37 The differential effect on cognitive decline secondary to microbleed location, again may hint at differing etiologies of microbleeds.

Our study has several limitations. First, the ADNI is not a community sample. The cohort consisted of more Caucasians, was more highly educated, and had fewer comorbidities than a community population at this age.39 Furthermore, ADNI subjects were included if they had a low Modified Hachinski score equal or less than 4, excluding people with more severe comorbid vascular pathologies.40 Therefore, although we did not find a significant effect on hypertension-related deep gray/infratentorial microbleeds on tau pathology and cognition, a significant association may be found in people with more significant vascular disease. As a result, generalization of these findings should be approached with caution and further validation in prospective population-based cohorts is required.

Conclusion

The distribution of microbleeds is clinically significant because it not only suggests differing underlying pathology (i.e. amyloid angiopathy versus hypertension) as previously reported in the pathological literature, but also is associated with different downstream events in Alzheimer’s pathogenesis (i.e. tau and cognitive decline). Clinical reports, particularly those in older individuals who are being assessed for cognitive decline, should report these microbleeds separately.
