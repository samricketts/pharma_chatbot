Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) often occur in early-age-of-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) and cluster into sub-syndromes (SSy). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between 18F-FDG-PET regional and connectivity-based brain metabolic dysfunctions and neuropsychiatric SSy.

NPSs were assessed in 27 EOAD using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and further clustered into four SSy (apathetic, hyperactivity, affective and psychotic SSy). 85% of EOAD showed at least one NPS. Voxel-wise correlations between SSy scores and brain glucose metabolism (assessed with 18F-FDG positron emission tomography) were studied. Interregional correlation analysis was used to explore metabolic connectivity in the salience (aSN) and default mode networks (DMN) in a larger sample of EOAD (N=51) and Healthy Controls (N=57).

The apathetic, hyperactivity and affective SSy were highly prevalent (&gt;60%) as compared to the psychotic SSy (33%). The hyperactivity SSy scores were associated with increase of glucose metabolism in frontal and limbic structures, implicated in behavioral control. A comparable positive correlation with part of the same network was found for the affective SSy scores. On the other hand, the apathetic SSy scores were negatively correlated with metabolism in the bilateral orbitofrontal and dorsolateral frontal cortex known to be involved in motivation and decision-making processes. Consistent with these SSy regional correlations with brain metabolic dysfunction, the connectivity analysis showed increases in the aSN and decreases in the DMN.

Behavioral abnormalities in EOAD are associated with specific dysfunctional changes in brain metabolic activity, in particular in the aSN that seems to play a crucial role in NPSs in EOAD.

Introduction

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a prominent and progressive cognitive deterioration in which neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) are also common (Cerejeira et al., 2012; Lyketsos et al., 2011; Nowrangi et al., 2015; Tartaglia et al., 2014). The presence of NPSs in AD was evident since the very first case reported in literature, Frau Auguste D., whose clinical onset was characterized by severe delusions and jealousy toward her husband (Stelzmann et al., 1995). More recently, several studies have investigated the occurrence of NPSs in AD patients, revealing that they are highly frequent (up to 60–90% of total cases) particularly as for apathy, depression and agitation (Lyketsos et al., 2011; Mega et al., 1996; Nowrangi et al., 2015). Noteworthy, exhibiting at least one clinically significant NPS has been linked to a worse prognosis in longitudinal studies on large AD cohorts (Peters et al., 2015) and can be associated with premature institutionalization and lower quality of life (Cerejeira et al., 2012). The presence of NPSs may also predict a faster decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects (Palmer et al., 2007) and in elderly cognitively normal individuals (Masters et al., 2015).

Recently, it has been proposed that some NPSs may cluster into several neuropsychiatric sub-syndromes (SSy) since they often present together and show a similar trend over time (Canevelli et al., 2013; Nowrangi et al., 2015). These SSy are typically comprised of 3 to 5 NPSs and have proved to be effective tools for the assessment of therapy outcomes in dementia (Nowrangi et al., 2015). According to the recent review by Canevelli et al. (2013), there has been a certain heterogeneity in the definition of SSy, probably because of methodological differences across studies (e.g. diverse clustering techniques, variable sample size, adoption of different version of the NPI questionnaire) (Canevelli et al., 2013). The work by Aalten et al. (2007), involving a large sample of AD patients (n&gt;2000), proposed classification in four neuropsychiatric SSy: apathetic SSy, hyperactivity SSy, affective SSy and psychotic SSy (Aalten et al., 2007).

However, there is limited understanding of the neurobiological basis of neuropsychiatric SSy in AD and, importantly, no studies to our knowledge have explored the relationship between neuropsychiatric SSy and cerebral metabolic assessment using 18F-FDG-PET. In a previous fMRI study by Balthazar et al. (2014), the authors found an association between the hyperactivity SSy (as defined according to Aalten et al., 2007) and increased functional connectivity (FC) in the anterior salience network (aSN) of AD patients (Balthazar et al., 2014). Increases in the aSN functional connectivity and arterial spin labeled (ASL) MRI hyperperfusion have been consistently reported in AD, together with decreased FC and hypoperfusion in the Default Mode Network (DMN) (Balthazar et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2010). On the contrary, Zhou et al. (2010) demonstrated that the FC changes in the aSN and in the DMN in patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are opposite to those observed in AD (i.e. increased FC in the DMN and decreased FC in the aSN) (Zhou et al., 2010). A link between aSN dysfunctions (i.e. both FC increases and decreases) and behavioral manifestations specific for AD or bvFTD has been advanced by Zhou and Seeley (2014) on the basis of the existing literature, but in need for further investigation also with other imaging modalities, such as 18F-FDG-PET.

AD patients can be classified as either early- or late-onset AD (EOAD and LOAD, respectively) according to the age of onset of clinical symptoms, with the distinction commonly set at 65 years old (Warren et al., 2012). EOAD represent only a minor percentage of patients, usually not exceeding the 5% of total cases (Warren et al., 2012). Differences in the clinical phenotype of the two groups have been reported, with LOAD presenting with predominant impairment of episodic memory and EOAD with focal non-amnestic symptoms involving attention, language, visuo-spatial and executive functions (Koedam et al., 2010; Migliaccio et al., 2009; Smits et al., 2012; van der Flier et al., 2011). Notably, Ossenkoppele et al. (2015) recently reported that a subset of AD (and especially EOAD) patients have predominant behavioral and/or dysexecutive impairments, thus defining the so-called behavioral/dysexecutive variant of AD (Ossenkoppele et al., 2015). Few studies directly compared NPSs in EOAD and LOAD patients, but several lines of evidence and the reported clinical experience of the authors suggest that they are particularly severe in EOAD (Garre-Olmo et al., 2010; Kaiser et al., 2014; Ossenkoppele et al., 2015; Park et al., 2014).

Neuroimaging findings showed differences between EOAD and LOAD: 18F-FDG-PET studies have shown that hypometabolism is more severe and extended in frontal, lateral temporal and parietal cortices for EOAD as compared to LOAD (Kalpouzos et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2005; McMurtray et al., 2007; Sakamoto et al., 2002) and structural MRI studies showed greater cortical than medial temporal involvement in EOAD compared to LOAD cross-sectionally and longitudinally (Frisoni et al., 2007; Migliaccio et al., 2015). Notably, Rabinovici et al. (2010) showed that the differences in metabolic vulnerability between EOAD and LOAD are not related to amyloid burden as assessed by means of 11C-PiB-PET (Rabinovici et al., 2010). Furthermore, resting state functional connectivity (FC) on fMRI data revealed both similarities and differences in the patterns of network disruption in the LOAD and EOAD groups (Adriaanse et al., 2014; Gour et al., 2014; Lehmann et al., 2015). Gour et al. (2014) showed that the FC in the DMN was comparably low for both groups, while it was decreased in the anterior-medial temporal network (associated with memory functions) only in LOAD and in the dorsolateral prefrontal network (subserving executive functions) only in EOAD (Gour et al., 2014). Adriaanse et al. (2014) found that EOAD patients showed more severe loss of FC than LOAD patients in the DMN and in other resting state brain networks (i.e. the auditory, the sensory-motor and the bilateral dorsal visual networks) (Adriaanse et al., 2014), while Lehmann and colleagues found greater reductions in connectivity in non-DMN cognitive networks than in the DMN in EOAD, possibly accounting for the more heterogeneous clinical presentations of EOAD (Lehmann et al., 2015).

In this study we investigated for the first time the NPSs, their clustering in SSy and the 18F-FDG-PET neuroimaging metabolic correlates in a large cohort of EOAD patients, with the following aims : 1) to define the prevalence of different SSy, based on of NPI symptoms, in EOAD 2) to study the relationship between 18F-FDG-PET brain metabolic dysfunctions and specific SSy 3) to explore differences in brain metabolic connectivity between EOAD and HC in the DMN and in the behavior related aSN. Several events contribute to synaptic dysfunction and consequent cerebral metabolic changes, namely impaired intracellular signaling cascades and mitochondrial functioning, as well as altered neurotransmitter release and long distance neural disconnection, all effects that can be captured by 18F-FDG-PET from the earliest disease phases (Perani, 2014).

The definition of clinical and neuroimaging features of NPSs in EOAD is particularly relevant because these patients are often considered in the differential diagnosis of behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), as they present with a similar symptoms and age of onset.

Materials and Methods

Participants

Fifty-one non-familiar EOAD patients (mean age: 58.55 ± 5.06 years) were retrospectively included from two centers: the Memory and Aging Center of the University of California San Francisco (UCSF; N=34) and the San Raffaele Hospital of Milan, Italy (HSR; N=17). (See Table I).

All the patients were diagnosed as probable AD according to NIA-AA criteria (McKhann et al., 2011) and underwent an extensive neuropsychological assessment and a 18F-FDG-PET metabolism study. Patients presenting with posterior cortical atrophy (Crutch et al., 2012) or logopenic variant of the primary progressive aphasia (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011) were excluded from this study. A mandatory inclusion criterion was the presence of 18F-FDG-PET hypometabolic pattern suggestive of EOAD at the single-subject level as assessed and quantified by means of an optimized single-subject SPM procedure (Perani et al., 2014; Della Rosa et al., 2014). Additional supportive biomarker evidence for AD was provided by means of either amyloid-PET imaging (for UCSF) (18F-AV-45(Florbetapir)-PET or 11C-PiB-PET) or Aβ1-42, total and phosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid (for HSR). The amyloid positivity was also used for inclusion in the study.

In addition, 57 age matched healthy controls (HC) (mean age: 58.7 ± 6.62 years) were selected from the EADC database (http://www.eadc.info/) and the Nuclear Medicine San Raffaele Hospital database, in order to test the metabolic connectivity of the aSN and DMN for the comparison to the patients. A two independent sample t-test confirmed no statistically significant difference in age between HC and EOAD groups (t= −0.133; p&lt;0.89).

Neuropsychiatric assessment

Quantitative assessment of behavioral manifestations by Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (Cummings, 1997) was available in 27 out of the 51 EOAD patients. The NPI is a validated caregiver-based questionnaire for NPSs evaluation in patients with dementia (Cummings, 1997). It assesses the frequency (a: from 0 to 4) and severity (b: from 0 to 3) of twelve NPSs: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, euphoria/elation, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, nighttime sleep disturbances and appetite/eating changes. The maximum total score (a × b) for each NPS is 12 and the NPI total cumulative score is 144 (Cummings, 1997). As for the assessment of the NPS prevalence, we considered the symptoms as present in a patient when their NPI scores were ≥ 1.

According to Aalten et al. (2007), we clustered the twelve NPI symptoms into four distinct SSy as follows: 1. psychotic SSy (delusions, hallucinations and night-time sleep disturbances); 2. affective SSy (anxiety and depression); 3. hyperactivity SSy (agitation/aggression, irritability, euphoria/elation, aberrant motor behavior and disinhibition); 4. apathetic SSy (apathy and eating and appetite changes). These sub-syndromes were identified by means of a principal component analysis on the NPI scores from a large case series of AD patients (N = 2354) from the European Alzheimer’s Disease Consortium (Aalten et al., 2007). The score for each SSy was defined as the sum of the scores of the comprised NPI symptoms. For example, the maximum score for the affective SSy (comprising NPI scores for anxiety and depression) was equal to 12+12.

18F-FDG-PET acquisition

All patients underwent an 18F-FDG-PET imaging session using 3D PET scans: Siemens ECAT EXACT HR or Siemens Biograph PET/CT Truepoint at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (for UCSF images) or multi-ring GE Discovery STE PET/CT system (at HSR). The patients’ injected dose was comparable across centers (approximately 270 MBq). The time interval between injection and scan ranged from 30 to 45 minutes and scan duration was respectively either 30 (for UCSF) or 15 (for HSR) minutes. All the scans acquired after 30 minutes from injection are considered comparable for a steady state FDG distribution, as reported by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine guidelines (Varrone et al., 2009). Image reconstruction followed an ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm. Attenuation correction was performed by means of either co-registered CT or ten-minute transmission scans and scatter correction was applied by means of dedicated software integrated in the PET scans. All the patients gave informed written consent after explanation of the 18F-FDG-PET procedure in conformity with the declaration of Helsinki.

18F-FDG-PET 1st level, single-subject analysis

First, preprocessing was run with PMOD software (PMOD Technologies Ltd.) in order to level out heterogeneities due to different PET scans and protocols. Then, Statistical Parametrical Mapping software (SPM5, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/), implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., Sherborn, Mass) was used for further image pre-processing and statistical analyses. Intensity normalization was achieved by dividing each image by its global mean. Single-subject images were processed according to an optimized and validated SPM procedure (Della Rosa et al., 2014; Perani et al., 2014). Briefly, the single-subject images were first normalized to a dementia-specific 18F-FDG-PET template (Della Rosa et al., 2014) and smoothed (FWHM: 8 mm). Subsequently, the warped and smoothed images entered a voxel-level statistical comparison with a large database of healthy controls (Perani et al., 2014). This procedure generated SPM t-maps showing regions of significant hypometabolism, with a high level of significance (p&lt;0.05 with Family Wise Error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons) and controlling for age as nuisance variable. Each individual SPM t-Map was evaluated by neuroimaging experts (DP, TB, LI) to assess and report for the typical EOAD-related brain hypometabolism. In addition, we performed correlation analysis in the EOAD group (N=51) using a ROI encompassing the pattern of hypometabolism found in the comparison with HC. The mean FDG uptake values inside the ROI were computed for each patient and then correlated with the severity of the disease (using the MMSE scores).

18F-FDG-PET 2nd level linear correlation analysis

Voxel-wise, whole-brain linear correlations (both positive and negative) were tested between brain metabolism and SSy scores by means of a general linear model (GLM) implemented in SPM5 (N=27 EOAD). Single-subject hypometabolism contrast files were adopted for this second-level analysis. For the sake of an easier interpretation of results, the signs of the values in contras images were changed, so that a positive value represents an increase in glucose metabolism and a negative one a decrease. Therefore, positive and negative correlations indicate, respectively, a linear increase or a decrease in glucose metabolism associated with increasing NPI scores (i.e. a more severe behavioral presentation). MMSE (mean: 20.77 ± 6.33), age (mean: 57.7 ± 5.0 years) and disease duration (mean: 3.18 ± 2.38 years) were entered as nuisance variables in order to factor out their effects from the studied association. We also assessed whether the FDG uptake values inside the emerged patterns of correlations (used as ROIs) were different between EOAD and age-matched HC in terms of relative hyper- and hypo- metabloism. In order to maximize the difference between EOAD and controls, sub-samples of EOAD patients were created for each SSy including only those who reported moderate to severe neuropsychiatric manifestations (i.e. SSy score above the 75th percentile; N= 8, 7 and 10 respectively for the hyperactivity, the affective and the apathetic SSy). We then computed the average FDG uptake values inside the ROI (for both EOAD and HC) and compared them by means of a one-tailed non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test.

18F-FDG-PET Metabolic connectivity analysis

Brain metabolic connectivity was investigated in the whole EOAD sample (N=51) and in age-matched controls (N=57). The main assumption of this analysis dates back to the seminal work by Horwitz et al. according to which brain regions whose glucose metabolism is correlated at rest are functionally associated (Horwitz et al., 1984). Here we applied a validated development of the original method: voxel-wise interregional correlation analysis (IRCA) in SPM (Lee et al., 2008). First, functional region of interests (ROI) were defined according to Shirer et al. (2012) as seeds for the analysis of the aSN and the dorsal DMN (Shirer et al., 2012) (http://findlab.stanford.edu/functional_ROIs.html). Seeds for the dorsal DMN and the aSN were, respectively, the PCC/precuneus and the left and right anterior insula that have been identified as pivotal hubs of the two networks by previous studies (Fransson and Marrelec, 2008; Menon and Uddin, 2010). As a control condition, we evaluated also the sensorimotor network (SMN) that we would expect not to differ between groups. The SMN seed regions were located in the left and right pre and post-central gyrus. Then, each warped and smoothed image underwent intensity normalization to the global mean and mean FDG uptake was extracted from the ROI separately for the EOAD and the HC groups. The mean ROI counts were entered as variables of interest in a GLM in SPM5 testing for voxel-vise correlations in the two groups, setting the p-value at 0.05 with FWE correction for multiple comparisons. In addition, the number of correlated voxels was computed for each considered network in both group. When differences in the spatial extension of the metabolic connectivity were found, a supplementary analysis was performed to compare differences in slopes and correlation coefficients between groups. Namely, we created in SPM a model to investigate voxel-wise the interaction between the group variable (i.e. EOAD and HC) and the mean ROI count from the seeds. This analysis allows the identification of brain regions in which EOAD and HC show significantly different slopes in the relationship with the FDG uptake values extracted from the seeds. Then, we assessed the correlation coefficients inside these brain structures and compared them between EOAD and HC by means of Fisher r-to-z transformation.

Results

Neuropsychiatric Assessment

NPSs were highly prevalent in our EOAD cohort (N=27), with 85% of the patients showing at least one NPS (defined as NPI total score ≠ 0). Apathy (67%) was the most frequent NPS, while hallucinations (11%) were rare and delusions completely absent.

As regards neuropsychiatric SSy, the apathetic SSy (74%) was the most frequent, followed closely by the hyperactivity SSy (70%) and the affective SSy (63%). The psychotic SSy was present in only nine patients (33%) and none of them had delusions. Given that not all the constitutive symptoms of the psychotic SSy were found in our cohort and that the great majority of the patients (18/27) showed no psychotic signs (cumulative score = 0), thus preventing a linear parametric correlations, we excluded it from further analysis. Table II displays the frequency of each of the four SSy and the corresponding NPI symptoms together with their mean scores and standard deviations (See Table II).

18F-FDG-PET

Single-subject analysis

The single subject optimized SPM analyses revealed metabolic alterations in each EOAD patient encompassing the AD typical brain hypometabolism in temporo-parietal associative cortices, in the posterior cingulum and precuneus and extending to the associative frontal regions. Based on visual inspection of single-subject SPM t-maps (N=51), thirty-two EOAD patients showed an extended frontal hypometabolism and nineteen patients showed a less extended frontal involvement (see Figure 1-A and B as examples and 1-C for group SPM analysis). In addition, a significant correlation was found between global clinical impairment (as assessed by MMSE) and the severity glucose metabolism reduction (r = −0.4 p&lt;0.003) (Figure 1-C). This is also consistent with the results reported in a previous study on a very large database (395 early AD cases) (Herholz et al. 2002).

Linear Correlations

The three investigated neuropsychiatric SSy showed statistically significant correlations with glucose metabolism at p&lt;0.01 (uncorrected, cluster extent: k=100; N=27) (see Figure 2).

The Hyperactivity SSy showed positive correlation (i.e. linear increase in glucose metabolism together with increasing hyperactivity SSy scores) in the left insula, in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and in the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) (that are part of the anterior Salience Network) as well as in the left temporal pole (TP), in the left precentral gyrus and in the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG).

The affective SSy scores showed also positive correlations with FDG uptake in the the ACG and SFG extending to the supplementary motor area (SMA).

The apathetic SSy was negatively correlated (i.e. linear decrease in glucose metabolism together with increasing apathetic SSy scores) with FDG uptake in the bilateral middle frontal gyri and the bilateral middle orbitofrontal gyri.

The group comparison analysis for increases or decreases glucose uptake values in EOAD as compared to HC confirmed the relative hypemetabolism in the frontal ROIs for the hyperactivity (U=115, p&lt;0.011) and the affective SSy (U=106, p&lt;0.022), and the reduction of glucose uptake in the frontal ROIs for the apathetic SSy (U=177, p&lt;0.029).

Metabolic connectivity (IRCA) results

SMN

The metabolic correlations for the SMN, considered as a control network, were limited to the seed regions without differences between groups.

DMN

Resting-state whole-brain metabolic connectivity with the PCC/precuneus as seed region of the DMN was reduced in EOAD as compared to HC. Metabolic correlations were found within the PCC/precuneus itself (i.e. autocorrelation) in both HC and EOAD, whereas additional metabolic correlations encompassing the left inferior parietal cortex (IPC), the right angular gyrus (rAG) and the left superior frontal gyrus (lSFG) were observed only in the HC group (p&lt;0.05, FWE) (See Figure 3, PCC/DMN). The SPM interaction analysis and the Fisher r-to-z transformation revealed a significant difference in the slope as well as reductions in the magnitude of the correlation coefficient (z=−7.36, p= 9.26e-14) in the EOAD, as compared to HC, in several brain regions that are part of the DMN (i.e. the left and, to a minor extent, right IPC, the left middle and inferior temporal cortex, the left ACG and the left IFG) (Figure 4, DMN). In all these brain structures the correlation with the PCC as seed of the DMN was stronger in HC as compared to EOAD (p&lt;0.001 uncorrected).

aSN

On the other hand, EOAD showed increased metabolic connectivity as compared to HC in the aSN when considering the left and right AI as seed structures. As for the left AI, both the EOAD and HC showed autocorrelation within this region, and additional significantly correlated clusters in the left ACG (the other pivotal aSN node), as well as in the left superior, middle and inferior frontal gyri and in the orbitofrontal cortex (p&lt;0.05, FWE). However, the spatial extent of metabolic correlated clusters in EOAD exceeded that of HC in all the reported brain regions. As regard the right AI, EOAD and HC showed either autocorrelations in the seed regions or additional metabolic correlations in the posterior insula, in the ACG extending to the right orbitofrontal cortex and the right IFG. Again, metabolic correlated clusters of the right AI in EOAD patients spatially exceeded that of HC extending to the dorsolateral frontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and subcortical brain regions (i.e. the thalamus and the pallidum) (p&lt;0.05, FWE) (See Figure 3, aSN).

The SPM interaction analysis showed that the slope of the correlation between the seeds of the aSN and several frontal and limbic brain regions was steeper in EOAD as compared to HC (p&lt;0.001 uncorrected). Namely, significant differences were found in the left insula extending to the IFG for the left aSN, and in the right IFG, the superior orbitofrontal cortex, the SFG and the inferior temporal cortex for the right aSN (see Figure 4, Right and Left aSN). In addition, significant differences between the correlation coefficients were found for both the left (z=5.78,p= 3.69e-09) and the right (z=4.02,p= 2.96e-05) aSN by means of the Fisher r-to-z transformation.

In the Figure 3, the voxel extent of the metabolic correlations in the EOAD (N=51) and HC (N=57) groups is reported to show the differences (as defined in Lee et al., 2011).

Discussion

The study shows that 85% of EOAD patients demonstrate neuropsychiatric symptoms as assessed by the Neurpsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and that their severity is associated with specific metabolic dysfunctions in brain regions known to be involved in behavioral regulation.

The most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptom was apathy (67%), in accordance with previous literature in AD (van Vliet et al., 2012), followed by irritability (44%), aberrant motor behaviors (44%) and anxiety (48%). Psychotic manifestations (i.e. delusions and hallucinations) were rare. When these were grouped in SSy, the majority of EOAD patients presented features of the apathetic, hyperactivity and the affective SSy, while the psychotic SSy was less frequent. Notably, also bvFTD patients present with early behavioral changes (that represent the core diagnostic criteria) involving apathy, disinhibition, loss of sympathy and empathy, perseverative or stereotyped behaviors and hyperorality and appetite changes (Rascovsky et al., 2011). We suggest that, with the exception of apathy, the EOAD behavioral profile is different from the bvFTD one and might be considered a useful cue in differential diagnosis.

Concerning the correlation analyses between SSy scores and brain glucose metabolism, the hyperactivity SSy and the affective SSy showed positive correlations, while a significant negative correlation was revealed only for the apathetic SSy (Figure 2). Notably, according to the psychiatric definition, neuropsychiatric symptoms may be considered as either “positive” or “negative”. The hyperactivity SSy is a clear example of positive psychiatric symptoms, while the apathetic SSy typically involves negative manifestations. It is thus arguable that the positive and negative symptoms could relate, respectively, to dysfunctional increases or decreases in metabolism in specific brain structures. A similar suggestion was advanced by Zhou and Seeley (2014) who proposed that positive and negative psychiatric symptoms in AD and FTD patients are associated, respectively, with aberrant increases and decreases of the functional connectivity in specific functional networks (Zhou and Seeley, 2014). On the other hand, the affective SSy (including anxiety and depression) encompasses both positive and negative features and it is thus not easily defined by this dichotomous classification.

The hyperactivity SSy was associated with an increased glucose metabolism in the left insula, in the ACG and in the SFG that are pivotal nodes of the anterior Salience Network (aSN) (Seeley et al., 2007; Shirer et al., 2012). This finding is in line with the recent fMRI study by Balthazar et al. (2014) in AD patients showing an association between the hyperactivity SSy and increased functional connectivity in the aSN (Balthazar et al., 2014). Structural MRI studies found a relationship between symptoms of the hyperactivity SSy and more severe cortical atrophy in regions of the aSN (Nowrangi et al., 2015). These findings seem to contrast our results, however, a temporal mismatch between brain functional and structural changes is possible. Given the relative low disease duration of our EOAD series (mean: 3.28 ± 2.113 years), we suggest that a sustained aSN hyper-activation may precede the loss of neurons as detected by MRI studies.

We found positive correlations with the hyperactivity SSy also in other brain structures, namely, a) in the left temporal pole, a paralimbic structure that is involved in eliciting reactions to emotional stimuli (Olson, Plotzker, and Ezzyat, 2007) and that is closely connected to the aSN (Seeley et al., 2007); b) in the right IFG that has been associated with inhibitory action control (Aron et al., 2014), and possibly critical for the emergence of the hyperactivity manifestations in AD patients; c) in the left precentral sulcus, which has been specifically associated with aberrant motor behaviors in AD and FTD patients probably because of an impairment in motor planning abilities (Rosen et al., 2005).

The affective SSy showed an association with increased glucose consumption in the SFG and in the ACG. As it has been said for the hyperactivity SSy, these brain structures are pivotal nodes of the aSN and are involved in the appraisal (i.e. evaluation of what an internal/external stimulus means) and expression of negative emotions (Etkin et al., 2011; Seeley et al., 2007). In particular the ACG sends efferent projections to cortical and subcortical (including the amygdala) brain structures triggering visceromotor and emotional reactions to salience that may be a major source of anxiety (Zhou and Seeley, 2014). The relationship between these findings and depressive symptoms (that are part of the affective SSy) is more controversial. Previous studies specifically focused on depression in AD (including mainly LOAD) found an association between depression and reduced glucose metabolism (Holthoff et al., 2005; D. Y. Lee et al., 2006) or accelerated atrophy (Zahodne et al., 2013) in frontal regions (including dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, superior frontal cortex and the ACG). Nevertheless, studies on late-life depression (LLD) showed an association between LLD and hypermetabolism in frontal (including the SFG and the ACG) and limbic structures (Hirao and Smith, 2014; Smith et al., 2009). Notably, the metabolic hyperactivity in frontal structures is the target of deep brain stimulation which was effective in decreasing the clinical symptoms in treatment-resistant depressed patients (Mayberg et al., 2005). We thus suggest that affective symptoms in EOAD are associated with a dysfunctional increased metabolism in specific frontal regions, as comparably reported in depressed patients (Hirao and Smith, 2014; Smith et al., 2009; Mayberg et al., 2005). It is of note that all these brain structures are usually spared by AD neurodegeneration on structural and functional neuroimaging, at least in the early and mild stages (Perani, 2013; Whitwell et al., 2007). We showed here that they might be dysfunctional as assessed by 18F-FDG-PET correlations in this study.

The apathetic SSy involves two conceptually distant NPI symptoms: apathy and appetite and eating changes. The former is a clear negative neuropsychiatric symptom involving loss of interest and motivation as well as difficulty in engaging in activities (Cummings et al., 1997). The latter comprises information regarding changes in eating habits and taste (Cummings, 1997). The correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between the apathetic SSy as a whole and glucose consumption in the bilateral middle orbitofrontal and middle frontal gyri. These structures are involved in motivation and decision-making (Kouneiher et al., 2009; Wallis, 2007) and, together with other frontal and subcortical structures (e.g. ACG, dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, caudate nucleus), were found hypometabolic in apathetic AD patients (Benoit et al., 2004; Stella et al., 2013). Specifically, the work by Benoit et al. (2004) showed that the exact component of apathy that correlates with a reduced rCBF in medial frontal and medial orbitofrontal regions is lack of interest (Benoit et al., 2004).

Studies in bvFTD patients also showed that apathy is associated with a severe hypometabolism in frontal medial, dorsolateral and orbitofrontal structures (Franceschi et al., 2005; Peters et al., 2006). Considering the present results and the above evidence in bvFTD and in AD patients (Stella et al., 2013), it appears that the neural correlates of apathy may be shared across different dementias. Notably, also eating and appetite changes in dementia (i.e. AD and bvFTD) have been associated with atrophy in the orbitofrontal cortex (but also to the insular and striatal brain regions) (Piguet, 2011; Schroeter et al., 2011) and to reduced perfusion as measured with 99mTc-EDC-SPECT in left orbitofrontal and left ACG (Ismail et al., 2008). Accordingly, the partial overlap of brain functional and structural correlates with apathy and appetite and eating changes supports their clustering in the apathetic SSy, as described by Aalten et al. (2007).

Finally, we performed a metabolic connectivity analysis (i.e. IRCA) in our large EOAD series (N=51) and in age-matched HC (N=57) that showed metabolic connectivity reductions (i.e. in the spatial extension of the networks) in the DMN and increases in aSN in EOAD. Moreover, we further expanded the IRCA approach demonstrating significant differences between EOAD and HC in the connectivity strength. On one hand, in several brain regions that are part of the DMN, the connection with the PCC (as main seed of the network) was stronger in HC as compared to EOAD, thus statistically supporting the result of a severe DMN impairment in EOAD patients (Figure 4,DMN). On the other hand, we found stronger connectivity in EOAD between several limbic and frontal regions (mainly in the right hemisphere) and the bilateral insula (as seeds of the aSN), indicating a stronger metabolic connectivity in the aSN for the EOAD group (Figure 4,Right and Left aSN). Taken together, these analyses strongly support the major metabolic disconnection of the DMN in EOAD together with dysfunctional metabolic connectivity in the aSN. Many fMRI studies showed that distinct functional networks (and in particular the DMN and the aSN that are relevant for our study) are anticorrelated both at rest and during task performance (Fox et al., 2005; Kelly et al., 2008; Zhou and Seeley, 2014). This means that spontaneous BOLD signal fluctuations are correlated within a functional network and anticorrelated between distinct networks. Basing on this foreword, we suggest that in the presence of posterior DMN impairment, as demonstrated in EOAD patients, there could be a sustained dysfunctional increase in the connectivity of the aSN originating from the lack of interplay between the two networks. Accordingly, reduction in activity in the DMN leads to increases in activity in the aSN and vice versa (Zhou and Seeley, 2014).

In addition, a recent rs-fMRI study demonstrated that functional connectivity changes according to dementia severity are similar in autosomal dominant AD (which typically presents with an early onset) and in LOAD patients (Thomas et al., 2014). Other fMRI studies instead found both similarities and differences in the functional connectivity of different brain networks when comparing EOAD and LOAD patients (Adriaanse et al., 2014; Gour et al., 2014; Lehmann et al., 2015). Despite some inconsistencies, a reduced DMN functional connectivity, as shown also here, seems to be a hallmark of both early and late onset AD, a result that may be explained by the selective amyloid deposition in the vulnerable DMN (Gour et al., 2014; Rabinovici et al., 2010). In addition, another possible explanation for the posterior DMN vulnerability might be also tau pathology spreading into posterior DMN hubs, a crucial issue that needs to be further investigated.

Besides the reduction of metabolic connectivity in the DMN posterior brain regions, we identified, for the first time in EOAD using 18F-FDG-PET, a dysfunctional increase of connectivity pattern in the aSN, in line with previous fMRI and ASL MRI evidence in AD (Hu et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2010). At difference to HC, in whom the bilateral AI correlated with the ACG, thus delineating the normal aSN architecture (Menon and Uddin, 2010; Seeley et al., 2007), in EOAD patients the left and right AI showed increased metabolic connectivity with the ACG and also with other frontal cortical and subcortical brain structures.

In healthy subjects, the aSN is essential for the detection of different forms of salience through the integration of relevant internal and extrapersonal information (Menon and Uddin, 2010; Seeley et al., 2007). According to Zhou and Seeley (2014), the enhancement of aSN functioning in AD patients may be associated with aberrant increased reactive response to social and emotional salient stimuli that, over a certain threshold, may lead to agitation, irritability and anxiety. On the contrary, atrophy in the aSN and reduction of functional connectivity have been consistently reported in bvFTD and associated with apathy, social cognition deficits and social disinhibition (Seeley et al., 2015; Zhou and Seeley, 2014).

The results show that behavioral abnormalities are frequent in EOAD and are associated with primarily frontal metabolic changes in specific neural networks. In particular, these results suggest that the dynamic interaction between functional state of aSN and DMN, as demonstrated in healthy subjects, bvFTD, LOAD (Balthazar et al., 2014; Zhou and Seeley, 2014) and now in EOAD, may be responsible for different aspects of neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms in neurodegenerative conditions.

Further studies in EOAD combining multiple imaging techniques will further contribute to characterize the neural basis of specific behavioral SSy.
