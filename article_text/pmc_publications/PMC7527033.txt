Objective

In the context of the public health burden posed by increases in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) prevalence around the globe and the related research efforts to identify modifiable risk factors for the disease, we sought to provide an empirical test of earlier claims that volunteering may be considered as a health intervention that could help to prevent or delay the onset of AD.

Method

Using nine waves of panel data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (n=9,697), we examined whether volunteering conferred cognitive health benefits in later life and whether volunteering served a gene-regulatory function to help alleviate cognitive decline associated with polygenic risk for AD. Multilevel models were used to estimate associations between volunteering, polygenic risk for AD, and cognitive functioning over time.

Results

We found robust within-person associations between volunteering (assessed as volunteer status and time commitment) and cognitive functioning over time, such that volunteering was associated with higher levels of cognitive functioning and slower cognitive decline. The findings also provided evidence that the within-person associations for volunteering and cognitive decline were more pronounced for older adults at higher genetic risk for developing AD.

Conclusions

Our findings are in line with a growing body of theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence suggesting that prosocial behaviors are directly associated with biological systems and may modify gene regulation to confer health benefits. The analytic approach taken in this study also provided a useful framework for investigating the effectiveness of other modifiable risk factors that vary over time in the context of cognitive decline related to genetic risk for AD.

1. Introduction

The pathophysiological process of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) often begins decades before a clinical diagnosis, which is driven in part by genetic factors as well as early and mid-life exposures and experiences (Dubois et al., 2016). Along with pathophysiological changes to the brain (e.g., amyloid-β accumulation, neurodegeneration), cognitive decline is widely documented as a significant antecedent of AD (Sperling et al., 2011). Of particular interest to this study are two features of cognitive decline in the context of the pathogenesis of AD. First, research has uncovered a genetic basis for cognitive decline preceding AD; while earlier research focused on the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene as a key genetic risk factor, recent research based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) demonstrates that cognitive decline associated with AD is accurately predicted through a polygenic risk approach (Marden et al., 2016). Second, as cognitive decline occurs at the later stages of preclinical AD, it also marks the latest time at which an intervention could play a role in delaying the onset of clinical AD (Sperling et al., 2011). Research also identifies a number of modifiable risk factors and prevention approaches, which include (but are not limited to) smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, healthy diet, exercise, and high blood pressure (Smith and Yaffe, 2014). Identifying modifiable factors for designing effective intervention approaches is critical, given the projected number of AD patients and associated healthcare spending around the globe (Sperling et al., 2011). In the U.S., for example, recent estimates indicate that over 13 million Americans aged 65 and older will have AD by 2050 and that the total cost associated with the disease will increase to over one trillion dollars annually (Alzheimer’s Association, 2015). In this vein, a coordinated worldwide effort is now underway to test multidimensional lifestyle intervention approaches for preventing or delaying dementia onset (Kivipelto et al., 2018).

One promising lifestyle intervention for dementia prevention is social engagement. In particular, formal volunteering, defined as unpaid work performed under the auspices of a formal organization with the intent of helping others, has been shown to confer a wide range of health benefits for the volunteer, including better physical and mental health, as well as reduced mortality risk (Anderson et al., 2014; Fried et al., 2013; Jenkinson et al., 2013). In addition to decades of research demonstrating robust health benefits associated with volunteering, recent randomized control trials (RCT), such as those based on intergenerational volunteering programs (e.g., Experience Corps), provide evidence consistent with a causal relationship between volunteering and better health (Fried et al., 2013; Jenkinson et al., 2013). As such, some researchers propose that formal volunteering should be considered a form of public health intervention, especially in the context of reducing risk and delaying onset of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (Anderson et al., 2014). Despite the cogent theoretical arguments made by researchers regarding how volunteering promotes the cognitive functioning of older volunteers, earlier studies on the topic yield inconsistent results (Anderson et al., 2014; Guiney and Machado, 2018). The purpose of this study is to add to the literature examining the association between volunteering and cognitive functioning by explicitly taking into consideration the genetic risk factors for AD. Using nine waves of panel data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we address the question of whether volunteering conferred cognitive health benefits in later life, especially for individuals at high polygenic risk for AD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to consider genetic risk associated with AD when examining the link between volunteering and cognitive decline.

1.1. Volunteering and cognitive decline

As summarized in two recent reviews on the topic, only a few studies examine the link between volunteering and cognitive outcomes in later life (Anderson et al., 2014; Guiney and Machado, 2018). In contrast to the consistent scientific evidence for physical and mental health advantages associated with volunteering, findings from the small body of observational (both cross-sectional and longitudinal) and RCT studies generally remain equivocal as to whether volunteering specifically benefits cognitive functioning (Guiney and Machado, 2018). However, a number of recent longitudinal studies based on large national data sources show more consistent results. An earlier study, based on eight waves of HRS data, finds that individuals who volunteered at baseline, as well as those who volunteered regularly over the course of the observation period, showed reduced risk of cognitive impairment compared to non-volunteers (Infurna et al., 2016). Another recent study based on nine waves of HRS data demonstrates that the number of volunteering hours is positively associated with higher global cognitive functioning and was negatively associated with decline in executive functioning (assessed with working memory and processing speed; Proulx et al., 2017). In addition, a five-year prospective Swedish study reports that those who continuously volunteered during the study period showed a lower likelihood of suffering mild to moderate dementia (as assessed with anti-dementia treatment) compared to their counterparts who did not volunteer or volunteered irregularly (Griep et al., 2017). While these recent studies provide promising evidence for the cognitive benefits associated with volunteering, the findings are limited by potential selection effects documented in the literature on volunteering and health (Li and Ferraro, 2006; Thoits and Hewitt, 2001). That is, earlier studies often compare cognitive outcomes between volunteers and non-volunteers, raising the question of whether and how much the traits associated with being a volunteer (e.g., better health), rather than the act of volunteering itself, account for better health outcomes among those who volunteer. In this study, we extend the knowledge base by employing a within-person analytic approach that allows us to partially address the issue of selection; that is, we examine whether an individual showed a higher level of cognitive functioning and slower cognitive decline when the person volunteered compared to when the same person did not volunteer over a 16-year observation period.

Researchers argue that the cognitive benefits associated with volunteering are explained by the cognitive, social, and physical activities embedded in volunteer activities (Anderson et al., 2014; Guiney and Machado, 2018). That is, in ways that other activities (e.g., paid work) with similar embedded tasks may aid cognitive functioning, the proposed theoretical framework linking volunteering and better cognitive functioning argues that volunteering stimulates higher levels of cognitive, social, and physical activity, thereby providing benefits to cognitive functioning for the volunteer. While the proposed pathways are plausible and likely explain important aspects of the volunteering-cognition nexus, earlier theoretical frameworks (Anderson et al., 2014; Guiney and Machado, 2018) often do not emphasize the prosocial nature of helping others through volunteering, which provides a complementary explanation for the link between volunteering and cognitive functioning. Importantly, there is a growing body of theoretical and empirical evidence that described how prosocial behaviors, such as volunteering, directly influenced biological systems and modified gene regulation to confer health benefits (Brown and Okun, 2014; Eisenberger and Cole, 2012; Nelson-Coffey et al., 2017; Seeman et al., 2020). In this light, we address the question of whether volunteering (assessed as both volunteer status and time committed to volunteering) serves a gene-regulatory function to alleviate cognitive decline associated with polygenic risk for AD.

1.2. “Under-the-skin” effects of volunteering and genetic risk for AD

Researchers are increasingly conceptualizing prosocial behavior in relation to what is described as the caregiving behavioral system, referring to social-neurophysiological mechanisms in the brain, providing a promising conceptual framework for understanding the beneficial health outcomes observed among those who help others (Brown and Okun, 2014; Inagaki, 2018). According to this framework, prosocial behavior is facilitated by a series of neurohormonal mechanisms, where brain regions implicated in the caregiving system and its hormonal correlates have direct downstream influences on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), as well as the immune system. Consistent with this framework, observational and experimental research demonstrates that prosocial behavior intended to help others is associated with reduced stress-reactivity and attenuated SNS activity, as well as inflammatory response (Inagaki, 2018), all of which are related to cognitive decline and dementia (Huang et al., 2009; Yaffe et al., 2004). Additionally, a stream of recent studies suggested that engaging in prosocial behavior may modify gene regulation. For example, an RCT study shows that engaging in prosocial behaviors resulted in reductions in pro-inflammatory gene expression and increases in antiviral gene expression (Nelson-Coffey et al., 2017). Another study documents similar patterns of gene regulation over nine months among older adults who participated in a prosocial intergenerational mentoring program intended to help school children (Seeman et al., 2020).

Unlike obligatory forms of helping behavior sometimes associated with adverse health outcomes, formal volunteering is widely recognized as a form of prosocial behavior appropriately situated within the caregiving behavioral system framework (Brown and Okun, 2014). This is especially the case among older adults, as volunteer activities in later life are often driven by a desire to help others (Morrow-Howell, 2010). Accordingly, findings from recent studies on volunteering and physiological systems assessed with biomarkers are consistently in line with the theoretical predictions of the caregiving systems framework. For example, volunteering is linked to lower levels of emotional and hormonal stress-reactivity (Han et al., 2018, 2019), cardiovascular disease risk (Burr et al., 2016), and inflammatory markers (Kim and Ferraro, 2014). The direct linkages between these biomarkers of health and cognitive functioning, as well as dementia risk, are established in the literature (Huang et al., 2009; Yaffe et al., 2004), implicating an “under-the-skin” pathway linking volunteering and better cognitive functioning, a pathway infrequently assessed in the research literature.

Some of these under-the-skin health benefits associated with volunteer activity may further downregulate the genetic risk for cognitive decline associated with AD. For example, a recent study based on daily diary data shows that volunteering is associated with reductions in stress-responsivity, as assessed with the stress hormone cortisol (Han et al., 2018), which is shown to interact with a genetic risk for AD (i.e., ApoE genotype) to worsen cognitive functioning (Montoliu et al., 2018), and accelerate cognitive decline for those at higher genetic risk for AD (Gerritsen et al., 2011).

1.3. Study objectives and hypotheses

The present study addresses whether volunteering is associated with better cognitive functioning, and importantly, whether this association was stronger for those who were at greater genetic risk for AD (moderation effect). To address the research questions, we utilize nine waves of panel data from the HRS to examine within-person associations between volunteering and cognitive functioning over time, thereby partly overcoming the issue of social selection bias documented in earlier studies (Li and Ferraro, 2006; Thoits and Hewitt, 2001). The study is confined to examining a subsample of HRS participants identified as having European ancestry because the polygenic risk measures generally do not yet perform well in predicting outcomes of interest (e.g., AD) among non-white, non-European ancestry populations (Marden et al., 2016; Ware et al., 2017). We hypothesize that individuals would have better cognitive functioning and slower cognitive decline when they volunteered compared to when they did not, and we also expect that this association would be more pronounced for individuals at higher polygenic risk for AD compared to those at lower risk.

2. Method

2.1. Data and study sample

This study was based on survey data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), an ongoing biennial panel study of older adults in the U.S. conducted by the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan (Sonnega et al., 2014). The HRS initially interviewed a nationally representative sample of persons aged 51–61 in 1992, but subsequently added younger and older birth cohorts, comprising what is now a nationally representative sample of adults 51 years old and older, as well as their spouses (of any age). We limited our study to nine waves of data collected from 1998 to 2014 because several study variables were inconsistently measured prior to the 1998 wave. Because we included new cohorts of individuals who were introduced to the HRS in the waves following 1998 (Sonnega et al., 2014), “baseline” in this study referred to the first wave in which an individual participated in the HRS during the observation period. Data for this study were primarily taken from the RAND-constructed file that accounted for inconsistencies and missingness across the study period (Bugliari et al., 2019). An exception included information on volunteering and genetic risk for AD, which was taken from the data provided by the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan.

In 2006, the HRS began collecting additional information from participants through the Enhanced Face-to-Face (EFTF) interview, which included collection of salivary DNA samples (for details on the saliva collection protocol, see Ware et al., 2018). The EFTF interview was conducted on a rotating half-sample basis, where a random half of the HRS sample was invited for the interview in 2006 (and followed up in 2010), and the other half was invited in 2008 (and followed up in 2012). As the polygenic risk score for AD (based on salivary DNA analysis) was a key variable for this study, the study sample was restricted to HRS participants of European ancestry who provided a sample of salivary DNA through an ETFT interview during the observation period (n = 12,090). The polygenic risk score for AD is the only measure taken from the EFTF interviews in this study.

Among the 12,090 participants who provided saliva samples, we selected our study sample based on several criteria. The sample was restricted to participants who were administered the full cognitive status battery (see below). At each wave, the full cognitive battery was administered to participants aged 65 and older, as well as their spouses, who were given the cognitive battery regardless of their age; we excluded those who were never administered the full cognitive status battery during the observation period (n = 273). Missing information was exceptionally low among participants in the study sample, where 0.2% of the person-wave observations had missing information (116 out of 51,990 person-wave interviews). Thus, we used listwise deletion to handle missing information, and as such, those participants who did not provide complete information for all study variables at any wave during the observation were eliminated (n = 3). Among the remaining 11,814 participants, we further excluded spouses of participants who were at baseline 50 years old and younger (spouses of cohort-eligible HRS participants; n = 1,153). We also excluded participants who were 75 and older at baseline (n = 964) for whom volunteering as an intervention for AD is considered less effective; and thus, the sample was bounded at those who were between ages 51 and 74 at baseline (Smith and Yaffe, 2014; Sperling et al., 2011). The final analytic study sample included 9,697 participants, contributing 44,410 person-wave observations (average of 4.6 person-wave observations).

2.2. Measures

2.2.1. Cognitive functioning

We used the full cognitive status battery adapted from the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status to assess participants’ cognitive functioning at each wave (Ofstedal et al., 2005). The measure included 10-word immediate and 10-word delayed word recall memory tests (range: 0–20), a serial 7s subtraction test of working memory (range: 0–5), backward counting to assess processing speed (range: 0–2), an object naming test (range: 0–2) to assess language, and recall of the current date (range: 0–4) and naming the current president and vice president (range: 0–2) to assess orientation. We used the composite score based on the full battery (range: 0–35), with higher scores indicating better cognitive functioning.

2.2.2. Polygenic risk score for AD (PGS-AD)

PGS-AD was computed based on a 2013 GWAS meta-analysis of four previously published GWAS data sources, consisting of 20 independent studies, conducted by the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (Lambert et al., 2013). The HRS identified 1,145,021 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including the ApoE status variants, that overlapped between the GWAS meta-analysis and the HRS genetic data, all of which were used in constructing the PGS-AD without taking into consideration any type of linkage disequilibrium (LD) trimming or p-value threshold. This approach yielded the largest predictive power of the PGS, or comparable results, compared to other approaches that were based on some degree of LD trimming or p-value thresholding (for detailed information on the construction of the PGS-AD, see Supplementary Table S1; Ware et al., 2018). Each SNP was weighted by the GWAS estimate, and weighted sums were used to compute the PGS-AD, where higher scores indicated a greater genetic risk for developing AD. The HRS standardized the scores to a normal curve (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).

2.2.3. Volunteering

We used two measures of volunteering assessed at each wave: volunteer status and time commitment; no other variables on volunteering were available in the core HRS data. HRS participants were first asked “have you spent any time in the past 12 months doing volunteer work for religious, educational, health-related or other charitable organizations?” Based on participants’ response to the question, volunteering status was coded dichotomously (1 = yes; 0 = no). Those who were identified as volunteers were followed up with a set of questions that captured the annual time committed to volunteering. Based on the responses to the questions, we created a four-category measure for annual time commitment (0 = did not volunteer; 1 = 1–99 hr; 2 = 100–199 hr; 3 = 200+ hr). The measure for annual time commitment was employed as a categorical variable in the analyses to capture possible threshold effects (Burr et al., 2016; Windsor et al., 2008).

2.2.4. Covariates

We included a set of time-invariant and time-varying covariates in our analyses. Time-invariant covariates included age at baseline (in years; range: 51–74), gender (1 = female, 0 = male), and years of education (range: 0–17). Time-varying covariates assessed at each wave included couple status (1 = in a coupled relationship, i.e., married or in a similar partnership arrangement; 0 = not in a coupled relationship), household wealth (assets minus debts, inverse-hyperbole sine-transformed; Friedline et al., 2015), work status (1 = worked for pay; 0 = did not work for pay), number of depressive symptoms based on the 8-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale (range: 0–8), use of psychiatric medication including antidepressants (1 = used medication, 0 = did not), and number of cardiometabolic health conditions, including heart conditions, stroke, high blood pressure, and diabetes (range: 0–4).

2.3. Analytic plan

The research questions were addressed using multilevel (2-level) regression models, where repeated observations (level 1) were nested within persons (level 2). Specifically, we used within-between random effects (WBRE) models that yield within-person estimates for time-varying measures that are independent of selection effects attributed to all stable inter-individual differences, both observed and unobserved (Allison, 2009; Bell et al., 2019; Hamaker and Muthén, 2019). This was achieved by decomposing time-varying variables into within-person (WP) and between-person (BP) components. In the context of this study, the level-2 BP component (computed as the proportion of waves in which participants volunteered or were in each volunteer time commitment category) captured differences in levels of cognitive functioning between persons who volunteered more often during the observation period compared to those persons who volunteered less (or did not volunteer). In contrast, the level-1 WP component (computed as the deviation from the person-mean at a given occasion) captured changes in cognitive functioning within the same person in relation to intra-individual variations in a person’s volunteer status over time. This modeling approach is increasingly recommended as a more robust way of handling repeated observations over time in the multilevel modeling literature (Bell et al., 2019; Hamaker and Muthén, 2019). This recommendation stems from the fact that failing to decompose level-1 and level-2 variance from time-varying measures produced estimates that were an uninterpretable blend of within-person and between person relationships (Bell et al., 2019; Hamaker and Muthén, 2019). This occurs, for example, because the reference category of the estimated coefficient for volunteering includes both non-volunteers (level-2) and not volunteering at a given wave (level-1).

Based on the random effects modeling framework, we estimated cognitive functioning trajectories that assessed longitudinal changes in cognitive functioning (i.e., individual change, assessed with time from baseline), while accounting for cross-sectional age-differences in cognitive functioning (assessed with age at baseline; Mendes De Leon, 2007; Morrell et al., 2009). The distinction between longitudinal and cross-sectional time has been shown to be crucial when the study sample included a wide range of age cohorts, as the models that used age as the sole time metric relied on the often inaccurate assumption of equivalence between cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of aging (Mendes De Leon, 2007; Morrell et al., 2009). We further accounted for possible curvilinear patterns in cognitive functioning by including quadratic terms for time and age. Finally, we added an interaction term between age at baseline and time to capture potential age-differences in longitudinal changes in cognitive decline.

We estimated two sets of models based on the two measures of volunteering: volunteer status and time commitment. We first estimated a model with volunteering and PGS-AD, as well as five ancestry-specific principal components to adjust for possible population stratification (Ware et al., 2018), along with all study variables (Table 2, Model 1A for volunteer status and Model 1B for volunteer time commitment). The level-1 WP estimates from this model allowed us to investigate whether participants reported a higher level of cognitive functioning when they volunteered compared to when they did not volunteer. The abbreviated multilevel equation predicting person i’s cognitive functioning at time t was as follows: Cognitivefunctioningti=γ00+γ10(Timeti)+γ20(Volunteeringti−Volunteeringi)+γ30(TVCti−TVCi)+γ01(PGS-ADi)+γ02(Volunteeringi)+γ03(TVCti)+γ04(TICi)+γ06(Timei)+u0i+eti

where γ00 was the participant-specific intercept, γ10, γ20, and γ01 were the coefficients for time (level-1), WP volunteering (status or time commitment; level-1), and PGS-AD (level-2), respectively. Following Curran and Bauer (2011), γ06 (i.e., person-mean of time) was also added to the model to adjust for panel observations that were unbalanced with respect to time.

The question of whether volunteering at each wave attenuated the rate of cognitive decline within the same person was addressed in Model 2 with the inclusion of an interaction term for time and volunteer characteristics. We also tested in the model whether a steeper cognitive decline was observed among those at higher polygenic risk for AD with an interaction term between time and PGS-AD. Because the interaction terms involving quadratic time (with volunteering and PGS-AD) were not statistically significant, these were excluded from the final model. The question of whether the link between volunteering and cognitive decline was more pronounced for individuals at higher polygenic risk for AD was addressed in Model 3 with the three-way interaction term involving linear time, volunteering, and PGS-AD. Finally, as the interaction terms involving volunteering and time also included within person and between-person components, between-person effects for the interaction terms were controlled in the models (Loeys et al., 2018; Schunck, 2013). All analyses were performed using the MIXED procedure in Stata (Version 15.1).

3. Results

3.1. Study sample characteristics

Characteristics of the study sample at baseline are presented in Table 1. On average, participants scored 24.7 out of a maximum of 35 on the cognitive battery and the distribution of the PGS-AD for the participants corresponded to a normal curve. More than forty percent of the sample identified as volunteering at baseline, and among those who volunteered, the majority committed less than 100 hours to volunteering annually. Of the 20,562 person-wave observations of volunteering (assessed as volunteer status) recorded during the study period, about 52% were categorized as volunteering less than 100 hours annually (10,694 observations), followed by 100–199 (5,159 observations; 25.1%) and 200+ annual volunteer hours (4,709 observations; 22.2%).

3.2. Multilevel model results

The multilevel models addressing the research question regarding the associations between volunteering, PGS-AD, and the level of cognitive functioning are presented in Table 2 (Model 1A based on volunteer status, Model 1B based on time commitment). The estimated parameters involving time and age were statistically significant, indicating changes in cognitive functioning accelerated over time and across age. After adjusting for the time and age trends, as well as the effects of all study variables, we found that PGS-AD was associated with the level of cognitive functioning at baseline in the expected negative direction. As shown in Model 1A, participants scoring one standard deviation above the mean on PGS-AD had a cognitive functioning level that was 0.09 lower than their counterparts with a mean PGS-AD score (p = .005; similar results in Model 1B). The small size of the estimate is attributable to the fact that some of the “pathway” characteristics (e.g., education, work status) that underlie the link between PGS-AD and cognitive functioning in later life are also included in the model; in a separate model (not shown) adjusted for time, age, gender, and ancestry-specific principal components, the parameter estimate for PGS-AD was −0.14 (p &lt; .001). WP estimates for volunteering, assessed both as status and time commitment, were associated with the level of cognitive functioning in the expected positive direction. Participants showed a higher level of cognitive functioning during the waves when they volunteered compared to when they did not volunteer (Model 1A: b = 0.26, p &lt; .001). As shown in Model 1B, compared to when they did not volunteer, participants also demonstrated higher cognitive functioning when they volunteered 1–99 hours (b = 0.21, p &lt; .001), 100–199 hours (b = 0.31, p &lt; .001), and 200+ hours (b = 0.44, p &lt; .001), respectively.

Further, the statistically significant WP effects were independent of the BP cognitive functioning differences found for those who volunteered more often during the observation period compared to those who volunteered less or did not volunteer. This is shown by the significant BP effects for volunteering; that is, individuals who volunteered more often (assessed both as status and time commitment) showed higher levels of cognitive functioning compared to their counterparts, as indicated by the statistically significant estimates that are generally larger compared to the corresponding WP estimates. Finally, all covariates, when significant, were associated with cognitive functioning in the expected direction based on past research.

Next, we tested the associations between volunteering, PGS-AD, and the rate of change in cognitive decline (see Table 3). In Models 2A and 2B, we first introduced the interaction terms for volunteering and time, as well as for PGS-AD and time, to estimate whether the respective characteristics were associated with changes in cognitive functioning over time. In Model 2A, volunteer status was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline, such that older adults showed a less steep cognitive decline during waves when they volunteered compared to when they did not volunteer (b = 0.11, p &lt; .001; see Fig. 1). Similarly, in Model 2B, compared to when they did not volunteer, participants showed slower cognitive decline during waves when they volunteered 1–99 hours (b = 0.08, p &lt; .001), 100–199 hours (b = 0.13, p &lt; .001), and 200+ hours (b = 0.16, p &lt; .001), respectively. Also, participants who had higher PGS-AD showed a more rapid cognitive decline compared to their counterparts with lower PGS-AD (b = −0.02, p = .001; see Fig. 2).

We then tested whether the link between volunteering and cognitive decline was more pronounced for those at higher PGS-AD compared to those at low risk with the three-way interaction term for volunteering, PGS-AD, and time in Models 3A and 3B (see Table 3). When volunteer status was examined (Model 3A), the three-way interaction term was not statistically significant (b = 0.02, p = .07). In Model 3B the interaction term was statistically significant, indicating that the within-person deceleration of cognitive decline associated with volunteering 100–199 hours relative to not volunteering was moderated by one’s genetic predisposition for AD risk (b = 0.07, p = .003, see Fig. 3).

Further, we engaged in supplementary analyses to identify at what range of the PGS-AD distribution the within-person linkage between volunteering and slower cognitive decline was significant. The supplementary analysis indicated that it was participants with PGS-AD scores higher than 1SD below the mean (≈85% of the study sample) for whom volunteering 100–199 hours led to a significantly slower cognitive decline, with the deceleration of cognitive decline becoming more pronounced as one’s genetic disposition for developing AD becomes greater (see Supplementary Fig. S1). As demonstrated in Fig. 3 and Fig. S1, the deceleration of cognitive decline associated with volunteering 100–199 was not statistically significant for those who were genetically protected against developing AD (e.g., individuals with PGS-AD score 2SD below the mean).

Finally, given that the measure of cognitive functioning is considered to have a two-factor structure consisting of episodic memory (range: 0–20) and mental status (serial 7s, backward counting, naming tests of objects and presidents, date recall; range: 0–15) (Mcardle et al., 2007), we engaged in additional sensitivity analyses to analyze each domain of cognitive functioning as separate outcomes (See Supplementary Tables S1–S4). The substantive pattern of results was consistent with the main findings, and the three-way interaction effect was also found to be significant when volunteering was assessed as a status variable in the model predicting mental status (See Table S4). We also performed sensitivity analyses where the models were further adjusted for an additional set of covariates (e.g., parental education, informal helping, and functional limitations). Findings from the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the findings from the more parsimonious models (See Tables S5 and S6).

4. Discussion

In light of the public health burden posed by the AD epidemic across the globe and the related research efforts to identify modifiable risk factors for this and related diseases, this study contributed to the scientific literature by providing an empirical test of earlier claims that volunteering should be considered a form of health intervention that could help to reduce or delay the onset of AD (Anderson et al., 2014). Based on nine waves of longitudinal data collected from a large sample of older adults of European ancestry in the U.S., we examined whether engaging in formal volunteering was associated with a higher level of cognitive functioning and a slower cognitive decline and whether such protective effects were more pronounced for individuals at high genetic risk for developing AD. Our findings indicated robust within-person associations between volunteering and cognitive functioning, regardless of how volunteering was measured (i.e., status or time commitment). Further, in line with a recent study showing healthful gene-regulatory function served by volunteerism among older adults (Seeman et al., 2020), our findings provided initial evidence for how engaging in formal volunteering may help to slow cognitive decline associated with genetic disposition for developing AD.

The robust statistical associations between volunteering and cognitive functioning reported here were generally in line with two recent studies based on the HRS (Infurna et al., 2016; Proulx et al., 2017). We contributed to this small but growing body of work by taking a within person analytic approach, which helped to partly alleviate selection bias. That is, unlike comparing cognitive functioning of volunteers to that of non-volunteers (or those who volunteered different hours), our findings indicated that the level of cognitive functioning and rate of decline were healthfully altered during times when individuals volunteered compared to other times when they did not volunteer. It is important to note that the significant WP linkage between volunteering and cognitive functioning found in this study was independent of the significant between-person differences in cognitive functioning observed between frequent volunteers and their non-volunteer counterparts. Although not directly comparable due to differences in study design, we also found that, compared to non-volunteers, volunteering for any number of hours significantly forestalled cognitive decline, providing counterevidence to earlier reports that suggested a threshold effect of volunteering on cognitive well-being (Anderson et al., 2014; Proulx et al., 2017). It may be that our findings for volunteering hours roughly approximated a linear dose-response relationship (see Models 1B and 2B); still, research with more fine-grained data on hours volunteered is needed to verify this result.

Perhaps the most novel finding from this study was that the link between volunteering and cognitive decline was moderated by one’s genetic predisposition for developing AD, as indicated by the three-way interaction estimates involving volunteering, PGS-AD, and time. Whereas the interaction term was not significant when volunteering was assessed as a status variable in Model 3A (but see also Table S4), the interaction effect was statistically significant when volunteering was assessed as time committed to volunteering in Model 3B (see Table 3 and Tables S2 and S4). Specifically, individuals with higher PGS-AD (compared to those with lower scores) appeared to reap greater benefits in terms of the within-person association between volunteering 100–199 hours (relative to not volunteering) and slower cognitive decline.

In terms of modifying the association between PGS-AD and cognitive decline, it is possible that volunteering less than 100 annual hours (≈2 weekly hours) presented an insufficient dosage of this form of prosocial behavior for the “under-the-skin” effect to take place in a meaningful manner. Also, volunteering more than 200 hours annually (≈4 weekly hours) may have created conflict for volunteers in terms of their ability to achieve other social role obligations (Thoits, 2012), and such role conflict may have undermined the stress-buffering effect of this form of helping behavior with respect to facilitating a gene-regulatory function (Brown and Okun, 2014). This pattern may have been especially the case for those older adults who engaged in very high levels of volunteering. For example, an earlier study indicated that negative affect, a strong correlate of psychological distress, increased for volunteers who volunteered more than 800–1000 annual hours (Windsor et al., 2008). Future studies should evaluate these potential explanations by examining whether the association between volunteer hours and cognition was mediated by role conflict and biomarkers of stress (e.g., cortisol), as well as neurohormonal correlates of the caregiving system. Also, more research is needed to clarify the issue of dose-responsivity, especially regarding whether and how dose of volunteering influences direct effects and the moderating pathways linking volunteering and cognition.

4.1. Study limitations

First, we were not able to consider specific types of volunteer work as well as continuous measures of volunteer hours due to HRS data limitations. Future studies should consider the nature of the volunteer work, as well as types of activities (e.g., physical, cognitive) embedded in the volunteer work experience to elucidate the pathways linking volunteering and cognitive functioning. Assessment of volunteering experience should also more precisely quantify the amount of time spent in volunteering and the extent to which it involved prosocial activity in order to more accurately address the issue of dose-responsivity. Second, despite the within-person analytic approach taken in this study to account for time-invariant omitted variable bias, the findings were still subject to potential bias related to omitted variables that varied over time. Third, although the full HRS is nationally representative of the population 51 and older in the U.S., the current study sample is not, given the study sample criteria discussed earlier. Further, findings from this study based on European ancestry adults could not be generalized to other race and ethnic groups, for whom AD may pose a greater threat. Although the HRS provided PGS-AD for individuals of African ancestry (PGS-AD not available in the HRS for other race and ethnic groups in the U.S.), the PGS-AD score was largely unrelated to cognitive functioning among the African American sample in supplementary analyses (results available upon request), consistent with findings from an earlier study (Marden et al., 2016). Future studies should investigate whether similar associations between volunteering, PGS-AD, and cognitive functioning exist for other race and ethnic groups when PGS-AD data with better predictive qualities become available. Fourth, multistage probability sampling design factors, as well as survey attrition, may reduce or increase bias in estimates of relationships like those reported here. Further, it is possible that mortality selection may have confounded studies of genetic associations, which may have been the case for the HRS as a subset of the HRS sample experienced death before genetic data were first collected in 2006 (Domingue et al., 2017). To partly address these concerns, we engaged in a set of sensitivity analyses based on a subsample of participants from the 1998 wave and adjusted the analyses by employing inverse probably weights while accounting for the HRS sample geographical stratification and clustering (Ding et al., 2019). The substantive findings from the sensitivity analyses remained consistent with the main findings (See Supplementary Tables S7 and S8; Heeringa et al., 2017), which was in line with earlier studies that found limited evidence for bias caused by mortality selection when estimating genetic associations between PGS measures and their target phenotypes in the HRS sample (Ding et al., 2019; Domingue et al., 2017).

5. Conclusions

This primary innovation of this study was the incorporation of genetic risk for AD (PGS-AD) when investigating the link between volunteering and cognitive functioning using a large national sample of older adults of European ancestry in the U.S. Our findings indicated that volunteering conferred cognitive benefits in terms of alleviating the pace of cognitive decline, particularly for those who are genetically at risk for AD. Apart from the main findings related to the cognitive benefits of volunteering, this study also provided additional observational evidence for the link between PGS-AD and rapid cognitive decline, also identified in a small number of earlier studies (e.g., Marden et al., 2016). The within-person analytic approach taken in this study also provided an innovative strategy for investigating whether volunteering may be considederd as a modifiable health beaviour in the context of cognitive decline and genetic risk for AD. The small but significant cognitive health benefits of volunteering should be understood in the context of the magnitude of the problems posed by the AD epidemic around the globe. Recent estimates suggested that treatments that could delay the onset of AD by five years would result in saving up to a trillion dollars related to the cost of care by 2035 (Alzheimer’s Association, 2015). As even small delays in the age of onset of cognitive decline and AD can lead to significant reductions regarding the public health burden, future studies should examine whether similar cognitive benefits exist for other forms of helping behaviors often performed in later life, such as informally helping neighbors, caregiving for an ill family member, and grandparenting (Luo et al., 2019; Uccheddu et al., 2019).
