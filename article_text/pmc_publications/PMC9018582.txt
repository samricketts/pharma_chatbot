In disease diagnosis, individuals are usually assumed to be one of two basic types, healthy or diseased, as typically based on an established gold standard. Candidate markers for diagnosing a disease often are much cheaper and less invasive than the gold standard, but must be evaluated against the gold standard for their sensitivity and specificity to accurately diagnose the disease. When candidate diagnostic markers are fully measured, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves have been the standard approaches for assessing diagnostic accuracy. However, full measurements of diagnostic markers may not be available above or below certain limits due to various practical and technical limitations. For example, in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, the Roche Elecsys® immunoassays have a measuring range for multiple CSF molecular concentrations. Many cognitive tests used in diagnosing dementia due to AD are also subject to detection limits, often referred as the floor and ceiling effects in the neuropsychological literature. We propose a new statistical methodology for estimating the diagnostic accuracy when a diagnostic marker is subject to detection limits by dividing the entire study sample into two sub-samples by a threshold of the diagnostic marker. We then propose a family of estimators to the area under the ROC curve (AUC) by combining a conditional nonparametric estimator and another conditional semi-parametric estimator derived from a Cox’s proportional hazards model. We derive the variance to the proposed estimators, and further assess the performance of the proposed estimators as a function of possible thresholds through an extensive simulation study, and recommend the optimum thresholds.

pmc1. Introduction

In medical diagnosis of a disease, individuals are often assumed to be one of two basic types ---healthy or diseased, according to an established gold standard which are typically invasive and/or expensive. Usually, candidate diagnostic markers are much cheaper and less invasive, but must be evaluated against the gold standard for their sensitivity and specificity to accurately diagnose the disease. When candidate diagnostic markers are fully measured, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves have been the standard approaches for measuring the diagnostic accuracy. Summary measures, such as the area under the ROC curve (AUC1–3) and the Youden index,4 have been used to assess diagnostic accuracy, as well as to compare them across multiple candidate markers so that the most accurate diagnostic markers may be identified. The AUC is especially appealing because of its intuitive probabilistic interpretation. Namely, the AUC represents the probability that test results for a randomly selected individual from the diseased population and another randomly selected individual from the healthy population will be ranked in the correct order. A large body of literature exists about the statistical inferences of the AUC. Both parametric and nonparametric approaches have been proposed. The main advantage of using parametric approaches is that they fit a smooth ROC curve from which the AUC can be easily estimated. These approaches often require strong assumptions about the distribution of the test results and/or the ROC curve.5 Estimation of model parameters, and then the AUC, often is obtained by the maximum likelihood method, which also serves as the foundation for standard likelihood-based inferences, especially if the sample sizes are relatively large. 3,6 Nonparametric approaches, which do not require distributional assumption, also have been well established in the literature for estimating AUC and comparing it across multiple markers, in both settings of independent samples and dependent samples over which the diagnostic markers are observed. An intuitive nonparametric estimator, often considered as the gold standard in estimating AUC, is obtained by simply ranking paired individuals with one from each group, the diseased and the healthy (see Section 3.2 below), across all possible pairs from the samples.7–8 This nonparametric estimator has been further generalized to handle the situation when study samples are clustered. 9 The statistical methodology of ROC curve has also been extended to account for more complex diagnostic situations, including time-dependent ROC curves (i.e., when the gold standard diagnosis refers to a future time point when disease progression will be observed), 10 and ROC surfaces and the volume under the surface11–15 when the gold standard diagnosis is subject to more than 2 and often ordered categories or even considered as continuous. 16 A comprehensive review and summary for the theory and application of the analysis of ROC curves, especially in the area of diagnostic medicine is available.17

In many diagnostic studies, however, candidate diagnostic markers cannot be accurately measured above or below certain limits due to practical and technical limitations. For example, in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia using molecular concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the Roche Elecsys® immunoassays have a measuring range of 200–1700 pg/mL for CSF Aβ42 concentration, and a measuring range of 80–1300 pg/mL and 8–120 pg/mL, respectively, for CSF total tau and phosphorylated tau concentration18. Further, many cognitive tests are also subject to detection limits, often referred as the floor and/or ceiling effects. For example, the Trailmaking tests19 provide important cognitive information in the amnestic domain about visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, as well as executive functioning. The test of Trailmaking A consists of 25 circles on a piece of paper with the numbers 1–25 written randomly in the circles. The test taker’s task is to start with number one and draw a line from that circle to the circle with number two in it and then to the circle with three in it. The person continues to connect the circles in numerical order until they reach number 25. The test of Trailmaking B consists of 24 circles on a piece of paper, but rather than all of the circles containing numbers, half of the circles have the numbers 1–12 in them and the other half (12) contain the letters A-L. The person taking the test draws a line from one circle to the next in ascending order; however, he or she must alternate the circles with numbers and letters. Trailmaking A and B are scored by how long the person takes to complete the test. Test takers will be stopped by the test administrator if they cannot complete Trailmaking A within 150 seconds and B within 300 seconds.

Statistical analyses of data subject to detection limits in the context of diagnostic accuracy have been studied in the literature, but to a much lesser degree than the case when data are subject to no detection limits. One simple, but often naïve, approach is to set measurements that are censored equal to the detection limits, and then perform the usual ROC analysis as if these censored values are fully measured.20 Another simple approach is to impute the censored values with a rather arbitrary value either below the lower limit or above the upper limit. 21–22 Although such a technique provides a computationally simple way to deal with the problem, Perkins et al. showed that any replacement value for the censored data as described above results in biased estimates to the AUC.23 Parametric approaches have also been proposed. Mumford et al. focused only on normally distributed biomarkers.24 Perkins et al. and Vexler et al. used common parametric models for the distribution of the diagnostic markers including the binormal and the bigamma models.25–27 These parametric models are all based on the maximum likelihood estimates first to the parameters, and then to the AUC. Finally, Bantis et al. focused on constructing smooth ROC curves by estimating the cumulative hazard functions through monotonic natural splines, 28 and by resorting to certain parametric models, e.g., binormal models with Box-Cox transformations or generalized gamma models. 29 Their approaches require a linear extrapolation of the cumulative hazards function curves beyond the last knots and the parametric assumptions.

On the other hand, nonparametric approaches, or approaches that are subject to minimal parametric assumptions of distributions, may be much preferred in estimating and comparing diagnostic accuracy as measured by the AUC when diagnostic markers is subject to detection limits. These are especially relevant when the diagnostic accuracy are to be compared across different modalities of biomarkers, e.g., CSF molecular concentrations vs. cognitive tests in diagnosing AD dementia, simply due to the fact that different biomarkers across multiple modalities are subject to not only very different measurement units, but most importantly, very different distributions. Whereas a large body of literature exists for estimating the diagnostic accuracy and comparing it across markers without relying on specific parametric distributions when diagnostic markers are fully observed, nonparametric inferences on ROC curves and the AUC remain largely missing when diagnostic markers are subject to detection limits. Given that the detection limits of the measurements imply that a portion of the distribution in the diagnostic markers can never be accurately estimated, it is important to realize that a completely nonparametric inference on the AUC may not be possible. Hence, a more realistic, and likely the optimal approach in terms of amount of distributional assumptions, is to allow minimal parametric assumptions, e.g., semiparametric models, for only a portion of the distribution where the diagnostic markers are either too small or too large, e.g., where the detection limits occur. Further, the inclusion and adjustment of covariates in the estimation and comparison of the AUC when markers are subject to detection limits remain thus far largely elusive in the literature.

In this article, we propose a novel method for estimating the diagnostic accuracy as measured by the AUC when a diagnostic marker is subject to an upper detection limit, by dividing the entire distribution of the diagnostic marker into two parts with a threshold that is less than the upper detection limit. We propose in Section 2 a family of estimators to the single AUC by combining a conditional nonparametric estimator from the portion of the distribution when the marker is fully measured, and another conditional semi-parametric estimator derived from a Cox’s proportional hazards model from the portion of the distribution where some of the measurements are censored (by the upper detection limit). We derive the variance to the proposed estimators in Section 3, and further propose a method to allow inclusion of covariates in the estimation of the AUC with an upper detection limit. We assess the performance of the proposed estimators as a function of possible thresholds through an extensive simulation study in Section 4, and recommend the optimum thresholds. Finally, we implement the proposed methodology in Section 5 to a real world study of AD, and assess and compare the ability of several CSF biomarkers and cognitive tests that are subject to detection limits in diagnosing early stage AD dementia.

2. AUC when a candidate diagnostic marker is subject to an upper limit of detection

We assume that a disease is diagnosed in a binary way by a gold standard. Let D+ and D− denote the diseased (i.e., the positive condition) group and the healthy (i.e., the negative condition) group, respectively. We also assume that a candidate diagnostic test (or marker), T, is a continuous random variable and follows the convention that higher values of the test result are more indicative of the disease. Let T− be the test result for a random subject in group D−, T+ the test result for another random subject in group D+. Let Sd(t) be the corresponding survival function for Td, d = −, +. Let I be the indicator which takes 1 for the diseased and 0 for the healthy group. Let L (a constant) be the upper detection limit of the diagnostic test. We focus here only on the case of an upper limit of detection, and point out that the proposed methodology below can be readily extended and applied to the case of a lower limit of detection. We choose a threshold t to divide the distribution of T into two parts, larger than or at most t. Then the area under the ROC curve of T is (1) A=P(T−&lt;T+)=P(T−&lt;T+≤t)+P(T−&lt;T+,T+&gt;t)=P(T−&lt;T+,T+≤t,T−&lt;t)+P(T−&lt;T+,T+&gt;t,T−≤t)+P(T−&lt;T+,T+&gt;t,T−&gt;t)=P(T−&lt;T+,|T+≤t,T−&lt;t)P(T+≤t,T−&lt;t)+P(T−&lt;T+|T+&gt;t,T−&gt;t)P(T+&gt;t,T−&gt;t)+P(T+&gt;t,T−≤t)=A1(t)+A2(t)+A3(t),

where A1=B1(t)1−S+t1−S−t,

B1t=PT−&lt;T+,|T+≤t,T−&lt;t,

A2t=B2tS+tS−t,

B2t=PT−&lt;T+T+&gt;t,T−&gt;t,

and A3(t)=[1−S−(t)]S+(t).

Notice that, whereas A does not depend on the threshold t, Equation (1) holds for any t, which allows us to estimate A by a family of estimators by varying the choice of t. Specifically, each term in Equation (1) can be nonparametrically estimated without specific assumption on the distributions of T+, T−, except for P(T− &lt; T+|T+ &gt; t, T− &gt; t)) which can only be estimated with some assumptions on the distributions, especially when t is the upper limit of detection or beyond.

We now assume that t is chosen so that t &lt; L, the upper detection limit. We further assume a Cox’s proportional hazards model for marker U=T-t, 30 given T&gt;t, i.e., for any subject, the corresponding hazard function for U is (2) huI=i=h0uexpα(t)i,

where i=0, 1, is the indicator of healthy and disease groups, respectively, h0(u) is the baseline hazard and α(t) is the Cox regression coefficient depending on the cutoff t. The model then implies that the survival function for U is SuI=1=S(u|I=0)expα(t).

Therefore, the area under the ROC curve for T, given T+ &gt; t, T− &gt; t, is (3) B2(t)=PT−&lt;T+|T+&gt;t,T−&gt;t=∫0∞S(u|I=1)f(u|I=0)du=11+eα(t),

where f(u|I = 0) is the probability density function of U in group D−. Hence, as long as for some t, U=T-t follows a Cox proportional hazards model, B2(t) can be estimated because α(t) can be estimated.

3. A family of estimators to the AUC when a candidate diagnostic marker is subject to an upper limit of detection

3.1. Estimating AUC without covariates

Assume now that a random sample of T+,T1+,T2+,…,Tn++, and a random sample of T−,T1−,T2−,…,Tn−−, are observed from D+ and D−, respectively. For a given t&lt;L, let D+t={i|Ti+≤t}, D−t=iTi−≤t, and let N+ (t), N−(t) be the cardinality of D+ (t), D−(t) respectively. Notice that N+ (t), N−(t) are both random variables. We first derive the conditional estimate for A, given N+ (t), N+(L) N− (t), N−(L) by assuming that N+ (t), N+(L) N− (t), N−(L) will take on the values which make all computations below mathematically meaningful (i.e., no zero in the denominators). Let S−^t=1−N−tn−,

S+^t=1−N+tn+,

be the nonparametric estimate to the survival function of T in D− and N+, respectively. Conditioning on N+ (t), N+(L) N− (t), N−(L) we can estimate the area under the ROC curve by (4) A^=A1^t+A2^t+A3^t,

where A1^t=B1^(t)1−S+^(t)1−S−^(t),

A2^t=B2^tS+^tS−^t,

A3^(t)=[1−S−^(t)]S+^(t).

Here B1t=PT−&lt;T+|T+≤t,T−&lt;t

can be estimated non-parametrically by B1^t=∑i∈D−t,j∈D+t1Ti−&lt;Tj+N+tN−t;

and B2t=PT−&lt;T+T+&gt;t,T−&gt;t

can be estimated semi-parametrically by B2^(t)=11+eα(t)^

Conditional on N+ (t), N−(t), N− (L), N−(L) the variance of B1^(t) can be readily estimated, as given by Equation (2) in DeLong et al.7 Specifically, VarB1^tN+t,N−t,N+L,N−L=1N−tW−(t)+1N+tW+(t),

where W+(t)=1N+t−1∑j∈D+t[D+Tj+−B1^t]2

W−(t)=1N−t−1∑i∈D−t[D−Ti−−B1^t]2,

and D+Tj+=1N−t∑i∈D−t1{Ti−&lt;Tj+},

D−Ti−=1N+t∑j∈D+t11{Ti−&lt;Tj+}.

The conditional expectation of A1^t is E[A1^tN+t,N−t,N+L,N−L=B1t1−S+^t1−S−^t.

The conditional expectation of A2^t can be approximated by, E[A2^tN+t,N−t,N+L,N−L=B2tS+^tS−^t.

The conditional variance of A2^t is Var[A2^tN+t,N−t,N+L,N−L=Var[B2^tN+t,N−t,N+L,N−LS+^t2S−^t2,

where Var[B2^tN+t,N−t,N+L,N−L can be estimated after fitting the Cox model (3) on subjects whose observations are larger than t. Specifically, Var[B2^tN+t,N−t,N+L,N−L can be based on an approximation to log hazards ratio:31 Var[α^tN+t,N−t,N+L,N−L=1N+L−N+t+1N−L−N−t,

where Nd (L) − Nd (t) is the number of subjects whose test score is actually observed (not censored, i.e., ‘events’) from group Dd, d = +, −, i.e., below the upper detection limit L and above t. Hence, the variance of B2^t, conditional on N+ (t), N−(t), N+ (L), N−(L), can be estimated by applying the Delta method, Var[B2^tN+t,N−t,N+L,N−L=e2α^t1+eα^t41N+L−N+t+1N−L−N−t.

Notice that all the above estimations are only mathematically possible when N+ (t) ≥ 2, N+(L) − N+ (t) ≥ 1, n+ ≥ N+(L) and N− (t) ≥ 2, N−(L) − N− (t) ≥ 1, n− ≥ N−(L). Hence, all (unconditional) inferences below will be subject to these restrictions. For d = +, −, let Cnd,ud,vd=nd!ud!vd!nd−ud−vd!.

Let p+u+,v+,t=C(n+,u+,v+)[1−S+(t)]u+S+t−S+(L)v+[S+(t)]n+−u+−v+∑u+,v+C(n+,u+,v+)[1−S+(t)]u+S+t−S+(L)v+[S+(t)]n+−u+−v+,

and p−u−,v−,t=C(n−,u−,v−)[1−S−(t)]u−S−t−S−(L)v−[S−(t)]n−−u−−v−∑u−,v−C(n−,u−,v−)[1−S−(t)]u−S−t−S−(L)v−[S−(t)]n−−u−−v−

be the probability of N+ (t) = u+, N+ (L) − N+ (t) = v+ and the probability of N− (t) = u−, N− (L) − N− (t) = v−, respectively. Notice the sums in the denominators of these probabilities are over 2 ≤ u+, 1 ≤ v+, u+ + v+ ≤ n+, and 2 ≤ u−, 1 ≤ v+, u− + v− ≤ n−, respectively. Finally, the (unconditional) variance of A^ is (5) Var(A^)=Var{E[A^∣N+(t),N−(t),N+(L),N−(L)]}+E{Var[A^∣N+(t),N−(t),N+(L),N−(L)]}.

The first term in the above sum can be estimated by first applying the Delta method, and then plugging into the estimates, Var^B1t1−S+^t1−S−^t+[1−S−^(t)]S+^(t)+B2tS+^tS−^t

=S+^t[1−S+^t]n+1−B1^t1−S−^t+B2^tS−^t2

S−^t[1−S−^t]n−B2^t−1S+^t−B1^t1−S+^t2.

The second term in Equation (5) can be obtained by E{Var[A^|N+t,N−t,N+L,N−L]}

=∑u+,v+,u−,v−p+u+,v+,tp−u−,v−,tVarB1^t(u+u−)2(n+n−)2+[n+−u+n−−u−]2(n+n−)2e2α^t1+eα^t41v++1v−.

Notice here that (1) is valid for any t&lt;L. Hence, a family of estimators to A can be obtained as in (4) by varying the choice for t as long as 2 ≤ N+(t), 1 ≤ N+(L) − N+(t), and 2 ≤ N−(t), 1 ≤ N−(L) − N−(t). Finally, we propose a family of 95% confidence interval (CI) estimate to A as (6) A^±1.96Var(A^).

Notice that these estimators we have proposed above combine both nonparametric and semiparametric components. Appropriate considerations must be given to the choice of threshold to assure adequate performance of the estimators. When t is chosen to be closer to the upper detection limit L, the nonparametric portion outweighs the semiparametric portion in the estimator, but may raise the concern whether the semiparametric portion of the estimator would behave well due to the relatively small number of ‘events’ in the Cox proportional hazards model. On the other hand, when very small t is chosen far away from L, the semiparametric portion outweighs the nonparametric portion in the estimators, but may raise the concern on whether the estimators are reasonably robust against deviations from the semiparametric model. Another important and practical consideration in the choice of threshold t is an adequate sample size for the Cox proportional hazards model, or more precisely, the number of ‘events’ to result in reliable estimate to the regression parameter. Much of the recommendations in the literature about sample sizes in Cox regression models are based on some type of rule of thumb that were mostly derived from simulation studies, e.g., number of events per variable (EPV). 32–35 Hence, not all options of t will result in good estimators to the AUC, and it is important to assess the performance of our proposed estimators for different options of t, in terms of both the bias and variance of A^ against a variety of distributional scenarios for the diagnostic test. We will address these issues through a large simulation study in Section 4.

3.2. Estimating AUC with covariates

We now consider the situation that a (continuous) covariate, X, may contribute to the AUC. We first note that Equation (1) can be readily extended to the case when both distributions of T+, T− are further conditioning on X = x, i.e., Ax=PT−&lt;T+|X=x=

PT−&lt;T+,|T+≤t,T−&lt;t,X=xP(T+≤t,T−&lt;t|X=x)

PT−&lt;T+T+&gt;t,T−&gt;t,X=xP(T+&gt;t,T−&gt;t|X=x

+PT+&gt;t,T−≤t|X=x

Similar to Equation (4), Ax can then be estimated by A^x=A1x^t+A2x^t+A3x^t.

Because the Cox’s proportional hazards model allows incorporation of covariates in a straightforward manner, following similar notations as in Section 3 and conditioning on T+ &gt; t, T− &gt; t, X = x, we obtain A2x^t=B2x^tS+^t|xS−^t|x.

The variance of A2x^t can be readily obtained, by relying on the variance of the regression parameter on disease indicator in the Cox’s regression model, and conditioning on T+ &gt; t, T− &gt; t, X = x. Further, A1x^t=B1x^(t)1−S+^(t|x)1−S−^(t|x),

where B1xt=PT−&lt;T+|T+≤t,T−&lt;t,X=x.

We propose to estimate B1x(t) by selecting an interval for the covariate that is centered at x, (x − h, x + h), where h is the bandwidth, and using the similar estimate to B1(t) and its conditional variance as in Section 3.1, i.e., B1x^t=∑i∈Dx−t,j∈Dx+t1Ti−&lt;Tj+Nx+tNx−t,

where Dxd,d=−,+, is the set of subjects within group Dd whose values of the covariate falls into (x − h, x + h), and Nxd(t) is the cardinality of Dxdt,d=−,+, where Dxdt={i|i∈Dxd,Tid≤t}. Hence, we combine the variance estimator to A^x,Var(A^x), using similar approaches as in Equation (5), and propose a family of 95% confidence interval (CI) estimate to Ax, as A^x±1.96Var(A^x).

In addition to the choice of threshold, t, another important parameter here in estimating Ax is the bandwidth h, which can be determined through standard cross-validation procedure. However, given the asymptotic nature of the inferences for both the nonparametric part and the semi-parametric part in our proposed estimators, another concern is whether the interval (x − h, x + h) is wide enough to allow valid inferences on conditional AUC at X=x. Hájek, J. (1969) 36 recommended sample sizes above ~20 in each comparison group for a reasonable normal approximation of the Mann Whitney’s U test (which is equivalent to the nonparametric estimate of the AUC without detection limits). We hence recommend that, when the bandwidth is chosen, it should be large enough to allow ~20 subjects within each disease group, especially when the sample sizes of both groups are close to each other. Further, in the Cox regression model with additional covariate X other than the disease indicator, sample sizes that are needed for the estimated regression parameters to enjoy asymptotic inferences are also an important consideration in deciding the bandwidth.30 One recent study using a large general-practice data set, comprising over 2 million anonymized patient records, indicated that an EPV rule of thumb should be data driven and that EPV ≥ 20 ​ generally eliminates bias in regression coefficients when many low-prevalence predictors are included in a Cox model.37 However, another simulation study suggested the rule of thumb may be too conservative, and found a range of circumstances in which coverage of confidence interval estimates and bias were within acceptable levels despite less than 10 EPV. 38

4. Simulation results

Our simulation study generated data of a candidate diagnostic marker from a range of parametric distributions: (1):T+, T− are both normal (denoted by NN; typically referred as binormal in the literature); (2): T− is normal, and T+ is exponential (denoted by NE); and (3): T+, T− are both exponential (denoted by EE). These scenarios cover major cases from when the distributions of the marker in D+, D− fully satisfy the Cox’s proportional hazards assumption (the EE) to when these distributions severely deviate from the Cox’s models (the NN), allowing us to assess how our proposed estimators and choice of threshold t perform under a range of very different distributional scenarios.

For each distributional scenario as described above and a chosen sample size (n=50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 for each group), 300 complete data sets (i.e., without detection of limits) were first generated for each group, D+, D−, and then randomly paired to estimate the AUC. Specifically, for the NN scenario, data were generated from N(3.5, 12.25) for D+ and N(0.5, 5) for D−, resulting in a true AUC of 0.765. For the NE scenario, data were generated from N(0.5, 5) for D− and an exponential distribution with mean=3.5 for D+, corresponding to a true AUC of 0.772. For the EE scenario, data were generated from an exponential distribution with mean 3.5 for D+ and another exponential distribution with mean 1 for D+, leading to a true AUC of 0.778. For each sample size, all simulated data sets were combined to estimate the 70th, 80th, 90th, and 95th percentiles which were then used as the possible upper detection limits to right censor each complete data set. These right censored data sets were used to estimate the true AUC. Hence, the total amount of censored observations from both D+ and D− combined is approximately 5%, 10%, 20%, or 30%, allowing us to assess how our proposed estimators and the choice of threshold t perform under a range of censoring scenarios. Notice that due to the assumption that large values of the diagnostic marker is associated with the disease, the amount of censoring is more in T+ than in T−, which is typical in real world applications. For each pair of the censored data sets from D+, D−, we computed our proposed estimator to the AUC as a function of threshold t that is smaller than the upper detection limit. For comparison purposes, for each simulated dataset, we also computed the naïve nonparametric estimate to the AUC7 (labeled “naïve” ) by imputing all censored observations by the detection limit, L. The mean bias over 300 estimates of our proposed estimators was computed as the average on the difference between our proposed estimates and the true AUC, and root mean square error (RMSE) of our proposed estimators was also computed over 300 estimates. Coverage was calculated as the percentage of simulations that the true AUC is covered by the proposed 95% confidence intervals.

Figure 1, 2 and 3 present the estimated bias, RMSE, and coverage, respectively, for all 3 distributional scenarios, NN, NE, and EE, as functions of threshold t, the amount of censoring, and the sample size per group. Notice here that in all these figures, the threshold, t, is also defined as the lower percentiles of the combined dataset simulated, and is less than the upper percentiles of the combined dataset used to define the detection limits (i.e., the amount of censoring, from 5% to 30%). These simulation results clearly indicate several main conclusions. First, regardless of the distributional scenarios, if the threshold t is extreme (large or small), our proposed estimator does not perform well as evidenced by the large bias from the left and right tails in Figure 1. This is likely due to the very small sample sizes either to the left or to the right of the threshold. On the other hand, the simulation results indicate that there are a rather wide range of thresholds that our proposed estimators to the AUC have very small bias and RMSE, suggesting that AUC can be accurately estimated by our proposed estimators with appropriately chosen thresholds. Specifically, under the EE scenario for which Cox’s proportional hazards model holds, as expected, the choice of threshold does not seem to matter as the proposed estimators had very small bias and RMSE over the entire range of the threshold. On the other hand, with rather severe deviations from the Cox’s proportional hazards assumption, e.g., under the NN and NE scenarios, the sweet spot to choose the threshold that led to excellent performance of the proposed estimators becomes much narrower. In fact, this sweet spot depends on the amount of censoring as well as the sample size. For example, when the amount of censoring is small, i.e., 5% or 10%, our proposed estimators had very small bias and RMSE if the threshold is between 0.6 and 0.8 (i.e., 60th to 80th percentile). When the amount of censoring is larger, i.e., 20% or 30%, however, the proposed estimators performed better in terms of bias if the threshold is between 0.5 and 0.6 (i.e., 50th to 60th percentile), especially if sample sizes are 200 or larger. Notice here that a threshold from 0.5 to 0.8 indicates that our proposed estimator is more heavily weighted toward the (conditional) nonparametric estimator from the lower portion of the distributions. As expected, when the sample sizes are small (50 or 100), the bias in Figure 1 and the RMSE in Figure 2 are both relatively large. Regardless of the distributional scenarios, however, as long as the sample sizes are reasonably large (&gt;=200), when the threshold t is around 0.6, i.e., the 60th percentile of the combined data, both the bias and the RMSE are very small. In fact, the very small scales in Figure 1 indicate that the bias is +−0.005 of the true AUC, suggesting excellent performance of the proposed estimators. The empirical coverage of the proposed 95% CIs as presented in Figure 3 (notice that the dark dashed lines in Figure 3 represent the 95% coverage) suggest also excellent coverage when the threshold is between 50th and 60th percentile and the amount of censoring is below 10%, regardless of the distributional scenarios and the sample sizes. However, when the amount of censoring is large (20% or above), the proposed CI tends to be too narrow, especially with larger sample sizes. It is also important to note that in our simulations, similar to what were shown in Section 5 below when the proposed estimators were applied to diagnose AD dementia, the estimated AUC, as a function of the threshold t, tended to plateau at the true AUC as t increased, regardless of the distributional scenarios. This observation may provide a practical way for determining the optimum range of thresholds that provide accurate inferences, especially when the proposed methodology is applied to real world research in which no true AUC is available.

Supplemental Figure S1 to S3 present the bias of the naïve estimator obtained by imputing the censored observations by the upper detection limit against our proposed estimators. These figures suggest that the naïve estimator was very biased and subject to larger RMSE, especially when the amount of censoring is large (e.g., at 20% or 30% censoring). The advantage of the proposed estimators is particularly obvious in the EE scenario.

5. Application to diagnosing early stage AD dementia when candidate markers are subject to detection limits

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. There are an estimated 5.8 million Americans of all ages living with Alzheimer-caused dementia in 2019 and the total Medicaid spending of the United States for people with Alzheimer’s or other dementia is projected to top $49 billion in 2019. 39 As the age distribution shifts further over the next quarter century, the increasing prevalence of AD poses a major health care crisis and intensifies the need for greater research efforts towards early detection and diagnosis, treatment, and cure. The AD process begins with a preclinical stage during which either no or very little clinical symptoms can be detected even using most sensitive tests to subtle decrements in cognitive and functional performance. As individuals approach the threshold of dementia, they begin to exhibit subtle signs of functional and cognitive deterioration, suggestive of early stage dementia. Such individuals exhibit mild forgetfulness along with subtle impairment of judgment, home and community activities, or occupational functioning. Many research groups have demonstrated that elders who exhibit this kind of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in memory and daily functioning go on to develop the full-blown syndrome of dementia, which is approximately five to seven times higher than for the age-matched individuals who do not exhibit such impairment. 40–41 Morris et al. further concluded that the earliest stage of AD dementia is represented by MCI, although not all MCI (nor dementia, for that matter) is caused by AD. 42 This transitional or early stage in AD is critical to detect not only because it is indicative of more serious disease development in the future but also because this is the time window for family caregivers to discuss care options and family future planning while the patient can still take part in making these decisions. The earlier the diagnosis of someone with AD dementia, the more likely the person can be remained at home and maintain their levels of functioning. Early diagnosis also may lead eventually to early treatment with some of the investigational drugs that currently are in clinical trials and have shown promise slowing cognitive decline. Because of the subtle clinical symptoms in the early symptomatic stage of AD and the fact that no single cognitive test can determine whether a person has the disease, diagnosing someone in the early stage of AD often is challenging. Enhanced understanding of AD in recent years, however, allows recognition of some of the disease’s earliest manifestations through a variety of tests and biological assessments. These assessments include mental status evaluation through traditional cognitive tests as well as novel biomarkers including molecular concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging biomarkers. 43–44

Many of the neuropsychological tests and the CSF biomarkers used in diagnosing early stage AD are subject to detection limits, either due to the limit of time window allowed for participants to complete a standardized task or due to the insensitivity of assays to detect very low or very high molecular concentration in the CSF samples. We applied our proposed methodology to estimate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of Trailmaking A and B, CSF Aβ42, tau and ptau concentrations from the Roche Elecsys® immunoassays in a harmonized database from 3 ongoing studies of AD: 45 Washington University (WU) Adult Children Study (ACS); 2) WU Healthy Aging and Senile Dementia (HASD) study; and 3) WU Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC). All studies have focused primarily on the preclinical and early symptomatic stages of AD, and/or recruited middle- and old-aged participants at risk for AD and followed them longitudinally with assessments of AD biomarkers, cognition, and everyday function. These studies have also followed identical clinical assessment protocols. Experienced clinicians diagnosed and staged the severity of dementia on the basis of a neurologic examination of the participant and semi-structured interviews with the participant and a knowledgeable collateral source (usually the spouse or an adult child). The clinical assessment protocols are consistent with that of the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center’s Uniform Data Set (UDS) which includes standard diagnostic criteria for detection of dementia and its differential diagnosis. 46 The presence or absence of dementia and, when present, its severity are operationalized with the Clinical Dementia Rating™® (CDR™®) 47 in which a CDR of 0 indicates no dementia, and a CDR of 0.5 indicates very mild dementia comparable to MCI, representing the earliest detectable stage of dementia. Etiological diagnosis was further rendered for those who received a CDR 0.5 or above. The clinicians were unaware of the results of cognitive tests or CSF assessments when CDR and etiological diagnosis were rendered. The data set contained a total of 2398 individuals with data on Trailmaking A and B in which 1848 were CDR 0 and 550 were CDR 0.5. A subset of 550 participants (463 CDR 0, and 87 CDR 0.5) also had data on CSF Aβ42, tau and ptau. Table 1 presents the demographics of the participants with CDR 0 and CDR 0.5 (with a diagnosis of AD) for the entire cohort (called cognitive cohort) as well as for the sub-cohort with CSF biomarker assessments (called CSF cohort). Table 1 also presents the genetic characteristics (i.e., Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes, classified by the presence or absence of ε4 alleles and denoted by the terms APOE ε4 positive and negative, respectively, and descriptive statistics of the candidate diagnostic markers for participants in the cognitive cohort and the CSF cohort.

Figure 4 presents the estimated AUC curve, as a function of threshold, along with its pointwise 95% confidence band for each of the 5 markers: Trailmaking A (traila), Trailmaking B (trialb), CSF Aβ42 (ab42), tau, and ptau. Notice that the estimated AUC curves, as functions of the threshold, tend to stabilize after the threshold reaches a certain level. It is then reasonable to use the stabilizing value to estimate the true AUC, and determine the optimum threshold for each marker as the one when the curve of the estimated AUC started to plateau. We further compared the AUCs between two candidate markers through 1000 bootstrapped datasets by sampling with replacement from the original dataset. Table 2 presents, for each pair of two markers, the paired difference in AUCs along with the 95% bias-corrected bootstrap quantiles-based CI. Our results indicate that all five candidate markers have diagnostic utility in diagnosing early stage symptomatic AD due to the fact that the 95% CIs to their AUCs all stay above 0.5. Comparatively, Trailmaking B has a higher diagnostic accuracy than Trailmaking A, and CSF ptau has a higher diagnostic accuracy than CSF tau. Across the modalities (cognition vs. CSF), CSF Aβ42 has a higher diagnostic accuracy than CSF tau, and both Trailmaking A and Trailmaking B have a better diagnostic accuracy than CSF tau, but have similar diagnostic accuracy as CSF ptau.

Because age is the biggest risk factor for AD, we further examined the diagnostic accuracy of these candidate diagnostic markers as a function of age. Figure 5 presents estimated AUC (i.e., Ax, x=age) for CSF Aβ42, tau and ptau, Trailmaking A, and Trailmaking B, as a function of age, along with their respective 95% pointwise CIs. Three options (2 years, 3 years, and 4 years) for the age bandwidth are presented in Figure 5. The threshold, t, used in these estimations for each of the 5 markers is the same as what was identified in Figure 4 where the curve of estimated AUC started to stabilize. Notice that the estimated AUCs for each marker are quite consistent, regardless of the options for the bandwidth. Further, these curves indicate that age plays a role in the diagnostic accuracy of these markers. For example, Trailmaking B shows a higher diagnostic accuracy when individuals are relatively young (from 60 to 70 years), whereas Trailmaking A seems to exhibit the best diagnostic accuracy when individuals are older (from 70 to 80 years). Figure 6 presents the pairwise differences of the estimated Ax for CSF Aβ42, CSF total tau and phosphorylated tau, Trailmaking A, and Trailmaking B, as a function of age, again using the same 3 options of the bandwidth. Figure 6 also contains for each age, a 95% bootstrap CIs (obtained again from 1000 bootstrap samples with replacement) to pairwise differences on the AUC across all 5 markers. These results suggest that the differences in diagnostic accuracy across 5 markers were not statistically significant at any single age from 60 to 90 years. However, the rather wide CIs are likely due to the limited sample size of the study, which may also be the reason that differences in AUC are not statistically significant. Practically, if age is confirmed to contribute to the diagnostic accuracy in much larger studies, age-specific diagnostic cutoff, sensitivity, and specificity may be needed in accurately diagnosing early AD dementia by clinicians.

6. Discussion

In summary, because the statistical estimation and inferences of diagnostic accuracy in the literature have been largely focused on the case when candidate diagnostic markers are fully measured, the family of the estimators to the AUC we proposed in this study fill in several knowledge gaps in the field. First, to the best of our knowledge, these estimators represent the first effort in combining nonparametric and semiparametric estimators to the overall AUC in the presence of detection limits. Second, our simulation results demonstrate good performance of the proposed estimators, regardless of the distributional scenarios, with a range of possible thresholds. Third, our proposed estimators allow certain degree of freedom in choosing the threshold to combine the nonparametric and semi-parametric estimators, hence facilitating researchers the ability to dictate the level of confidence in the semi-parametric part of the estimators which requires strong parametric assumptions against the nonparametric part of the estimators which is distribution-free. Fourth, the inclusion and adjustment of covariates in the estimation and comparison of the AUC when candidate diagnostic markers are subject to detection limits have been proposed and are feasible, providing a methodological framework to reveal potential genetic and environmental factors (as covariates) that may play important roles in diagnosing diseases. Fifth, the proposed methodology may improve the statistical inferences of diagnostic accuracy even when diagnostic markers are fully measured, by treating the unobserved portion of the distribution as censored by a detection limit. Sixth, our application of the proposed estimators to a real world diagnostic study of early stage AD demonstrates the utility of the proposed methodology, and confirms the diagnostic ability of multiple CSF molecular concentrations and cognitive tests, all of which are subject to detection limits or ceiling and floor effects, a methodological challenge that has largely been ignored by the AD research community thus far. Finally, our proposed methodology also has limitations. First, our proposed estimators do not perform well when the threshold t is too extreme (large or small), as demonstrated by the large bias in Figure 1. Our proposed CI estimates are also too narrow when the amount of censoring is large, as indicated by Figure 3. Second, the choice of threshold t could be subjective, especially in real world applications. Third, it remains an open question as to how to compare the AUC of two correlated markers when both are subject to detection limits. In the absence of a closed form analytic solution, we recommend that readers use bootstrapping techniques to provide inferences on the difference of two correlated AUCs, as we have done in the AD applications.
