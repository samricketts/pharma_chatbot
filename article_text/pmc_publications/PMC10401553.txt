Amyloid formation is a hallmark of many medical diseases including diabetes type 2, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson diseases. Under these pathological conditions, misfolded proteins self-assemble forming oligomers and fibrils, structurally heterogeneous aggregates that exhibit a large variety of shapes and forms. A growing body of evidence points to drastic changes in the lipid profile in organs affected by amyloidogenic diseases. In this study, we investigated the extent to which individual phospho- and sphingolipids, as well as their mixtures can impact insulin aggregation. Our results show that lipids and their mixtures uniquely alter rates of insulin aggregation simultaneously changing the secondary structure of protein aggregates that are grown in their presence. These structurally different protein-lipid aggregates impact cell viability to different extent while using distinct mechanisms of toxicity. These findings suggest that irreversible changes in lipid profiles of organs may trigger formation of toxic protein species that in turn are responsible for the onset and progression of amyloidogenic diseases.

pmc1. Introduction

Amyloid diseases are a large group of severe pathologies that share a common feature, namely the presence of deposits of misfolded proteins within the body [1–3]. Misfolded proteins self-assemble forming oligomeric species that exhibit a large variety of forms and shapes [4,5]. Protein oligomers exert high cell toxicities and play a significant role in the spread of pathologies throughout the body [4,6–11]. They also propagate into insoluble amyloid fibrils, rod-like aggregates with cross-β-sheet secondary structure [10,12]. Cryo-electron microscopy and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ss-NMR) resolved the secondary structure of amyloid fibrils [13–15]. However, the transient nature of oligomers and their morphological heterogeneity limit the use of these classical methods of structural biology for elucidation of the oligomers’ structural organization [16]. To overcomes these limitations, several groups proposed an elegant approach that allow for trapping these oligomers [17,18] For instance, Barghorn et al. discovered that stable homogeneous amyloid β1–42 peptide (Aβ1–42) oligomers could be formed if the monomeric peptide was aggregated at low concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) [19]. Similar findings were reported by Serra-Batiste et al. that observed growth of detergent-stabilized Aβ1–42 oligomers in the presence of dodecyl phosphocholine (DPC) micelles [20]. Although such aggregates exerted cell toxicities, their structural relevance to the native oligomers formed in the absence of detergents remains unclear.

Scanning probe techniques, such as high-speed AFM (HS-AFM) [21,22], as well as optical nanoscopy approaches, such as atomic force microscopy Infrared (AFM-IR) spectroscopy [23–27] and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy [28–32] can be used to overcome these limitations. For instance, HS-AFM was able to reveal structural transformations in islet amyloid precursor peptide (IAPP), Aβ1–42 and α-synuclein (α-Syn) that lead to fibril formation [21,33,34]. These proteins that are directly linked to diabetes type 2, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson diseases, respectively. Furthermore, HS-AFM revealed two aggregation mechanisms of Aβ1–42 that led to formation of straight and spiral fibrils [22]. Using NMR, AFM, mass spectroscopy, and computational simulations, Wei et all found that in solution IAPPs rapidly aggregated into transient dimers and trimers that slowly propagate into higher-order spherical oligomers and elongated fibrils [35]. These findings can help to find targeted therapeutic strategies to block protein aggregation at the early stages.

In AFM-IR, a metalized scanning probe is positioned above the sample of interest that is illuminated by pulsed tunable IR light [36–38]. IR-induced thermal expansions in the sample are recorded by the scanning probe [39,40]. If a resonance frequency of the scanning probe matches the laser frequency, appearing resonance effect enables single-monolayer and even single-molecule sensitivity [41,42]. This high sensitivity and nanometer spatial resolution made AFM-IR highly attractive for structural analysis of wide variety of samples: amyloid fibrils, [23,25,26,43–45] plant epicuticular waxes [46,47], polymers [48], malaria infected blood cells [49], meteorites [50], bacteria [51–53], liposomes [54] and polycrystalline perovskite films [55].

Using AFM-IR, our group was able to determine structural changes that take place upon aggregation of α-Syn [27]. Zhou and co-workers found that α-Syn forms two types of oligomers at the early stages of aggregation: one dominated by α-helical/unordered structure and one mostly composed of antiparallel- and parallel-β-sheet. The first type of oligomers remain unchanged during the course of protein aggregation, whereas antiparallel β-sheet rearrange into parallel-β-sheet secondary in the second type of oligomers upon their propagation into fibrils [27].

A growing body of evidence suggests that a large number of biological molecules can uniquely alter rates of protein aggregation and modify toxicity of oligomers and fibrils.[56–58] For instance, Cataldi and co-workers showed that 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, a product of dopamine oxidation, alters the secondary structure of amyloid β oligomers and increases their toxicity significantly [56]. Galvagnion and co-workers found that lipids either accelerate or decelerate the rate of α-Syn aggregation. This effect is determined by the chemical structure of the lipid, as well as lipid to protein ratio [59–61]. Our group found that lipids not only alter the rates of α-Syn aggregation but also uniquely modify secondary structure of protein oligomers [5]. Similar observations were reported by Zhang et al. for IAPP [62]. Specifically, the researchers showed that low levels of anionic lipids promoted IAPP aggregation and enhanced membrane permeabilization potential of these aggregates. At the same time, zwitterionic lipid did not alter the rate of IAPP aggregation, whereas cholesterol at or below physiological levels significantly decelerated IAPP amyloid formation, as well as lowered the propensity of IAPP aggregates to cause membrane leakage. Lipids can also uniquely alter the structure of amyloid β1–40 (Aβ1–40) aggregates [63]. A critical question is whether this lipid-mediated effect on structure and aggregation kinetics is unique to α-Syn, IAPP and Aβ1–40 or whether it is a general phenomenon applicable to a large group of amyloid-associated proteins.

Insulin is a small hormone that regulates glucose metabolism. If present at high concentrations, insulin forms oligomers and fibrils [30,64]. Insulin aggregation is associated with diabetes type 2, a severe pathology characterized by a suppressed response of cells to insulin [65]. As a result, an overproduction of insulin takes place in the pancreas, triggering insulin misfolding and aggregation. Similar processes are observed upon injection-induced amyloidosis [66,67]. In this case, injection if a high local concentration of insulin in the skin dermis and subcutaneous fat triggers the formation of fibrils [68]. These fibrils in turn may trigger the aggregation of other proteins, a phenomena which results in systemic amyloidosis [69]. In the subcutaneous fat, injected insulin is exposed to lipids, including the phospholipids, ceramides and sphingolipids found in the membranes of cells [70]. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), cardiolipin (CL), ceramide (CER) and sphingomyelin (SM) also occupy significant part of the lipid membranes in most of eucaryotic cells [70–73]. Specifically, PC is the most observed lipid that takes up to 47 % of the membranes, whereas the ~10 % of the organelle and plasma membranes are occupied by PS. Although the contributions of CER and SM are smaller, these lipids take up to 6 % and 4 % of eukaryotic plasma membranes, respectively. CL is unique to the inner mitochondrial membranes where it where it constitutes about 20 % of all present lipids. It should be noted that all chosen lipids for this work possessed C16-C18 saturated fatty acids (FA). Although lipids with unsaturated FA also play an important role in membrane biophysics, elucidation of their impact on insulin aggregation is the subject for a separate study. Therefore, in our study we tested the effect of these lipids, as well as their mixtures, on insulin aggregation. Our findings show that lipids uniquely alter rates of insulin aggregation. Furthermore, lipids modify the morphology and secondary structure of insulin aggregates. Such aggregates exert significantly lower cell toxicities than insulin aggregates grown in the lipid-free environment.

2. Results

2.1. Kinetics of insulin aggregation

We first examined the extent to which lipids can alter the lag-phase and rate of insulin aggregation. For this, insulin was mixed in 1:1 M ratio with PC, PS, CL, SM and CER. The solutions were mixed with ThT and kept at 37 °C under 510 rpm agitation. Insulin aggregation in the lipid-free environment had a well-defined lag-phase that was followed by a rapid increase in the ThT intensity, which indicated a formation of protein aggregates, Fig. 1. We found that lipids can either shorten or delay the lag-phase (tlag) of insulin aggregation (tlag = 14.4 ± 0.8 h), Table S1 and Fig. S1. Specifically, CL (tlag = 3.2 ± 0.5 h), CER (tlag = 7.7 ± 0.5 h) and PS (tlag = 8.2 ± 1.0 h) substantially shortened, whereas SM delayed the lag-phase (tlag = 23.5 ± 1.0 h). We also observed no changes in ThT intensity for Ins:PC, which suggests that PC strongly inhibits insulin aggregation. These findings show that lipids can both shorten and delay the lag-phase of insulin aggregation.

Next, we aimed to reveal the extent to which the effect of CL, which caused the most substantial shortening of the tlag, can be reduced by PC, the lipid that strongly inhibited fibril formation. For this, we aggregated insulin the presence of a mixture of PC and CL at 50:50 and 80:20 M ratios (Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5) and Ins:PC:CL (1:0.8:0.2), respectively). If tlag for Ins:CL was 3.2 ± 0.5 h, tlag for Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5) was 6.8 ± 1.7 h. These findings confirm our hypothesis that presence of PC inhibits acceptation effect of CL on insulin aggregation. We also found that an increase in the relative concentration of PC relative to CL (Ins:PC:CL (1:0.8:0.2)), similarly to PC itself, resulted in the full inhibition of insulin fibril formation.

We have also found that lipids can uniquely alter the rate of insulin aggregation. We found that CL (t1/2 = 6.4 ± 0.3 h), CER (t1/2 = 11.4 ± 1.0 h), PS (t1/2 = 10.9 ± 0.6 h) and Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5) (t1/2 = 9.5 ± 2.9 h) substantially accelerated the rate of protein aggregation (Insulin t1/2 = 18.1 ± 0.4 h), Table S1 and Fig. S1. However, SM (t1/2 = 25.5 ± 0.4 h), on the opposite, decelerated the rate of insulin aggregation. These findings show that lipids uniquely alter both a lag-phase and the rate of insulin aggregation.

2.2. Morphological analysis of insulin aggregates

We utilized AFM to investigate a morphology of insulin aggregates grown in the presence of lipids, as well as in the lipid-free environment, Fig. 2. We found that in the lipid-free environment (Ins), insulin formed prolong fibrillar assemblies with a large distribution of lengths that had on average 12 nm in height, Fig. 2 and Figs. S2–S3. In the presence of CL (Ins:CL), insulin aggregation yielded short (30–60 nm) spherical aggregates and ~ 200 nm long fibrils that had 6–8 nm in height. Similar aggregates have been observed for Ins:CER, Ins:PS and Ins:SM (6–12 nm in height). In the presence of PC, insulin formed only small (4–6 nm in height) oligomers. Aggregates with similar morphologies and dimensions were found for Ins:PC:CL (1:0.8:0.2) together with short, fibril-like structures. An increase in the concentration of CL relative to PC (Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5)), resulted in formation of short (40–70 nm) spherical aggregates and 90–160 nm long fibrils that have ~12 nm in height. These aggregates had similar topologies with those formed by insulin in the presence of CL itself. Summarizing, we can conclude that in the lipid-free environment, insulin aggregates into long fibrils, whereas in the presence of PS, CL, SM and CER short fibrillar species together with spherical oligomers are grown. In the presence of PC, insulin forms only small oligomers. This inhibitory activity of PC is also evident from a comparison of aggregates observed for Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5) and Ins:PC:CL (1:0.8:0.2). An increase in the concentration of PC in the lipid mixture decreases the yield of fibrils and increases the amount of spherical oligomers. These findings show that lipids either significantly alter morphologies of protein fibrils (CL, PS, SM and CER) or strongly inhibit fibril formation (PC).

2.3. Structural characterization of protein aggregates

We utilized CD and ATR-FTIR to examine the secondary structure of insulin aggregates grown in the presence of lipids, as well as in the lipid-free environment. CD spectra of Ins, Ins:CER, Ins:PS, Ins:CL, Ins:SM, as well as Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5) exhibited a trough at ~225 nm, which indicates the dominance of β-sheet in their secondary structure, Fig. 3 and Table S2 [74,75]. However, Ins:PC and Ins:PC:CL (1:0.8:0.2) had drastically different CD spectra with two troughs at 209 and 222 nm. Such spectra are characteristic to proteins with a mixture of α-helical and unordered secondary structures, Fig. S2 [74,75].

ATR-FTIR spectra collected from Ins:PC and Ins:PC:CL (1:0.8:0.2) aggregates exhibited the amide I at ~1657 cm−1, Fig. 3. This observation demonstrates that Ins:PC and Ins:PC:CL (1:0.8:0.2) have primarily α-helix and unordered protein secondary structure. [76,77] In the spectra collected from Ins:CER, Ins:PS, Ins:CL, Ins:SM, as well as Ins:PC: CL (1:0.5:0.5), the amide I was centered at ~1631 cm−1, which indicates the dominance of parallel β-sheet secondary structure in these protein aggregates [76,78]. We have also found that ATR-FTIR spectrum of Ins aggregates exhibited amide I at 1628 cm−1. This finding points on the substantial structural difference between the parallel β-sheet secondary structure in insulin aggregates grown in the lipid-free environment and the aggregates grown in the presence of lipids. Finally, we observed a shoulder at 1657 cm−1 in the amide I region of the spectra collected form Ins, Ins:CER, Ins:PS, Ins:CL, Ins:SM, as well as Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5). This points out on the presence of unordered protein secondary structure in all insulin aggregates [27,79].

One may expect that differences in the structural organization between aggregates that were grown in the presence and absence of lipids can arise from a presence of lipids in such aggregates. ATR-FTIR is insufficient to examine the presence of lipids in the aggregates because if lipid vibrations are observed in the corresponding spectra, we cannot unambiguously determine whether lipids are integrated in the aggregates or simply co-present with such protein aggregates. To overcome this limitation, we used AFM-IR. AFM-IR allows for a direct visualization individual protein aggregates simultaneously enabling their structural analysis. [5,25,26,80]

AFM-IR spectra collected from individual protein aggregates that were grown in the presence of lipids exhibited vibrational bands centered ~800 and 1000–1200 cm−1, Fig. 4. These vibrational bands correspond to C—H and PO2− vibration respectively [80]. We have found that Ins:PS, Ins:PC, Ins:CER and Ins:CL exhibited very strong intensities of ~800 and 1000–1200 cm−1 bands. This finding point on the presence of a significant amount of lipids in their structure. We also found that intensities of 1000–1200 cm−1 bands were substantially lower in the spectra collected from Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5) and Ins:PC:CL (1:0.8:0.2) comparing to the intensities of these bands in the spectra collected from Ins:PS, Ins:PC, Ins:CER and Ins:CL. Previously, we have demonstrated that intensity of PO2− vibration directly depends on the local environment of the lipid head groups. Thus, our AFM-IR results show that the underlying lipid-protein structure of Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5) and Ins:PC:CL (1:0.8:0.2) are drastically different from both Ins:PC and Ins:CL.

AFM-IR analysis of Ins:SM showed significant variability in the intensity of the acquired spectra. In some of the collected spectra intensities of ~800 and 1000–1200 cm−1 vibrations were low whereas in other spectra these bands very found to be very intense. Such fluctuations in the intensities of the vibrational bands point on structural heterogeneity of Ins:SM aggregates. We found that spectra predominantly collected from small spherical aggregates exhibit intense ~800 and 1000–1200 cm−1 vibrations, whereas AFM-IR spectra collected from fibrils often showed low intensities in these regions. This observation shows that lipids primarily present in the pre-fibrillar aggregates and are rarely observed in fibrils. This finding is in a good agreement with previously reported results by our group, as well as other researchers. Specifically, Galvagnion and co-workers hypothesized that proteins utilize lipid layers for their assembly [60,81]. Using AFM-IR, our group showed that such assembly is driven by lipids that form complexes with proteins. [5] Such complexes yield structurally and morphologically different fibrils. AFM-IR results reported in the Fig. 4 confirm that lipids present in all of the analyzed insulin aggregates that were grown in the presence of lipids. We infer that presence of lipids in such aggregates and unique lipid-protein complex play a critically important role for their toxicity.

2.4. Toxicity of insulin aggregates

We utilize mice midbrain N27 cell line and a set of toxicity assays to examined the relationship between oligomer structure and toxicity. Amyloid aggregates are thought to exert toxicities by enhancing ROS production and inducing the mitochondrial dysfunction in cells. [4,56] Therefore, we examined general cell toxicity of insulin aggregates, as well as investigated the extent to which these structures are engaged in ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction of cells, Fig. 5.

LDH test indicated that Ins:CL, Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5), Ins:PC:CL (1:0.8:0.2), Ins:PC, Ins:PS and Ins:SM exhibited significantly lower cell toxicities compared to insulin aggregates grown in the lipid-free environment (Ins), Fig. 5. Specifically, toxicity of Ins:CL and Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5) was twice, whereas toxicity of Ins:PS, Ins:PC and Ins:PC:CL (1:0.8:0.2) was more than three times lower than toxicity of Ins aggregates. Ins:CER exhibited similar cell toxicity to Ins aggregates. Importantly, lipids themselves did not exert any significant cell toxicity.

The results of ROS test were consistent with the results of the discussed above LDH levels that were observed upon the exposure of N27 cell to the insulin aggregates that grown in the lipid-free and lipid-rich environments. We found that Ins aggregates yield significantly higher ROS levels compared to the aggregates grown in the presence of lipids. We have also found that Ins:PC:CL (1:0.8:0.2) and Ins:PC caused the lowest ROS production. ROS response increased from Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5) to Ins:CL, Ins:PS, Ins:SM and Ins:CER.

We also utilized the JC-1 dye, a probe of mitochondrial membrane potential, to examine the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by insulin aggregates. It was found that insulin aggregates grown in the lipid-free environment cause significantly higher mitochondrial dysfunction comparing to the protein aggregates grown in the absence of lipids. Thus, if grown in the presence of lipids, insulin aggregates will exert substantially lower ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction. We have also found that CL, PC:CL (1:1), PC:CL (1:4) and SM exert small but noticeable mitochondrial dysfunction. Overall, our results show that lipids uniquely alter the toxicity of insulin aggregates. Furthermore, the structure and corresponding toxicity of such aggregates is governed by the chemical structure of the lipid.

2.5. Mechanism of insulin aggregates’ toxicity

Protein aggregates can permeabilize the plasma membrane of cells directly or alternatively enter cells via endocytosis. In the former case, amyloid aggregates damage the cell plasma membrane, and this can cause a cell death. [82] In the latter case, protein aggregates accumulate inside endosomes. The aggregates can subsequently be exocytosed to return to the cell’s exterior. However, aggregates may also damage endosomal membranes and leak into the cytosol. They may thus use this route to induce ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction [83,84]. We performed a set of biochemical assays to determine whether insulin aggregates are endocytosed by cells and whether they cause damage to the endosomal membranes. Such damages initiate endosomal repair, clearance of damaged endosomes by autophagy and de novo biogenesis of organelles [85].

To establish relationships between insulin aggregates and endosomal membrane damage, the probes Chmp1-EGFP, Gal3-EGFP, and TFEB-EGFP were used. Chmp1 proteins bind to membranes of damaged endosomes that exhibit Ca2+ leakage into the cytosol engaging ESCRT-III complex in membrane repair processes, [85–87] Scheme 1. Endosomal damage can also expose luminal β-galactosides to the cytosol. Cytosolic Gal3 binds to exposed β-galactosides, thereby initiating autophagy, [85,88] Scheme 1. Chmp1-EGFP and Gal3-EGFP construct were transiently transfected into cells and endosomal membrane damage was detected by quantifying the localization of Chmp1-EGFP or Gal3-EGFP by fluorescence microscopy. A diffuse and cytosolic distribution of Chmp1/Gal3 is observed in the absence of endosomal while Chmp1/Gal3-EGFP puncta form when endosomes are damaged. Finally, TFEB is a transcription factor that regulates lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy [89–91]. Activation of TFEB is linked to endosomal Ca2+ efflux, activation of the phosphatase calcineurin, dephosphorylation of TFEB, and subsequent translocation of the transcription factor to the nucleus, Scheme 1. [85] In turn, nuclear TFEB activates a transcriptional program that induce de novo biogenesis of endosomal organelles. Therefore, cell transfected with TFEB-EGFP were used to monitor the cytoplasm to nucleus translocation of the transcription factor upon exposure to insulin aggregates.

We found that insulin aggregates grown in the presence and absence of lipids cause damage of endosomal membranes, as measured by Chmp1, Gal3 and TFEB, Fig. 6 and Fig. S4. The extent of endosomal damage directly depends on the structure of the aggregates. Specifically, Ins:PS causes higher Ca2+ leakages, endosomal repair (Chmp1b) and de novo biogenesis (TFEB) of endosomes comparing to other insulin aggregates. At the same time, Ins:CL and Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5) induce the lowest Ca2+ leakages and endosomal repair (Chmp1b). We also found that Ins and Ins:PS induce very little endosomal autophagy (Gal3), whereas Ins:CL, Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5) and Ins:PC primarily disrupt endosomes using Gal3 pathway. These findings show that insulin aggregates cause damages of endosomal membranes inducing their repair and de novo biogenesis.

3. Discussion

Abrupt insulin aggregation is the underlying molecular cause of injection amyloidosis, a severe pathology that arises from the injection of insulin in the skin dermis and subcutaneous fat layer [66,67]. Injections cause a local increase in the concentration of insulin, which, in turn, triggers protein aggregation. Insulin aggregates can induce abrupt aggregation of a large number of proteins present in the body, which results in systemic amyloidosis [69]. As was previously demonstrated by Kurouski and co-workers, insulin aggregation at pH below 2 resulted in formation of tape-like fibrils, whereas at pH above 2, insulin formed left-twisted fibrils [76]. It was also found that these tape-like and twisted fibrils had distinctly different supramolecular chirality [76].

Lipids are one of the most abundant classes of biological molecules in subcutaneous fat and cell membranes. Our results show that lipids drastically alter insulin stability either accelerating or decelerating its aggregation. We found that phospholipids with net negative charges, such as CL (net charge is −2) or PS (net charge is −1) strongly accelerate insulin aggregation. Zwitterion lipids, such as SM and PC either decelerate (SM) or strongly inhibit (PC) insulin aggregation. Interestingly that CER that possesses no charges at neutral pH also accelerates insulin aggregation. This finding suggests that both charge and chemical structure of the lipid play an important role in lipid-protein interactions that trigger or inhibit insulin aggregation.

It should be noted that not only the charge of lipids, but also curvature of the lipid vesicles can play an important role in protein-lipid interactions that can alter the rates of protein aggression [92,93]. For instance, Terakawa and co-workers demonstrated that small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) enable much faster aggregation of amyloid β1–40 peptide comparing to large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) with the same lipid composition [94]. The researchers inferred that this effect originates from a higher level of defects of lipids in SUVs comparing to LUVs. Consequently, lipids in these defects are more accessible to proteins that localize on the surface of the vesicles. Considering these observations, all phospholipids utilized in our study were assembled into LUVs with the same (~100 nm) vesicle diameter prior to mixing with insulin.

Lipid-protein interactions are developed between charged amino acid residues of proteins and polar head groups of lipids. For instance, lysine and glutamic acid residues on N-terminus (amino acids 1–60) of α-Syn exhibit strong electrostatic interactions with headgroups of phospholipids that triggers α-Syn aggregation [95]. NMR and fluorescence methods also revealed that lipid-protein interactions are facilitated by hydrophobic interactions between non-polar amino acid residues of the protein and fatty acid tails of lipids [96,97]. Our findings show that lipid-protein interactions with PC inhibit fibril formation yielding only small oligomeric species that are highly rich with unordered protein secondary structure. These oligomeric structures exhibit low cell toxicity. Insulin interactions with SM, although decelerate its aggregation, yield β-sheet-rich fibril-like structures that are highly toxic to cells. Similar β-sheet-rich fibril aggregates are observed for Ins:CER, Ins:PS and Ins:CL. However, toxicities of these morphologically similar aggregates are significantly different. Furthermore, such aggregates exhibit distinctly different mechanisms of cell damage. These findings suggest that differences in the secondary structure itself may not be sufficient to explain differences in the toxicities of amyloid aggregates.

Our previous findings and experimental results presented in this study show that lipids become integrated in protein aggregates that form in their presence [5,98–101]. These conclusions are based on observed by AFM-IR vibrations of PO2− of lipid head-groups in the spectra collected from both α-Syn [5,98] and insulin [99–101] aggregates formed at different stages of protein aggregation. Specifically, Rizevsky and co-workers found that insulin oligomers grown in the presence of both PC and CL possessed the corresponding lipid molecules in their structure [99]. It was also found that insulin filaments and fibrils grown in the presence of these phospholipids possessed significantly lower amount of lipids. Furthermore, it was found that in the presence of both phospholipids, insulin preferably bound PC rather than CL [99]. These results suggested that drastic differences in toxicities of β-sheet-rich fibril structures were likely determined by the chemical structure of lipid-protein complex present in such aggregates.

An uptake of amyloid aggregates by cells typically occurs by their endocytosis. Our findings show that insulin aggregates damage endosomes triggering a cascade of endosomal repair mechanisms, Scheme 1. Endosomal damage, in turn, induces Ca2+ leakage into cytosol. This disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis is a likely pathomechanism of cell apoptosis that compromises living systems in the context of aging. In addition to the Ca2+ leakage, degradation of endosomes may lead to the escape of the aggregates into the cytosol where they induce ROS production and cause mitochondrial damage. These results are in a good agreement with recently reported findings by Matveyenka and co-workers [102]. Specifically, it was demonstrated that insulin aggregates grown in the lipid-free environment and in the presence of lipids caused irreversible damage of cell endoplasmic reticulum (ER), an important cell organelle used for calcium storage, protein synthesis and folding. Specifically, amyloid-induced ER damage activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the cell, which, in turn, suppresses protein expression and increases chaperon activity. Thus, one can expect that with an enhanced ROS levels and mitochondrial damage, cells fail to mitigate the ER stress and restore normal cell physiology, which ultimately causes their death.

4. Conclusions

Our experimental findings show that lipids uniquely alter both the lag-phase and rate of insulin aggregation. We also found that in the presence of lipids, insulin forms structurally and morphologically different aggregates that have significantly lower cell toxicities then fibrils grown in the lipid-free environment. We observed a direct relationship between presence of β-sheer secondary structure and cell toxicity. We also found that a level of cell toxicity, ROS production and mitochondrial damage is dictated by the lipid-protein complex that is different for different lipids.

It should be noted that the reported in this work results only revealed biophysical effects of individual lipids on the rates of insulin aggregation, as well as on the structure and corresponding toxicity of insulin aggregates. We expect that these results can be used to model the effects of these lipids in the context of lipid membranes to establish the connection between change in the lipid profile of cell membranes and neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, other important chemical and physical factors such as lipid composition of membranes, membrane defects and curvatures, should be considered to establish the relationship between a change in the lipid profiles and neurodegeneration.

5. Experimental section

5.1. Materials

Bovine insulin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), 1,2-ditetradecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DMPS or PS), 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC or PC), 1′,3′-bis [1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho]-glycerol (18:0 cardiolipin (CL)), sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramide (CER) were purchased from Avanti (Alabaster, AL, USA).

5.2. Liposome preparation

DMPS, DMPC and CL large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared accordingly to the method reported by Galvagnion et al. [103] Briefly, 0.6 mg of the lipid were dissolved in 2.6 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4. Lipid solutions were heated in water bath to ~50 °C for 30 min and then placed into liquid nitrogen for 3–5 min. This procedure was repeated 10 times. After this, lipid solutions were passed 15 times through a 100 nm membrane that was placed into the extruder (Avanti, Alabaster, AL, USA). LUV sizes were determined by dynamic light scattering. Due to the poor assembly properties, no LUVs for SM and CER were prepared; lipids used as received. LUVs were stable at pH 3 for several weeks without changing their size distribution (as determined by DLS measurements). In contrast, LUVs nearly instantaneously disassemble at pH below 2.5. We infer that this disassembly is caused by the protonation of their head groups.

5.3. Insulin aggregation

In the lipid-free environment, 400 μM of insulin was dissolved in PBS; solution pH was adjusted to pH 3.0 using concentrated HCl. For Ins: CL, Ins:CER, Ins:PS and Ins:SM, as well as for Ins:PC:CL (1:0.5:0.5) and Ins:PC:CL (1:0.8:0.2), 400 μM of insulin was mixed with an equivalent concentration of the corresponding lipid; solution pH was adjusted to pH 3.0 using concentrated HCl. Next, the solutions were placed in the plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) and incubated at 37 °C under 510 rpm for 24 h. Although insulin can aggregate forming fibrils at physiological pH, pH 3.0 was chosen in this work because insulin isoelectric point is ~5.3. This drastically lowers protein solubility at pHs above 3.8. At the same time, at pH lower than 3.0, LUVs could be easily disassembled due to protonation of their headgroups.

5.4. Kinetic measurements

Insulin aggregation was monitored using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay. Briefly, protein samples were mixed with 2 mM of ThT solution and placed in the plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) where samples were incubated at 37 °C under 510 rpm for 30 h. Fluorescence measurements were taken every 10 min. Excitation wavelength was 450 nm; emission was collected at 488 nm. ThT measurements were done in triplicates.

5.5. AFM imaging

AFM imaging was performed using silicon AFM probes with related parameters force constant 2.7 N/m and resonance frequency 50–80 kHz were purchased from Appnano (Mountain View, CA, USA) on AIST-NT-HORIBA system (Edison, NJ). After 24 h of incubation of insulin (400 μM) with and without lipids at 37 °C under 510 rpm, sample aliquots were diluted with 1xPBS pH 3.0; deposited onto pre-cleaned silicon wafer and dried under a flow of dry nitrogen. Analysis of collected images was performed using AIST-NT software (Edison, NJ, USA).

5.6. AFM-IR

AFM-IR imaging was conducted using a Nano-IR3 system (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The IR source was a QCL laser. Contact-mode AFM tips (ContGB-G AFM probe, NanoAndMore, Watsonville, CA, USA) were used to obtain all spectra and maps. Sample aliquots were diluted with 1xPBS pH 3.0; deposited onto pre-cleaned silicon wafer and dried under a flow of dry nitrogen. Treatment and analysis of collected spectra was performed in Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc. Natick, Massachusetts, USA).

5.7. Circular Dichroism (CD)

After 24 h of sample incubation, samples were diluted to the final concentration of 100 μM using PBS and measured immediately using J-1000 CD spectrometer (Jasco, Easton, MD, USA). Three spectra were collected for each sample within 205–250 nm.

5.8. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy

After 24 h of sample incubation, samples were placed onto ATR crystal and dried at room temperature. Spectra were measured using Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Three spectra were collected from each sample.

5.9. Cell toxicity assays

Mice midbrain N27 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) in 96 well-plate (5000 cells per well) at 37 °C under 5 % CO2. After 24 h, the cells were found to fully adhere to the wells reaching ~70 % confluency. Next, 100 μL of the cell culture was replaced with 100 μL RPMI 1640 Medium with 5 % FBS containing protein samples. Concentration of FBS was decreased from 10 % to 5 % to lower the baseline absorbance level of the control according to the specifications of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay (G1781, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) that was used to determine toxicity of insulin aggregates. Insulin aggregates grown in the presence and absence of lipids (24 h), as well as lipids alone were added to N27 cells to reach the final concentration of 400 μM. After 48 h of incubation, we used CytoTox 96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay to determine LDH levels in N27 cells. Absorption measurements were made in plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) at 490 nm. Every well was measured 25 times in different locations.

In parallel, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay was performed using the same cell culture. Briefly, ROS reagent (C10422, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) was added to reach the final concentration of 5 μM and incubated at 37 °C under 5 % CO2 for 30 min. After the supernatant was removed, cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 200 μL of PBS in the flow cytometry tubes. Sample measurements were made in Accuri C6 Flow Cytomer (BD, San Jose, CA, USA) using red channel (λ = 633 nm). Percentages of ROS cells was determined using Acura software.

For JC-1 staining, 1 μL of JC-1 reagent (M34152A, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) was added to cells and incubated at 37 °C under 5 % CO2 for 30 min. After the supernatant was removed, cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 200 μL of PBS in the flow cytometry tubes. Sample measurements were made in Accuri C6 Flow Cytomer (BD, San Jose, CA, USA) using red channel (λ = 633 nm). Percentages of ROS cells was determined using Accuri software.

5.10. Membrane leakage assay

Three plasmids that code biomarkers Charged multivesicular body protein 1b (Chmp1b - cell membrane repair), Galectin-3 (Gal3 - autophagy) and Transcription factor EB (TFEB - lysosome biogenesis) were used. Plasmids were delivered in HEK 293 T cell using GeneX Plus reagent (ACS-4004, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). HET 293 T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) cell medium with 10 % FBS. After 24 h, the cells were found to fully adhere to the wells reaching ~80 % confluency. Transfection was made in DMEM without FBS during 4 h. Next, cell media was replaced on DMEM with 10 % FBS and incubated for 24 h. Protein samples were added to the cells and incubated for 24 h. Fluorescence cell imaging was performed in EVOS M5000 microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Chmp1b and TFEB plasmids contain green fluorescence protein and Gal3 contains red fluorescence protein, Fig. S4. Microscopic images reported in Fig. S4 show cells with various numbers of punctata present in each cell. Using these images, we counted number of punctata in cells treated with insulin aggregates grown in the presence and absence of lipids. The number of punctata was reported in the histograms shown in the Fig. 6.
