Background:

To reduce the increasing societal and financial burden of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), prevention is critical. Even small improvements of the modifiable dementia risk factors on the individual level have the potential to lead to a substantial reduction of dementia cases at the population level.

Objective:

To determine if pattern(s) of functional decline in midlife associate with late-onset ADRD years later.

Methods:

Using a longitudinal study of adults aged 51–59 years in 1998 without symptoms of ADRD by 2002 and followed them from 2002 to 2016 (n = 5404). The outcome was incident ADRD identified by the Lange-Weir algorithm, death, or alive with no ADRD. We used cluster analysis to identify patterns of functional impairment at baseline and multinomial regression to assess their association with future ADRD.

Results:

Three groups of adults with differing patterns of functional impairment were at greater risk of future ADRD. Difficulty with climbing one flight of stairs was observed in all adults in two of these groups. In the third group, 100% had difficulty with lifting 10 pounds and pushing or pulling a large object, but only one-fourth had difficulty in climbing stairs.

Conclusion:

Results imply that improved large muscle strength could decrease future risk of ADRD. If confirmed in other studies, screening for four self-reported measures of function among adults in midlife may be used for targeted interventions.

pmcINTRODUCTION

The number of people living with dementia is expected to triple worldwide by 2050, with a $777 billion cost annually in the United States, unless effective measures to delay the onset of the disease are implemented [1]. That study suggests 35% of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) could be delayed or prevented through modifiable health and lifestyle factors from different phases of life [1]. Thus, even small improvements of the modifiable dementia risk factors, such as hypertension and smoking, on the individual level have the potential to lead to a reduction of dementia cases at the population level. The disease processes occur for years though symptoms typically appear after age 65. Thus, identifying those at risk early for intervention is crucial. For example, performance-based measures of physical function (e.g., hand grip strength [2] and walking speed [3]) have been shown to be associated with ADRD among older adults. It is unknown if improvements in function could prevent ADRD. Because administering performance-based measures in busy clinical environments would be burdensome, it may be advantageous to use patient-reported metrics of physical function to efficiently identify individuals at risk for developing ADRD.

In our previous study, we found that a summary measure of self-reported difficulty with mobility was associated with future risk of ADRD symptoms [4]. In that study, we assessed future onset of ADRD with several summary measures of function that have been established, studied, and validated by researchers using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) [5, 6]. However, these summary measures do not include all items related to function that were included in the HRS. For example, activities such as lifting, kneeling, or crouching meet the definition of motor functions (i.e., abilities that derive from the coordinated activity of varied motor control systems located throughout the brain and spinal cord, and that extend through the peripheral nervous system to musculoskeletal structures [7]) but were not included in the HRS Gross Motor Activities Summary measure [6]. In the HRS, these activities were used to assess relationships with specific job performance and the retirement decision [6]. Therefore, we sought to expand on prior research which only used summary measures, by employing all of the measures of physical function collected in the HRS to determine if patterns of impairment present years before onset of ADRD.

Herein we used cluster analysis [8] to identify adults at risk of incident ADRD years prior to onset. Our study among adults aged 51–59 sought to determine if sub-groups of people with unique patterns of limitation in physical function were at increased risk of ADRD years later.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data source and study design

We used data collected every two years from 1998 to 2016 in the HRS, a population-based, prospective longitudinal interview survey of a cohort of adults aged 51 years and older in the United States [9, 10]. Our study population was designed and weighted to represent adults aged 51–59 years in the United States during 1998. Inclusion criteria included adults aged 51–59 who participated in the 1998 survey and had no symptoms of ADRD within four years of baseline (1998). A proxy for the respondent was interviewed if they entered a nursing home and could not participate in the interview. Participants were followed until they reported symptoms of ADRD, were lost to follow-up, died, or it was the end of the study. Deaths were confirmed using the National Death Index and the Social Security Death Index. Participants were excluded who reported having a stroke prior to or at baseline (n = 149). Our final sample included adults aged 51–59 years in 1998 who did not develop dementia according to the Langa-Weir classification [11] before the 2002 wave or report having a stroke during or prior to 1998, N = 5,404 (Fig. 1). The HRS is sponsored by the National Institute on Aging and performed by the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan.

Outcome

The outcome of our analysis was incident ADRD. The HRS ADRD classification was validated with the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), a nationally representative survey of cognitive health which is a sub-sample of the HRS [12]. We used reported symptoms of ADRD to identify incident cases because diagnoses were not available. Only self-reported symptoms were used to identify incident cases.

Main exposure

The HRS asked respondents to indicate whether they had any difficulty (yes or no) with each of the following: walking several blocks, walking one block, walking across the room, climbing one flight of stairs, climbing several flights of stairs, sitting for more than two hours, getting up from a chair, stooping/crouching, pushing/pulling a large object, getting in/out of bed, bathing, picking up a dime, eating, dressing, toileting, and lifting 10 pounds.

Covariates

We controlled for several covariates that potentially confound the relationship between physical function and ADRD. Covariates included respondents’ level of education, sex, race (White, Black, Other), Hispanic ethnicity, age, marital status, smoking status, physical activity, census region of residence, body mass index (kg/m2), and self-reported diagnoses of: diabetes, hypertension, depression, stroke, and heart disease.

Statistical analyses

We performed cluster analysis at baseline using all known [1] and available risk factors for ADRD including: diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, heart disease, stroke, smoking, alcohol use, marital status, sex, education level, depression, loneliness, hearing loss, race/ethnicity, working for pay, health problems limit ability to work, difficulty sleeping, and potential risk factors related to function mentioned previously. We used an iterative approach for cluster analysis, beginning with a 2-step process to determine the most appropriate number of clusters [13]. First, several runs of cluster analysis were conducted with varying numbers of clusters (2 to 7). Second, ratios of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance of the clusters were examined in each run. We used these ratios to identify risk factors that contributed to cluster formation—risk factors with low ratios did not contribute to forming clusters and were excluded. In this sample, all risk factors other than four measures of function were removed from the model, as they did not contribute to identification of clusters. A higher overall ratio indicates a better separation of clusters. Because the overall ratio increases with the number of clusters examined, the ideal number of clusters to choose is the number (n) with the highest overall ratio when compared with one additional cluster (n+1) that has a smaller ratio. Six clusters revealed the best separation. (Table 1).

We used STATA version 16 (College Station, TX) to fit multinomial logit models that account for the complex survey design. Using results of the cluster analysis, six sub-groups of respondents were identified at baseline. The regression model determined if the clusters at baseline in 1998, regardless of later change in function, were independently associated with incident ADRD, death, or neither by 2016. If a respondent developed ADRD symptoms and later died, they were censored after onset of ADRD.

Estimates presented are weighted to represent adults aged 51–59 years in the United States during 1998, followed to 2016. HRS data are public use with no identifiers and have been approved by the University of Michigan’s Institutional Review Board.

RESULTS

Cluster description

At baseline, six clusters were identified that best separated groups of adults by patterns of difficulty with physical function. (Table 1) The four measures of function that contributed to and defined the clusters included lifting 10 pounds, pushing or pulling a large object, climbing one flight of stairs, and walking one block. The two factors that contributed most to separation of clusters (i.e., had the highest ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance) were lifting 10 pounds and pushing or pulling a large object.

The following groups were defined based on results of cluster analysis: 1) No difficulty (75.5%): no difficulty with lifting 10 pounds, pushing/pulling a large object or climbing one flight of stairs, and 1% had difficulty with walking one block; 2) Difficulty Pushing/Pulling (6.7%): difficulty pushing/pulling a large object (82.4%), no difficulty lifting 10 pounds or climbing one flight of stairs and few (3.9%) have difficulty walking one block; 3) Difficulty Lifting (3.2%): difficulty lifting 10 pounds, no difficulty pushing/pulling a large object or climbing one flight of stairs and few (2.3%) have difficulty walking one block; 4) Difficulty Climbing Stairs (3.2%): difficulty climbing one flight of stairs but may or may not have difficulty with any of the other three measures; 5) Difficulty Upper Body (7.2%): difficulty lifting 10 pounds and pushing/pulling a large object but may or may not have difficulty climbing one flight of stairs or walking one block; and 6) Difficulty Upper and Lower Body (4.2%): difficulty climbing one flight of stairs and walking one block and vast majority have difficulty lifting 10 pounds (91.0%) or pushing/pulling (85.5%) a large object.

Clusters varied significantly across all baseline characteristics except for age group (Table 2).Women were significantly more likely than men to be in any of the five clusters with difficulties (p &lt; 0.01). Compared with the other clusters, adults in the cluster labeled Difficulty Upper and Lower Body (who had difficulty with all four of the physical function measures) most frequently reported: no educational degree (41.4%), living in the Southern census region (44.4%), obesity (29.5%), hypertension (48.8%), diabetes (21.0%), heart disease (25.6%), that they currently smoked (36.3%), and engaged in vigorous physical activity three times or more per week (11.0%).

In the unadjusted analyses using multinomial regression with two time points, at baseline and end of study, all clusters with difficulty in physical function compared to the cluster with no difficulties were statistically significantly more likely to develop symptoms of ADRD (Table 3). In the analyses adjusted for age, sex, marital status, race and ethnicity, level of education, region of residence, physical activity, smoking status, depression, body mass index, self-reported diagnoses of diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and heart disease, three of the clusters remained statistically significantly more likely to develop ADRD symptoms compared with the cluster with no difficulties: 1) Difficulty Climbing one Flight of Stairs: Risk Ratio (RR): 2.30 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28, 4.13); 2) Difficulty Upper Body: RR: 2.01 (95%CI: 1.34, 3.01); and 3) Difficulty Upper and Lower Body: RR: 2.86 (95% CI: 1.49, 5.50).

DISCUSSION

Overall, in adjusted analyses, three unique groups of adults with differing patterns of difficulty with physical function at baseline were at greater risk of future ADRD. Difficulty with climbing one flight of stairs was observed in 100% of persons in two of these groups. In the third group, 100% had difficulty with lifting 10 pounds and pushing or pulling a large object, but only one forth had difficulty in climbing stairs. Stair climbing, lifting, and pulling and pushing objects are motor activities that requires strength of large muscle groups. This finding is consistent with prior research that reported that lower levels of muscle mass and muscle strength among the muscles of the arms and legs were also related to increased risk of AD [14]. In addition, compared with those that had no functional impairment, those in clusters with functional impairment were more likely to report a diagnosis of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and to be overweight or obese.

Our results are also consistent with findings from prior studies reporting that loss of motor function is associated with incident Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [2, 15]. Some suggest that age-related cognitive and motor decline may share a common causation [16] and that clinically diagnosed AD cases are only the ‘tip of the iceberg’ because AD pathology may also account for a large proportion of cognitive and motor dysfunction currently considered ‘normal aging’ among older adults without dementia. However, it is unknown whether midlife functional decline leads to less activity and therefore weakness, or if midlife functional decline leads to weakness and therefore less activity. Studies have shown that physical activity modulates ADRD risk in general and cognitive function in cognitively impaired people [1].

Our study results compel us to question whether the benefit of physical activity to those with cognitive impairment is limited to those with prior functional decline or to all adults at risk. If the former, we have identified an efficient way of identifying persons to target for intervention, rather than applying interventions to everyone. This is vital because evidence from prevention trials is inconclusive, partially due to inclusion of subjects too old to benefit from intervention and relatively short periods of follow-up [17]. In our prior study we found a summary measure of mobility function was associated with future development of ADRD symptoms [4]. Findings from both studies should be confirmed in other populations. If confirmed the simple questions of function could be easily used for pre-dementia screening.

Our finding that women were more likely to be in all clusters with some level of difficulty compared to the cluster with no difficulty is supported by previous studies that report sex differences in function limitations [18, 19]. Importantly, modifiable factors prevalent among adults in the clusters at increased risk of ADRD included smoking and obesity; and treatable factors significantly associated with being in clusters at increased risk of ADRD included diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.

A strength of our study was the method of cluster analysis. In a previous study of middle-age subjects, high-quality biomarker data with repeated measures was small (n = 175) though sufficient sample size for agglomerative hierarchical clustering [8]. However, that type of cluster analysis works best when clusters are assumed to be similar size. In another study that used k-means clustering which works better for varying sizes of clusters, they identified people at high risk of ADRD at a point in time (cross-sectionally), using 92 variables including self-reported measures of physical function, and validated it with data from another country so that it could be used to predict ADRD in other settings. However, that study was cross-sectional and so could not identify factors present years prior to onset of incident ADRD symptoms. The method we used avoided both of these shortcomings.

A limitation of our study was that we could not disentangle which cases were AD and which were RD from the availed HRS data. Another limitation is that the cause(s) of difficulty with performing functions measured may vary according to risk of ADRD, but such information was unavailable. In addition, the 1998 cohort of adults aged 51–59 years may not be representative of later birth cohorts. Moreover, our estimates included wide confidence intervals, partially due small cell sizes while adjusting for many confounders of ADRD and function. Future research in which more precise assessment of overall outcomes including neuropathology and other markers of general decline with aging is needed.

Our study is a contribution to the field in that we have identified four measures of physical function that may present with difficulty among midlife adults on average 10 years prior to onset of ADRD. Essentially, we have identified four simple questions that need to be further examined in future research. If proven to be early indicators of ADRD, independent of other predictors, these items could be used to screen pre-dementia. Fortunately, in light of prior studies suggesting physical activity improves cognitive function, our results imply that improved motor function, particularly large muscle strength, could potentially decrease future risk of ADRD. Given the burden of ADRD, public health efforts to improve physical function in adulthood seem warranted. We also identified other modifiable factors prevalent among adults in the clusters at increased risk of ADRD including smoking and obesity as well as additional potentially treatable factors including diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.

6) Difficulty Upper and Lower Body	5.89 (3.78, 9.18)	2.86 (1.49, 5.50)	
Difficulty Upper Body includes those having difficulty with lifting 10 pounds and pushing/pulling a large object. Upper and Lower Body also includes those having difficulty with climbing one flight of stairs and walking one block. Adjusted model controlled for: age, sex, marital status, depression, physical activity, smoking status, region of residence, race and ethnicity, education level, body mass index, self-reported status of diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and incident cases of stroke). Respondents with previous reports of stroke were excluded.
