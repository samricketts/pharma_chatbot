Background-

Exposure to air pollution has been identified as a possible environmental contributor to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) risk. As the number of people with AD worldwide continues to rise, it becomes vital to understand the nature of this potential gene-environment interaction. This study assessed the effects of short-term exposures to concentrated ambient ultrafine particulates (UFP, &lt;100 nm) on measurements of amyloid-β, tau, and microglial morphology.

Methods-

Two cohorts of aged (12.5–14 months) 3xTgAD and NTg mice were exposed to concentrated ambient UFP or filtered air for 2 weeks (4-h/day, 4 days/week). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and brain tissue were collected twenty-four hours following the last exposure to evaluate lung inflammation, tau pathology, amyloid-β pathology, and glial cell morphology.

Results-

No exposure- or genotype-related changes were found with any of the measures of lung inflammation or in the hippocampal staining density of astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. The microglia marker, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1, and amyloid-β marker, 6E10, exhibited significant genotype by exposure interactions such that levels were lower in the UFP-exposed as compared to filtered air-exposed 3xTgAD mice. When microglia morphology was assessed by Sholl analysis, microglia from both NTg mouse groups were ramified. The 3xTgAD air-exposed mice had the most ameboid microglia, while the 3xTgAD UFP-exposed mice had microglia that were comparatively more ramified. The 3xTgAD air-exposed mice had more plaques per region of interest as measured by Congo red staining as well as more plaque-associated microglia than the 3xTgAD UFP-exposed mice. The number of non-plaque-associated microglia was not affected by genotype or exposure. Levels of soluble and insoluble human amyloid-β42 protein were measured in both 3xTgAD groups and no exposure effect was found. In contrast, UFP-exposure led to significant elevations in phosphorylated tau in 3xTgAD mice as compared to those that were exposed to air, as measured by pT205 staining.

Conclusions-

Exposure to environmentally relevant levels of ultrafine particulates led to changes in tau phosphorylation and microglial morphology in the absence of overt lung inflammation. Such changes highlight the need to develop greater mechanistic understanding of the link between air pollution exposure and Alzheimer’s disease.

1. Introduction

1.1 Exposure to air pollution and Alzheimer’s disease risk

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is currently the 6th leading cause of death in the United States, with an estimated 5.8 million people living with the disease. This number is expected to sharply increase as the population ages (Alzheimer’s Association 2019). While some cases can be directly linked to specific genetic mutations, including those for amyloid precursor protein and the presenilins, most cases are sporadic and are likely due to complex gene-environment interactions. Exposure to air pollution is thought to be an environmental risk factor for AD (Calderón-Garcidueñas et al. 2004; Jung, Lin, and Hwang 2015; Oudin et al. 2016; Younan et al. 2020). Epidemiological studies have shown an association between particulate matter (PM) exposure and dementia risk. In a large population-based cohort study carried out in Canada, proximity to a major roadway— a surrogate for traffic-related PM exposure— was associated with an increased risk of dementia, with 7–11% of cases in residents who lived closest to roadways (&lt; 50 m) being attributable to traffic exposure (Chen et al. 2017). A retrospective study measuring the effects of PM2.5 (particulates &lt; 2.5 μm in diameter) exposure on Medicare recipients in the Southeastern United States showed a 5% increase in dementia risk for every 1 μg/m3 increase in annual PM2.5 levels as measured by hospitalizations (HR = 1.049, 95% CI: 1.048–1.051). When considering AD specifically, the risk was slightly higher, showing a 6% increase (HR = 1.060, 95% CI: 1.057–1.062) (Lee et al. 2019). In Medicare recipients in the Northeastern United States, there was also an increase in hospitalizations for AD as PM2.5 levels rose (HR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.11–1.19 per 1 μg/m3 increase in annual PM2.5 exposure) (Kioumourtzoglou et al. 2016). In a study conducted in London, England, PM2.5 exposure increases of 0.95 μg/m3 were associated with a hazard ratio for incident dementia of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02–1.12), with larger increases in risk found in the top fifth percentile of exposure (Carey et al. 2018).

1.2 Ultrafine particulates in air pollution

While air pollution is a complex mixture, many of these epidemiological studies have linked findings to measurements of particulates in air, which are categorized by airborne size (PM10 &lt; 10 μm; PM2.5 &lt; 2.5 μm; and ultrafine particulates (UFP) &lt; 100 nm in diameter). UFPs have several properties that can enhance their toxicological potential, such as a large surface area per mass with which other pollution components, like metals and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, could interact (Geiser and Kreyling 2010). Their small size permits them to deposit efficiently throughout the respiratory tract, including the gas exchange region, where they could initiate an inflammatory cascade that enters the circulation and impacts other organs, including the brain (Kleinman et al. 2008; Lucchini et al. 2012; Mumaw et al. 2016). Alternatively, UFPs could directly translocate to the brain via the olfactory neuronal pathway after depositing in the nasopharyngeal region of the respiratory tract, where they could induce neuroinflammation (Kreyling 2016). Studies in rodents have shown that multiple nanoscale particles (&lt; 100 nm), including carbon, manganese, gold, and iridium, accumulate in the brain following inhalation exposure (Balasubramanian et al. 2013; Elder et al. 2006; Kreyling 2016; Oberdorster et al. 2002; Takenaka et al. 2001). In both the direct and indirect pathways, inflammation in the brain is thought to promote the accumulation of aggregated proteins and drive AD pathology (Janelsins et al. 2008).

1.3 Microglia and neuroinflammation

AD is characterized by extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal tau tangles. Other mechanisms, such as neuroinflammation, are increasingly being recognized as important contributors to overall AD pathology. Neuroinflammation is mediated by glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, both of which can play pro- or anti-inflammatory roles (Serrano-Pozo et al. 2013). Microglia survey the surrounding parenchyma in their resting state, at which time they are characterized by smaller somas and long ramified processes (Davalos et al. 2005; Nimmerjahn, Kirchhoff, and Helmchen 2005; Tremblay et al. 2011). These microglia may be stimulated by many factors, such as the presence of Aβ and pro-inflammatory cytokines, to become activated (Colton et al. 2006; Rodriguez et al. 2014; Stence, Waite, and Dailey 2001). They can also become activated by environmental exposures like particulate matter (PM &lt; 0.2μm; (Woodward et al. 2017)) or diesel exhaust (Cole et al. 2016).

We hypothesized that exposing mice to airborne concentrated ambient UFP present in air pollution would exacerbate existing AD pathology by causing changes indicative of neuroinflammation, including activation of microglia in regions of the brain with amyloid-β plaques. To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model of AD and conducted UFP exposures using the Harvard Ultrafine Concentrator of Ambient Particle System (HUCAPS) to assess changes in AD-related pathology, including levels of Aβ, plaque density, microglia morphology, and tau immunodensity.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Study Design and Animal Model

The 3xTgAD mouse strain (B6/129 hybrid) was chosen as the model for AD. These mice are offspring of founder mice originally gifted to Dr. William Bowers (formerly of University of Rochester) from Dr. Frank LaFerla (University of California, Irvine). The mice express human versions of Aβ and tau, along with a mutated form of mouse presenilin 1. It was not feasible to study mice of both sexes because the maximum outflow of the HUCAPS limits the size of the exposure chambers which presents a constraint on the number of mice that could be exposed at one time. Male mice were chosen since the progression of AD pathology in male 3xTgAD mice has been well-documented (Mastrangelo and Bowers 2008; Oddo et al. 2003). NTg mice were included as controls in the study. Mice were bred and aged in-house to 12.5–14 months, an age at which both Aβ plaques and tau tangles are already established in male 3xTgAD mice (Mastrangelo and Bowers 2008; Oddo et al. 2003). Animals were group housed in temperature and humidity-controlled rooms with a 12-hour light-dark cycle in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited vivarium facility and given ad libitum access to food and water. Mice were exposed to either filtered air or UFP-enriched aerosols, resulting in 4 experimental groups: 3xTgAD Air, 3xTgAD UFP, NTg Air, and NTg UFP. A total of 26 3xTgAD and 25 NTg mice were used in this study in two separate cohorts. Cohort A (n = 4–5 mice) was exposed from January 14–24, 2014, and Cohort B (n = 7–8 mice) from March 15–24, 2016. Cohort A was used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cohort B was used for Aβ42 protein measurement in the hippocampus and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analyses. All protocols involving animals were reviewed and approved by the University of Rochester’s Committee on Animal Research (UCAR).

2.2 Exposure

Animals were transferred from their home cages to 31 L stainless steel-reinforced plexiglass whole-body inhalation chambers, which were compartmentalized using a wire mesh insert (one mouse per compartment). The temperature and humidity of these chambers were monitored throughout the exposure and ranged from 73–84° F and 31–70%, respectively. The animals were returned to their home cages upon completion of exposure each day. The mice were exposed to clean, filtered room air or concentrated UFP from ambient air pollution using the HUCAPS for 4 hours a day, 4 days a week, for 2 weeks. The HUCAPS takes in approximately 5,000 L/min of outdoor air from a busy street (i.e., traffic aerosol) and uses virtual impaction and condensational growth to concentrate the ambient UFP fraction (Gupta, Demokritou, and Koutrakis 2004). This results in an output of 50–60 L/min to the exposure chamber with a concentration factor of approximately 10x with respect to ambient particle number concentrations. Theoretically, the HUCAPS neither concentrates nor depletes gas phase components. We emphasize that ‘(concentrated) UFP’ is used throughout to refer to the HUCAPS output aerosol and acknowledge that gas-phase and semi-volatile components are also present. Particle size distribution and number concentration (PNC) were monitored with a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) (differential mobility analyzer model 3071, condensation particle counter model 3022A, TSI, Shoreview, MN). Daily gravimetric samples collected on 37 mm Teflo filters (VWR, Radnor, PA) were used to determine mass concentration in Cohort B. Mass concentration for cohort A was extrapolated from the SMPS output.

The Multiple Path Particle Dosimetry Model (MPPD v. 3.04) was used to estimate regional fractional deposition in the upper and lower respiratory tract (Anjilvel and Asgharian 1995). Allometrically scaled respiratory rate and tidal volume were calculated from across-group mean body weight and the estimated daily deposited dose calculated, both in total respiratory and by subregion (Piccione, Caola, and Mortola 2005). Overall exposure average count median diameters (CMD) and geometric standard deviations (GSD) from the continuous monitoring of the HUCAPS aerosol were also used as inputs for the MPPD model (Guyton 1947). The approach is described in detail by Jew et al. (Jew et al. 2019).

2.3 Tissue Harvesting

Twenty-four hours after the end of exposure, each cohort of mice was euthanized. Cohort A mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 10% heparinized saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brain tissue was extracted and placed in PFA for 2 hours and then transferred to 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline. Once the tissue sank, the cerebellum was separated from the rest of the brain and both resulting samples were separately snap frozen in dry ice-chilled isopentane and stored at −80° C until use. For IHC, brains were coronally sectioned (30 μm) with a sliding microtome on a freezing stage. Sections were stored at −20° C in cryoprotectant. The mice from Cohort B were euthanized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital and brain tissue was microdissected into left and right olfactory bulb, hippocampus, striatum, frontal cortex, and cerebellum. These tissues were immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80° C until use.

2.4 Immunohistochemistry

Free floating sections were incubated in rabbit anti-ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) (1:5000, Wako, Richmond, VA), rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:6000, Dako, Santa Clara, CA), or rabbit anti-pT205 (1:5000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 48 hours at 4° C followed by a 2-hour incubation in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at room temperature. For amyloid staining, sections were incubated in 70% formic acid for 5 minutes at room temperature before incubation in biotinylated mouse anti-6E10, which binds to Aβ and amyloid precursor protein, (1:5000, Covance, Princeton, NJ) for 48 hours at 4° C. All colorimetric stains were visualized with ABC (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector) and Ni-DAB (Peroxidase Substrate Kit, Vector). Sections were mounted on chrom-alum/gelatin subbed slides, dehydrated, and coverslipped with DPX (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Some sections were stained for Iba1 at 1:2000, then treated with a fluorescent secondary goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488 (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) antibody for 2 hours for visualization on a confocal microscope. Congo red staining was used to visualize amyloid plaques with kit HT60 using the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Sections prepared for confocal microscopy were also stained with Hoechst vital dye to visualize cell nuclei (1:100, Thermo Fisher Scientific) before mounting on subbed slides and coverslipping with Prolong Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

2.5 Bronchoalveolar Lavage Procedure and Analysis

Lungs from Cohort B mice were excised with the trachea, then lavaged 10 times with warmed sterile 0.9% saline (10 × 1 mL), with the first two lavage washes reserved separately from the rest to prevent cell dilution. The BAL fluid was centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 minutes to separate out the cell fraction. The supernatants from lavages 3–10 were discarded and those from lavages 1–2 were saved for measurements of total protein (microBCA, Thermo-Fisher Scientific) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity (Sigma Aldrich). The cell pellets from all 10 lavages were combined to determine total cell number as well as cell viability using trypan blue exclusion and a hemocytometer. Cells were pelleted onto slides using a cytospin and differential counts were then performed following staining with modified Wright-Giemsa stain (Hema 3, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

2.6 Microscopy

Light microscopy images were acquired on a Nikon H550S microscope equipped with a Spot RT3 camera. Images were processed to determine percent area stained using ImageJ (NIH ImageJ V.1.52e). The hippocampus was traced, and default thresholding settings in the program were adjusted as needed to convert the pictures from color to binary images. These images were used to calculate the percent area stained for each region of interest. The calculations were performed for each section on the slide that contained hippocampus, approximately 4–8 sections per animal, and values were averaged to obtain a single value per animal. The individual animal values were further averaged for each experimental group.

Images of microglia and Congophilic plaques were acquired using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. For each animal, a section from approximately the same stereological location (around −2.79 mm bregma) was selected. An initial 10x overview of the hippocampus in that section was obtained and a box was drawn, framing the subiculum. When the magnification was increased to 60x, the box became divided into multiple discrete fields of view. The same 3 fields of view within the box were then imaged for each animal. An image was also taken in the cortex above the subiculum at 60x to serve as a control region (without Congo red-positive plaques). The image files were exported to ImageJ for Sholl analysis to assess microglial morphology. Five microglia were randomly chosen from each 60x image for a total of 20 microglia per animal, 15 in the subiculum and 5 in the cortex. These microglia were isolated from the image and thresholding was applied to convert them from color to binary images. Thresholding was adjusted manually until only the soma and processes of the microglia were visible. The soma diameter was measured and divided by 2 to serve as the starting radius of the Sholl circles. Rings were placed at a step size of 10 pixels out to the ending radius of 250 pixels (Sipe et al. 2016). The number of microglial processes intersecting each circle was counted and used to create Sholl curves for each cell, which were then averaged to create a mean Sholl curve per animal. The area under the curve was calculated and individual measurements were averaged to create the mean for each group. The number of microglia and plaques in each image was counted. Microglia that were overlapping or in very close proximity (within ~7 μm) to a plaque were considered plaque-associated. The number of microglia per plaque was calculated by dividing the number of plaque-associated microglia by the number of plaques in the image.

2.7 Amyloid-β42 Quantitation

Protein from the left hippocampus was extracted into T-PER buffer (tissue protein extraction reagent, Thermo-Fisher Scientific; complete mini protease inhibitor tablets, Roche; phosphoSTOP phosphatase inhibitor tablets, Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana) so that 20 μL T-PER was used per 1 mg of tissue. Samples were homogenized, sonicated, and centrifuged for 60 minutes at 100,000 × g and the supernatant removed for the analysis of soluble amyloid-β42. The pellet was further extracted and incubated in 5M guanidinium-HCl for 4 hours. After additional centrifugation for 60 minutes at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was removed for the analysis of insoluble amyloid-β. Soluble and insoluble samples were analyzed separately with a human Aβ42 ELISA kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (limit of quantitation = 10 pg/mL) (Invitrogen) and as found in Rivera-Escalera 2014.

2.8 Statistical Analysis

The data were evaluated by 2-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) in JMP Pro 13 (JMP Inc., Cary, NC) for the main effects of genotype and exposure, as well as their interactions. Tukey-Kramer t-tests for multiple comparisons were used when the test for interactions was statistically significant. Non-normal or unequally variable data were transformed logarithmically before analysis. The criterion for statistical significance was set at P &lt; 0.05.

3. Results

3.1 Exposure conditions

Cohort A was exposed to an aerosol with a mean PNC of 65,896 ± 53,343 p/cm3 (mean ± standard deviation) and a mean CMD of 82.6 ± 5.9 nm over 8 days of exposure. The mean GSD was 1.53 ± 0.05, indicating that the aerosol had a narrow size distribution. Cohort B was exposed to an aerosol with a similar mean CMD and GSD, 84.4 ± 4.3 nm and 1.52 ± 0.08, respectively, while the mean PNC was lower at 47,875 ± 21,850 p/cm3. The mean mass concentration for this exposure was 42.0 ± 15.7 μg/m3. Filter samples were not collected for Cohort A exposures, but the mass concentration was estimated to be ~58 μg/m3 using SMPS data. Figure 1 shows the daily variations in PNC. MPPD model analysis was performed for both cohorts (Anjilvel and Asgharian 1995) and showed the regional fractional deposition for the nasopharyngeal-laryngeal region to be 15%, tracheobronchial region to be 5%, and pulmonary region to be 17%. Assuming no clearance, this would lead to an estimated daily deposited dose of 183–241 ng, with 75–99 ng deposited in the head region, 24–31 ng deposited in the tracheobronchial region, and 84–111 ng deposited in the pulmonary region.

3.2 Concentrated UFP effects on overt lung inflammation

After 8 days of exposure, there were no changes in BAL fluid total cell number compared to filtered air controls (Table 1). No changes were seen in the number or percentage of macrophages, neutrophils, or lymphocytes. Additionally, measurements of LDH activity and total protein showed no differences between groups. Cell viability did not deviate from control values. These results indicate a lack of overt inflammation and cell damage in the lungs at the end of the 8-day exposure.

3.3 Concentrated UFP effects on staining density of astrocytes and microglia

Brain tissue sections were stained for GFAP, a marker for astrocytes, and Iba1, a marker for microglia. GFAP percent area stained was 30–36% in the hippocampus across all groups and was not affected by either genotype or exposure (Figure 2). In the subiculum of 3xTgAD air-exposed mice, there were clusters of prominently Iba-1-stained ameboid microglia, suggesting activation, while such structures were conspicuously absent in most 3xTgAD UFP-exposed mice (Figure 3E, F). These ameboid microglia exhibit spatial proximity to the areas of heaviest plaque burden (see 6E10 staining in Figure 7G, H for reference). While the differences in Iba1 staining were obvious from the microscopy images, there were no statistically significant differences in percent area stained when the analysis included the entire hippocampus (Figure 3A). However, when the analysis was restricted to the subiculum, there was a statistically significant genotype*exposure interaction (p=0.034), indicating that 3xTgAD mice responded differently to UFP exposure than did the NTg mice (Figure 3B). Neither genotype nor exposure by themselves significantly affected Iba1 staining density. We also evaluated Iba-1 staining density in the overlying cortex and the olfactory bulb; while staining density patterns were similar to that in the subiculum, there were no statistically significant effects of either genotype or exposure in these regions (Figure S1 and S2).

3.4 Concentrated UFP effects on microglial morphology

We used confocal microscopy to obtain higher resolution images for Sholl analysis, a method that is very sensitive to changes in cell morphology. Ramified microglia have more processes than ameboid ones, resulting in a higher number of radial intersections of the overlaid concentric rings and often at a farther distance from the soma (Morrison and Filosa 2013; Sholl 1953). The Sholl analysis was performed in two regions: the subiculum (Figure 4), where the Iba1 staining density appeared to be most intense in the 3xTgAD mice exposed to filtered-air (Figure 3), and the cortex (Figure 5), a control region that does not exhibit amyloid plaque deposition at this timepoint (Mastrangelo and Bowers 2008). In the subiculum, NTg animals had more intersections per distance from the soma as compared to 3xTgAD mice (genotype main effect, p&lt;0.0001), but this was not impacted by exposure (Figure 4B). The 3xTgAD filtered air-exposed mice had the lowest number of intersections at the peak, ~4 intersections compared to ~7 in the NTg mice. They also had intersections that were closer to the soma than NTg mice, resulting in an early drop-off and lack of processes farther from the soma, i.e., a more ameboid appearance. In contrast, the 3xTgAD UFP-exposed animals showed an intermediate pattern: more ameboid than NTg mice, but more ramified than the 3xTgAD air-exposed animals (Figure 4B). The areas under the curve from the Sholl analyses were calculated and a statistically significant gene*exposure interaction was found (p=0.043) (Figure 4C). When Sholl analysis was performed using images taken in the cortex, no significant differences were found among groups (Figure 5). Indeed, the morphological appearance of microglia from the cortex is strikingly different from the subiculum in that there are no obvious amoeboid cells (Figure S1). These data show that activated microglia and high plaque burdens co-occur in the subiculum of 3xTgAD mice and that this relationship can be modified by UFP exposure.

3.5 Concentrated UFP effects on hippocampal microglia and plaque numbers

The confocal images from the subiculum were further analyzed by counting the numbers of Congophilic plaques (3xTgAD mice only) and microglia, both plaque-associated and non-plaque-associated. The total number of microglia in the subiculum was higher in 3xTgAD mice than in NTg mice (genotype main effect, p=0.0004). In both groups, concentrated UFP exposure significantly lowered the number of microglia (exposure main effect, p=0.004) (Figure 6A). Additionally, the 3xTgAD air-exposed mice had significantly more plaques per region of interest than the UFP-exposed 3xTgAD mice (Figure 6B), about 5 plaques versus 1 plaque (p=0.005). They also had a higher number of plaque-associated microglia per image, about 9 versus 1 plaque-associated cell (Figure 6C; p=0.018). Correspondingly, a greater percentage of the total microglia in an image was plaque-associated in the 3xTgAD air-exposed mice (45% ± 17%) as compared to 3xTgAD mice that were exposed to UFP (11% ± 13%; p=0.01) (Figure 6D). The number of non-plaque associated microglia did not change (Figure 6E). When analyzed on a per plaque basis, 3xTgAD UFP-exposed mice had more microglia per plaque, 9.3 microglia/plaque on average as opposed to 3xTgAD air-exposed with 4.7 (Figure 6F; p = 0.0050).

3.6 Concentrated UFP effects on tau phosphorylation and amyloid-β42 protein levels

NTg mice lack the transgene for human Aβ production, hence there was no measurable human Aβ42 in the hippocampal homogenates from NTg mice (data not shown). There were no UFP exposure-related differences in soluble or insoluble Aβ42 concentrations in hippocampal homogenates from 3xTgAD mice (Figure 7A, B). Beta amyloid levels were also evaluated via measurements of 6E10 staining within the hippocampus. As expected, the NTg animals had negligible 6E10 immunoreactivity as compared to the 3xTgAD mice (Figure 7C, D) (genotype main effect, p&lt;0.0001). When 6E10 immunoreactivity was examined at the level of the entire hippocampus in the 3xTgAD mice, the mean percent area stained was 2.7% ± 0.6% in the UFP-exposed and 1.7% ± 0.6% in the filtered air-exposed mice, but there was no statistically significant exposure effect (Figure 7C). However, when the 6E10 percent area stained analysis was restricted to the subiculum, a statistically significant effect of exposure was found such that the percent staining in UFP-exposed mice was lower than that in air-exposed mice (exposure main effect, p=0.0257; Figure 7D). These data suggest that UFP-enriched aerosol exposure affects human Aβ protein deposition in 3xTgAD mice.

Tau phosphorylation was assessed by staining for phosphorylation at the threonine 205 residue (pT205). As expected, negligible immunoreactivity was seen in the NTg groups as compared to 3xTgAD mice (genotype main effect, p&lt;0.0001). The percent area stained for pT205 in the 3xTgAD air-exposed mice was ~2%, while that in the UFP-exposed 3xTgAD mice was significantly elevated at ~4% (Figure 8; exposure main effect, p=0.0453). Increased pT205 staining was primarily observed in pyramidal neurons (see Figure 8 inset).

4. Discussion

In this study, we assessed the effects of inhaled concentrated ambient UFP aerosols on AD-related pathology, microglial morphology, and acute lung inflammatory endpoints in a genetic mouse model. As mounting epidemiological evidence demonstrates an association between ambient particulate air pollution exposure and AD incidence and prevalence, it is vital to understand the underlying mechanisms and the pathophysiological changes within the brain in relation to exposure. In the present work, we examined the ability of UFP to accelerate existing pathology. We observed that UFP-enriched aerosol exposure did not result in changes in any measures of lung inflammation or cellular damage. Despite this, we found exposure-related perturbations in microglial morphology and increases in tau phosphorylation in 3xTgAD mouse hippocampus, a region of the brain that is critical to learning and memory function and that is particularly impacted by AD. Results relating to Aβ were less straightforward: contrary to our original hypothesis, we found an exposure-related decrease in plaque number as detected by Congo red and 6E10 staining, but no substantial changes in either soluble or insoluble Aβ42 peptide levels.

Microglia are reactive cells that can undergo morphological shifts in response to various stimuli in the brain, including Aβ plaques (Davis, McMurray, and Schubert 1992; McWhorter et al. 2013; Sasaki et al. 1997; Serrano-Pozo et al. 2013). Morphological changes (e.g., being more or less ramified) can indicate differences in activation states and may also signify changes in properties, some of which, like phagocytic ability, can directly impact AD pathology. Ramified morphology is typically associated with a resting state, though resting is something of a misnomer, as these microglia remain quite active, surveilling the brain parenchyma surrounding their processes (Davalos et al. 2005; Nimmerjahn, Kirchhoff, and Helmchen 2005). Activated microglia are often ameboid and play a different role, such as phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and remodeling tissue (Michelucci et al. 2009; Sudduth et al. 2013).

The observed changes in the microglia in the present study were evidenced by increased Iba1 staining intensity in the subiculum (Figure 3E, F) that corresponded with the areas of highest plaque burden observed in the 6E10 staining (Figure 7G, H). Interestingly, a statistically significant genotype-by-exposure interaction was found such that staining was less than expected in the 3xTgAD UFP-exposed mice in the subiculum (Figure 3B). Sholl analysis is particularly informative regarding changes in cell morphology and confirmed the visual observation that the 3xTgAD UFP mice had microglia that were more ramified, less ameboid in shape, and, therefore, likely less activated in the subiculum (Figure 4). When the analysis was completed in the cortex, a region that was devoid of plaques at 12–13 months of age, no such changes were observed (Figure 5). Taken as a whole, our findings indicate that the changes in microglial morphology were only manifested in the presence of plaques. While such changes are suggestive of specific alterations in microglial phenotype, additional studies, such as transcriptional profiling, are required to clarify the pro- or anti-inflammatory status of the cells. Further studies are required to clarify the exact nature of the activation state associated with changes in morphology seen in the 3xTgAD microglia.

Interestingly, based on Sholl analysis, microglia in the 3xTgAD UFP group appeared to have an intermediate phenotype, with their Sholl plot falling midway between the NTg plots (ramified microglia) and the 3xTgAD air plots (ameboid microglia). This intermediate phenotype is likely due to the increase in baseline inflammation inherent in the 3xTgAD model (Cantarella et al. 2015). Inflammation is an important part of AD and, as the main immune cells of the brain, microglia play a key role by producing cytokines, trophic factors, and reactive oxygen species. While neuroinflammation is an established component of AD, its precise role in disease onset or progression has yet to be determined. Some posit that neuroinflammation is the major driver of disease, pointing to studies on the potential benefits of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the disease or time course studies performed in transgenic models where neuroinflammation precedes traditional markers of pathology, such as Aβ plaques (Weggen et al. 2001; Wright et al. 2013). Yet, antithetically, certain inflammatory states appear to be beneficial. Multiple studies have shown that transgenic AD mice receiving intracranial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent inflammatory stimulus, have reduced levels of Aβ (DiCarlo et al. 2001; Herber et al. 2004; Morgan et al. 2005). Furthermore, suppression of LPS-induced inflammation by the administration of steroids prevented both the reduction of Aβ and the concomitant activation of microglia, suggesting that microglia play a pivotal role in this process (Herber et al. 2007). Other studies have shown that direct increases in inflammatory cytokines such as IL1β cause a similar reduction in Aβ (Ghosh et al. 2013; Matousek et al. 2012; Shaftel et al. 2007). The general hypothesis for this phenomenon is that microglia, having been activated by the added inflammatory stimulus, adopt a phenotype that is more effective at phagocytosis and, hence, Aβ clearance (Shaftel et al. 2007).

4.2 Aβ and Congophilic plaques

Overall, there were significantly more microglia in the subiculum from the 3xTgAD air-exposed mice as compared to the other groups; however, this number was driven almost entirely by higher numbers of plaque-associated microglia. The 3xTgAD UFP-exposed animals had fewer Congophilic plaques than the 3xTgAD air-exposed mice. Hence, they also had fewer plaque-associated microglia. However, if the calculations account for plaque burden, the 3xTgAD UFP-exposed mice have more microglia per plaque than the 3xTgAD air-exposed. Unfortunately, it is impossible with the current data to know whether changes in the microglia or the plaques came first. Analyzing Aβ using other methods presents different results. We found no differences in the concentration of either soluble or insoluble Aβ1–42 peptide. While this tissue contained the subiculum, our area of interest, it also contained a greater proportion of non-subicular tissue, potentially leading to a dilution effect for subicular changes in Aβ peptide concentrations. This hypothesis is compatible with the fact that when the 6E10 analyses was restricted to the subiculum, a statistically significant exposure effect was found, but was absent when the hippocampus was analyzed in whole. Some other explanations for the differences between the plaque burden analyses are that they were run on two separate cohorts of mice with different exposure conditions and that ELISA and IHC are fundamentally different methods. The ELISA recognized Aβ1–42 peptide specifically, while the 6E10 antibody used for staining recognized amyloid precursor protein and other amyloid fragments in addition to Aβ1–42. Furthermore, while the locations and morphology of the Congophilic plaques were similar to what was observed with 6E10 staining, Congo red binds to beta-pleated sheets, which would be a subset of the 6E10 staining (Khurana et al. 2001).

As Aβ plaques are one of the characteristic pathological features of AD, early studies assumed that the elimination of plaques and excess amyloid would lead to improvements in cognitive function and reduced disability. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. The levels of Aβ do not directly correlate with cognitive dysfunction (Arriagada et al. 1992; Bierer et al. 1995). In fact, treatment with an enzyme inhibitor that decreases amyloid brain burden has been shown to have no effect on cognitive performance in human AD (Egan et al. 2018). Indeed, a recent study using positron emission tomography concluded that cognitive decline was more closely correlated with levels of tau than with Aβ (Hanseeuw et al. 2019). Furthermore, treatments or exposures that positively impact Aβ levels may have completely different effects on tau. For example, a reduction in amyloid load after IL1β overexpression also markedly increased tau phosphorylation (Ghosh et al. 2013). In our study, we observed a similar paradox in the context of UFP exposure, namely decreased density of subicular 6E10- and Congo red-labeled Aβ plaques, but clear exposure-related increases in tau phosphorylation in the 3xTgAD mice. Very few studies have looked at the impact of particulate matter exposure on tau phosphorylation and they have mostly used wild-type animals. The majority of these studies employed oropharyngeal aspiration or intranasal instillation, forms of bolus dosing that are not relevant to human exposures. Such studies reported increases in phosphorylation of various tau epitopes after exposure to PM2.5 (Gao et al. 2017; Wei et al. 2019) or PM2.5 in combination with SO2 gas inhalation, but not alone (Ku et al. 2017). Inhalation studies have drawn conflicting conclusions, though the studies are difficult to directly compare due to differences in animal models and exposure. Exposure of C57BL/6 mice to concentrated PM2.5 (65.7 ± 34.2 μg/m3) for 9 months produced changes in Aβ1–40 levels with no concomitant changes in tau phosphorylation as measured by PHF-1 (Bhatt et al. 2015). It is important to note that while UFPs are included in the PM2.5 fraction, they make up only a small proportion of particles by mass; they also tend to agglomerate onto PM2.5. Rats exposed to diesel exhaust via whole body inhalation for 6 months showed increases in phosphorylated tau starting around 311 μg/m3 as measured by pS199, as well as increases in Aβ42 (Levesque et al. 2011). The differences in study design related to exposure method, exposure duration, particle size fraction/type, and animal models make it difficult to directly compare results across studies.

4.3 Microglia and tau pathology

Microglia recognize and have been shown to colocalize with tau in human postmortem AD brain tissue, particularly in the subiculum (DiPatre and Gelman 1997). They can phagocytose tau in vitro as well as in vivo (Bolos et al. 2016; Sheng, Mrak, and Griffin 1997) and their phagocytic ability is markedly increased by the addition of an inflammatory stimulus such as LPS (Majerova et al. 2014). However, when inflammation is induced in the 3xTgAD mouse model by intraperitoneal injection of LPS or intracranial viral infection (e.g., mouse hepatitis virus), levels of tau hyperphosphorylation were significantly increased (Kitazawa et al. 2005; Sy et al. 2011). Additionally, some studies suggest that microglial phagocytosis of tau might not always be playing a positive role. Microglia may take up tau seeds, early protein aggregates that promote further oligomer aggregation, but fail to completely break them down. When the seeds are released, they may still be able to induce aberrant phosphorylation in other tau oligomers, thus spreading tau pathology around the brain (Hopp et al. 2018). In a mouse tauopathy model, tau propagation was markedly reduced after microglia depletion (Asai et al. 2015). UFP exposure may be acting as a mild neuroinflammatory stimulus to perturb microglial function with the unfortunate side effect of propagating tau pathology.

4.4 Lung Inflammation

Our results from BAL analysis indicated a lack of acute lung inflammation, consistent with previous studies of HUCAPS-concentrated UFP exposures in the 3xTgAD mouse model (Jew et al. 2019) (different mouse cohorts and exposure periods than reported here). The lung is obviously a main target organ for inhaled respirable particulates and one of the main hypotheses regarding potential adverse effects on the brain is that an inflammatory reaction builds in the lungs and then spills over to peripheral organs. While we cannot completely rule out an increase in inflammatory mediators peripherally, our study shows effects on the brain in the absence of overt lung inflammation. Given evidence that inhaled nanoparticles (&lt; 100 nm in diameter, like UFPs) can access the brain via the olfactory route, the possibility remains that the concentrated particulates deposited on the olfactory epithelium and entered the brain, leading to direct effects in areas where they accumulated (Balasubramanian et al. 2013; Elder et al. 2006; Kreyling 2016; Takenaka et al. 2001).

4.5 Strengths and limitations

Short-term exposures to relatively low UFP PNC led to changes in microglia morphology and AD pathology in aged 3xTgAD mice. Epidemiological studies have suggested an increased incidence of AD in humans exposed to traffic aerosols – which are enriched for UFP – indicating a potential causal relationship. The short exposure duration is a limitation in that we only captured a small snapshot of time after the development of pathology in mice, whereas humans with AD are exposed to air pollution over a lifetime, both before and after pathology develops. Our findings lay the foundation for the more extensive research that is needed to explore chronic exposure-related effects and changes that may occur in the timing of neurodegenerative pathology development. Additionally, long-term exposures would be the best way to characterize the response of male versus female mice because of the known differences in their pathological timelines. Mice were exposed to ambient, i.e., real-world, UFPs at concentrations that were of the same order of magnitude as what humans experience; for example, the median concentration of UFP measured across two days in Brooklyn, NY was 33,000 p/cm3 (Richmond-Bryant et al. 2009) and reached up to 190,000 p/cm3 (Westerdahl et al. 2005) by a busy freeway in Los Angeles. The PNCs for our experiments, 65,896 ± 53,343 p/cm3 (Cohort A) and 47,875 ± 21,850 p/cm3 (Cohort B), fall within this range. While this is very environmentally relevant, it also subjects the mice to all the daily variability that humans experience in aerosol concentration and composition. The particulate levels and composition vary from day to day and exposure to exposure, resulting in unique exposures that cannot be duplicated and may be difficult to directly compare. Furthermore, because of outflow limitations of the HUCAPS, the volume of the exposure chamber is constrained, preventing an increase in sample size or a simultaneous exposure with multiple mouse cohorts at once. Consequently, the study was performed using two cohorts that did not receive identical exposures and, therefore, cannot easily be compared to each other. Finally, it was not possible to be completely blinded to genotype for the analyses because the 3xTgAD mice manifest pathology that the NTg mice do not and which is evident when staining for 6E10, pT205, or Congo red. Any visual differences resulting from exposure, though, are not as striking, permitting the analyst to remain blinded with regard to exposure.

5. Conclusions

In summary, our study shows that concentrated UFP exposure in 3xTgAD mice can lead to statistically significant changes in the hippocampus, including microglial morphology perturbations, decreases in plaque deposition, and increases in tau phosphorylation in the absence of overt inflammatory changes in the lung. 3xTgAD mice exposed to UFP had more ramified microglia in the hippocampus when compared to 3xTgAD air-exposed mice as well as fewer plaques and plaque-associated microglia. Microglial morphology in the cortex was unchanged by exposure. In the subiculum of 3xTgAD mice, UFP exposure caused decreases in the number of Congophilic plaques and 6E10 staining in comparison to filtered air-exposed controls. Paradoxically, UFP exposure led to increased tau phosphorylation as compared to air-exposed controls. Further research is necessary to understand the mechanisms by which these responses are initiated. This is especially important, as these changes were seen at relatively low UFP aerosol concentrations. UFP emissions remain unregulated across much of the world and demonstrating that health effects can be independently associated with the UFP fraction may help spur changes in air pollution regulation, as well as the pathological course of debilitating chronic diseases in humans, like AD.
