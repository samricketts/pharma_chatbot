Objectives:

The Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale (PFS) is a self-administered 10-item tool to measure physical and mental fatigability in older adults. The aim of the current study was to validate the psychometric properties of the traditional Chinese version of PFS (TC-PFS).

Methods:

We recruited 114 community-dwellingolder adults, where 35 were diagnosed with late-life depression (LLD), 26 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 53 were cognitively normal (CN) from a larger community study of older adults. Statistical analyses were done separately for TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales. Factor analysis was used for reliability, Cronbach’s alpha for internal consistency, Pearson’s correlation for construct validity, and group comparison for discriminative validity.

Results:

Factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure for both the TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales with high reliability (α = 0.89 and 0.89, respectively). Patients with LLD had the highest PFS scores, with 80.0% and 82.9% classified as having greater physical and mental fatigability. For concurrent validity, we found moderate associations with the vitality and physical functioning subscales of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. For convergent validity, TC-PFS showed moderate association with emotional-related psychometrics, particularly for the Physical subscale in those with LLD. In contrast, TC-PFS Mental subscale showed correlations with cognitive function, particularly in the MCI group.

Conclusions:

Our results indicate that the TC-PFS is a valid instrument to measure perceived physical and mental fatigability in older Taiwanese adults.

Clinical implications:

Perceived fatigability reflects the underlying physical, mental or cognitive function in older adults with or without depression.

pmcIntroduction

Perceived fatigue is a complex state describing the subjective feeling of lack of physical or mental energy. It is a common symptom in neurological diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson disease, or chronic fatigue syndrome) (Kluger, Krupp, &amp; Enoka, 2013), cancer (Hofman, Ryan, Figueroa-Moseley, Jean-Pierre, &amp; Morrow, 2007), rheumatoid arthritis (Hewlett et al., 2005) and systemic lupus erythematosus (Ad Hoc Committee on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Response Criteria for Fatigue, 2007). In community-dwelling adults in US, 31.2% of patients had complaints of chronic fatigue (Meng, Hale, &amp; Friedberg, 2010). The prevalence of fatigue varies due to differences in culture, assessment tool, and population selection; however, it contributes to the decline in quality of life and disability in these patients (Chen, Fan, Hu, Yang, &amp; Li, 2013; Juengst, Skidmore, Arenth, Niyonkuru, &amp; Raina, 2013; Schmeding &amp; Schneider, 2013).

In the medical setting, general practitioners reported a 38.2% prevalence rate among patients having symptoms of fatigue or loss of energy, and the prevalence escalated to 93.6% among subsamples diagnosed with major depression (Maurice-Tison et al., 1998). In a prospective study from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA), those who reported chronic unexplained fatigue at baseline and during a 13-year follow-up had a 28-fold increase risk in developing new onset depression than those who never had fatigue (Addington, Gallo, Ford, &amp; Eaton, 2001). Based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) (DSM-5), fatigue is one of the criteria in diagnosing major depressive disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). In sum, fatigue is an integral part of depressive symptoms.

Fatigue is also one of the components constituting frailty, along with low grip strength, slowed walking speed, low physical activity, and unintentional weight loss (Xue, 2011). Although physical frailty is associated with incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI), fatigue is not, possibly due to the single-item scale not being sensitive enough to gauge fatigue (Boyle, Buchman, Wilson, Leurgans, &amp; Bennett, 2010). On the other hand, the one-page Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale (PFS) successfully predicted mobility decline in older adults (Simonsick et al., 2018). However, there is no prior research directly focusing on the symptom of fatigue in those with MCI. With aging, one may expect the prevalence of fatigue to increase, given the decline in strength, endurance and muscle power in older adults. However, studies have shown counterintuitive results due to avoidance or slowing-down in the activities engaged by older people to avoid the feeling of fatigue (i.e., self-pacing) (Eldadah, 2010). By examining fatigability, a novel concept to measure fatigue symptoms (e.g., tiredness, exhaustion) anchored to standardized activities with predefined duration and intensity, we can account for self-pacing bias. Glynn et al. (2015) developed the 10-item self-administered PFS to fill the gap in tools to measure perceived physical and mental fatigability in a single instrument. The PFS was designed and validated for older adults ≥60 years, and included activities frequently performed by older adults (Glynn et al., 2015; Renner et al., 2021). Furthermore, the PFS has been validated in different cultures (Feenstra, Smidt, Van Munster, Glynn, &amp; De Rooij, 2020; Pérez et al., 2019) and clinical groups (Carlozzi, Boileau, Murphy, Braley, &amp; Kratz, 2019). Developing a traditional Chinese version of the PFS is important. For example, “shenjing shuairuo” is the Chinese version of neurasthenia to describe fatigue, weakness or physical pain (Chang et al., 2005). Since fatigue is a subjective feeling, it can be conceptualized differently from one culture to another (Karasz &amp; Mckinley, 2007). In Hong Kong, 10.7% of the general population had chronic fatigue (Wong &amp; Fielding, 2010), and 44.2% of older adults and 72.5% of older adults with depression presented with fatigue as their medically unexplained somatic symptom (Yu &amp; Lee, 2012). Yet, the existing traditional Chinese versions of fatigue-related psychometrics are varied and each pose different construct validities (Shun, Beck, Pett, &amp; Berry, 2006). Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the traditional Chinese version of the PFS in a community-based cohort, consisting of those with late-life depression, mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively normal older adults.

Methods

Participants

We enrolled older participants from a community study after the approval of the institutional review board at Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan (IRB number: 201600269B0). The Keelung Community Study included residents who consented to a longitudinal cohort study, with the primary goal of examining the trajectory changes of physical and mental health through annual tests. These community-dwelling participants were recruited via advertisements at community centers. Protocols for this study have been approved by the institutional review board of the Chang Gung Medical Foundation (IRB No. 201600580B0).

The parent Keelung Community cohort study enrolled over 3000 participants at baseline (2013–2015) from the community residing in four townships in Keelung city, Taiwan (Wei et al., 2019). Among these participants, we aimed to recruit a subset of participants categorized as (1) late-life depression (LLD); (2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI); and (3) cognitively normal (CN) older controls, for the validation analyses in this current study. In the current study, we retrospectively searched for possible candidates based on the scores from the two screening tools administered in the parent study, the Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire (Lee, Yang, Lai, Chiu, &amp; Chau, 2000) and the Alzheimer Disease 8 (Galvin et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2011). Older adult participants aged ≥60 with scores &gt;19 on Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire or a score of 2 in Alzheimer Disease 8 (AD-8) were contacted by telephone and were invited to a 30-min Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I) (Sheehan et al., 1998) to ascertain the confirmatory diagnosis. Major depressive disorder was diagnosed based on DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and MCI based on previous criteria (Petersen, 2011). In order to refine our inclusion of MCI, additional requirements for MCI included scores on the Cognitive Dementia Rating (CDR) (Morris, 1993) &lt;1 and score of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) &lt;24, based on previous research in a Taiwanese sample (Tsai et al., 2012). Those who met the diagnosis of LLD or MCI, and the CN controls, received further comprehensive neuropsychological assessments and served as the validation sample for the TC-PFS.

Exclusion criteria consisted of other major mental illness (i.e., psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, or substance use disorders) and major neurocognitive disorder, based on DSM-5 criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). We also excluded those with a history of significant head trauma (with loss of consciousness), major neurological disorder, stroke, thyroid dysfunction, or other systemic illness. No psychotropics were used in either the LLD, MCI or CN control group during the study. In short, we sequentially scrutinized and examined participants from our parent community study comprising 3000 mid- to older adults to accumulatively accrue 114 participants LLD or MCI cases for the current study (Figure 1).

Behavioral measures

The Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale (PFS) was translated from the English version to Chinese by the author (C. Lin) and back translated to English by a bilingual person. The original scale and the back-translated scales were compared and reviewed by the original author of the PFS (N. Glynn) and a native Chinese speaker fluent in English (J. Ju) to assure the quality of the Chinese version. The PFS asks the participant to rate their perception of physical and mental fatigability on a scale from 0 (“no fatigue”) to 5 (“extreme fatigue”) for each of the 10 social, sedentary, lifestyle, and physical activities that vary by intensity (from light to high intensity) and duration. For the TC-PFS, we added an 11th item (“moderate household activity for 30 min”) from the original list of 26 items from the PFS initial development. This new item K was added to the scale as there was some concern that item D, “heavy gardening or outdoor work,” was not culturally relevant to Taiwanese older adults. To evaluate the impact of keeping the original item D versus replacing it with the new item K, two TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscale scores were calculated each with scores ranging from 0 to 50 (higher scores = greater fatigability). A cutoff point of ≥15 and ≥13 was used to classify higher physical and mental fatigability, respectively (Simonsick et al., 2018; Wasson et al., 2019). The TC-PFS can be provided free of charge upon request for noncommercial use via https://publichealth.pitt.edu/epidemiology/research-practice/faculty-research/pittsburgh-fatigability-scale.

A series of tests were administered to examine the validity of the TC-PFS. For concurrent validity, vitality and physical functioning subscales from the SF-36 (Fuh, Wang, Lu, Juang, &amp; Lee, 2000; Tseng, 2003) were chosen for its previously established relatedness to the measurement of fatigue (Hewlett, Dures, &amp; Almeida, 2011; O’sullivan &amp; Mccarthy, 2007). For convergent validity, we included the 5-item Sarcopenia Assessment (SARC-F) (Cao et al., 2014) to measure the degree of muscle loss. We also chose psychological scales, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Wang et al., 2011; Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983), Apathy evaluation scale (Lee, Wen, Chao, Chen, &amp; Yen, 2008), and UCLA-Loneliness scale (Russell, Peplau, &amp; Cutrona, 1980). Neurocognitive tests were also included to investigate whether perceived physical and mental fatigability was related to differences in cognitive function in older adults (i.e., cognitive fatigue) (Avlund, 2010). Global cognitive scores included MMSE, MoCA, and Alzheimer’s disease Assessment Scale (ADASCog) (Liu et al., 2002). Cognitive domains were derived from individual cognitive tasks, including the digit symbol substitution test (DSST), digit span forward/backward, letter-number sequencing (LNS) (Yang et al., 2013), facial memory (memory domain), and category verbal fluency (language domain). The score of the DSST was reversed such that higher values in each domain represented better functioning. We averaged the scores of the DSST plus digit span forward and LNS plus LNS to yield two other cognitive domains, processing speed and working memory.

Statistical analyses

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) between the three groups was conducted with Scheffé post hoc analysis for the demographic data and all psychometrics. We also performed exploratory factor analysis with a direct oblimin rotation. An eigenvalue more than one was required to include the factor in which the item has a factor loading greater than 0.50. We subsequently conducted confirmatory factor analysis based on the results from exploratory factor analysis for both subscales in all participants as well as within diagnostic sub-groups. Internal consistency was derived by calculating Cronbach α and item-total correlations. Two values of Cronbach α were calculated to see if the revised PFS (with item K for item D) outperformed the original scale. We used Pearson correlations to compute the correlation between total scores of both TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales and the psychometrics for the analysis of concurrent and convergent validity, as well as the association with cognitive function. These correlational analyses were conducted in all participants as well as separately by each group (MCI, LLD, CN). We evaluated discriminant validity based on the results from the previous one-way ANOVA as we expected significant group differences. The analyses above were performed using SPSS v21 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) with significance level set at p &lt; .05. Missing PFS data were imputed using SAS for four of the participants with less than three items missing (Cooper et al., 2019).

Results

We enrolled 114 participants, n = 35 patients with LLD, n = 26 MCI, and n = 53 CN controls. We excluded four participants due to completely missing TC-PFS data. There were age differences among the three groups, with the mean age of 68.6 ± 6.1 (range = 60–83 years) in MCI, higher than the 65.6 ± 4.1 (range = 60–77 years) in LLD, and 66.1 ± 3.9 (range = 60–77 years) in CN controls. Greater numbers of women had LLD compared with MCI and CN controls with marginally significant differences (X2 = 5.5, p = .064). Compared to LLD and CN controls, lower education level was noted in those with MCI (F (2, 111) = 13.0, p &lt; .001) (Table 1).

Reliability

The Cronbach’s alpha was 0.89 and 0.89 for the TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales, respectively. After replacing item D with the new item K, the Cronbach’s alpha value was unchanged. Moreover, 74% of the participants performed item D in the past week compared to only 38% for the added item K. The item-total correlation (r) ranged from 0.51 to 0.75 for all items in both the TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales (Table 2). Therefore, the validity of the TC-PFS and the ensuing analysis were evaluated using the original 10 items from the PFS.

Known-groups discriminant validity was confirmed with significant group difference in TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales (F (2, 111) = 12.8, p &lt; .001; F (2, 111) = 16.8, p &lt; .001). LLD scored the highest on the TC-PFS Physical or Mental subscales than the controls and MCI in post-hoc comparison (p &lt; .001). Prevalence rates of greater perceived physical (TC-PFS ≥ 15) and mental (TC-PFS ≥ 13) fatigability was 80.0% and 82.9%, respectively, for the patients with LLD. A total of 57.5% and 61.5% of the MCI participants were classified as having greater physical and mental fatigability, respectively, while only 39.6% and 35.8% in CN controls. Other results were as expected that patients of LLD scored higher in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and that those of MCI scored lower in MMSE or MoCA but had higher rates of sarcopenia (measured with SARC-F). We present the full results in Table 1.

Factor analysis

Exploratory factor analysis revealed two factors with eigenvalue greater than 1 were found, accounting for 60.9% and 62.8 of the variance in TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales, respectively (Table 2). Standardized root mean square residual (SRMR &lt; 0.08), comparative fit index (CFI &gt; 0.9), and Tucker–Lewis index (TLI &gt; 0.9) were adopted to evaluate model fit (Awang, 2012). Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated this two-factor structure in TC-PFS Physical subscale to be acceptable (X2 = 64.7, df = 34, p &lt; .001, CFI = 0.94, TLI = .91, RMSEA = 0.08) for the entire sample. However, the model fit for TC-PFS Mental subscale was less robust, compared to the PFS Physical subscale (Table 3).

Validity

In the analysis of concurrent validity, both TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales showed mild to moderate correlation with vitality and physical functioning subscales from the SF-36. Sarcopenia scale correlated with TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales in CN controls (r = −.37, p = .008; r = −.31, p = .03, respectively). Across all participants, significant concurrent validity was also found with the TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales correlations ranging from 0.29 to 0.47 (in absolute value) with all the scales above.

For convergent validity, nearly all psychological and emotional psychometrics correlated with the TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales in CN and LLD groups, but not in MCI. In MCI, only the TC-PFS Mental subscale showed significant correlations with neurocognitive functions, including cognitive domains in processing speed (r = −.45. p = .02), working memory (r = −.42. p = .03), and language function (r = −.52. p = .01). For the memory domain, a significant correlation was found with TC-PFS Physical subscale only in LLD (r = −.34. p = .04) (Table 4). Across all the participants, TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales showed similar characteristics in the correlational analysis, while the TC-PFS Mental subscale demonstrated additional correlation with apathy and neurocognitive function as opposed to TC-PFS Physical subscale.

Discussion

Our research provides the reliability and validity of the traditional Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale, including both its Physical and Mental fatigability subscales, in community-dwelling older adults with consisting of three diagnostic entities, including those with intact cognition, mild cognitive impairment and late-life depression. Those with LLD had the greatest physical and mental fatigability, while the MCI and CN groups did not differ statistically in fatigability scores. The traditional Chinese version of the PFS demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties to measure perceived physical and mental fatigability in Taiwanese older adults.

The internal consistency of the TC-PFS is comparable to the original PFS Physical and Spanish PFS Physical subscales, with a 0.88 and 0.83 Cronbach’s alpha value, respectively (Glynn et al., 2015; Pérez et al., 2019). Moreover, when we substituted the original item D,” heavy gardening or outdoor work,” with another item of comparable intensity and duration, “moderate household activity for 30 min”, from the original 26-item scale, this did not improve the Cronbach’s alpha. This demonstrated that the original 10-item PFS remains a reliable instrument measuring perceived physical and mental fatigability even for different culture backgrounds. In factor analysis, two principal factors were identified, with one factor composed of items related to low-intensity or social activity and the other to moderate- to high-intensity activity. The two-factor result is nearly identical for two subscales in TC-PFS. Item C (light household activity for 1 h) loaded in the factor of moderate- to high-intensity activity, in contrast to the finding in the original PFS (Glynn et al., 2015). One possibility is that household activity contributed to the largest portion of the physical activity in older adults in Taiwan (Ku, Sun, Chang, &amp; Chen, 2013) but contributed less to general well-being as opposed to leisure activity (Ku, Fox, Liao, Sun, &amp; Chen, 2016). This implies that household activity may be recognized as particularly tiring in our culture. Also, in contrast to the original PFS Mental subscale (Renner et al., 2021) and the Dutch version of PFS (Feenstra et al., 2020), our results loaded item A (leisurely walk for 1 h) to the factor of low-intensity or social activity factor. Further studies with larger sample sizes for different populations are needed to validate these cross-cultural differences. Another influence of cultural differences in our results could be explained by the TC-PFS Physical subscale performing better than the TC-PFS Mental subscale. Notably, Chinese individuals have the tendency to use somatization in expressing suppressed mental distress (Mak &amp; Zane, 2004). This phenomenon is particularly evident in depressed patients (Ryder &amp; Chentsova-Dutton, 2012), which may explain our findings that the TC-PFS Physical subscale had the best model fit indexes in LLD.

In our sample, those with LLD reported greater fatigability compared to MCI and CN groups; with 80.0% reporting greater physical fatigability and 82.9% greater mental fatigability. This prevalence is similar to findings from Ferentinos, Kontaxakis, Havaki-Kontaxaki, Dikeos, and Lykouras (2011), where 79.2% of middle-aged depressed patients reported high fatigue using the fatigue/energy item from the mini-international neuropsychiatric interview (M.I.N.I.). Fatigue is also associated with faster progression to death in female patients with LLD (Brown et al., 2014). Fatigability is increasingly recognized as an important symptom in depression, and specific treatment has been discussed to target this dimension (Demyttenaere, De Fruyt, &amp; Stahl, 2005; Ghanean, Ceniti, &amp; Kennedy, 2018).

We also found that the MCI group reported a similar rate of fatigability compared to the CN group. Although no statistically significant differences in fatigability emerged during post–hoc analysis for the MCI and CN groups, it should be noted that those with MCI had 57.5% greater physical fatigability and 61.5% for mental; almost 20% higher than CN group (39.6% and 35.8%, respectively). It is worth noting that the percentage of having greater physical fatigability in our CN group is higher than the 28% (in the age group of 60–69, similar to our sample) reported in the Long Life Family Study (Lasorda et al., 2020). This may strengthen our hypothesis of cultural difference in shaping the perception of fatigability. Although the research on the prevalence of fatigability in MCI is scarce, one study by Tsutsumimoto et al. (2014) found 17.4% of MCI patients had exhaustion, a state defined as unusual fatigue. These descriptive differences in MCI and CN are notable as there is a paucity of research on fatigue in MCI and research should further explore whether cognitive decline and fatigue may share overlapping neuroscientific mechanism. For example, Carvalho et al. (2017) found that fatigue in cognitively normal older adults was associated with 9 years of accelerated brain aging measured with cortical thickness, suggesting fatigue may be associated with mechanisms of neurodegeneration seen in MCI individuals. Moreover, subjective fatigue was associated with accentuated decline in all cognitive domains over the years (Lin, Chen, Vance, Ball, &amp; Mapstone, 2013). And specifically mental fatigability has been associated with impaired physiological stress regulation and brain basal ganglia circuitry dysfunction in MCI (Lin et al., 2016).

When examining all participants, both TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales showed acceptable concurrent validity based on the moderate association with vitality and physical functioning subscales from the SF-36, subscales frequently referenced to measure fatigue (Donovan, Jacobsen, Small, Munster, &amp; Andrykowski, 2008; Ferentinos et al., 2011). In convergent validity, both the TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales correlated with activity, emotion and neurocognitive related scales. These findings were consistent with previous fatigue and fatigability literature. For example, physical and mental fatigability correlated with perceived loneliness; past research has shown being lonely is associated with fatigue, possibly due to immune system dysregulation (Jaremka et al., 2013). Pain, depression and loneliness also tend to cluster together, suggesting possible common risk factors (Jaremka et al., 2014). Related to our finding that lower muscle strength correlated with TC-PFS Physical subscale, it has been found that greater physical fatigability mediated the association of lower physical activity on slower gait speed at younger-old ages (Qiao et al., 2020). On the other hand, TC-PFS Mental subscale correlated more with tools measuring psychological and cognitive function compared to TC-PFS Physical subscale. In research done on patients of Parkinson’s disease, it was mental fatigue, not physical fatigue, that correlated with depression (Lou, Kearns, Oken, Sexton, &amp; Nutt, 2001). Moreover, those with greater perceived mental fatigability, not physical fatigability, had smaller amygdala (Wasson et al., 2019), a key region involved with depression and anxiety (Ressler &amp; Mayberg, 2007). It has been proposed that dopaminergic depletion could be a common mechanism leading to both apathy and mental fatigue with underlying dysfunction in basal ganglia-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex loop (Sáez-Francas, Hernández-Vara, Corominas Roso, Alegre Martín, &amp; Casas Brugué, 2013). Since this fatigue-related basal ganglia circuitry has numerous afferent and efferent connections with prefrontal cortex, perceived mental fatigability is also associated with neurocognitive dysfunction (Chaudhuri &amp; Behan, 2000). Perceived mental fatigability also correlated better than perceived physical fatigability with global cognitive function in LLD and working memory in MCI. Recently, the PFS Mental subscale was validated and shown to be correlated with cognitive function (Letter Fluency and Trail Making Tests) (Renner et al., 2021), supporting the measurement of the PFS Mental subscale, in addition to the Physical subscale. Future work should examine the effect of having both cognitive impairment and mental fatigability on impairment in brain regions associated with processing speed and working memory. In conclusion, both physical and mental fatigability exhibited acceptable concurrent and convergent validity, notably that the TC-PFS Physical subscale correlated better with activity-orientated scales, and TC-PFS Mental subscale with emotion and cognitive related scales. This work underscores perceived physical and mental fatigability as important markers of phenotypic aging across cultures (Schrack, Simonsick, &amp; Glynn, 2020).

Limitations and conclusion

Our study has some limitations. First, the number of participants was small. The MCI group in particular had the fewest participants (n = 26), which may have led to power issues in detecting significant differences for that group. The same issue happened when we conducted confirmatory factor analysis and reliability tests in sub-groups. Second, selection bias may exist, as our sample consisted of active community-dwelling older adults. Future studies should consider evaluating the TC-PFS in a nursing home setting. Third, we did not have objective measurements of physical or mental fatigability, although the Spanish-version of PFS Physical subscale correlated well with an objective measurement of physical fatigability (Pérez et al., 2019). However, perceived and performance mental fatigability have constantly been shown to have weak correlations across different disease entities (Bailey, Channon, &amp; Beaumont, 2007; Baran, Zhang, Anderson, Mcdermott, &amp; Lin, 2019; Cockshell &amp; Mathias, 2014; Jarad, Sequeiros, Patel, Bristow, &amp; Sund, 2012). Furthermore, it is “perceived” fatigability that predicts future mobility decline (Avlund, Damsgaard, Sakari-Rantala, Laukkanen, &amp; Schroll, 2002; Juengst et al., 2013; Simonsick et al., 2018). Nevertheless, this is the first traditional Chinese version of a perceived fatigability scale validated in Taiwan. Further studies on these two subscales from TC-PFS should be extended to other disease entities and in other parts of Chinese-speaking regions.

Clinical implications

TC-PFS is a reliable instrument to assess perceived physical and mental fatigability in older Taiwanese adults.

TC-PFS Physical and Mental subscales showed moderate association with emotional-related psychometrics.

Greater perceived mental fatigability correlated with lower global cognitive function and working memory in older adults with late-life depressed and mild cognitive impairment.
