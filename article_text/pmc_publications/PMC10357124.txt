Fatigue is a long-lasting problem in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with limited research that investigated the fatigue-related white-matter changes within TBI and/or PTSD cohorts. This exploratory cross-sectional study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological data collected from 153 male Vietnam War veterans, as part of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative - Department of Defense, and were divided clinically into control veterans, PTSD, TBI, and with both TBI and PTSD (TBI+PTSD). The existence of fatigue was defined by the question “Do you often feel tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime?”. DTI data were compared between fatigue and non-fatigue subgroups in each clinical group using tract-based spatial statistics voxel-based differences. Fatigue was reported in controls (29.55%), slightly higher in TBI (52.17%, PBenf = 0.06), and significantly higher in both TBI+PTSD (66.67%, PBenf = 0.001) and PTSD groups (79.25%, PBenf &lt; 0.001). Compared to non-fatigued subgroups, no white-matter differences were observed in the fatigued subgroups of control or TBI, while the fatigued PTSD subgroup only showed increased diffusivity measures (i.e., radial and axial), and the fatigued TBI+PTSD subgroup showed decreased fractional anisotropy and increased diffusivity measures (PFWE ≤ 0.05). The results act as preliminary findings suggesting fatigue to be significantly reported in TBI+PTSD and PTSD decades post-trauma with a possible link to white-matter microstructural differences in both PTSD and TBI+PTSD. Future studies with larger cohorts and detailed fatigue assessments would be required to identify the white-matter changes associated with fatigue in these cohorts.

pmcIntroduction

Fatigue is a symptom presented in both physical and mental forms as an acute response to physical, mental, or infectious triggers. Fatigue appears to manifest as a life-lasting consequence of both physical and emotional trauma (Heim et al., 2009; Johansson and Rnnbck, 2014; Rau et al., 2018). Trauma is a consequence of different sources including physical insults causing traumatic brain injury (TBI), and/or emotional causes leading to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma causes significant burden to human welfare, health sector, economy, and government. TBI is the result of an excessive physical force to the brain which may lead to long-term behavioural and cognitive impairments, depending on the severity of the TBI (Pavlovic et al., 2019). PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that result from exposure to traumatic events such as war/combat, serious accident, rape, and more that would lead to several behavioural and cognitive issues (Scott et al., 2017). Furthermore, TBI has a high comorbidity with PTSD as the outcome of surviving a life-threatening traumatic event (Van Praag et al., 2019).

Studies indicate that 58–67% of individuals with history of TBI relative to 18–20% of non-injured controls endure significant levels of fatigue (Schiehser et al., 2017). A separate study has revealed that 16–32% of TBI survivors reported increased fatigue within one-year post-TBI, which persisted for two years, with the sleep quality, depression, and pain considered to be the main contributors to the reported fatigue levels (Bushnik et al., 2008). Another study reported fatigue in 68% and 73% of cases at 2 and 5 years post-TBI, respectively (Olver et al., 1996). PTSD was also linked with daytime fatigue and was independent of the poor sleep (Rau et al., 2018) and fatigue was most commonly associated with stress and anxiety (Shen et al., 2006). It has been proposed that fatigue and attention problems related to TBI may be worse in patients with PTSD (McAllister, 2009), and thus negatively impact the clinical outcomes in these patients.

Despite efforts to identify neurobiological biomarkers of the fatigue (Tajima et al., 2010), limited literature has been able to identify the changes that underpin fatigue in TBI and/or PTSD. Some studies have employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate alterations to the white-matter microstructure, associated with fatigue (Delano-Wood et al., 2015; Clark et al., 2017). DTI has been suggested as the main neuroimaging modality to investigate the white-matter alterations associated with brain development as well as across disorders (Xekardaki et al., 2011; Kantarci et al., 2017), and changes observed in DTI have been associated with different pathologies including neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal injury (Xekardaki et al., 2011; Kantarci et al., 2017). One study reported that subjective cognitive fatigue was associated with decreased white-matter integrity in striato-thalamo-cortical tracts, known for their role in mediating arousal and higher-order cognitive processes in TBI survivors (Clark et al., 2017). A separate study of the brainstem white-matter tracts seven years post-TBI, showed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in corticospinal tracts which correlated with loss of consciousness, while reduced FA values in the pontine tegmentum correlated with post-concussive symptoms including fatigue (Delano-Wood et al., 2015). Interestingly, despite the overlap in symptomatology between TBI and PTSD, and the extensive neuroimaging research in PTSD, no DTI studies were performed to investigate the association between fatigue and white-matter alterations in PTSD.

The aim of the current study was to investigate fatigue-related white matter changes, as revealed by DTI, as a long-term consequence of moderate-to-severe TBI with or without comorbid PTSD, or due to PTSD alone in Vietnam War Veterans decades after the war.

Materials and Methods

Participants’ information

We used data acquired as part of the US Department of Defense Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (DOD-ADNI), a non-randomised neuroimaging study that recruited Vietnam War veterans to investigate TBI and/or PTSD as potential risk factors for the development of Alzheimer’s disease. DOD-ADNI is part of the ADNI project led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner. Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of University of Queensland (IRB number #2017000630).

A total of 191 datasets of DTI scans were downloaded from DOD-ADNI website. Following data quality check, a total of 31 scans were excluded due to different DTI protocol (n =13), missing slices (n = 3), image (field) distortion (n = 6), or inadequate brain orientation (n = 9). Furthermore, seven more participants were excluded from the analysis due to the absence of their fatigue-status response.

Finally, a total of 153 individuals with good-quality DTI scans and a Fatigue-status were included in our final analysis. Fatigue status was recorded as “Yes” or “No”, to the question “Do you often feel tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime?”. Participants were divided into 8 different subgroups as described in Figure 1. The groups consisted of participants with/without reported fatigue and: (i) veterans without service-related injury (controls), (ii) those with TBI, (iii) those with combined TBI+PTSD, and (iv) PTSD patients (Weiner et al., 2017). The control group included Vietnam War veterans without history of TBI or PTSD. The TBI group included veterans with a documented history of moderate-to-severe TBI related to their earlier military services based on the VA/DoD criteria for TBI (Weiner et al., 2017) with a loss of consciousness ≥ 24 hours, post-traumatic amentia &gt; 24 hours, or alteration of consciousness ≥ 24 hours. The PTSD group was diagnosed using the DSM-IV, with the criterion of a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score &gt; 40. The TBI+PTSD group consisted of veterans with a history of TBI who developed PTSD later in life.

In addition to imaging, all participants had participated in neuropsychological assessments by completing several questionnaires described in previous publications (Mohamed et al., 2018, 2019, 2021a). This was used to identify people with cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment. In addition, cognitive fatigue might result from the cognitive impairment, therefore it is important to investigate the presence of cognitive challenges associated with fatigue in different groups.

Mild cognitive impairment was identified by ADNI team as described in the earlier publication (Weiner et al., 2017). In brief, MCI was screened for using adapted version of AD8 (Yaffe et al., 2010; Weiner et al., 2015) along with the 10-word list recall Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. In addition, we defined MCI based on global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5, with a Memory Box score of at least 0.5 (Petersen et al., 2010), with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score between 24 and 30. None of the participants included in the analysis had mild cognitive impairment.

MRI acquisition and pre-processing

Data acquisition procedures were standardised across all ADNI sites, and study protocol information can be found at (https://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/DODADNI_Procedures_Manual_20170912.pdf).

Data were pre-processed and analysed using MRtrix3 (https://www.mrtrix.org/) and FMRIB’s Software Library (FSL 6.0.4). DTI data were denoised (dwidenoise), corrected for eddy currents (FSL-eddy correct) using the average b0 volumes as a reference volume, skull stripped (FSL-bet2), and corrected for field bias (dwibiascorrect). The Diffusion (kurtosis) tensor estimation tool in MRtrix was used for the local fitting of the diffusion tensors to generate the FA, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) maps. A study specific template was generated by linearly co-register the FA maps to the FMRIB58 template-space to generate the initial study specific template; then all individual FA maps were fed to the antsMultivariateTemplateConstruction2.sh to run for 6 iterations. The resulted warp maps were then used to normalise the FA, MD, RD, and AD maps to the study specific template. Tract Based Spatial Statistics was used to generate the group mean FA images and then skeletonise the mean map to identify the centers of all white matter tracts in the different study groups with a threshold FA value of 0.2.

Statistical analysis

The demographic, behavioral and cognitive data were tested for data normality, and the data was found to be normally distributed using the Shapiro–Wilk test (Mishra et al., 2019). To test for differences between the trauma groups in the neuropsychological measures, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by unpaired t-tests were used to compare continuous data and the Chi-Squared test to compare categorical data, both of which were performed in R (version 3.3.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with Bonferroni correction (PBenf ≤ 0.05) for multiple comparisons.

Voxel-based analysis was used to compare between those with self-reported fatigue and without self-reported fatigue in the different cohorts. DTI measures were incorporated into the general linear model and calculated “FSL-randomise” with 10,000 permutations and corrected for multiple comparisons using threshold-free cluster enhancement with a family-wise error correction (PFWE ≤ 0.05). The comparison between the TBI, PTSD, TBI+PTSD, and controls were performed in our earlier publication (Mohamed et al., 2021b). Age, education level, and APOE4 status were added as confounding variables to the analysis to reduce their influence on the observed results. Previous studies reported that age and APOE4 status are known to alter the brain white-matter microstructure (Dean et al., 2014; Operto et al., 2019; Nir et al., 2021). These results confirm the increased vulnerability of white-matter tracts in APOE-ε4 in health population. Furthermore, studies showed education levels to change the structure and microstructure of the brain in healthy populations (Dufouil et al., 2003; Noble et al., 2013; Cox et al., 2016; Bathelt et al., 2019), and these observations might persist even 60 years later but influenced by other factors as well (Cox et al., 2016).

Results

PTSD and TBI+PTSD groups show cognitive deficits

The demographics of the participants from different groups are presented in Table 1. The results showed fatigue presented in the control group (29.55%). Chi-square statistics revealed a slightly larger number of fatigued participants in TBI (52.17%, PBenf = 0.06), and significant higher percentage of the fatigued participants in the TBI+PTSD (66.67%, PBenf = 0.001) and the PTSD group (79.25%, PBenf &lt; 0.001) compared to controls (see Table 1). When investigating the neuropsychological and cognitive measures (results in Table 2), a significantly higher ECog-language subscale (PBenf = 0.003) in the control group, and total ECog score in the PTSD group (PBenf = 0.046) was observed in those with reported fatigue as compared to those without fatigue (Table 2). No other neuropsychological or cognitive measures were significant in any of the fatigue-subgroups (PBenf &gt; 0.05).

Fractional anisotropy was reduced in those with fatigue in the TBI+PTSD but not the other trauma groups or the controls

TBSS analysis revealed no differences between those with and without self-reported fatigue in the control (PFWE &gt; 0.05), TBI (PFWE &gt; 0.05), and PTSD groups (Figure 2; PFWE &gt; 0.05). However, the TBI+PTSD group, with fatigue had decreased FA as compared to those without fatigue across a distributed network of tracks which included fornix, cingulum, middle cerebellar peduncle, cerebral peduncle, anterior, posterior, and retro-lenticular parts of internal capsule, external capsule, superior corona radiata, uncinate fasciculus, medial lemniscus, superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) (Figure 3).

The fatigue-associated diffusivity measures were increased in the TBI+PTSD and PTSD groups, but not in the TBI or Control groups.

Greater values of AD, RD, and MD measures were found in the PTSD group (Figure 2) and TBI+PTSD group (Figure 3). No significant differences in diffusivity measures between fatigues and non-fatigued subgroups of the control group or the TBI group (PFWE &gt; 0.05).

In the PTSD group, the fatigue subgroup showed greater AD values in the external capsule, IFOF, ILF, corticospinal tract, and cerebral peduncle (PFWE ≤ 0.05; Figure 2). In addition, RD was increased in those with reported fatigue in the corticospinal tract, cerebral peduncle, and middle and superior cerebellar peduncle (PFWE ≤ 0.05; Figure 2). The MD values were also greater in the fatigue sub-group in the IFOF, ILF, corticospinal tract, and cerebellar peduncle (PFWE ≤ 0.05; Figure 2 and Suppl. Table 1).

In contrast to the non-fatigue groups, those with fatigue within TBI+PTSD showed greater AD in genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, IFL, SLF, internal capsule, and fornix (PFWE ≤ 0.05; Figure 2). The RD values were also greater in the fatigue sub-group in body of the corpus callosum, fornix, cingulum, superior and middle cerebellar peduncle, cerebral peduncle, external capsule, superior corona radiata, uncinate fasciculus, corticospinal tract, SLF, IFOF, and ILF (PFWE ≤ 0.05; Figure 3). The same regions showed greater MD values in the same white-matter tracts in those with fatigue as compared to those without fatigue (PFWE ≤ 0.05; Figure 3 and Suppl. Table 1).

Discussion

The current study is the first to investigate fatigue-related white-matter integrity changes in TBI, TBI+PTSD, and PTSD cohorts, decades post-trauma. These results act as preliminary exploratory findings and aims to raise the point of fatigue associated with white-matter microstructural alterations. The results demonstrated that fatigue in controls or those with TBI alone had no associated white-matter integrity changes. The absence of differences between fatigue and non-fatigue subgroups of TBI could be the results of the limited sample size within the group. Interestingly, in the TBI+PTSD group, patients with fatigue showed less FA values and greater diffusivity values as compared with those without fatigue. Fatigue patients in the PTSD group showed an increase in the diffusivity measures compared to those without fatigue. The observed differences in white-matter in these groups was not associated with differences in the different cognitive or behavioural measures, suggesting the observed white-matter alterations could be primarily due to the reported fatigue. Moreover, the results may suggest that fatigue associated with PTSD alone might differ from that associated with TBI+PTSD, with more alterations within the TBI+PTSD group. Future studies utilizing different objective fatigue assessment tools will be required to possible identify the causality link between the fatigue and white-matter in trauma survivors.

Chronic fatigue is one of the commonly reported and long-lasting post-trauma symptoms (Lannsjö et al., 2009; Saksvik et al., 2020). The current study showed that more than 50% of the TBI survivors reported increased daily fatigue despite the absence of cognitive decline when compared to healthy controls. In addition, 66% of the PTSD cohort reported fatigue during their day regardless of the source of trauma. Notably, there was a constellation of overlapping symptoms which included headache, dizziness/nausea, fatigue or lethargy, and sleep pattern alterations associated with both TBI (Pavlovic et al., 2019) and PTSD (McFarlane, 2010). Furthermore, fatigue can impact individual’s work performance and relationships causing more burden and increasing the risk for other neuropsychological problems including depression and anxiety (DeLuca, 2005; Schnieders et al., 2012; Esbjörnsson et al., 2013).

Fatigue is strongly dependent on subjective self-reporting measures which are notoriously prone to bias. To date, most clinical and research measurements of fatigue have relied upon self-reported perception of sensations such as exhaustion or weariness. In contrast, objective fatigue is performance based and determined by decline or attenuation on a quantifiable measure. Frequently, studies use one or more of surveys including the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Fatigue Impact Scale, the Fatigue Severity Scale, Mental Fatigue Scale, and the Global Fatigue Index to study the fatigue in different clinical populations, but they are all heavily dependent on subjective reporting. Therefore, it is important to find other ways to measure the Fatigue in these cohorts. Recently, studies attempted to examine cognitive fatigue objectively through inducing cognitive fatigue and then examining behavioral performance. This is achieved by either examining cognitive performance over a time period (e.g. an hour while performing a cognitive task, neuropsychological battery, or a work day), or during the course of a neuropsychological task requiring constant effort (DeLuca, 2005). Dual-tasking would require the individuals to divide attention between competing task demands to achieve a certain goal, which makes the performance in such task an objective indicator of fatigue. Future studies including subjective and objective measures of fatigue would be required for better assessment of the underlying pathology.

The extant literature reports that decreased FA is indicative of loss of white matter integrity, AD to be associated with axonal injury, while RD to be associated with demyelination, neuroinflammation with edema or macrophage infiltration (Budde et al., 2011; Mohamed et al., 2020, 2021a). Previous investigations of fatigue related white-matter alterations showed conflicting DTI findings with some reporting increased FA in the right arcuate fasciculus and the right ILF in chronic fatigue syndrome (Zeineh et al., 2015), while others have reported widespread FA reduction and increased diffusivity measures in chronic fatigue patients (Rayhan et al., 2013; D’Ambrosio et al., 2015). In this regard it has been suggested that reduced FA and increased diffusivity measures reflect demyelination and neuroinflammatory processes in populations who have reported fatigue (Rayhan et al., 2013; D’Ambrosio et al., 2015). Similarly, in PTSD patients, both neuroinflammation (Papadopoulos and Cleare, 2012; Prasad and Bondy, 2015) and demyelination (Djokić et al., 1998)(32)(32) have previously been reported in PTSD. Inflammatory markers have been associated with day-time fatigue as reflected by the elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (Djokić et al., 1998). Furthermore, hyperarousal and concurrent fatigue have been described in other syndromes that are characterised by increased activation of stress-response systems (Rau et al., 2018). This may suggest that fatigue following PTSD might result from the impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which is common with other fatigue disorders such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue (McBeth et al., 2007; McFarlane, 2010; Papadopoulos and Cleare, 2012). The results from the present study might indicate that white-matter tracts associated with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system were altered in both TBI+PTSD and PTSD groups suggesting that fatigue may be a secondary consequence of dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system (Rau et al., 2018).

Studies showed several regions are affected in TBI, PTSD and fatigue patients including frontal cortex (Pardini et al., 2010; Tajima et al., 2010), temporal lobe (Marshall and Garakani, 2002), and amygdala (Meeus and Nijs, 2007). A previous study using positron emission tomography suggested the decreased activity of prefrontal brain regions during wakefulness to be associated with daytime fatigue observed in people with insomnia (Papadopoulos and Cleare, 2012). Several white-matter tracts connected to the frontal cortex were altered in the fatigue-subgroup of the TBI+PTSD and PTSD groups. The IFOF connects multiple frontal, temporal and occipital cortical regions that have been implicated with the fatigue and cognitive decline in these clinical groups (Fukuda et al., 1994) through the link between the frontal cortex connectivity to the nucleus accumbens (Camara et al., 2010). The critical role of the IFOF is an important connector of different regions involved in fatigue and perception, which suggests it might assume a key role in chronic fatigue in trauma survivors. In addition, a previous study has reported that the white-matter volume of the left IFOF to decrease in the longitudinal investigation of chronic fatigue syndrome patients (Shan et al., 2016). Another major white-matter tract with altered measures is the SLF, that connects the occipital, parietal, and temporal regions to the frontal lobe (Siehl et al., 2018). Veterans with a history of TBI and/or PTSD have reduced FA and increased diffusivity measures in the SLF (Schuff et al., 2011; Fani et al., 2012; Isaac et al., 2015), which may suggest a possible link to the emotionally traumatic experience (Siehl et al., 2018). In addition, it might contribute to the perturbation of brain networks implicated in fatigue following TBI and/or PTSD, including the early detection, processing, and emotional response to different cues embedded in the environment (Siehl et al., 2018). In addition, the altered white-matter alterations of the SLF have been linked with fatigue symptoms in a previous study of veterans with Gulf War Illness (Rayhan et al., 2013).

The internal capsule is another important white-matter tract with significant alterations observed in those with fatigue within TBI+PTSD and PTSD when compared to those without fatigue. The internal capsule is critically involved within the basal ganglia circuitry as it runs from the thalamus to the frontal lobe, caudate, and corpus striatum. Internal capsule alterations have been linked to deficits in central nervous system arousal and regulation, as well as execution of complex cognitive tasks (Dobryakova et al., 2013; Clark et al., 2017). A previous study has showed white-matter integrity of the anterior internal capsule to decrease in association with the cognitive fatigue symptoms following TBI (Clark et al., 2017). Another study using functional MRI reported that fatigue was associated with impaired fronto-striatal activity in the TBI group (Kohl et al., 2009), suggesting that the decreased neural efficiency and white-matter integrity may underpin the behaviorally manifested fatigue in the trauma survivors. Delano-Wood and colleagues showed that FA in the brainstem white matter tracts, including corticospinal tract, pontine tegmentum, and the medial lemniscus and central tegmental tract, negatively correlated with increased post-concussive symptoms including fatigue (Delano-Wood et al., 2015).

The present study has several notable limitations to report. The first limitation relates to the lack of the objective measure of the level of fatigue. In addition, although there are 153 participants in total, these participants are subdivided into 8 groups, leaving the sample size in some of the groups to be 11, especially in the groups without fatigue reported. In addition, other confounding factors including number of blast exposures, number of penetrating and non-penetrating TBI incidents, time interval from index head injury to scan time, number of time participants had neurosurgical intervention, substance abuse, smoking status, and the variability, duration and severity of symptoms should be acknowledged as they might contribute to the present findings as we could not address due to limitations in the data captured. Despite being able to observe differences in our analyses, by adding more confounding variables, the observed differences might not survive the significant thresholds after multiple comparisons correction due to the limited sample size. Therefore, future studies with larger sample size with more comprehensive data collection and employing objective measures of fatigue will be required to disentangle and quantitate the relationship between fatigue and white matter changes in similar cohorts. Finally, all participants were males, making it difficult to generalise the findings across gender. Future studies would benefit from addressing these limitations.

In conclusion, this study act as a preliminary investigation of the effect of chronic fatigue on white-matter microstructural changes many decades following moderate-to-severe TBI and/or PTSD in Vietnam War veterans. The results indicate FA to be helpful in discriminating the effect of fatigue in TBI and/or PTSD, while the diffusion measures might indicate ongoing demyelinating and neuroinflammatory processes. Finally, the white matter alterations were more significant in the TBI+PTSD and less in the PTSD subgroups with fatigue. This may suggest the severity of white matter alterations might be associated with more severe fatigue, with future studies required to support these findings.

Participants were classified based on their clinical history as described in “VAELG.csv” by the DOD-ADNI administration into control veterans (CN), traumatic brain injury (TBI), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and TBI survivors with PTSD (TBI+PTSD). In addition, the participants were further classified based on their subjective response to the question “Do you often feel tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime?”, with yes (F+) or No (F-). The TBI participants had a documented history of moderate-to-severe TBI related to their earlier military services based on the VA/DoD criteria for TBI with a loss of consciousness ≥ 24 hours, post-traumatic amentia &gt; 24 hours, or alteration of consciousness ≥ 24 hours.

Highlights:

Compared to controls, Fatigue was significant in TBI+PTSD and PTSD but not in TBI.

Compared to non-fatigued, no white-matter changes in the fatigued control or TBI groups.

Compared to non-fatigued, fatigued PTSD had higher RD and AD, but no FA difference.

Fatigued TBI+PTSD had lower FA and higher diffusivity compared to non-fatigued group.
