Background:

Semantic dementia (SD) is characterized by progressive semantic anomia extending to a multimodal loss of semantic knowledge. Although often considered an early-onset dementia, SD also occurs in later life, when it may be misdiagnosed as Alzheimer disease (AD).

Objective:

To evaluate late-onset SD in comparison to early-onset SD and to AD.

Methods:

We identified 74 individuals with SD and then compared those with late-onset SD (≥ 65 years of age) to those with early-onset SD (&lt; 65) on demographic and clinical features. We also compared a subgroup of 23 of the late-onset SD individuals with an equal number of individuals with clinically probable AD.

Results:

Twenty-six (35.1%) of the SD individuals were late onset, and 48 (64.9%) were early onset. There were no differences between the two groups on clinical measures, although greater asymmetry of temporal involvement trended to significance in the late-onset SD group. Compared to the 23 AD individuals, the subgroup of 23 late-onset SD individuals had worse performance on confrontational naming, irregular word reading, and face recognition; however, this subgroup displayed better verbal delayed recall and constructions. The late-onset SD individuals also experienced early personality changes at a time when most individuals with AD had not yet developed behavioral changes.

Conclusions:

Approximately one-third of SD individuals may be late onset, and the differentiation of late-onset SD from AD can lead to better disease management, education, and prognosis. SD may be distinguished by screening for disproportionate changes in reading, face recognition, and personality.

Semantic dementia (SD) is a relatively rare neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a loss of semantics (ie, the meaning of words and objects) (Hodges et al, 2010; Kertesz et al, 2010). SD accounts for approximately one-fourth of individuals with a frontotemporal dementia syndrome (Johnson et al, 2005), which is characterized by clinical onset in the presenium (&lt; 65 years). SD is almost entirely sporadic, with a mean duration of approximately 10 years, and individuals with SD have focal atrophy involving the inferolateral anterior temporal lobes (ATLs). The neuropathological hallmark of SD is the presence of “Type C” transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 neuronal inclusions that are ubiquitin positive and tau negative (Spinelli et al, 2017).

SD is equivalent to advanced semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) (Gorno-Tempini et al, 2011), reflecting the usual presentation with predominant anomia. The criteria for a diagnosis of svPPA include the presence of semantic anomia (word-finding difficulty without improvement with phonemic or category cuing) and impaired single-word comprehension, as well as at least three of the following: impaired object knowledge (including faces), impaired irregular word reading (surface dyslexia), intact repetition, and intact speech production (Gorno-Tempini et al, 2011; Knibb and Hodges, 2005).

SD is svPPA combined with a diagnosis of dementia. The semantic impairment in individuals with svPPA eventually progresses beyond language to involve a multimodal, or amodal, impairment in the knowledge of objects, faces, and persons (Caixeta et al, 2011; Hodges et al, 2010; Snowden et al, 2001). SD is also associated with prominent personality changes—in particular, a tendency for bizarre food choices or fads, rigidity or compulsivity, and other behaviors (such as disinhibition)—which may reflect involvement of the right anterior temporal and adjacent orbitofrontal cortices (Kumfor et al, 2016; Landin-Romero et al, 2016).

Like most individuals with a frontotemporal dementia syndrome, individuals with SD most commonly experience an early onset of the disease (ie, &lt; 65 years); however, one study in the literature suggests that up to 46% of individuals with SD can present after age 65 (Hodges et al, 2010). Because both SD and Alzheimer disease (AD) can present with an insidious onset of memory complaints and word-finding difficulty (Botha and Josephs, 2019), clinicians may commonly misdiagnose late-onset SD as AD, which is the most prevalent neurodegenerative dementia that occurs in later life (Kertesz et al, 2010; McKhann et al, 2011). However, it is important for clinicians to distinguish between these two dementias correctly because they differ in their management and clinical course as well as in the education that is provided to individuals with the disease and their families.

Recognizing the distinctive clinical features of late-onset SD can help in making a correct diagnosis. We anticipate that a careful clinical analysis of individuals with late-onset SD will show a less pronounced profile of the same, singular clinical features of early-onset SD, which is distinguished from AD by impaired irregular word reading, worse face recognition, and earlier personality and behavioral changes. Accordingly, we investigated the clinical differences between individuals with late-onset SD and those with early-onset SD as well as a comparable group of individuals with AD.

METHODS

Participants

The individuals in our study presented for evaluation over a 17-year period to a university clinic (UCLA Neurobehavior Clinic) that is dedicated to the diagnosis and management of early-onset dementias. All of the individuals had experienced the insidious onset and progression of cognitive changes and had undergone a comprehensive neurobehavioral evaluation, laboratory assessment, and MRI; many had also had a fluorodeoxy-glucose PET of the brain.

A total of 74 individuals met the criteria for imaging-supported svPPA (Gorno-Tempini et al, 2011) as well as those for dementia, as evidenced from examination and caregiver reports of cognitive or behavioral difficulities beyond the language domain as well as impaired daily or occupational functioning (McKhann et al, 2011). with the 74 individuals also met the criteria for SD: The individuals had impaired confrontational naming accompanied by a loss of single-word comprehension or meaning without response to cuing, and without motor speech or repetition difficulties. The individuals also had predominant inferolateral anterior temporal atrophy on MRI reports or review, which was often corroborated by temporal hypometabolism on PET (when available).

Among the 74 individuals with SD, we identified those who had an age of onset of ≥ 65 years. We then compared this group to the remaining individuals, who had an age of onset of &lt; 65, on clinical variables. We next identified a subgroup of 23 individuals with well-characterized late-onset SD (with neuroimaging confirmation beyond a single outside report). This subgroup of 23 late-onset SD individuals was further compared with an equal number of individuals with AD with similar age and disease severity/stage (according to scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination [Folstein et al, 1975] at intake). All of the individuals with AD met the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association criteria for probable AD, including changes consistent with AD-compatible neurodegeneration on MRI or PET (McKhann et al, 2011).

The study protocol was approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board and was performed according to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. All participants provided informed written consent before enrolling in the study.

Assessment

For all participants (SD and AD), we abstracted from their medical records a number of demographic characteristics that had been obtained at their intake presentations, including ages of onset and presentation to the clinic, education level, and sex.

We also abstracted the study participants’ performance on cognitive tests measuring category fluency, confrontational naming, irregular word reading, verbal episodic (delayed recall) memory, visuospatial constructions, and face recognition. Information on the participants’ salient personality changes associated with SD was also abstracted.

On intake presentation, neurologists had administered the Mini-Mental State Examination and a neurobehavioral status exam (Daffner et al, 2015). The neurobehavioral status exam generally consisted of a verbal fluency test (eg, generating as many animal names as possible in a minute), a 20-item version of the Boston Naming Test (eg, confrontational naming of 20 objects presented as line drawings; Kaplan et al, 1983), a reading test (eg, reading aloud 8–10 words that included 4–5 irregular words), a memory test (eg, 10 -to15-minute delayed recall of 10 previously learned unrelated words), a construction test (eg, copying a 3-dimensional cube or “napkin holder” [Benson] figure), and a face recognition task (eg, naming or identifying by salient feature 8–24 pictures of famous faces).

Over the 17-year period that these individuals had been seen, the exact methods of assessment for reading, memory, constructions, and face recognition varied. Consequently, we analyzed these aspects of the neurobehavioral status exam simply as impaired versus unimpaired. For example, performance on an 8- to 10-word reading screen that included 4–5 irregular words (eg, yacht, colonel, pint, bouquet, mortgage) was classified as impaired if two or more words were read phonetically (“regularization errors”). Performance on a 10-item test for episodic memory (either the Consortium to Establish a Registry in Alzheimer’s Disease [Chandler et al, 2005] or our version of a 10-item auditory learning test) was classified as impaired if ≤ 70% of the items were remembered on delayed recall. Performance on visuospatial constructions (3-dimensional cube or the “Benson figure”) were classified as impaired if at least one of the following items was absent: perspective, parallel faces, correct number of surfaces, or internal lines. Performance on a famous faces recognition task (different 8-, 12-, or 24-item versions over the years of 2 × 2 computerized black and white blocked facial [cutoff at hairline] pictures composed of half political and half entertainment persons, equally divided between men and women) was classified as impaired if &lt; 50% of the faces were named or otherwise identified with a specific salient feature (eg, a prior president). These famous faces varied over the years to reflect contemporary familiarity. Using the caregiver questionnaire of the Neurobehavior Inventory (Kaufer et al 2000), we assessed the participants’ behavior for food behavior changes, rigid or compulsive personality features, and disinhibition or impulsivity. Responses on the Neurobehavior Inventory were considered as changes in behavior and were coded as present or absent. Variations in the neurobehavioral status examination that had been recorded in the medical records mitigated accurate assessment of a number of other cognitive and behavioral items, such as praxis and executive abilities.

Neuroimaging

The MRI scans of the individuals with SD had been clinically obtained on a range of different scanners using different techniques at different institutions, with some images unavailable for review. Clinical reports characterized the images as left-temporal, right-temporal, or bilateral involvement (which almost always was asymmetric to a degree). Individuals with only a single external MRI report that could not be verified further by personal review or repeat scan(s) were excluded from the AD comparison. Two neurologists (M.F.M. and O.Y.) reviewed the images independently from each other (although not blinded to the individuals with SD). The reviewers determined agreement with the clinical radiologist’s report, and any discrepancies were mediated by M.F.M and O.Y.

Statistical Analysis

We compared the demographic and basic characteristics of the dementia groups (late SD vs early SD and late SD vs AD) using the Student’s t test and Fisher’s exact test for contingency tables. Continuous variables included category fluency and confrontation naming (ie, 20-item version of the Boston Naming Test). Because other measures had involved different test versions over the years, reading, memory, constructions, face recognition, and behavior/personality changes were analyzed as categorical data with pathognomonic cutoffs. Cramer’s V was used to evaluate associations between the categorical variables. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (Version 23).

RESULTS

Out of the group of 74 individuals with SD, 26 (35.1%) had an age of onset ≥ 65 years (12 with onset ≥ 70 years). Beyond ages of onset and presentation, there were no significant differences between the early-onset and late-onset SD individuals on major demographic characteristics, including education and sex (despite more males [56%] with early onset and more females [61.5%] with late onset), or Mini-Mental State Examination score; nor did the two groups differ significantly on the cognitive and behavioral measures surveyed in this study (Table 1). On neuroimaging, however, there was a trend for the individuals with late-onset SD to have greater asymmetry on the MRI scans, with a larger percentage (30.8% vs 12.5%) with unilateral involvement (for the individuals with late-onset SD, six were predominant left and two were predominant right).

The group of 74 individuals with SD exhibited associations between the cognitive, behavioral, and neuroimaging characteristics listed in Table 1. Specifically, the presence of impaired face recognition was associated with impaired irregular word reading (Cramer’s V = 0.345, P = 0.001) and with rigid/compulsive behavior (Cramer’s V = 0.275, P = 0.025). Not unexpectedly, the three behavioral changes were significantly associated with each other (hyperphagia/food fads with rigid/compulsive behavior [Cramer’s V = 0.541, P &lt; 0.001], hyperphagia/food fads with disinhibited/impulsive behavior [Cramer’s V = 0.229, P = 0.003], and rigid/compulsive behavior with disinhibited/impulsive behavior [Cramer’s V = 0.367; P = 0.001]). The only significant association found between the neuroimaging characteristics was between impaired face recognition and bilateral temporal involvement (Cramer’s V = 0.314; P = 0.033).

In the comparison of the 23 individuals with late-onset SD with the 23 individuals with AD, we found no significant differences between the two groups on age of onset or presentation, education, sex, or Mini-Mental State Examination score; however, the two groups differed on all of the cognitive and behavioral measures except for category fluency (Table 2). The individuals with late-onset SD had worse performance on confrontational naming, irregular word reading, and face recognition than those with AD. In contrast, these same individuals were better than the individuals with AD on verbal episodic (delayed recall) memory and visuospatial constructions. Nevertheless, a major source of confusion with AD was the presence of difficulty with delayed recall in most (60.9%) of the individuals with late-onset SD. Finally, on intake evaluation, the behavior screen showed early personality changes among the individuals with SD at a time when most individuals with AD had not yet developed behavioral changes.

DISCUSSION

SD may begin in later life and may resemble the much more common AD, particularly because both disorders can present with word-finding difficulty, which affects the semantic aspects of words (Reilly et al, 2011; Sajjadi et al, 2012; Xie et al, 2010). In our study, the individuals with late-onset SD differed very little from those with early-onset SD, with the possible exception of a higher proportion of temporal lobe asymmetry (which did not reach statistical significance). In contrast, when compared to the individuals with AD, the individuals with late-onset SD had more prominent confrontational naming, irregular word reading, and face recognition difficulties; better verbal episodic (delayed recall) memory and visuospatial constructions; and more behavioral changes at the time of presentation. The assessment of these features can help clinicians distinguish between AD and SD in later life.

SD is a unique neurodegenerative syndrome that affects the semantic system in the ATLs, particularly Brodmann’s area 38 (Leyton et al, 2016). The inferolateral ATL functions as a convergence hub for integrating the sensory-motor features of words, objects, and even persons into multimodal representations of knowledge (Fletcher and Warren, 2011; Hoffman et al, 2014; Wang et al, 2017). In SD, the prominence of semantic anomia, particularly for concrete words (Cousins et al, 2016), originates from the more common involvement of the left ATL with associated white matter (uncinate and anterior inferior longitudinal fasciculi) and with functional connectivity abnormalities (Meijboom et al, 2017; Montembeault et al, 2019; Tu et al, 2016). The presence of difficulty with irregular word reading (ie, surface dyslexia), another more prominent language feature in SD versus AD, may arise because left ATL degeneration impairs the semantic processing of irregular word forms, and the amount of gray matter loss in this region correlates with the number of regularization errors (Joyal et al, 2017; Wilson et al, 2009).

SD occurs most commonly in the presenium, but it may occur late and be confused with AD (Hodges et al, 2010). As with other studies, our study indicated that, among the frontotemporal dementia syndromes such as behavioral variant and the progressive aphasias, SD is the most likely to occur in later life (Hodges et al, 2010; Landin-Romero et al, 2016). Because of this, clinicians need to consider SD in the differential diagnosis of dementia in the elderly, as well as the features that most distinguish it from AD.

Late-onset SD is surprisingly similar to early-onset SD, suggesting that age does not modify the clinical syndrome or that common age-associated neuropathological changes do not alter its presentation. However, there was a trend among our study participants toward greater asymmetry of temporal involvement in late-onset SD, which may reflect a slower bilateral spread and disease course, leading to a later age of symptom onset. Although not statistically significant, impaired category fluency, confrontational naming, irregular word reading, and face recognition, as well as behavioral changes, were present in a lower percentage of the individuals with late-onset SD compared with those with early-onset SD.

Despite the presence of better verbal episodic (delayed recall) memory among the individuals with SD compared to those with AD, the majority of the individuals with SD still had verbal episodic (delayed recall) memory difficulty. Studies comparing SD and AD have previously focused on differences in the semantic system (Laisney et al, 2011; Reilly et al, 2011; Rogers and Friedman, 2008; Sajjadi et al, 2012); however, the neuropathology of SD, like that of AD, involves the hippocampi, which may impair episodic memory (Bejanin et al, 2017b; La Joie et al, 2014; Viard et al, 2013). In fact, in our study, more than half of the individuals with late-onset SD exhibited impaired episodic memory. SD affects a more anterior portion of the hippocampus and its semantic network, unlike in AD, where the posterior hippocampus and its episodic memory network are more affected (Chapleau et al, 2016, 2019). Nevertheless, there may be an overlap of pathology between the two dementias, as well as possible contributions from semantic and perceptual deficits to episodic memory. The sparing of other regions and memory relays in individuals with SD versus AD may further lessen episodic memory loss in individuals with SD (Irish et al, 2016; Tan et al, 2014).

There were other cognitive differences between the individuals with late-onset SD and those with AD in our study. For instance, face recognition difficulties were more prevalent among the individuals with late-onset SD compared with those with AD, and these difficulties were associated with impaired irregular word reading, personality changes, and bilateral ATL involvement on clinical MRIs. Face recognition, like other aspects of person-specific knowledge, occurs when there is involvement of the right ATL, and this may be based on nonverbal semantic representations (Luzzi et al, 2017).

The right ATL (including the amygdala) also participates in emotional recognition (Hutchings et al, 2015; Kumfor et al, 2016), empathic concern (Hutchings et al, 2015; La Joie et al, 2014), affective theory of mind (Bejanin et al, 2017a; Irish et al, 2014; Michel et al, 2013), recognition of animacy (Mendez et al, 2010), and social information (Fletcher et al, 2015; Gola et al, 2015; Pobric et al, 2016). These aspects of SD can predispose individuals to personality and behavioral changes early in the course of the disease. Similar to prior comparisons (Van Langenhove et al, 2016), in our study, the individuals with SD showed more prominent behavioral disturbances than those with other primary progressive aphasias or AD. The individuals with SD had frequent dietary changes, such as increased sugar intake and rigid food fads (Ahmed et al, 2014). Other behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia-like behaviors, such as disinhibition, may emerge, possibly from associated involvement of the adjacent orbitofrontal cortex (Hutchings et al, 2015).

Neuroimaging can supplement the clinical examination and help distinguish individuals with late-onset SD from those with AD. On MRI, inferolateral ATL involvement in individuals with SD is distinguishable from the more prominent hippocampal and parietal lobe atrophy that is evident in individuals with AD (Gorno-Tempini et al, 2011). AD pathology on amyloid PET imaging may be absent in individuals with late-onset SD (Brown et al, 2016). A prior report with [11C]-Pittsburgh Compound B amyloid PET imaging included five individuals with late-onset SD who were PiB negative (Brown et al, 2016). Other studies, however, have reported amyloid-positive PET scans in individuals with late-onset SD (Lee et al, 2018), and amyloid imaging can be false positive in the elderly or reflect co-existent pathology (Santos-Santos et al, 2018). The more recent tau PET imaging in individuals with SD may also fail to distinguish between AD and SD, possibly due to positive scans from binding to monoamine oxidase B-positive astrocytes (Kobayashi et al, 2018). Finally, on an fMRI study (Montembeault et al, 2019), individuals with SD showed decreased functional connectivity along the ventral language pathway (sound-to-meaning) and increased functional connectivity along the dorsal language pathway (sound-to-articulation).

Study Limitations

There are several potential limitations to this study. First, this was a clinical retrospective review, albeit of well-characterized individuals in a subspecialty clinic. Second, the study lacked extensive neuropsychological testing of visual episodic memory and a number of other specific cognitive aspects. Nevertheless, our study had the advantage of similar, although not identical, evaluations of a large number of individuals with SD from the same clinical program over nearly 2 decades. The majority of these individuals had undergone an extensive intake neurobehavioral status exam and neurobehavior inventory. Over the years, there were changes in some of these measures, necessitating their analysis as categorical variables. Third, there was no pathological or disease-specific biomarker, particularly for excluding concomitant Alzheimer neuropathology. Nevertheless, whereas some individuals with late-onset SD may have had concomitant AD neuropathology, this may not be a common finding (Bergeron et al, 2018). Finally, the clinical MRI and PET scans were of different origins and were often unavailable for re-analysis in a formal method.

CONCLUSION

In this study, approximately one-third of the individuals with SD had onset ≥ 65 years, which may be mistaken for AD; therefore, it is important to know the differences between late-onset SD and AD. Along with better verbal episodic (delayed recall) memory and visuospatial constructions, more impaired language measures, including confrontational naming and irregular word reading, may distinguish these dementias on presentation. For distinguishing late-onset SD from AD, clinicians can also evaluate face recognition ability and behavioral changes, such as dietary behavior, rigidity/compulsivity, and disinhibition/impulsivity. More research on late-onset SD can offer further insights into its recognition and differentiation from AD and can clarify any differences in ATL asymmetry in individuals with late-onset versus early-onset SD.
