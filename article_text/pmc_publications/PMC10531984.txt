Semantic memory remains relatively stable with normal cognitive aging and declines in early stages of neurodegenerative disease. We measured electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory correlates of semantic memory retrieval to examine the effects of normal and pathological aging. Twenty-nine cognitively healthy young adults (YA), 22 cognitively healthy aging adults (HA), and 20 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) completed a semantic memory retrieval task with concurrent EEG recording in which they judged whether two words (features of objects) led to retrieval of an object (retrieval) or not (non-retrieval). Event-related power changes contrasting the two conditions (retrieval vs. non-retrieval) within theta, alpha, low-beta, and high-beta EEG frequency bands were examined for normal aging (YA versus HA) and pathological aging effects (HA versus MCI). With no behavioral differences between the two normal age groups, we found later theta and alpha event-related power differences between conditions only in YA, and a high-beta event-related power difference only in HA. For pathological aging effects, with reduced accuracy in MCI, we found different EEG patterns of early event-related beta power differences between conditions in MCI compared to HA and an event-related low-beta power difference only in HA. Beta oscillations were correlated with behavioral performance only in HA. We conclude that the aging brain relies on faster (beta) oscillations during the semantic memory task. With pathological aging, retrieval accuracy declines and patterns of beta oscillation changes. The findings provide insights about age-related neural mechanisms underlying semantic memory and have implications for early detection of pathological aging.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Semantic memory is relatively preserved with normal cognitive aging but declines in early stages of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (AD-RD) including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Salmon et al., 1999; Gainotti et al., 2014; Kraut et al., 2006, 2007; Gustavson et al., 2020). Although cognitively healthy older adults experience some challenges with word retrieval (e.g., recalling names) and engage additional neural resources compared to younger controls (Shafto et al., 2010; Baciu et al., 2016; Haitas et al., 2021), their semantic knowledge remains intact (Verhaegen &amp; Poncelet, 2013; Nicholas et al., 1985). In contrast, older adults with MCI and AD-RD have semantic memory deficits that may go beyond word retrieval issues and can involve degradation of semantic knowledge (Dudas et al., 2005; Joubert et al., 2021). With disease progression from MCI to AD-RD, there is more noticeable semantic memory deterioration (Pelgrim et al., 2021; Aschenbrenner et al., 2015; Almeida &amp; Radanovic, 2022). The majority of this research has been conducted using naming tasks (e.g., confrontational naming, verbal fluency, associations). One of the major challenges in understanding the nature of alterations in semantic memory in MCI and AD-RD relates to difficulty in determining whether deterioration is in word retrieval, accessing semantic memory, or semantic knowledge per se.

A semantic memory task that examines access to semantic knowledge without requiring overt word retrieval is thus ideal to investigate changes in semantic memory retrieval associated with normal versus pathological aging. Retrieval of semantic memory involves selection of a concept after inhibition of competing concepts and is mediated by cortico-caudate-thalamic circuit that is connected by direct neuroanatomical pathways as well as coordinated neurophysiological (oscillatory) activity (Hart et al., 2013; Crosson, 2021; Crosson et al., 2007). We designed the Semantic Object Retrieval Test (SORT), which examines how objects are retrieved via explicit evaluation of object-associated features that requires effortful search, and selection of concepts (Kraut et al. 2002; Assaf et al., 2006). In the SORT paradigm, the features (e.g., “humps” and “desert”) normally facilitate retrieval of an object (e.g., “camel”). While participants are not required to overtly recall the word (e.g., “camel”), they are asked to judge whether the features bring to mind a particular object by pushing the ‘yes’ or ‘no’ button on the response box. Our task is distinct from tasks involving semantic priming, contextual constraints, and semantic relatedness that assess unconscious and conscious associations between concepts without needing to retrieve a concept (Kiefer, 2001; Kutas &amp; Federmeier, 2000; Wlotko et al.,2010). Whereas in the SORT, participants are explicitly requested to judge whether the stimuli evoke retrieval of a specific object, which requires selecting the correct concept while inhibiting incorrect concepts, going beyond just relatedness judgment. Our previous work has shown that semantic memory retrieval dysfunction in SORT can behaviorally manifest as either a retrieval failure during the retrieval trials or a failure to suppress inappropriate object retrieval during the non-retrieval trials (Chiang et al., 2014, 2015; Kraut et al., 2006, 2007). Assaf et al. (2006) found increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal change in the cortico-caudate-thalamic circuit (including the pre-Supplementary Motor Area, left inferior frontal gyrus, caudate and thalamus) during SORT in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study but not during an association task suggesting that performing the task engages aspects of semantic retrieval beyond typical semantic associations.

Electroencephalogram (EEG), with its millisecond temporal resolution and direct measure of post-synaptic neuronal activity, is a useful tool to study neural dynamics associated with semantic memory (Chiang et al., 2016, 2020). Previously, on EEG-based semantic object memory retrieval test (SORT), we observed differences in event-related potentials (ERPs) between (1) cognitively normal younger and older adults, and (2) individuals with MCI and cognitively normal older controls. A frontal ERP between 800–1000 ms differentiated retrieval from non-retrieval trials in cognitively normal older adults but not in younger adults, which was posited to relate to a more extensive search during the non-retrieval trials with aging (Chiang et al., 2014). A similar fronto-parietal potential between 950–1050 ms differentiated retrieval from non-retrieval trials in individuals with MCI but not in cognitively normal age- and education-matched controls (Chiang et al., 2015), suggesting a differentiation between normal and pathological aging in semantic search. This fronto-parietal activity was also found to be correlated with episodic memory performance. Those with worse performance on the logical memory subtest (immediate and delayed recall) of Wechsler Memory Scale- Third Edition (Wechsler, 1997) had a delayed fronto-parietal ERP effect, supporting the value of this task in differentiating normal and pathological aging. Despite the utility of ERPs for examining the temporal unfolding of neural activity, non-phase-locked and time-locked activity is treated as noise during averaging of ERPs and thus information that could provide useful information about the underlying neurophysiological process is not included. The current study was motivated by the additional insights that time-frequency EEG analysis (Roach et al., 2008; Cavanagh &amp; Frank, 2014) may provide about semantic memory related to the SORT, and aimed at examining differences in neural dynamics that could inform how semantic memory functions differ from normal to pathological aging.

Prior EEG studies using time-frequency analysis have suggested functional roles of power changes in low and in high beta band EEG (12–20 and 20–30 Hz, respectively) with lexical-semantic retrieval (Bakker et al., 2015; Bastiaansen and Hagoort, 2006; Slotnick et al., 2002; Lewis &amp; Bastiaansen, 2015; Weiss &amp; Mueller, 2012), while theta (4–8 Hz) and alpha (8–12 Hz) EEG oscillations have been linked to word or sentence processing (Bakker et al., 2015; Bastiaansen and Hagoort, 2006; Li &amp; Yang, 2013; Shahin et al., 2009; Chiang et al., 2016). Also, the lower frequency bands (theta, alpha) are thought to be associated with domain-general processes such as cognitive control and attentional demands during semantic processing (Cavanagh &amp; Frank, 2014; Klimesch, 2012). How these different frequency bands specifically relate to semantic memory processing is still under investigation; therefore, the current study examined oscillatory dynamics in all three frequency bands (theta, alpha, high/low beta) during the SORT.

The current literature on EEG oscillations related to semantic memory mostly involves studies on young adults. There are a few EEG studies examining time-frequency responses directly elicited by semantic tasks in normal aging or pathological aging (e.g., MCI) (Markiewicz et al., 2021; Poulisse et al., 2020; Packard et al., 2020; Mazaheri et al., 2018), and none have compared such effects across normal and pathological aging. Since there is not sufficient literature to guide an adequately-informed a priori hypothesis to focus on specific frequency bands or time frames, we used a data-driven approach based on permutation tests to examine neural oscillations on the SORT task.

Our goals were to examine (1) normal aging effects by comparing younger to cognitively normal older adults and (2) pathological aging effects by comparing cognitively normal older adults to individuals with MCI. Our general hypothesis was that normal aging adults would demonstrate differences in EEG event-related oscillatory power changes during SORT, compared to younger adults, with no evident differences in behavioral performance measured by accuracy and reaction time. These event-related power changes reflecting neural (de)synchronization might be associated with variability in accuracy or reaction time due to age, suggesting age-related neural (de)compensation during semantic memory retrieval. In contrast, we expected that older adults with MCI, compared to their age- and education-matched cognitively normal controls, would demonstrate reduction in retrieval accuracy as previously reported (Kraut et al., 2007), as well as altered EEG oscillatory event-related power changes, suggesting decline at both behavioral and neural levels.

METHODS

Participants

The study included three groups of participants including younger adults [YA] (Total N = 29, 11 males, mean age of 21.3 ± 2.5 years, mean education of 14.2 ±1.2 years), cognitively healthy older adults [HA] (total N = 22, 5 males, mean age of 63.9 ± 6.4 years, mean education of 17 ± 1.6 years), and individuals with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment [MCI] (total N = 20, 10 males, mean age of 67.8 ± 8.2 years, mean education of 16 ± 2.4 years; Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5). All participants were native English speakers with no history of learning disabilities, stroke, major psychiatric illness, alcoholism or substance abuse, or uncorrected hearing or vision loss. All MCI participants met Petersen criteria (Petersen et al., 2009), by consensus diagnosis among clinicians or research investigators, including the following: (1) cognitive concerns reported by the patient and/or corroborated by a reliable informant, (2) cognitive impairments verified by objective measures, (3) relative independence in performing daily functions, and (4) did not meet dementia criteria. Both amnestic (N = 16) and non-amnestic (N = 4) MCI patients were included. The HA and MCI groups had no statistical differences in age and education. Based on Fisher’s exact test, no sex difference between YA and HA (2-sided p = 0.362) or between HA and MCI (2-sided p = 0.107) was found. Therefore, we did not consider sex as a contributing factor in our subsequent analyses. Performance on selected neuropsychological tests for HA and MCI is presented in Table 1. These neuropsychological tests were selected to measure aspects of cognitive functions including global cognition (including MMSE and MoCA), language (BNT, COWAT, animal fluency), episodic memory (logical memory), executive functions (TMT-B), and attention (digit span) to confirm group assignment, which was agreed upon by clinicians and researchers during consensus meetings. We had unequal number of subjects in each group because these participants were recruited through multiple studies, but all underwent the same EEG tasks. Younger adults were mostly undergraduate students from the University of Texas at Dallas, who received credits for their participation. Older adults received monetary compensation for research participation (up to $100 US dollars for all visits) and were recruited from the community in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan area or referred by the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards of The University of Texas at Dallas and The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Experiments with participants were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Committee on Human Experimentation of these institutions and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.

EEG task and procedures

All participants completed the SORT task which has been described in prior publications (Chiang et al., 2014, 2015). SORT consists of word pairs presented simultaneously representing two conditions: retrieval condition and non-retrieval condition. The retrieval condition includes 56 word pairs which facilitate retrieval of a particular object from memory (e.g., the pair ‘humps’ and ‘desert’ facilitate retrieval of the concept ‘camel’). The non-retrieval condition contains 56 word pairs which come from the same set of words, but which are randomly paired and thus do not lead to memory retrieval of any object (e.g., ‘humps’ and ‘monitor’ do not facilitate retrieval of a specific item). Retrieval and non-retrieval word pairs were randomly sequenced to create two different versions of the task, which were randomly assigned and counterbalanced across participants. Word pairs appeared simultaneously on the screen with one word above the other for a total of three seconds. A fixation target (+) was presented at the center of the screen for three seconds between each word pair. Participants were asked to decide if each pair led to object retrieval by pushing either a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ button on a response pad using their right index and middle finger, respectively. The experimental paradigm is schematically demonstrated in Figure 1.

Participants received the following instructions prior to the EEG task: “You are going to see two words. These represent features that are related to objects. Push the button under your index finger if the two words combine to bring to mind some particular object. If the two words do not combine to bring to mind a particular object, push the button under your middle finger.” Participants were encouraged to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. Response time (RT) and accuracy were recorded for each trial. Responses recorded outside the window of 300–3000 ms were labeled as incorrect. The entire task took approximately 11 minutes. The stimuli were presented on an LCD screen using Stim software (Compumedics Neuroscan, USA) and placed about 46 inches from the participant. The two words in each pair spanned approximately 5° of both vertical and horizontal visual angles, with the horizontal measure varying slightly by word length. All the words were presented against a white background in black, lower-case, Times New Roman font (size 72).

EEG data acquisition and preprocessing

EEG was continuously recorded from a 64-electrode EEG cap (Neuroscan Quikcap) via a Neuroscan SynAmps2 amplifier using Scan 4.5 software (Compumedics Neuroscan, USA; sampling rate: 1 kHz, DC-200 Hz) while subjects performed the SORT task. The reference electrode was placed between Cz and CPz at the midline. A bipolar vertical electrooculogram (VEOG) was recorded for the left eye. EEG data from electrodes with impedance exceeding 10–20 kΩ were discarded from further processing and most impedances were less than 5–10 kΩ. Poorly functioning electrodes were excluded manually by visual inspection of the raw data. Data from fewer than 5% of electrodes were rejected; the number of rejected electrodes did not differ significantly across groups (YA vs HA, t(49) = 0.15, p = 0.881; HA vs MCI, t(40) = 0.44, p = 0.663). An algorithm computing the average based on spherical splines fitted to the data was then applied to interpolate EEG data to the sites of the bad electrodes identified (Ferree et al., 2009).

The continuous EEG data were high-pass filtered at 1 Hz and subsequently low-pass filtered at 40 Hz using a finite impulse response filter. Independent component analysis (ICA) was then applied to the filtered continuous EEG data to identify artifacts (muscle, eye, and heart) using the EEGLAB toolbox (Delorme and Makeig, 2004) running under MATLAB 2021 (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Components with &gt;70% probability of representing an artifact were automatically removed (ICLabel, Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019). Subsequently, ICA components of each individual’s data were visually examined and artifacts not identified previously by the algorithm were removed manually to complete data cleaning. After this step, EEG data were segmented for retrieval and non-retrieval conditions into multiple EEG epochs (−1000 to 3000 ms, time-locked to the stimulus onset). Epochs having a peak amplitude of ±75 μV between −500ms and 2000 ms post stimulus onset (highly associated with artifacts) were rejected and epochs with extreme values (based on standard deviation &gt; 5) were excluded by rejection algorithms in EEGLAB using joint probability and kurtosis of activity. The average (accepted trials / all correct trials) epochs retained for retrieval and non-retrieval conditions respectively were 88.3 ± 5.8 % (42.3 ± 4.1 trials) and 89 ± 6.6 % (42.7 ± 5.2 trials) in the YA group, 91 ± 5.3 %(44.7 ± 4.2 trials) and 91.9 ± 4.1 % (44.8 ± 4.4 trials) in the HA group, and 88.6 ± 5.8% (39.3 ± 4 trials) and 88.3 7.5 ±% (40.3 ± 7.6 trials) in the MCI group.

EEG Time-Frequency analysis

EEG epochs underwent spectral decomposition using Morlet wavelets to extract power data for frequencies from 4 to 30 Hz (with approximately 1 Hz intervals). Three cycles were set for the lowest frequency and cycles increased linearly with frequency scaled at 0.5 using EEGLAB newtimef() function (‘cycles’, [3 0.5]; Delorme and Makeig, 2004). Temporal resolution was around 36–37 ms per time frame. Baseline correction within each 1 Hz frequency interval was performed for each single trial by subtracting the average power between −600 and −100 ms pre-stimulus onset from each time point post-stimulus onset to calculate event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) using the gain model (Grandchamp and Delorme, 2011). The power data were then logarithmically converted to decibel (dB) for further statistical analysis. Increase in power relative to baseline represents event-related synchronization (ERS), while lower power relative to baseline represents event-related desynchronization (ERD).

Statistical Analysis

For SORT performance, we utilized repeated measures general linear models (GLM; IBM SPSS Statistics 28.0) with group as a between-subject factor (two group comparisons: YA vs HA, or HA vs MCI) and conditions as a within subject factor (retrieval vs non-retrieval). RT and accuracy data were analyzed separately. Post-hoc comparisons were adjusted with Bonferroni correction. Significant results were reported when p &lt; 0.05.

EEG data were analyzed for theta (4– 8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), low beta (12–20 Hz), and high beta (20–30 Hz) frequency bands with mean values calculated from each frequency range, based on canonical classification from prior EEG studies (Weiss &amp; Mueller, 2012; Poulisse et al., 2020; Markiewicz et al., 2021). In order to examine differences in individual alpha frequency (IAF), given different age groups, we performed peak frequency extraction within the frequency range 7–14 Hz from epochs between −750 to 2500 ms to stimulus onset, for each individual across conditions (Klimesch, 1999). We ran a repeated measures GLM and did not find any significant effects (no effects of group, condition, or group by condition interaction), thus ruling out that individual alpha differences affected our analysis, and supporting the use of the standard window.

Permutation tests (N = 2000) were performed to compare group data, for difference between retrieval and non-retrieval conditions, based on two-tailed independent t-tests. These tests were performed to assess (1) normal aging effects by comparing YA to HA groups and (2) pathological aging effects by comparing HA to MCI groups, for all electrodes (N = 62) and all windows (N = 26) spanning from 188 to 1105 ms post stimulus onset. We chose this time window given that prior studies have shown effects within this time window on the SORT task (Chiang et al., 2014, 2015, 2016, 2020). A False Discovery Rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05 from permutation tests was considered significant, which is a robust statistical approach commonly adopted in functional imaging studies to avoid excessive false negative results, so further corrections for multiple comparisons were not applied. Additionally, we tested conditional effects (retrieval vs non-retrieval conditions) within each group separately, based on permutation tests (N = 2000) using two-tailed paired-t tests, thresholded at FDR &lt; 0.05. These results are presented in the supplementary materials since condition effects are not related to our primary research questions.

Post hoc analysis was performed based on the mean event-related power scores extracted within the time window at the electrodes showing significant results, using 2-tailed paired-t tests to compare conditions (retrieval vs non-retrievals). Significant results were reported if p &lt; 0.05.

We also examined the correlation between behavioral measures and the EEG/ERSP effects of interest (i.e., those significant effects that showed differences between groups and conditions) in each condition (retrieval and non-retrieval conditions), separately for normal and pathological aging effects. The analyses were performed after both behavioral data (RT, accuracy) and ERSP data (at focused frequency bands, time window, and electrode) were transformed into Z scores separately for each group. Generalized linear modeling (IBM SPSS Statistics 28.0) was used to include Group (as a fixed effect), Z-transformed ERSP data (as a covariate), and an interaction term between Group and ERSP data. Significant results were reported only if the interaction was significant at p &lt; 0.05, given that this was the effect of interest that demonstrated group differences in correlations. When an interaction effect was significant, a two-tailed Kendall’s tau b correlation coefficients was used to examine magnitude and direction of the correlation separately for each group.

RESULTS

Normal aging effects (YA vs HA comparison)

Behavioral results.

For RT (measured in ms), main effect of condition was significant, F(1,49) = 78.418, p &lt; .001, with participants taking longer to respond to non-retrieval (mean RT = 1562, SD = 345) compared to retrieval (mean RT = 1296, SD = 235) conditions. Main effect of group was not significant, F(1,49) = 3.798, p = .057. No significant interaction between condition and group was found, F(1,49) = .126, p = .724. For accuracy, main effect of condition was significant, F(1,49) = 4.657, p = .036, with participants performing better on non-retrieval (mean accuracy = 88 %, SD = 9.1 %) compared to retrieval (mean accuracy = 84.7 %, SD = 6.9 %) conditions. Main effect of group was not significant, F(1,49) = 0.761, p = 0.387. No significant interaction between condition and group was found, F(1,49) = 0.196, p = 0.66. Group averaged RT and accuracy scores for each condition are listed in Table 2 and plotted in Figure 2.

EEG results.

The differences in ERSPs between conditions within each group (YA, HA) were first tested for each frequency band (Figures 3–6). YA showed extensive effects in alpha (starting around 518–591 ms post-stimulus onset, ERS larger in non-retrieval than retrieval trials, Figures 4 &amp; 7) and low beta (starting around 701–738 ms post-stimulus onset, ERS larger in non-retrieval than retrieval trials, Figures 5 &amp; 7), compared to HA that showed effects in a smaller time window only in low beta (around 848–885 ms post-stimulus onset near left anterior electrodes, ERS larger in non-retrieval than retrieval trials, Figures 5 &amp; 7). For theta and high beta, neither of the two groups showed significant results (Figures 3, 6 &amp; 7). Permutation tests on differential ERSP effects (difference between retrieval and non-retrieval conditions) between YA and HA showed three different effects (FDR &lt; 0.05). First, there was greater theta ERS near the left/midline parietal electrode (P1) from 628 to 701 ms post-stimulus onset in non-retrieval compared to retrieval conditions in YA, t(28) = 3.841, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.06 (retrieval: 1.96 ± 1.49 dB, non-retrieval: 2.72 ±1.48 dB), but not in HA, t(21) = 1.772, p = 0.091 (retrieval: 2.25 ± 1.75 dB, non-retrieval: 1.76 ± 2.3 dB) (Figure 8). Second, there was greater alpha ERD near the left centro-parietal electrode (CP3) from 555–591 ms post-stimulus onset in retrieval compared to non-retrieval conditions in YA, t(28) = 3.744, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.17 (retrieval: −0.32 ± 1.81 dB, non-retrieval: 0.5 ± 2.13 dB), but not in HA, t(21) = 0.889, p = 0.384 (retrieval: 0.14 ± 3.05 dB, non-retrieval: −0.09 ± 3 dB) (Figure 9). Third, there was greater high beta ERS near the right parietal electrode (P8) from 444–481 ms post-stimulus onset in non-retrieval compared to retrieval in HA, t(21) = 2.32, p = 0.03, Cohen’s d = 0.85 (retrieval: 0.11 ± 1.1 dB, non-retrieval: 0.53 ±0.77 dB), but not in YA, t(28) = 1.305, p = 0.202 (retrieval: 0.82 ± 0.69 dB, non-retrieval: 0.63 ± 0.76 dB) (Figure 10). There were no significant ERSP effects shown in low beta frequency bands comparing YA to HA (Supplementary Figure 4). Results from all time frames (including windows with non-significant effects) for normal aging effects (YA versus HA) can be found in Supplementary Figure 4.

Correlation between behavioral and ERSP measures.

A significant correlation was observed between high beta ERSP (at P8, between 444 and 481 ms post-stimulus onset) and accuracy on non-retrieval trial in HA, R = −0.494, p = 0.002, but not in YA, R = −0.233, p = 0.088 [significant interaction of this correlation between groups, F(1,47) = 4.199, p = 0.046]. In particular, greater ERS in high beta was correlated with lower accuracy during non-retrieval trial in HA (Figure 13–1, Table 3). We did not find such interaction effects across groups (all p &gt; 0.1) between high beta ERSP and RT during non-retrieval conditions, or between theta/alpha ERSP and any behavioral measures (RT or accuracy (Table 3).

Pathological aging effects (HA vs MCI group comparison)

Behavioral results.

For RT (measured in ms), main effect of condition was significant, F(1,40) = 58.107, p &lt; .001, with participants taking longer to respond to non-retrieval (mean RT = 1704, SD = 346) compared to retrieval (mean RT = 1439, SD = 257) conditions. Main effect of group was not significant, F(1,40) = 1.988, p = 0.166. No significant interaction between condition and group was found, F(1,40) = 0.146, p = 0.688. For accuracy, main effect of condition was significant, F(1,40) = 4.684, p = .036, with participants performing better on non-retrieval (mean accuracy = 86 %, SD = 11.9 %) compared to retrieval (mean accuracy = 82.2 %, SD = 8.3 %) conditions. Main effect of group was also significant, F(1,40) = 7.401, p = 0.01, with HA more accurate (mean accuracy = 87.24 %, SD = 7.5 %) than MCI (mean accuracy = 80.7 %, SD = 12 %). This group difference was maintained even after one apparent outlier (31% accuracy in Non-retrieval trials) was excluded from the MCI group, F(1,39) = 6.64, p = 0.014. No significant interaction between condition and group was found, F(1,40) = 0.598, p = 0.444. Group averaged RT and accuracy scores for each condition are listed in Table 2 and plotted in Figure 1.

EEG results.

The differences in ERSPs between conditions within each group (HA, MCI) were first tested for each frequency band (Figures 3–6). MCI showed effects in low beta (starting around 738 ms post-stimulus onset near the left frontal and right parietal electrodes, ERS larger in non-retrieval than retrieval trials, Figures 5 &amp; 7), while HA also showed effects in low beta within a shorter time window (around 848–885 ms post-stimulus onset near left anterior electrodes, ERS larger in non-retrieval than retrieval trials, Figures 5 &amp; 7). For theta, alpha and high beta, neither of the two groups showed significant results that appeared to be meaningful (Figures 3, 4 &amp; 6). Permutation tests on differential ERSP effects (difference between retrieval and non-retrieval conditions) between HA and MCI showed two different effects. First, greater low beta ERS near the right frontal electrode (F2) from 444–481 ms post-stimulus onset was observed in retrieval compared to non-retrieval conditions for HA, t(21) = 3.136, p = 0.005, Cohen’s d = 1.01 (retrieval: 0.56 ± 1.51 dB, non-retrieval: −0.11 ± 1.34 dB), but not in MCI, t(19) = 1.292, p = 0.212 (retrieval: 0.24 ± 1.28 dB, non-retrieval: 0.65 ± 1.74 dB) (Figure 11). In addition, greater high beta ERS in the left fronto-temporal electrode (FT7) during 224–261 ms post-stimulus onset was observed in non-retrieval compared to retrieval conditions in MCI, t(19) = 2.173, p = 0.043, Cohen’s d = 0.83 (retrieval: 0.58 ± 0.58 dB, non-retrieval: 0.99 ± 0.93 dB), with a reverse pattern noted in HA, t(21) = 2.097, p = 0.048, Cohen’s d = 0.87 (retrieval: 1.03 ± 0.71 dB, non-retrieval: −0.65 ± 0.55 dB) (Figure 12). There were no significant ERSP effects shown in the theta and alpha frequency bands comparing HA to MCI (Supplementary Figure 5). Results from all time frames (including windows with non-significant effects) for pathological aging effects (HA versus MCI) can be found in Supplementary Figure 5.

Correlation between behavioral and ERSP measures.

A significant correlation was observed between low beta (at F2, between 444 and 481 ms post-stimulus onset) and RT during retrieval trials in HA, R = 0.411, p = 0.007, but not in MCI, R = 0.032, p = 0.846 [significant interaction of this correlation between groups, F(1,38) = 4.273, p = 0.046]. In particular, greater ERS in low beta was correlated with slower RT on retrieval trial in HA (Figure 13–2, Table 3). We did not find such effects (all p &gt; 0.1) between event-related low beta power and accuracy during retrieval conditions, or between event-related high beta power and any behavioral measures (RT or accuracy) (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

By utilizing a semantic memory paradigm that did not require explicit word retrieval, we were able to identify different patterns of EEG oscillations between normal aging versus pathological aging. When comparing YA and HA groups, no significant behavioral differences were seen but three within-group condition effects were identified on EEG measures: differences in (1) theta ERS and (2) alpha ERD between conditions were observed in YA but not in HA after 500 ms post-stimulus onset, and (3) a difference in high beta ERS between conditions in the HA group but not in YA group during 400–500 ms post-stimulus onset. Larger high beta ERS was associated with poorer accuracy during non-retrieval trials only in HA but not in YA. When individuals with MCI were compared to HA, they had reduced accuracy than HA across conditions accompanied by two EEG effects: (1) a difference in low beta ERS between conditions was observed in the HA group but not in the MCI group during 400–500 ms post-stimulus onset. Larger low beta ERS correlated with more prolonged reaction time during retrieval trials only in HA but not in MCI, and (2) a difference in high beta ERS between conditions, divergent in pattern, was noted between MCI and HA between 224–261 ms post-stimulus onset.

Our behavioral data showed preserved accuracy and RT in the HA group compared to the YA group consistent with findings from our prior studies and the literature supporting relatively preserved access to semantic memory with normal aging, (Chiang et al., 2014; Verhaegen &amp; Poncelet, 2013; Rönnlund et al., 2015). However, differences between YA and HA groups observed on EEG suggest early age-related changes emerge between conditions during 400 and 500 ms post-stimulus onset. The HA group showed differences in high beta between retrieval and non-retrieval conditions relative to the YA group. High beta has been associated with retrieval of semantic information (Slotnick et al., 2002; Ferree et al., 2009; Hart et al., 2013; Lewis &amp; Bastiaansen, 2015; Weiss &amp; Mueller, 2012). Differences across conditions observed in the HA group suggest recruitment of additional neural resources, mediated by high beta activity, to support varying demands related to semantic processing between the two conditions. In contrast to HA, the YA group showed differences across conditions after 500 ms post-stimulus onset in theta ERS and alpha ERD. In particular, consistent with our prior findings within similar time windows (Chiang et al., 2016; Ferree et al., 2009; Hart et al., 2013), YA demonstrated increased alpha ERD during retrieval compared to non-retrieval conditions, which might be linked to semantic integration of features which lead to object memory activation. In the subsequent time window (628 to 701 ms post-stimulus onset), YA had higher theta ERS during non-retrieval compared to retrieval conditions, which might be related to enhanced search for potential feature integration prior to making a final judgment (Yes/No response on button push). In HA (as well as in MCI), the lack of differentiation in theta and alpha across conditions (Figures 3 &amp; 4) suggests age-related neurophysiological alterations. It is plausible that with age, with or without a diagnosis of MCI, there is less neural differentiation across retrieval and non-retrieval trials compared to YA, and comparable neural resources (theta ERS and alpha ERD) are being used to facilitate retrieving and inhibiting object concepts during semantic memory processing (Cavanagh &amp; Frank, 2014; Klimesch, 2012). This finding is consistent with the literature that suggests dedifferentiation and reduced segregation in neural activity in healthy aging (Koen &amp; Rugg, 2019; Martin et al., 2022). However, these reduced neural differentiations in HA at later time frames do not seem to be sufficient to impact task performance. We speculate that the earlier high beta differential effects observed in HA between 400–500 ms represent a compensatory neural alteration that supports semantic memory retrieval. This is corroborated by a correlation between greater high beta ERS and poorer accuracy during non-retrieval trials.

Our task was able to differentiate the HA group from individuals with MCI on behavioral task performance as well as EEG measures. Consistent with our hypothesis, lower accuracy was noted in the MCI group compared to the healthy older adult group, suggesting impaired semantic memory performance, which has been reported in our prior studies and the literature (Chiang et al., 2015; Kraut et al., 2007; Dudas et al., 2005; Joubert et al., 2021). We also found greater low beta ERS in retrieval compared to non-retrieval conditions in the HA group but not in the MCI group in earlier time windows (&lt; 500 ms post stimulus onset). This earlier low beta ERS was greater in those who had slower reaction time during retrieval only in HA, but not in MCI. These findings suggest that while the HA group differentially allocates neural resources to select the correct concepts during retrieval trials, mediated by increased event-related low beta oscillation as a possible compensatory mechanism, these differentiations are lost in the MCI group and do not account for behavioral changes anymore. Interestingly, within the first 300 ms post-stimulus onset, both groups showed differences in high beta ERS across conditions, albeit different patterns. While the HA group had higher high beta ERS in retrieval compared to non-retrieval conditions, an opposite direction was observed in the MCI group with non-retrieval greater than retrieval conditions. It is unclear what this reverse pattern indicates, but these findings suggest that HA and MCI groups may use different strategies to retrieve or process semantic information during the task. Nevertheless, the MCI group shows patterns of neural oscillations that can be differentiated from the HA group on the SORT task and these alterations may be indicative of early neural (de)compensation, as suggested in this and in prior studies using different semantic memory paradigms (Woodard et al., 2009; Barbeau et al., 2012; Pistono et al., 2021).

Overall, with age, there is a shift in differentiation across conditions (retrieval vs non-retrieval) from slower frequencies (alpha, theta) to faster frequencies (low and high beta) on the SORT paradigm. The transition from slower to faster brain oscillatory responses may be a sign of aging in general. While both normal and pathological aging effects were specifically identified in high beta ERS, the YA and HA groups differed in the time frame of 444–481 ms post stimulus onset, which is later than the time frame of 224–261 ms which differentiates the HA and MCI groups. It is possible that increased high beta ERS to non-retrieval trials in the earlier time window (224–261 ms) is a sign of pathological aging in MCI, while increased high beta to retrieval trials in the later time window (444–481 ms) reflects normal aging in the older adults. In contrast, low beta differences between retrieval and non-retrieval trials are present much later in all groups (later than 500 ms post-stimulus onset; Figure 5), suggesting previously proposed retrieval mechanism is still prevalent when object memory is successfully retrieved across all age groups (Slotnick et al., 2002; Hart et al., 2013). Given the evidence that integration of semantic memory was thought to be associated with high beta frequency (25–30 Hz) activity from both the cortex and thalamus during the SORT task (Slotnick et al., 2002; Hart et al., 2013), it may be that differential changes in cortico-thalamo-cortical synchronization (Crosson, 2021) underlie the changes we found in high beta frequency in normal versus pathological aging, though during an earlier time frame. It has been shown that changes in thalamic function and cortico-thalamo-cortical connectivity can occur in normal aging (Goldstone et al., 2018; Fama &amp; Sullivan, 2015) as well as in MCI (Hahn et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2013; Aggleton et al., 2016). Future work that combines EEG and MRI techniques would be useful to explore these possibilities.

Behavioral measures of semantic memory (e.g., semantic/category fluency) have already shown promising predictive value in risk of progression to MCI and dementia (Sutin et al., 2019; Gustavson et al., 2020). EEG markers of semantic memory will provide additional insights given that neural changes may precede behavioral changes in pathological aging (Olichney et al., 2002; Jack et al., 2013). Although we posit that similar patterns of changes in oscillatory activity from normal to pathological aging should also be observed using other types of semantic memory retrieval tasks, generalization of the current study findings needs to be examined.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, our findings implicate a shift in neural dynamics from young to older adults with and without cognitive impairment on semantic memory retrieval assessed with SORT. Changes in alpha, theta and beta oscillations may indicate an age-related versus disease-related reorganization of global and local semantic neural networks that encompass multiple brain regions in the ventral and dorsal systems as well as the cortico-caudate-thalamus circuit, with potential critical roles of the pre-SMA and LIFG as hubs in these networks as previously shown in fMRI studies using SORT (Assaf et al., 2006, 2009). The loss of differentiation in later alpha and theta oscillations (later than 500 ms) between retrieval and non-retrieval conditions, as observed in the older groups, could represent increased demand in selecting (e.g., facilitating and inhibiting) concepts during memory retrieval. On the other hand, the enhanced differences in earlier beta oscillations (earlier than 500 ms) between retrieval and non-retrieval conditions, correlated with behavioral performance as observed only in the cognitively healthy older adults, suggest additional neural recruitment for facilitating relevant concepts and inhibiting irrelevant concepts to support successful semantic memory retrieval in normal aging. Those with MCI did not show this early beta compensatory activity suggesting further degradation of semantic networks underlying these beta oscillations due to disease processes. Future studies are needed to better localize these oscillatory changes within these semantic networks due to normal and pathological aging. Biochemical mechanisms of these oscillatory changes remain unclear, although it has been proposed that cholinergic and glutamatergic systems disrupted by the AD pathology could contribute to semantic memory deficits in MCI (Almeida &amp; Radanovic, 2022).

An important implication of our study is that these brain oscillatory responses can potentially be used as outcome measures to assess efficacy of interventions (e.g., cognitive training, pharmacological treatment) in order to gain a mechanistic understanding. Furthermore, with the advent of non-invasive brain stimulation methods (Meiron and Lavidor, 2013, 2014), these oscillatory brain responses may serve as targets to modulate prefrontal executive networks associated with allowing access to semantic memory (Hart et al., 2013; Assaf et al., 2006, 2009) as well as semantic/language networks (Price, 2012) directly by electrical stimulation to stabilize compensatory processes or to delay the impact of progressive pathological processes, and thus to maintain or even improve cognitive function in aging populations with or without cognitive impairment (Grover et al., 2022). Given the importance and growing recognition of intervening the neurodegenerative processes present at early stages such as MCI, this would provide potentially useful diagnostic and prognostic early disease biomarkers. We recognize that our data examine group level differences, and that future work is necessary to examine how these markers can be utilized at the individual level to differentiate normal versus pathological aging. Also, longitudinal studies would be warranted in the future to understand if changes in these brain oscillatory responses can predict disease progression. To our knowledge, our study is the first to directly examine both normal and pathological aging effects to demonstrate EEG oscillatory changes during semantic memory retrieval.

Figure 1: SORT experimental design

Two represented trials (one retrieval and on non-retrieval trial) are demonstrated in this schematic diagram. Each word pair is presented for 3 seconds, followed by a fixation point presented for 3 seconds in between trials. One is asked to respond upon seeing the word pair by pressing either one of the two buttons to indicate if the word pair bring to mind any particular object (right index finger: yes; right middle finger: no). In this case, “humps” and “desert” would lead to retrieval of “camel” (retrieval trial), while “humps” and “rail” would not lead to an object concept (non-retrieval trial).
