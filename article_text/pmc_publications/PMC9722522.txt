Hypoxic-ischemic injury has been linked with increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The underlying mechanism of this association is poorly understood. Here, we report distinct roles for hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (Hif-1α) in the regulation of BACE1 and γ-secretase activity, two proteases involved in the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ). We have demonstrated that Hif-1α upregulates both BACE1 and γ-secretase activity for Aβ production in brain hypoxia-induced either by cerebral hypoperfusion or breathing 10% O2. Hif-1α binds to γ-secretase, which elevates the amount of active γ-secretase complex without affecting the level of individual subunits in hypoxic-ischemic mouse brains. Additionally, the expression of full length Hif-1α increases BACE1 and γ-secretase activity in primary neuronal culture, whereas a transcriptionally incompetent Hif-1α variant only activates γ-secretase. These findings indicate that Hif-1α transcriptionally upregulates BACE1 and nontranscriptionally activates γ-secretase for Aβ production in hypoxic-ischemic conditions. Consequently, Hif-1α-mediated Aβ production may be an adaptive response to hypoxic-ischemic injury, subsequently leading to increased risk for AD. Preventing the interaction of Hif-1α with γ-secretase may therefore be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.


pmcINTRODUCTION

Increasing evidence indicates that cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases are risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1-4]. However, how these diseases contribute to the pathogenesis of AD is not well understood. Reduction in O2 supply (hypoxia) to the brain is a potential mechanism through which these diseases contribute to AD. The effect of hypoxia on amyloid-β (Aβ), one of the key causes of AD, has been an active area of research.

Aβ is generated by sequential cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) via β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. It has been reported that hypoxia accelerates the deposition of amyloid plaques by upregulating BACE1 gene expression in AD transgenic mouse models [5, 6]. However, it is unknown how γ-secretase is regulated by hypoxia in vivo. γ-Secretase is a macromolecular complex that contains four essential subunits— anterior pharynx-defective 1 (Aph1), nicastrin (NCT), presenilin enhancer 2 (Pen-2), and its catalytic core presenilin (PS) [7]. The APH1a gene promoter contains a Hif-1α response element (HRE) binding site and chemically induced hypoxia has been shown to upregulate γ-secretase activity in cells through an increase in Aph1a gene expression [8, 9]. Recently, we found that hypoxia upregulates γ-secretase activity for Notch signaling through a direct interaction with Hif-1α in breast cancer cells, revealing an unconventional function for Hif-1α as an enzyme subunit, which is distinct from its canonical role as a transcription factor [10]. In addition, it has been reported that γ-secretase can be modulated by γ-secretase modulatory proteins in a context dependent manner [11, 12]. Importantly, these protein differentially regulate γ-secretase activity for APP and Notch cleavages [12], such as IFITM3 [13], GSAP [14, 15] and Serp1 [16]. Thus far, the majority of studies dedicated to understanding the relationship between hypoxia and γ-secretase have been done in cellular models, making it critical to investigate in vivo, the mechanism of hypoxic regulation of γ-secretase for Aβ production. Ultimately, it is critical to gain insight into Aβ regulation in cerebrovascular insufficiency, and furthermore how hypoxia-ischemia may impact Aβ production and thus increased risk for AD.

In this study, we have demonstrated that both BACE1 and γ-secretase activity are upregulated in two mouse models of brain hypoxia: bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) and hypoxia. Further, Hif-1α transcriptionally upregulates BACE1 and non-transcriptionally activates γ-secretase for Aβ production. These findings show that Hif-1α augments Aβ production by activating BACE1 and γ-secretase through differential mechanisms. The pathophysiological response to hypoxia through BACE1 and γ-secretase/Aβ-production may increase the risk of developing AD and understanding these mechanistic differences may be critical for the development of effective therapeutics.

METHODS

Primary neuronal culture

Primary mouse cortical neurons using pregnant C57/bl6 mice at embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Cortices from embryos were collected and meninges were removed. Cortices were then washed with ice-cold HBSS before dissociation with 0.25% trypsin and 0.15 μg/mL DNase at 37 °C for 5 minutes. Dissociated tissue was triturated with 30 passages through a P1000 tip to fully dissociate cells and then resuspended with Neurobasal Media plus 10% FBS to inactivate trypsin. Cells were spun down at 500 x g for 5 minutes, supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was resuspended in Neurobasal Media plus 2% B27 supplement, L-glutamax, and 5 mM HEPES. Cells were filtered using a 40 μm strainer and then seeded on plates coated with PDL/PLL. Complete media was changed at 1 day in vitro (DIV) and half media was replaced every 2-3 days thereafter. For primary neurons transduction, lentiviral particles were added to neurons at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 on 3 DIV. Cells were incubated with lentivirus overnight before half media was replaced. All neurons were used at 14-16 DIV.

All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator unless otherwise stated as cultured under hypoxic conditions where primary mouse cortical neurons were cultured in 5% CO2/5% O2.

Cloning and lentivirus production

Lentiviral plasmid backbone pLV-EGFP-T2a was a generous donation by Corey Anderson from the Giovanni Manfredi Lab at Weill Cornell Medicine. Restriction free cloning was used to insert Hif-1α TM and Hif-1α C-term from pcDNA3.1 vectors previously created in the lab (Villa et al., 2014) into the pLV-EGFP-T2a backbone following the T2a linker. Amino acids 1-80, containing the DNA binding domain of Hif-1α was deleted using Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (NEB). All constructs were validated by Sanger Sequencing (Genewiz).

Lentiviral particles were produced in LentiX-293 cells (Takara) using a second-generation system following a standard protocol [17]. In brief, LentiX-293 cells were transfected with the pLV vector containing cDNA inserts, packaging vector pCMV- Δ8.91, and VSVG envelope vector pMD2.G using Lipofectamine 3000. After 6 h, media was completely changed to Neurobasal Media plus 2% B27 supplement, L-glutamax, and 5 mM HEPES. Culture media was collected 48 h later, and the resulting lentivirus was spun at 1000 x g to remove debris, filtered through a 0.45 μm PVDF filter, and frozen in aliquots at −80 °C until use.

Western Blot

Primary antibodies for Hif-1α (610958, BD Biosciences) and Aph-1a (38-3600, Invitrogen) were used at 1:500 (v/v) in 5% milk (TBST 0.1% Tween-20). These antibodies are not sensitive enough to be visualized by the Odyssey®, so standard ECL detection was used. PS1-NTF and NCT have been previously described [13]. PS1-CTF (5232, Chemicon), BACE1 (108394, AbCam), Anti-ADAM 10 (AB19026, Millipore), ADAM17 (EHS008, Kerafast) and tubulin (56676, AbCam) were used at 1:1000 (v/v) in Odyssey® blocking buffer. All primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies anti-rabbit/anti-mouse HRP (ECL) and anti-rabbit/anti-mouse IRDYE 800cw, anti-rabbit/anti-mouse IRDYE 680cw (Odysseys®) were used at 1:10000 for 1 h at room temperature.

Samples were incubated with 4xSB and run on 4–20% SDS PAGE gel. The gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane. Transfer was done at 7 min at 25 volts and 2.5 mAmp in a semi-dry Turbo Transfer system (Bio-Rad). Following transfer, membranes were blocked for 30 minutes at room temperature shaking in either 5% milk for ECL detection or in Odyssey blocking buffer. Primary antibodies were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After primary and secondary antibody incubation, membranes were washed three times in TBST 0.1% Tween. With ECL detection, standard methods for film detection were used. With Odyssey detection, blots were visualized using the Licor Odyssey western blot scan.

MesoScale Discovery

Primary neurons were seeded at 250,000 cells in a 24-well plate and at 14 DIV, one plate was moved into hypoxia and one plate stayed in normal oxygen overnight at 37 °C. Media supernatant was collected for both normoxia and hypoxia 24 h after cells were placed in hypoxia. The next day, the MesoScale plate (4G8) was blocked with diluent 35 for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the plate was washed 3 times in PBST (0.1% Tween), and the detection mix was added according to manufacturer’s protocol. A serial dilution of Aβ40 and 42 was plated as a standard, and in separate wells, cell media was added and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature shaking. The plate was then washed and read with read buffer. The concentration of Aβ in the cell media was calculated using a standard curve.

Compounds

All compounds JC-8, LZ-26, L-685,458 were synthesized in the laboratory [18-21] and dissolved with DMSO.

Animals

All animal work was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center— Protocol number 15-03-001.

Hypoxia

Adult C57/Bl6 male mice were used for this study. Mice were placed in a hypoxia chamber (Coy Laboratory) and exposed 10% O2 (balance N2) or room air (20% O2) for 24 h. We have previously shown that breathing 10% O2 reduced arterial pO2 by 56% [22]. After 24 h, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the brain was quickly removed and flash frozen.

Bilateral Common Carotid Artery Stenosis (BCAS)

Adult C57BL/6 male mice were used for this study. BCAS was done by members of our collaborator’s lab, Dr. Iadecola, Weill Cornell Brain and Mind Research Institute, as previously described [23, 24]. At 1, 2, and 4 weeks post-surgery, the animals were sacrificed with cervical dislocation, where the brain was quickly removed and flash frozen, or by transcardial perfusion, where mice were deeply anaesthetized with a single dose of ketamine/xylazine cocktail (Ketamine: 100 mg/kg, xylazine: 5 mg/mg) and transcardially perfused with 50 mL of PBS followed by 50 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were removed and post fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C. The brains were then washed with PBS, dehydrated with 30% sucrose for 48 hours, and cryopreserved using Tissue-Tek O.C.T. embedding compound (Sakura).

Membrane preparation

The membrane fraction of the mouse brains was prepared for use in all biochemical assays. The hemi-brain was thawed on ice and once it was 80% thawed, it was lysed with the TissueLyser II (Qiagen) using a 5 mm stainless steel bead in 1.3 mL cold buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM EGTA) plus protease inhibitors. After lysing for 2 min at 25 Hz, the samples were spun down at 1000 g for 10 min to pellet unbroken cells, which were discarded. Then, the supernatant was spun at 100,000 x g for 1 hour at 4 °C to pellet the membrane fraction. This fraction was resuspended in 0.2 mL of Buffer A with protease inhibitors, and aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use.

Activity-based photo-labeling

Cell lines were plated in a 6-well plate overnight at 200,000 cells/well. For mouse brain experiments, 100 μg of whole brain mouse membrane extract was used. JC-8 (10 nM) is added in PBS (pH 7.4), 0.25% CHAPSO, protease inhibitor cocktail, and DMSO/1uM L685-458. The reaction was incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C. Subsequently, covalent cross-linking of the activity probe benzophenone moiety to γ-secretase is facilitated by UV cross-linking at 350 nm for 30 minutes at room temperature [25, 13].

Non-covalent proteins were solubilized by RIPA (50 mM Tris, pH8.0, 150 nM NaCl, 0.1% v/v Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% wt/v deoxycholic acid) buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. Finally, streptavidin beads (Pierce) were added to capture bound complexes via the biotin moiety on the C-terminus of the probe and was rotated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then pelleted, washed, and eluted by boiling in 2x Laemmli sample buffer and loaded onto a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel followed by western blot visualization of PS1-NTF.

γ-secretase activity assay

In vitro GS activity assays were performed as previously described using Sb4 (APP) and NTM2 (Notch1) substrates [13, 26, 27]. In brief, primary cortical neurons were seeded at 250,000 cells/well and on DIV14, media was aspirated, and gently washed 1x with PBS. For assays using mouse brain membrane, 10ug of the membrane fraction was used as the source of GS. Cleavage assay consisted of PIPES (50 mM PIPES, pH 7, 150 mM KCl, 4 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM MgCl2), 0.25% CHAPSO, protease inhibitor cocktail, Sb4 (1uM), and 0.1% of DMSO or 1uM L685-458 (used for assay background correction). The cleavage assay was incubated for three hours at 37 °C. The cleaved Sb4 or NTM2 product was detected by ΑlphaLISA technology that consists of a neo-epitope specific antibody G2-10 for Aβ40, 10G-3 for Aβ42 and SM320 for Notch1.. The AlphaLISA readings are used to quantify activity and are expressed as arbitrary units (A.U.).

LZ-26 activity-based affinity capture

Solubilized brain membrane fractions were used for this capture [21, 28]. Solubilization buffer consisting of 1% CHAPSO, protease inhibitor cocktail, in PIPES (50 mM PIPES, pH 7, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 5mM MgCl2) was added for 1 h at 4 °C. Solubilized fraction was separated by centrifuge at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO and 800ug of membrane was pre-incubated with either DMSO or 5uM of L685-458 for specificity and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C. LZ-26 (50 nM) was then added for 1 h at 37 °C shaking. Streptavidin beads were added for overnight capture at 4 °C rotating. The next day, beads were spun down at 200 rpm for 3 min and washed 5 times with TBST (0.1% Tween-20). After the last wash, the supernatant was aspirated, and beads were eluted by incubating with elution buffer 2x Laemmli sample buffer in room temperature for 15 min. Samples were run on a 4–20% gradient gel and detected by western blot analysis.

Immunofluorescence staining

For immunofluorescence detection, cryoembedded brains were serially sectioned coronally at 30 μm using a Cryostat (Leica) and stored at −20 °C in tissue storage solution (30% sucrose, 30% ethylene glycol in 0.1 M phosphate buffer) until use. Brain sections were treated with 1% sodium borohydride two times, 10 min each time, and then washed thoroughly with PBS. Washed sections were stained with Alexa Fluor conjugated primary antibodies for Hif-1α 647 (1:50) (Cell Signaling, Cat #52496 S), NeuN 488 (1:50) (Cell Signaling, Cat #54761S), and GFAP 594 (1:50) (Cell Signaling, Cat #8152S) overnight at 4 °C. After staining, sections were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma Aldrich, D9542, 5ug/ml) for 10 minutes. Stained sections were mounted on charged slides and imaged with MIRAX SCAN (Zeiss) and immunofluorescence was visualized using CaseViewer. Quantification of immunofluorescence was performed using ImageJ.

RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR

Total RNA from primary neurons was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit according to manufacturer’s protocol. 1ug of RNA was reversed transcribed into cDNA using Superscript III 1st strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR analysis was performed with Taqman Gene expression assays (ThermoFisher). RNA samples were normalized to GAPDH (Hs02786624_g1) as the house-keeping gene. qRT-PCR was performed on the QuantStudio 5 System (ThermoFisher). Taqman probes were purchased and used: APP (Mm01344172_m1), BACE1 (Mm00478664_m1), PSEN1 (Mm00501184_m1), ADAM10 (Mm00545742_m1), ADAM17 (Mm00456428_m1). Relative quantification comparison between samples was made by the ΔΔCt method.

Statistical analysis

Appropriate statistical methods (two-sided Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey as indicated in Figure legend) were used for data analysis. p-values and significance: *p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001; ****p &lt;0.0001.

RESULTS

γ-Secretase activity is increased in mouse models of hypoxia-ischemia

To investigate γ-secretase regulation under cerebrovascular impairment, we took advantage of the BCAS mouse model, in which microcoils are placed around both common carotid arteries to restrict blood flow to the forebrain [23]. The BCAS model has been shown to reduce cerebral blood flow by 20–40% of baseline [29], leading to brain hypoxia in mice. Mouse brains from BCAS and sham mice were harvested at 1, 2 and 4 weeks after BCAS or sham surgery, and the Hif-1α protein was characterized. Our studies show a time-dependent increase in Hif-1α levels in BCAS brains, which was not detected in the sham controls (Fig. 1A), confirming that the BCAS mouse model results in cerebral hypoxia. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that BCAS animals had elevated Hif-1α levels compared to sham controls (Figs. 1B and 1C). Furthermore, we examined cell types that express Hif-1α, focusing on neurons and astrocytes, due to their contributory role in Aβ production [30, 31]. Histological staining shows similar levels of astrocytic Hif-1a in both sham and BCAS brains (Figs. 1B and 1C). On the other hand, Hif-1α is significantly higher in BCAS neurons, stained by NeuN, compared to sham controls (Figs. 1B and 1C) indicating that hypoperfusion-induced brain hypoxia leads to an accumulation of Hif-1α in neurons and not astrocytes (Fig. 1C).

Next, we determined γ-secretase protease activity for Aβ40 and Aβ42 cleavages with a recombinant protein substrate [15] using BCAS and sham brain tissue. γ-Secretase activity for Aβ40 and Aβ42 cleavages was increased at all three time points in the BCAS model; statistical significance was achieved only at 2- and 4-weeks post-surgery, with an approximate 2.5 fold increase in protease activity at these time-points (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, γ-secretase for Notch1 cleavage is augmented in BCAS mouse brains (2 week) compared with sham (Fig. 2B). We then examined the level of γ-secretase subunits, APP, and BACE1 at 4- weeks post-surgery (Fig. 2C). There were no changes in γ-secretase subunits (NCT, PS1-NTF, PS1-CTF and Aph1a) or in APP (Fig. 2C, sFig 1A). Noticeably, there was an increase in BACE protein levels with BCAS as compared to sham surgery animals (Fig. 2D).

While the protein level of γ-secretase subunits was the same in both the sham and BCAS brains, γ-secretase activity for Aβ production was increased in the ischemic brains (Fig. 2A). We then used an active-site directed probe, JC8, to assess the amount of active γ-secretase complex in membrane fractions at 4-weeks post-surgery [32, 33] (Fig. 2E). We found that BCAS increased the amount of active γ-secretase by 68%, compared to sham controls (Fig. 2E), suggesting that the elevation in γ-secretase activity resulted from the increased level of the active complex. Next, we investigated if Hif-1α associates with the γ-secretase active complex in the BCAS mice, leading to this increase in activity. To this end, LZ-26, a γ-secretase active site directed inhibitor, was used to capture the whole complex in non-denaturing conditions and analyzed for both PS1 and Hif-1α (Fig. 2F). We found that LZ26 specifically captured Hif-1α at four weeks post-surgery only in BCAS animals and not in sham animals (Fig. 2F).

We also examined the effect of ischemic hypoxia on ADAM-10, and ADAM-17, α-secretases involved in the processing of APP. The expression of both ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 (Figs. 3A and 3B) are the same in 2-week BCAS brains compared with sham brains. Next, we examined the pre- and mature forms of both enzymes (Fig. 3C-E). The mature forms represent the active proteases. Both forms of ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 are not changed in BCAS and sham samples (Fig. 3C-E). These results indicate that ischemic hypoxia does not affect the expression and activity of α-secretase.

Hypoperfusion-hypoxia in the BCAS model leads to many pathological changes [34]. To determine whether the upregulation of BACE1 and γ-secretase activities results from Hif-1α or other factors, we assessed the direct effect of low oxygen on BACE1 and γ-secretase activities in mice housed in a hypoxia chamber (10% O2). After 24 h, brains were harvested for biochemical analysis. We found that Hif-1α was detected in mice housed in hypoxic conditions (10% O2), but not in mice housed in normoxia (Fig. 4A). Moreover, γ-secretase activity was increased by 31% and 51% for Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively, in mice exposed to 10% O2 for 24 h. (Fig. 4B). In addition, the low O2 treatment did not alter the level of γ-secretase subunits but increased the level of BACE1 (Figs. 3C, 4D).

Collectively, these findings indicate that both BACE1 and γ-secretase processing of APP is increased in the BCAS and hypoxia mouse models. Moreover, our studies show that neuronal Hif-1α directly binds to γ-secretase complexes under ischemic conditions.

Hypoxia enhances γ-secretase activity in primary neurons

We next determined the effect of hypoxia on Aβ production in primary neurons. Primary cortical neurons were placed at 5% O2 at DIV 14, with controls placed in normoxic conditions. After 48 h, media was collected for Aβ quantification. The hypoxic primary neurons showed a 61% increase in secreted Aβ40 and a 57% increase in secreted Aβ42 compared to the normoxic neurons (Fig. 5A). In addition, secreted Aβ38 was evaluated (sFig 2A) under hypoxia. Furthermore, γ-secretase activity for Aβ40 and Aβ42 cleavages were elevated 1.28- and 1.29-fold, respectively, in the primary neurons exposed to hypoxic compared to normoxic conditions (Fig. 5B). These findings suggest that the hypoxic condition increases γ-secretase activity and promotes the production of Aβ in neurons.

Distinct roles of Hif-1α in the regulation of BACE1 and γ-secretase activities

How Hif-1α regulates γ-secretase in neurons remains to be investigated. In order to address this question, we have used three constructs for such studies (Fig. 5C): Hif-1α constructs containing mutations in the oxygen sensing residues (P402A, N803A, P564G) allowing for stability in normal oxygen conditions (Fig. 5C). (1) Hif-1α TM: Hif-1α full length with three mutations that is stable in normoxia, (2) Δ1-80 Hif-1α: the first eighty amino acids encompassing the DNA binding domain was deleted making it transcriptionally inactive, and stable in normoxia; (3) Hif-1α CTF: C-terminal Hif-1α fragment that is stable in normoxia. Hif-1α TM, Δ1-80 Hif-1α, Hif-1α CT, or EV containing a T2a linker with GFP were packaged into lentiviral particles and transduced into primary cortical neurons. Transduced neurons were maintained in normal oxygen conditions, which would degrade all endogenous Hif-1α. Expression of viral constructs of Hif-1α variants was confirmed by western blot (Fig. 5D). First, we measured Aβ in the culture media. We found that Aβ levels were increased in primary neurons expressing either Hif-1α TM or Δ1-80 Hif-1α, compared to neurons expressing EV or C-terminal Hif-1α (Fig. 5E), indicating that both transcriptional and non-transcriptional forms of Hif-1α are capable of promoting the production of Aβ40 and Aβ42. Next, we assayed γ-secretase activity using four neuronal cell membranes. Hif-1α TM and Δ1-80 Hif-1α caused a 2-fold increase in γ-secretase activity for Aβ40 and a 1.5-fold increase for Aβ42 compared to EV and C-terminal Hif-1α (Fig. 5F). The same profile of Hif-1α TM and Δ1-80 Hif-1α in the activation of γ-secretase suggests that Hif-1α activates γ-secretase through its non-transcriptional role. Finally, we examined the level of BACE1 in neuronal cells. and observed an increase in BACE1 protein in the Hif-1α TM (Fig. 5G, 5H). There was no change in BACE1 protein levels in neurons expressing Δ1-80 Hif-1α, despite there being an increase in Aβ. We observe a transcriptional upregulation of BACE1 by qPCR (Fig. 5I). There are no changes in mRNA expression between all groups for APP and PSEN1 but a 14% increase for BACE1 only in the Hif-1α TM expressing neurons (sFig 2). In summary, Hif-1α TM upregulates both BACE1 and γ-secretase activity in primary neuronal culture, whereas transcriptionally incompetent Δ1-80 Hif-1α only activates γ-secretase. These findings show that Hif-1α augments Aβ production by activating BACE1 and γ-secretase through differential mechanisms.

DISCUSSION

γ-Secretase cleaves multiple substrates that control many essential biological processes and disease development [35]. In addition to the four obligatory subunits, γ-secretase activity and specificity for APP and Notch1 substrates can be regulated by modulatory proteins [11, 12]. Both GSAP and SERP1 selectively regulates γ-secretase activity for Aβ production and has no effect on the Notch1 cleavage in biochemical and cellular assays [14-16]. However, IFITM3 has an opposing effect on γ-secretase for APP and Notch 1 cleavages [13]. Our previous work showed that Hif-1α non-transcriptionally increases γ-secretase activity for Notch1 cleavage in tumor cells [10]. This study has demonstrated that non-transcriptional Hif-1α augments γ-secretase activity for Aβ production in neuronal cells and in vivo, reporting that Hif-1α is a modulatory protein that increases γ-secretase activity for both APP and Notch cleavages. It is noteworthy to point out that the multitude roles of γ-secretase in AD and other diseases have often been overlooked, due to the fact that no change is seen at the mRNA or protein level despite changes in activity, highlighting the necessity to study the active complex and protease activity directly, which we have previously established in biochemical and cellular studies [10, 19, 36]. Our work has shown that Hif-1α enhances BACE1 and γ-secretase through two distinct mechanisms (Fig. 6): transcriptionally and non-transcriptionally, under hypoxia.

Mechanistically, this orchestrated regulation may reflect the constitution and nature of these two proteases. BACE1 is a single polypeptide protease with ~4-hour half-life and is activated by removal of the propeptide [37, 38]. In contrast, γ-secretase is a multiprotein complex that requires expression, stabilization, and trafficking and endoproteolysis to assemble into a functional unit [39]. Moreover, γ-secretase has a half-life of more than 24 h [40, 41] and the majority of the complex is catalytically inactive [36]. Conversion of the inactive complex to the active complex can occur quickly in response to environmental changes. Therefore, cells develop a protective system that allows Hif-1α to effectively activate both BACE1 and γ-secretase by different mechanisms, promoting adaptation to cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxia. It has been reported that half-life of Hif-1α in both cytoplasm and nucleus is 5–8 min in normoxia [42]. It is critical to investigate the stability of Hif-1α when it is engaged in the active γ-secretase complex and determine the time course of γ-secretase complex inactivation when cells are switched to normoxia. In addition to the promoter region of BACE1 containing a hypoxia-responsive element [5], hypoxia also modulates the phosphorylation of elF2α [43] and ETV4 [44] that contribute to increase gene expression of BACE1 and AD pathogenesis [45, 46]. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate how hypoxia regulates the expression of BACE1 through these mechanisms.

Some studies have shown that Aβ plays a physiological role in innate immunity, the recovery of brain injury, and synaptic function [47]. It has been reported that Aβ peptides transiently increase in response to brain injury and stroke [48, 49]. Moreover, some studies suggest that Aβ plays an important role in the recovery of brain injury. Aβ levels have been shown to positively correlate with improved neurological status in traumatic brain injury patients [48, 50]. In addition, BACE1 or APP knockout mice, after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, show higher mortality rates than WT mice [51]. Further, overexpression of APP in rats has shown to provide neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia [52]. Injection of Aβ40 to controlled cortical impact mice has shown some beneficial effect [53]. Additional studies are necessary to investigate the protective role of Aβ in brain injury and ischemic stroke. In addition, we have found that Hif-1α is accumulated in neurons, not astrocytes, in BCAS mouse brains, suggesting that the regulation of Hif-1α is cell specific and may play a different role. Indeed, it has been reported that Hif-1α in neurons and astrocytes has an opposite role in the protection of neuronal death [54].

Furthermore, while evidence indicates that initial Aβ production carries a protective function, aberrant overproduction of Aβ may ultimately become detrimental in the context of AD. Increasing evidence indicates that cerebrovascular disease and cardiovascular disease are risk factors of AD [2, 3, 55, 56]. The Hif-1α mediated hypoxic response is associated with cerebrovascular disease and cardiovascular disease [57]. Our work has demonstrated that both BACE1 and γ-secretase activity are upregulated under BCAS-induced cerebral hypoxia and hypoxia induced by breathing 10% O2. Ultimately, overproduction of Aβ combined with the inability to properly clear and degrade Aβ may lead to increased risk for AD.

This study offers a potential mechanism underlying the correlation between AD and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disorders. A multifactorial data-driven analysis of biomarkers and brain images has indicated that vascular deregulation may represent an earliest pathological event in the progress of LOAD based on [58]. It has been reported that cardiac arrest in patients led to an increase in blood Aβ peptides [59]. Moreover, AD is both clinically and molecularly heterogenous [60-64]. Recent multi-omics approaches to AD have revealed various networks, circuits, and molecular subtypes in AD patients [64-66], offering a molecular basis for therapeutic development. Whether the dual regulation of BACE1 and γ-secretase by Hif-1α represents one or more subtypes of LOAD remains to be investigated. Moreover, this work may prove critical for therapeutic intervention, as preventing the binding of Hif-1α to γ-secretase allows for the sole inhibition of γ-secretase activity in conditions of hypoxia, specifically decreasing Aβ production in a context-dependent manner.

Fig. 6 Dual roles of Hif-1α activate γ-secretase and increase BACE1 through distinct mechanisms.

Cerebrovascular or cardiovascular diseases cause hypoxia and an accumulation Hif-1α in neurons, enhancing BACE1 and γ-secretase through transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms, respectively. Hif-1α-mediated Aβ production acts as an adaptive response to hypoxic-ischemic injury for neuronal protection and this potentially beneficial effect of Aβ may become detrimental in the setting of AD.
