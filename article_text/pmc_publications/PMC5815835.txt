This research was motivated by a clinical trial design for a cognitive study. The pilot study was a matched-pairs design where some data are missing, specifically the missing data coming at the end of the study. Existing approaches to determine sample size are all based on asymptotic approaches (e.g., the GEE approach). When the sample size in a clinical trial is small to medium, these asymptotic approaches may not be appropriate for use due to the unsatisfactory type I and II error rates. For this reason, we consider the exact unconditional approach to compute the sample size for a matched-pairs study with incomplete data. Recommendations are made for each possible missing pattern by comparing the exact sample sizes based on three commonly used test statistics, with the existing sample size calculation based on the GEE approach. An example from a real surgeon-reviewers study is used to illustrate the application of the exact sample size calculation in study designs.

1 Introduction

The Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) initiated a Prevention Instrument (PI) project to investigate the cognitive and functional change for elderly adults over 4 years (Cummings et al., 1994, 2006; Banks &amp; Weintraub, 2009; Banks et al., 2014; Bernick &amp; Banks, 2013; Ferris et al., 2006). This is a longitudinal study with a total of 644 cognitively healthy elderly participants who were initially enrolled. These participants were randomized to receive experimental instruments either at home within 2 weeks of their clinic visit or during the clinic visit. In the end, 417 participants completed the study. The missing rate at the end of the study is calculated to be (644 − 417)/644 = 35%, and this missing data is the result of participants lost to follow up. In this ADCS-PI project, six domains were assessed: cognition, behavior, activities of daily living, global change, pharmacoeconomics, and quality of life (Banks et al., 2014). The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a five-point scale that is often used to quantify the severity of dementia symptoms in the cognition domain: 0=normal, 0.5=very mild dementia, 1=mild dementia, 2=moderate dementia, and 3=severe dementia (Cummings et al., 1994; Banks et al., 2014). The CDR value of zero is used as the threshold to classify the participants as either normal or abnormal at baseline and at the end of the ADCS-PI project. This study has 417 complete samples and 227 incomplete samples with measurements at baseline only.

A general study of the aforementioned dementia example would be a matched-pairs study with incomplete data at baseline or at the end of the study. Matched-pairs studies are often important and popularly adopted in clinical research due to a lack of large numbers of potential participants. This design allows for more confidence in results by removing much of the variation between the two groups, allowing for meaningful clinical studies with smaller participant pools (Xu et al., 2011; Maust et al., 2014). In many cases the outcome measure may be binary, such as mild cognitive impairment vs. dementia, or obese vs. non-obese, institutionalization vs. mortality. Being able to account for missing data points in such studies is important in understanding the disease, especially in rare diseases.

Choi and Stablein (1982) were among the first to identify this practical problem and investigated seven test statistics with regards to type I error control based on simulation studies. These tests include the commonly used McNemar test (McNemar, 1947) by using complete pairs only, the likelihood ratio test, and the test based on the unbiased estimators for the marginal proportions. Tang and Tang (2004) introduced the exact unconditional approach for statistical inference based on the two test statistics recommended by Choi and Stablein (1982) when the sample size is relatively small (no more than 40 in total), for data with missing completely at random. Later, Lin et al. (2009) proposed a new p-value calculation from a Bayesian perspective for a matched-pairs study with missing data.

Recently, Zhang, Cao, and Ahn (2015) developed a new closed-form sample size formula based on the GEE approach for a matched-pairs study with incomplete data. Their simulation studies showed that the nominal power level is controlled well, but the type I error rate could be inflated or conservative in some cases. To overcome the unsatisfactory performance of the error rate control, we propose using the exact unconditional approach based on maximization for sample size determination. Under the unconditional framework, the tail probability is a function of two nuisance parameters for this data, and the p-value is computed as the worst case scenario over the two-dimensional parameter space. We use an improved version of the centroid algorithm by Benke and Skinner (1991) to search for the p-value. Three different test statistics are used in conjunction with the exact unconditional approach for the sample size calculation. We make our recommendations after extensive numerical studies.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the problem in a general case that allows missing data either at baseline or at the end of the study, we then review the existing sample size calculation based on the GEE approach. After that, we present the detailed sample size calculation by using the exact unconditional approach based on three different test statistics. In Section 3, first we numerically compare the sample sizes by using the exact approach and the GEE approach, we then use a real example from a surgeon-reviewer study to illustrate the application of these approaches. In Section 4, we provide some remarks for comparing two paired proportions with missing data.

2 Methods

In a matched-pairs study (e.g., a study in which each participant is measured at baseline and at the end of the study (Type 1 study), or each participant is assessed by two experts (Type 2 study)), the data can be expressed as (Xi1, Xi2) for the i-th participant in the study. In practice, it is possible that some participants miss one of the two measurements (Xi1 or Xi2 could be missing), and others have complete data. We use the Type 1 study to introduce the problem. Suppose N, B, and A are the the numbers of subjects with complete samples (Xi1, Xi2), incomplete samples at baseline only (Xi1,.), and incomplete samples at the end of the study only (., Xi2), respectively. Then the total number of subjects is M = N + A + B. For a study with binary outcomes, let S be the outcome from the study with S = 1 for a positive result and S = 0 for a negative result, see Table 1 for the data structure.

Let p0 = n1+/N and p1 = n+1/N be the probability of S = 1 at baseline and at the end of the study, respectively. In such studies, it is often assumed that the probability of the response rate is consistent between the complete samples and incomplete samples: p0=b1B, and p1=a1A. We are interested in testing the following hypotheses H0:p0=p1againstHa:p0≠p1.

Zhang et al. (2015) used the GEE approach to compute the sample size when comparing two paired proportions with incomplete data. To attain the pre-specified power 1−β at the significance level of α, the closed-form sample size formula for a given design parameter (p0, p1, ρ, q0, q1) is presented as (1) MGEE=[q0p0(1−p0)+q1p1(1−p1)−2(q0+q1−1)ρp0(1−p0)p1(1−p1)](z1−α/2+z1−β)2q0q1p0(1−p0)p1(1−p1)[log(p11−p1/p01−p0)]2,

where ρ is the correlation coefficient with a range from −1 to 1, and q0 and q1 are the proportions of subjects who complete their measurements at baseline and at the end, respectively. In the neurological study analyzed by Choi and Stablein (1982), the missing rate is between 5% and 20%. In the recent work by Zhang et al. (2015) to compute the sample size for a colorectal cancer prevention outreach program, a 20% missing rate is assumed for before or after the intervention. The total missing rate is 40% in their study as assumed. In the aformentioned ADCS study, the missing rate is around 35% (Banks et al., 2014). When (q0, q1) = (1, 1), this is a complete study without any missing data, and this missing pattern is considered for reference in our later numerical studies.

The sample size calculation by using the GEE approach in Equation (1) is based on the limitation distribution of the standardized test statistic, which is the GEE parameter estimate divided by its associated asymptotic standard error. This sample size calculation performs well when M goes to +∞. When the required sample size for a study is from small to medium, the sample size calculation based on the GEE approach may not be accurate. In other words, the calculated sample size, MGEE, could be over- or under-estimated. When MGEE is under-estimated, a study could fail due to insufficient participants. When it is over-estimated, a longer time for a project is needed in order to address the research questions from the project, and the cost of the project is increased accordingly. For these reasons, we develop a new exact sample size calculation for comparing two paired proportions with incomplete data. The incomplete data is often due to technique issues, such as administration problems (Tang &amp; Tang, 2004), not related to the disease status. For this reason, the missing mechanism is assumed to be missing completely at random in this article.

Exact unconditional approach is often used in conjunction with an existing test statistic to order the sample space to determine the rejection region. Among the two test statistics recommended by Choi and Stablein (1982), under the exact unconditional framework (Tang &amp; Tang, 2004), the test statistic Tc in Equation (2) is more powerful than the other when N is relatively larger than B and A which is often the case in practice. This test statistic is expressed as, (2) Tc=(B+A)Ab1−Ba1(b1+a1)(B+A−b1−a1)(B+A)BA+2Nn10−n01n10+n01(B+A)2+(2N)2.

The test statistic Tc combines the test statistics for comparing the proportions when only the complete pairs are used or only the incomplete samples are used. Under the null hypothesis, Tc asymptotically follows the standard normal distribution (Choi &amp; Stablein, 1982). If the asymptotic distribution under the alternative with p0 ≠ p1 can be found, then the sample size can be determined from these two asymptotic distributions. We do not find the alternative asymptotic distribution in existing literature. In addition, sample size calculation based on asymptotic distributions may not be reliable due to unsatisfactory type I and II error control, especially when the sample size is not that large.

For this reason, we consider the exact unconditional approach based on maximization to compute sample size for comparing two paired proportions with missing data. In this unconditional framework, all possible sample points are enumerated, given the subtotal sample sizes (N, B, and A), and the complete sample space is presented as Ω={(n10,n01,b1,a1):0≤n10≤N,0≤n01≤(N−n10),0≤b1≤B,0≤a1≤A}.

It should be noted that the test statistic Tc does not depend on n11 and n00 values. In other words, when two samples have the same value of (n10, n01, b1, a1), they should have the same test statistic. Since this is a two-sided problem, Tc2 is used to order the sample space Ω. The null hypothesis is rejected for a large Tc2 value.

Let X = (n10, n01, b1, a1) be a sample from Ω and x be the observed data from a study. The tail area is defined as Ω(x)={x:Tc2(x)≥Tc2(x)}.

Under the null hypothesis with p0 = p1 = p, the exact p-value is calculated as PExact(x)=max0≤π11≤p≤1∑x∈Ω(x)N!n01!n10!n11!(N−n01−n10−n11)!(p−π11)n01+n10π11n11(1−2p+π11)(N−n01−n10−n11)×B!b1!(B−b1)!A!a1!(A−a1)!pb1+a1(1−p)B+A−a1−b1,

where π11 = P (Xi1 = 1, Xi1 = 1). This exact p-value is computed by maximizing the tail probability over the two nuisance parameters π11 and p, with a range of 0 ≤ π11 ≤ p ≤ 1. In order to search for the global maximum of the tail probability over the two nuisance parameters, the search algorithm proposed by Benke and Skinner (1991) is utilized to find the global maximum. This is an iterative algorithm that averages random perturbations in estimating the nuisance parameters. Specifically, we use this efficient search algorithm with 200 iterations. We calculate the results from the first 100 iterations and the remaining 100 iterations. If they have the same results, the maximum is considered as the global maximum. Otherwise, an additional 100 iterations will be conducted to confirm the global maximum.

To search for the required sample size to attain the pre-specified power (e.g., 1 − β = 80%) at the significance level of α = 0.05 by using the exact approach, we start with a relatively small sample size whose power is below 1 − β. We found that 75% of the sample size formula in Equation (1) given by Zhang et al. (2015), is often small enough with power being lower than 1 − β for the cases studied in this article. In the case that power is still over 1 − β, one can further reduce the sample size until the power at that sample size is lower than 1 − β. Suppose the initial sample size is M0. The sample sizes for complete and incomplete samples are B=[M0(1−q1)],A=[M0(1−q0)],andN=M0−B−A,

where [e] is the largest integer that is less than or equal to e. To compute the power of a study with the sample size M0, the tail set at the significant level of α should be calculated first. The tail set is defined as the largest set of Ω(x) such that the type I error is guaranteed PExact(x)≤α.

Once the tail set is obtained, the power of the study under the alternative with p0 ≠ p1 is calculated as ∑x∈Ω(x)N!n01!n10!n11!(N−n01−n10−n11)!(p1−π11)n01(p0−π11)n10π11n11(1−p0−p1+π11)(N−n01−n10−n11)×B!b1!(B−b1)!p0b1(1−p0)B−b1A!a1!(A−a1)!p1a1(1−p1)A−a1,

where π11=ρp0(1−p0)p1(1−p1)+p0p1 is calculated from the correlation coefficient of a bivariate distribution (Choi &amp; Stablein, 1982). If the power is less than 1 − β, the total sample size is then increased by 1, and the tail set and the power are calculated again under the new sample size M0 + 1. This procedure is continued until the power is over 1 − β. The total sample size from the last iteration is the required sample size to attain 1 − β power based on the exact approach.

It should be noted that the test statistic, Tc, in Equation (2), can be used to test the data with q0 &lt; 1 and q1 &lt; 1. When q0 = 1 and q1 = 1, this is a study with complete pairs without any missing data, the McNemar test statistic (McNemar, 1947), TMC=(n10−n01)2n10+n01,

can be used to compute the exact sample size. Recently, Shan and Zhang (2016) compared the exact sample sizes with the existing asymptotic sample size calculations by Borkhoff, Johnston, Stephens, and Atenafu (2015) based on the asymptotic unconditional McNemar approach, and the GEE approach by using a Wald test statistic (GEE-W) (Pan, 2001). They found that the exact unconditional approach often needs less participants as compared to the GEE-W approach. This research is an important practical extension of their work on exact sample size calculation for complete data to data with incomplete samples when two paired proportions are compared.

In the case with the missing patterns of (q0 &lt; 1, q1 = 1) or (q0 = 1, q1 &lt; 1), for simplicity, the McNemar test statistic can be used to order the sample space for p-value and power calculations. In this article, we are interested in a study with the missing pattern of (q0 = 1, q1 &lt; 1) instead of (q0 &lt; 1, q1 = 1) for two reasons: we expect the results from the second missing pattern to be similar to the first missing pattern q0 = 1 and q1 &lt; 1; it is very rare for a study to have missing data at baseline but complete data at the end. For a study with the missing pattern of (q0 = 1, q1 &lt; 1), a test statistic proposed by Choi and Stablein (1982) can be used, which is Tu=(n10+n11+zN+B−n01+n11N)2(N−n10−n11)(n10+n11)φ2N3+(N−n10−n11)(n01+n11)N3−2(n00n11−n10n01)φN3+b1(B−b1)(1−φ)2B3,

where φ = N/(N + B). In this test statistic, n10+n11+zN+B and n01+n11N are the unbiased estimates of p0 and p1. A general version of Tu can be used for data with missing at baseline or at the end of a study. That test statistic was compared with Tc under the exact unconditional framework, and the results showed that the exact approach based on the general version of Tu is generally not as powerful as that based on the combined test Tc (Tang &amp; Tang, 2004). For this reason, we use Tc for sample size calculation when the incomplete data occurs at baseline or at the end of a study. For the data with missing at the end of a study only, both Tu and TMC can be used for sample size calculation, and they are compared in the numerical study section.

3 Numerical study

The GEE approach and the proposed exact approach are compared at various p0, p1, and ρ to attain 80% power at the significance level of α = 0.05. The correlation coefficients ρ = −0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 are studied. Three p0 values are investigated: 20%, 30%, and 50%, and multiple response rate differences Δ = p1 − p0 are studied: 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%. We consider 6 missing patterns: Q1:(q0,q1)=(1,1),Q2:(q0,q1)=(0.9,0.7),Q3:(q0,q1)=(0.8,0.8),Q4:(q0,q1)=(0.7,0.9),Q5:(q0,q1)=(1,0.6).

The missing patterns Q2 to Q4 represent the data with incomplete samples at baseline or at the end of a study. The pattern Q5 is for samples with missing data that occur only at the end of a study. Suissa and Shuster (1991) were the first to compute exact sample sizes for a matched-pairs study with complete data (Q1) by using TMC as the test statistic for sample space ordering (Lloyd, 2008b; Fagerland, Lydersen, &amp; Laake, 2013; Shan &amp; Wilding, 2014).

We compute the proposed exact sample size, MExact, by enumerating all possible samples given the total sample size N for the complete samples, and B and A for the incomplete samples. As was said, there is no simulation involved in determining the sample size. The competitor is the approach based on the GEE approach, MGEE, with a closed-form sample size formula (Zhang et al., 2015). The actual type I and II error rates of the proposed approach are computed exactly while the GEE approach computes the actual error rates by using simulation studies (Zhang et al., 2015).

We first compare the performance of the GEE approach and the proposed approach with regards to type I error control. In a table of Zhang et al. (2015) (Table 2 of their work), almost half of the cases have the actual type I error rates over the nominal level, and over 25% of the cases have power being less than the desired power, for data with complete samples, or incomplete samples at baseline or at the end of a study. In Table 3, we provide the actual type I error rate of the GEE approach and the proposed approach with three different correlation coefficients: ρ = 0, 0.15, and 0.3, for complete samples (Q1) and incomplete samples at the end (Q5). The actual type I error rate based on the GEE approach and its associated sample size are from Zhang, Cao, and Ahn (2014). The exact sample size and its actual type I error rate are computed by using TMC as the test statistic for complete samples and Tu for the incomplete samples. It can be seen that the proposed exact approach guarantees the type I error rate while the existing GEE approach does not. The actual type I error rate of the proposed exact approach is always less than or equal to the nominal level, and Table 4 is used to illustrate this property when p0 = 20%, and p1 = 45% at the nominal level of α = 0.05. It can be seen that the exact approach preserves the significance level of a test.

Test statistic Tc is used for sample size calculation when the missing patterns are Q2, Q3, or Q4 with missing data at baseline or at the end, and TMC is used for a study with no missing data, Q1. When the missing data pattern is Q5, Tu and TMC can be used. In Figure 1, we compare the sample size calculation based on these two test statistics for data with the missing pattern Q5 when p0 = 20%, p1 from 35% to 50%, and correlation coefficient ρ from −0.2 to 0.6. For a given response rate p1, sample size for each ρ is plotted in the figure. The sample size MExact(Tu) is less than MExact(TMC) when the point is above the diagonal line. It can be seen that the exact approach based on Tu always needs fewer participants as compared to that based on TMC when (q0, q1) = (1, 0.6) with 40% of subjects having missing data at the end of the study. The exact approach based on Tu performs better than the other when Δ = p1 − p0 is small, although these two exact approaches are comparable when Δ is large and ρ is zero or negative. Similar results are observed for other configurations. We would recommend using the exact approach based on Tu for data with the missing pattern Q5, and Tu is used in the following comparison for a study with this missing pattern.

As suggested by one of the reviewers, alternatively the likelihood ratio (LR) test could be used to order the sample size for exact sample size calculation. For a study with complete data, Lloyd (2008b) found that the LR test and the McNemar test have similar performance with regards to power for such studies with complete data. For this reason, the example size based on these two tests should be close to each other. For a study with missing data either at baseline or at the end of a study, the likelihood function is expressed as L(p0,p1,π11)=(p1−π11)n01(p0−π11)n10π11n11(1−p0−p1+π11)(N−n01−n10−n11)p0b1(1−p0)B−b1p1a1(1−p1)A−a1.

Then, the LR test is given as LR=−2logmax0L(p0,p1,π11)L(p^0,p^1,π^11),

where max0 L(p0, p1, π11) is the maximum likelihood function under the null hypothesis, and L(p^0,p^1,π^11) is the maximum of the likelihood function. In general, there is no closed-formula to compute these maximum likelihood functions, and one has to compute them by using iterative methods (Choi &amp; Stablein, 1982). The LR test asymptotically follows a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom. For each possible data point, we compute the LR test first. We compare the required sample sizes based on the LR test and the Tc test in Table 5. We also provide the actual type I and II error rates for the exact sample size calculation based on the test statistic Tc and the LR test in this table. Both test statistics are used to order the sample space, and the p-value is then computed by using the exact approach as discussed in the manuscript. Table 5 illustrates that both are exact with type I and II error rates guaranteed. It can be seen that they have similar sample sizes in these cases, although the Tc test can save a few participants in general. Obviously, Tc is easy to use in sample size calculation since it has a closed-formula. For this reason, Tc is recommended for use in sample size determination. The LR test is not used in the following sample size comparisons. Therefore, the proposed approach utilizes TMC for complete data, Tc for data missing at baseline or at the end of a study, and Tu for missing data at the end of a study.

We present the sample sizes, MGEE and MExact, for various combinations of p1 and ρ when p0 = 20% in Table 6. Under the alternative with p0 and p1 as the marginal response rates, the response rate for π11 is calculated as π11=ρp0(1−p0)p1(1−p1)+p0p1, where 0 &lt; π11 &lt; min(p0, p1). We found that π11 is larger than p0 = 20% when p1 = 45% or 50%. In these cases, sample size calculations based on the exact approach does not exist. Although one can still use the GEE sample size calculation formula in Equation (1) to compute the required sample size, this may not be practically correct since the estimate of π10 is negative which is not considered a constraint in the GEE sample size calculation.

It can be seen in Table 6 that the required sample size generally decreases as the correlation coefficient ρ increases for a given design configuration for both approaches. When the response rate difference, Δ = p1 − p0, increases from 15% to 30% as in the table, the sample size is decreased. For a study with the missing pattern Q1 or Q5, MExact is always slightly smaller than MGEE, and the sample size difference between these two approaches is often small. For the other missing patterns from Q2 to Q4, although the exact approach may need more participants in a few configurations with negative or zero correlation, the exact approach generally needs fewer subjects than the GEE approach, and the sample size savings from the exact approach is substantial when ρ is large.

We plot the sample sizes, MGEE against MExact, when p0 = 30%, p1 = 50%, and ρ = −0.2 to 0.6, in Figure 2. Similar to the results observed from Table 6, sample size increases as the correlation coefficient ρ goes down from 0.6 to −0.2. The sample size based on the exact approach is smaller than that based on the GEE approach when ρ is large, and this trend is reversed when ρ is small or negative and the missing patterns are Q2 to Q4. Out of the 30 total cases seen in Figure 2, the exact sample size is less than or equal to that based on the GEE approach in the majority of the cases. We also provide the sample size calculation when p0 = 50% in Table 7. Similar results are observed to these in Table 6 and Figure 2.

3.1 Examples

We use a real example to illustrate the application of the proposed new exact sample size, MExact, as compared to the existing asymptotic sample size, MGEE. This study involved two surgeon-reviewers who evaluated the 69 cases (Greenberg et al., 2007). They were asked whether ‘hand-offs in care’ was a contributing factor in communication breakdowns. Their answers to each question were either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. Among these 69 claims, 50 were reviewed by both surgeon-reviewers, and 11 claims were reviewed by reviewer 1 only, and the remaining 8 claims were assessed by reviewer 2 only. The detailed data are given in Table 2. We combine all data to estimate the response rate of ‘Yes’ for each reviewer: p0 = 29/61 = 47.5% for reviewer 1, and p1 = 35/58 = 60% for reviewer 2. The missing rates are estimated as q0 = 80% and q1 = 85%. We use the complete samples to estimate the correlation coefficient as ρ = 0.75. To attain 80% power at α = 0.05, the GEE sample size is MGEE = 125, and the proposed exact sample size based on the test statistic Tc is MExact = 78. The required sample size by the exact approach is much smaller than the GEE sample size. When the nomial level is increased to α = 0.1, the required sample sizes are MGEE = 99 and MExact = 59, respectively. In the case for a study at α = 0.01, MGEE = 186 and MExact = 122 are required based on the GEE approach and the proposed exact approach.

The difference between these two approaches is relatively large as compared to those in the simulation study. In order to meet the condition that all the probabilities are positive, the upper bound for correlation coefficient ρ is 0.7766. The correlation coefficient is estimated as 0.75 from the example, which is very close to the upper bound. It can be seen from the numerical study that the exact approach saves more sample sizes as compared to the GEE approach when the correlation increases for this type of missing pattern.

4 Discussion

In this article, we developed a new exact sample size calculation for a matched-pairs study with incomplete data. As compared to the exact approach for sample size calculation, (Lloyd, 2007, 2014, 2008a; Shan, 2013; Shan, Ma, Hutson, &amp; Wilding, 2012; Shan &amp; Ma, 2016; Shan, 2015; Shan, Wilding, Hutson, &amp; Gerstenberger, 2016; Shan, Moonie, &amp; Shen, 2016; Shan, 2015), the existing GEE approach does not guarantee type I and II error rates although it is computationally easy with a closed form. With the wide availability of powerful computers or supercomputers, exact sample size computation is practical and feasible. The program to compute exact sample sizes is written in R, (Shan &amp; Wang, 2013), and it is available by request from the first author. The exact sample sizes are recommended for use in practice to improve the effectiveness of a study, and have the potential to increase the success rate of clinical trials with adequate and accurate sample size to attain the pre-specified power.

In this article, we compared the performance of the McNemar test with the test statistics proposed by Choi and Stablein (1982), Tu, by using the exact approach for a study with missing data at the end only (missing pattern Q5). The test statistic Tu uses all data while the McNemar test only uses the complete samples without considering the incomplete samples. The test statistic Tu is often more powerful than TMC for data with the missing pattern of q0 = 1 and q1 &lt; 1, and is associated with fewer participants in general. When data is missing at random or missing not at random, the assumption of response rate consistency between complete data and incomplete data is not valid. Li and Caffo (2011) conducted a simulation study to compare proportions with missing data. They assumed that the missing process is dependent on two covariates in the simulation study. A logistic regression model was used in the simulation study to investigate the robustness of their developed maximum likelihood estimator for a binary outcome. They considered 10 different missing at random scenarios to investigate the results. They found that the performance of their proposed estimator is dependent on the missing scenario. We consider comparing the performance and robustness of the GEE approach and the proposed exact approach in sample size calculation for a matched-pairs study with missing at random or missing not at random, as future work. When the required sample size is large, exact approaches could be computationally intensive, and other approaches based on Monte Carlo simulation (Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2002) or the bootstrap method (Yuan &amp; Hayashi, 2003) could be used.

If different approaches are used in sample size calculation and final data analysis, it is possible that we may fail to reject the null hypothesis given the sufficient sample size calculated from an efficient method in the sample size planning. For this reason, we would highly recommend researchers analyze the final data consistently by using the same approach used in the sample size calculation. In addition to that, researchers should also be encouraged to identify the most appropriate approach for analyzing the data by controlling for other possible confounding factors.
