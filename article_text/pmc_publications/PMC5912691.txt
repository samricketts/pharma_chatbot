A European working group has provided a new set of recommendations for the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in the diagnostic evaluation of Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment. These recommendations represent an important step towards the implementation of CSF biomarker tests in the clinic, but several challenges remain.


Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia, but symptoms such as impaired memory and other cognitive skills, and the gradual loss of ability to perform functions of daily living, can occur in other dementias, especially early in the disease trajectory. The challenge of reinforcing a clinical diagnosis led two groups — the National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer’s Association workgroup1, and the International Working Group for New Research Criteria for the Diagnosis of AD2 — to develop research criteria for AD at the stage of dementia or earlier (mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or prodromal AD). When a need exists for more-accurate determination that AD is the cause of dementia, both groups recommended the inclusion of biomarkers, including reduced levels of amyloid-β1–42 (Aβ1–42) and elevations of total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), positive results on imaging tests such as amyloid PET, medial temporal lobe atrophy assessed by MRI, or a characteristic pattern of glucose hypometabolism measured by 18F-FDG–PET1,2. Similar guidelines have been endorsed by the European Federation of Neurological Societies.

To provide evidence-based guidance for the clinical utility of CSF Aβ1–42, t-tau and p-tau181 as AD biomarkers, a multidisciplinary working group of European investigators, as part of the BIOMARKAPD (Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease) initiative, recently published recommendations for the use of these biomarkers in the diagnostic evaluation process for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD or MCI3,4. The working group employed a structured, well-organized and comprehensive approach, including an extensive literature search, prioritized clinical questions, and grading of the quality of evidence.

In the diagnostic work-up for suspected AD3, the evidence that these CSF biomarkers could identify or exclude AD was strong in mild dementia, but weaker in atypical or ambiguous cases. The investigators found weak evidence that CSF biomarkers could predict rates of clinical decline in mild AD or atypical or ambiguous dementia, and no evidence that their use could improve well-being or reduce health-care costs in these patients (although this question has received limited formal study). Also, comparisons with other biomarkers were limited, and were largely confined to brain MRI. For MCI4, the evidence indicates that CSF biomarkers can support or exclude AD as the likely underlying pathological process, and also have utility in predicting decline over 3 years.

Some evidence is scanty or missing: in particular, little information is available regarding the feasibility of lumbar puncture in the routine workflow for MCI and dementia, diagnostic and treatment outcomes after obtaining CSF biomarker data, and validation against gold standards such as autopsy. Nevertheless, the working group provides a compelling argument for incorporating CSF biomarkers into the initial diagnostic assessment of MCI, and of dementia in early, atypical or complex cases.

MRI has value beyond the assessment of hippocampal or cortical atrophy, and CSF and MRI biomarkers are probably best deployed in a synergistic rather than a mutually exclusive fashion. Brain MRI or CT is recommended in the diagnosis of dementia to evaluate features such as mass lesions, vascular disease and certain types of CNS inflammation, which CSF-based AD biomarkers do not address. Conversely, although hippocampal atrophy or regional cortical thickness patterns on MRI can support a diagnosis of AD, they do not indicate whether amyloid or tau pathologies are driving these changes. In atypical presentations — for example, progressive aphasia or posterior cortical atrophy — biomarkers are complementary: MRI might demonstrate the regional atrophy pattern, and CSF biomarkers can clarify whether AD is the likely underlying pathology.

Before CSF Aβ1–42, t-tau and p-tau181 can move into clinical use, standardization of pre-analytical and analytical factors is an essential requirement for the provision of technically robust and reliable test methods. In the AD CSF biomarker research community, consensus has been growing around definitions of best-practice pre-analytical steps to handle CSF, and the need to move beyond ‘research use-only’ immunoassay methods for measurement of CSF Aβ1–42, t-tau and p-tau181. We look forward to the development and validation of automated immunoassay methods according to strict in vitro diagnostic protocols, which should permit robust reproducibility across laboratories using the same assay methodology and analytical platform, and ultimately across different analytical platforms. Substantial progress in the development of certified reference methods and materials has been made for Aβ1–42, and similar efforts have been initiated for tau5–7.

An important question for any laboratory test is its interpretation: what pathological processes do the CSF analytes Aβ1-42, tau and p-tau181 measure, what does an abnormal test imply, and how should cut-off points be established? The decreased levels of CSF Aβ1–42 in AD indirectly reflect aggregation and impaired clearance of Aβ1–42 in the brain. Depletion of Aβ1–42 in the CSF correlates with increased retention of amyloid PET tracers in the brain, although recent studies suggest that CSF Aβ1–42 levels begin to decrease before amyloid PET scans fall into the positive zone. Because Aβ1–42 is preferentially deposited in plaques in AD, normalization of Aβ1–42 against a less aggregation-prone Aβ peptide might improve diagnostic accuracy. Several recent studies support this idea: the CSF Aβ1–42:Aβ1–40 ratio was found to perform slightly more accurately than Aβ1–42 alone when calibrated against amyloid PET imaging, and in studies where people with AD were compared with those with other types of dementia and controls8,9.

Increased levels of CSF tau suggest damage to neurons or axons and, when considered in the context of decreased Aβ1–42, provide support for ongoing neurodegeneration in AD. Evidence exists that the ratio of tau to Aβ1–42 has greater diagnostic utility than Aβ1–42 alone or the Aβ1–42:Aβ1–40 ratio. A systematic review with careful attention to analytical methodologies and study sample sizes will be needed to determine which combination of these biomarkers provides the best diagnostic and prognostic value.

The European working group has provided a conservative and thoughtful set of recommendations to move CSF biomarkers toward clinical implementation as indicators of the presence or absence of AD pathological processes in dementia and MCI3,4. This carefully weighed evidence, together with the prospect of improved test methods that would be widely available in clinical laboratories, as well as universally applicable cut-off points, provides a basis for the realistic availability of these tests in the near future, but many challenges remain. For example, better tests or combinations of tests are needed for accurate prediction of rate of decline in MCI and patients with early AD. Also, studies comparing CSF biomarkers with various imaging modalities are required. In addition, the benefit to patients of CSF Aβ1–42 tau and p-tau181 testing must be investigated. Ultimately, as the heterogeneity of pathology underlying dementia is increasingly recognized, an optimal biomarker panel may be tasked with detecting amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration10, as well as factors such as vascular or α-synuclein pathology, in order to personalize diagnosis and therapy.
