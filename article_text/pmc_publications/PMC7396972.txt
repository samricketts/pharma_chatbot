Background

Older adults are especially susceptible to adverse effects of inappropriate medication therapy, and anticholinergic medications are common culprits for cognitive dysfunction due to their action on the central nervous system. Medication therapy management (MTM) interventions can aid in deprescribing and reducing inappropriate medication use in older adults. However, there is sparse literature on the long-term sustainability of these interventions.

Objectives

(1) To investigate whether the deprescribing of anticholinergic medications during an 8-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a targeted MTM intervention is sustained at one-year post-intervention follow-up, and (2) to compare anticholinergic utilization trends in the study population to a large sample of similar individuals not exposed to the intervention.

Methods

Participants in the targeted MTM (tMTM) RCT had normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment and were recruited from enrollees in a longitudinal study at the University of Kentucky Alzheimer’s Disease Center (UKADC), and thus have pertinent medical information gathered approximately annually. In this post-trial observational follow-up, sustainability of the anticholinergic deprescribing intervention was assessed in participants in the RCT, and anticholinergic medication use trends were described from RCT baseline (which occurred immediately following an ADC visit) to the next annual visit in all participants. Mean change in anticholinergic burden from RCT baseline to the next annual visit was estimated using analysis of covariance, and participants were compared to two external samples. Anticholinergic burden was measured using the anticholinergic drug scale (ADS). The odds of decreasing baseline anticholinergic burden and number of total and strong anticholinergic medications at the follow-up study timepoint was assessed using logistic regression.

Results

Of the deprescribing changes made during the initial RCT, 40% were sustained after one year. Participants in the tMTM trial reported decreases in the use of anticholinergic antihistamines and bladder agents (−6.5 and −4.4% respectively), but there was no change in the use of anticholinergic CNS-targeted agents. While RCT participants’ anticholinergic burden decreased over one-year (adjusted mean ADS change [95% CI] −0.33 [−0.72, 0.07]), it was not different than the change observed in two external samples at the trial center (−0.20 [−0.42, 0.02]) and nationally (−0.33 [−0.39, −0.26]). There were no statistically significant differences between trial participants and external samples in the odds of decreasing anticholinergic burden, nor in decreasing the number of total, or strongly anticholinergic medications at one year follow-up.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that the sustainability of deprescribing is limited to the period of intervention, rather than affording lasting effects even over periods as short as one year, demonstrated not only in the small group of RCT participants but also by comparison to external groups. Future work should extend the duration of intervention and follow-up periods for MTM interventions to allow further insights regarding the sustainability of deprescribing efforts in older adults.


Introduction

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 formally recognized the role of medication therapy management (MTM) programs in reducing the risk of adverse drug events,1 and pharmacists play a key role in the effective implementation of MTM programs.2,3 While MTM programs can provide a range of services aimed at optimizing therapeutic outcomes and preventing costly medication-related adverse events, a core component of most MTM programs is the comprehensive medication review,4 an in-depth review of all patient medications, allowing identification of, and recommendations to address the issue of inappropriate medication use5 that may contribute to cognitive impairment in the aging population.

Older adults are a unique population of patients who may especially benefit from MTM interventions, as their advanced age and generally high medical comorbidity load may place them at greater risk for drug-related adverse events.6–8 The literature on MTM programs led by pharmacists has generally shown that these interventions reduce inappropriate prescribing and potential drug-related problems in the older adult population, with most studies focusing on reducing polypharmacy rather than targeting deprescribing of particular drug classes, such as anticholinergic medications9–11 that are known to be detrimental to cognitive function,12,13 yet are highly prescribed in the aging population today.14

Despite evidence of the short-term efficacy of MTM interventions, no studies have been conducted that focus primarily on the sustainability of MTM interventions in preventing potentially inappropriate medication use over longer periods of time. In a recent systematic review analyzing approaches to improve appropriate medication therapy amongst those with polypharmacy, investigators included 32 studies, of which only 37.5% sustained the intervention for at least one year. Yet, the review did not include any reflection regarding the length of post-intervention follow-up of the included MTM studies.11 There could be many factors that influence the extent to which a MTM intervention successfully sustains deprescribing efforts over time.

Previously, we reported on an eight-week, parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate whether a targeted patient-centered pharmacist-physician team (tMTM) intervention reduced the use of inappropriate anticholinergic medication use among older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) enrolled in a longitudinal study at the University of Kentucky Alzheimer’s Disease Center (UKADC) which is part of the National Institutes on Aging Alzheimer’s Disease Centers Program.15 Standardized data collection protocols for all ADCs are coordinated by the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC).16 The results of the initial RCT showed that the tMTM intervention resulted in reduced use of inappropriate anticholinergic medications during the 8-week trial period.17 Unfortunately, as with most clinical trials, the short follow-up period of the RCT limited its ability to determine the sustainability of the tMTM intervention and its effect on anticholinergic medications use patterns over a longer period of time.

The present study focuses on the long term sustainability of this tMTM intervention at one year, post-intervention;18 in addition, we are comparing the one-year impact of an anticholinergic tMTM intervention to natural trends in similar groups of subjects not participating in the RCT from both local and national comparative samples that were not exposed to the tMTM intervention. Methods.

Study design

This report is a post-trial observational follow-up of an RCT evaluating the effect of a tMTM intervention on deprescribing medications with anticholinergic properties among older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. The tMTM intervention has been described previously.17 The RCT and this observational follow-up were approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board and all participants provided signed informed consent for participation in research. For participants with mild cognitive impairment, the informed consent was also provided by their legally authorized representative. This report focuses on RCT participants’ outcomes approximately one-year after the trial’s completion, compared to two external samples of similar subjects, including both a local (UKADC) and a national (NACC) sample.

Targeted Medication Therapy Management Intervention

Briefly, participants were recruited from the UKADC and were screened for RCT eligibility between October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015, and those potentially eligible were invited to participate in the RCT. UKADC participants were eligible if they were aged at least 65 years and reported at least one medication with anticholinergic properties at their annual UKADC visit. ADC participants living in a long-term care facility or with at least moderate dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating- CDR® Dementia Staging Instrument [CDR] ≥ 2) were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned to either the tMTM intervention or standard of care using a simple block randomization scheme, and group allocation was not revealed until after the baseline medication review was completed by the trial pharmacists.

All participants were given generic informational materials on the importance of being actively involved with—and learning about—their medications and were encouraged to talk to their primary care providers about their medications. Participants randomized to the intervention group met with a pharmacist-clinician (MD or APRN) team with the goal of discontinuation of any potentially inappropriate medications with anticholinergic properties, or replacement with safer alternatives including both medication substitutions and non-pharmacologic interventions (i.e., deprescribing). When alternatives were unavailable, reduction in dosage was recommended whenever clinically indicated to reduce the anticholinergic burden. Due to ethical considerations, participants randomized to the control group received a modified version of the tMTM intervention at the end of the RCT. Specifically, these participants discussed their medications with the trial pharmacists and received recommendations regarding their anticholinergic medications.

Post-Trial Observational Follow-Up

The main objectives of the current investigation are to: (1) investigate whether the deprescribing of anticholinergic medications during an 8-week RCT of a tMTM intervention is sustained at one-year post-intervention follow-up and (2) compare the anticholinergic utilization trends in the study population to a large sample of similar individuals not exposed to the intervention. Specifically, we compared the changes in anticholinergic medication use and anticholinergic burden from baseline (i.e. RCT enrollment) to the next UKADC visit approximately one-year later to the natural trends in both a local (UKADC) and national (NACC) sample not exposed to the tMTM intervention. Sustainability was evaluated in RCT participants by describing changes in anticholinergic medication use from the end of the trial period (EOT) to the next follow-up visit approximately one year later. We evaluated these changes in all RCT participants as a single group since all participants received some form of the intervention (whether formal as in the pharmacist-clinician team tMTM intervention group, or informal as in the pharmacist-led tMTM control group).

To account for historical trends in medication use, we constructed two external control samples of ADC participants who were not enrolled in the RCT and examined their anticholinergic medication changes over the same period of time. These external control samples were identified from the databases of participants enrolled in the UKADC as well as all current and former ADCs throughout the United States. The US National Institute on Aging (NIA) began the ADC program in 1984 in a comprehensive effort to boost research on both Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders.15 ADCs prospectively collect the Uniform Data Set (UDS), which includes standardized demographic, clinical, neuropsychological, and diagnostic patient data, and share de-identified UDS data with NACC.19 Annual ADC visit data were then used to assess changes in medication use after one year; visits were selected such that the first visit occurred in either 2014 or 2015 (similar to the timeline of the original RCT), and subjects were selected by applying the RCT inclusion and exclusion (I/E) criteria to all subjects.17 Participants who did not have medication information available at the annual visit after baseline were excluded from this analysis. Thus, all participants had information on medication use at baseline and the next annual ADC visit.

The first external ADC control group included local subjects from the UKADC who met I/E criteria in 2014-15 but were not enrolled in the RCT. Because all RCT participants were recruited from the UKADC, this group was intended to provide information about anticholinergic medication use trends for the source population of similar older adults residing in the same geographical area as RCT participants. The second external control group included all eligible subjects from the other ADCs (excluding UKADC), based on UDS data obtained from NACC. Because the UKADC is itself part of the national ADC program, this second ADC control group was included with the intent of providing information about patterns of anticholinergic medication use in a larger population with similar characteristics to the RCT participants, but residing in geographically disparate locations.

Outcome Measures

This post-trial observational follow-up focused on three outcome measures to describe anticholinergic medication use: (1) patterns of anticholinergic medications use; (2) mean change in anticholinergic burden, and (3) odds of decreasing use of anticholinergic medications. For participants in the RCT, we investigated patterns of anticholinergic medications use from the EOT period to the next ADC visit approximately one year later, with medications organized by therapeutic class. We evaluated the mean change in anticholinergic burden and the odds of decreasing use of anticholinergic medications from the baseline to next ADC visit (approximately one year later) between all RCT participants and the two external control groups. “Decreased” use of anticholinergic medication was defined as report of fewer medications with any anticholinergic properties at the next ADC visit than at baseline.

Anticholinergic burden was measured using the updated version of the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS),20 which accurately quantifies anticholinergic burden and categorizes the largest number of medications for anticholinergic activity of all currently available scales.21,22 The ADS has four levels for each included drug, ranging from 0 (no known anticholinergic activity) to 3 (marked anticholinergic activity, or strongly anticholinergic), and the summation of anticholinergic activity level for all reported medications reflects the total anticholinergic burden for the participant (higher scores indicate a higher burden).

Odds of decreasing use of any or only strongly (defined as ADS=3) anticholinergic medications over the follow-up period were also considered. These outcomes were included to provide more clinically relevant results, as a count of medications may be more easily measured and implemented in clinical practice than changes in anticholinergic burden, and strongly anticholinergic medications may be more easily prioritized for deprescribing.

Statistical Analysis

We used Student’s t or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables and Pearson chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for binary variables to assess the similarity of RCT participants and external control subjects at their respective baseline visits.

Using a table organized by medication class, we listed deprescribed anticholinergic medications among RCT participants and described whether these medications remained discontinued, were replaced, or were re-iniated by the one-year post-intervention follow-up. Mean ADS change was assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) controlling for imbalanced baseline covariates (total number of medications and baseline ADS) to generate adjusted means and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The ANCOVA aimed to compare RCT participants’ mean ADS changes to both local and national external groups to determine whether participation in the RCT was associated with greater reduction in anticholinergic burden than standard of care. To determine whether there was a difference in the odds of decreasing anticholinergic burden, total number, or number of strong anticholinergic medications, we used logistic regression to compare groups with adjusted odds ratios (OR) in the same fashion as the ANCOVAs, controlling for total number of anticholinergic medications and ADS at baseline. All statistical analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4®.23

Results

Baseline Characteristics

In total, 1,937 ADC participants were included in analyses (n=46, 146, and 1,745 from the RCT, local, and national groups respectively). Groups were similar in demographic characteristics including age (mean 76.9 years), female sex (64.8%), white race (83.8%), and years of education (mean 15.9 years; see Table 1). There was a similar proportion of participants with impaired cognition in each group, but RCT participants reported more medications in general at baseline than those in the NACC group (p=0.048) and had a higher anticholinergic burden than both the UKADC and NACC groups (p=0.005 and 0.001, respectively).

Anticholinergic Medication Use Patterns

At baseline, the most commonly used anticholinergic medication class in all groups was antidepressants (32.6, 41.1, and 46.0% of participants in the RCT, UKADC, and NACC groups respectively; see Figure 1 for frequency of anticholinergic medications use). Bladder antimuscarinics and anticholinergic cardiovascular agents were also highly utilized.

Among the 46 participants who had post-intervention follow-up data, there were 77 anticholinergic medications used at baseline. The most commonly used anticholinergic medication classes included antidepressants (n=18, 23.4%), cardiovascular medications (n=15, 19.5%), and bladder agents (n=14, 18.2%).

Of the anticholinergic medications reported at baseline, 22 (28.6%) were discontinued at the end of the 8-week RCT (27.3% antidepressants, 22.8% each of antihistamines and gastrointestinal agents, 13.6% bladder agents, 9.1% central nervous system-acting agents excluding antidepressants, and 4.5% cardiovascular agents; see Table 2). All of the deprescribed central nervous system-acting and cardiovascular agents remained discontinued at the one-year post-intervention follow-up, while 60, 40, 33% and 33% of the antihistamines, gastrointestinal agents, bladder agents, and antidepressants remained discontinued respectively. Overall, 50% of the anticholinergic medications that were deprescribed remained discontinued at the one-year post-intervention period, though the success varied by anticholinergic medication class.

Of the baseline anticholinergic medications, 55 (71.4%) were continued at the end of the 8-week RCT, but 16 of these (29.1%) were discontinued by the one-year post-intervention follow-up. These included antihistamines (n=5, 31.75%), bladder and cardiovascular agents (n=4 and 3, 25 and 18.75% respectively), and one each of antidepressant, gastrointestinal, central nervous system-acting, and steroid agents.

The difference in percent of participants using each anticholinergic medication between baseline and the next follow-up visit approximately one year later (by class) is visualized in Figure 1. RCT participants reported the largest decreases in antihistamines (−6.5% difference between baseline and one-year use), followed by bladder antimuscarinics (−4.4%). The two external control samples did not report as large of a decrease in the use of bladder antimuscarinics. However, while both external control samples saw marked decreases in the use of CNS-active anticholinergic medications, there was no change between baseline and one year in the frequency of RCT participants using such medications. After one year, a slightly greater proportion of RCT participants reported using anticholinergic antidepressants (+2.2%) compared to these same subjects at baseline.

Change in Anticholinergic Burden and Medication Use

After adjusting for baseline total number of medications and baseline anticholinergic burden, RCT participants had an average 0.33 point decrease in ADS from baseline to one-year (95% CI −0.72, 0.07). As seen in Table 3, this was not statistically significantly different than the change in mean ADS seen in either local or national external control samples (mean [95% CI] −0.20 [−0.42, 0.02] and −0.33 [−0.39, −0.26] for the local and national groups respectively).

A greater proportion of RCT participants decreased anticholinergic burden (34.8% among RCT participants vs 27.4 and 29.2% in the local and national groups; see Table 3) and the number of anticholinergic medications (28.3 vs 25.3 and 27.9%) compared to the external control groups. However, this difference was not statistically significant, as RCT participants had similar odds of decreased anticholinergic burden (OR [95% CI] 1.07 [0.51, 2.25] and 0.95 [0.50, 1.80]) and decreased number of anticholinergic medications (OR [95% CI] 0.92 [0.43, 1.98] and 0.78 [0.40, 1.53]) compared to the local and national external controls, respectively (see Figure 2).

When restricted to strongly anticholinergic medications (i.e., ADS≥3), 8.7% of RCT participants decreased the use of these medications after one year, compared to 9.6% and 9.8% of those in the local and national external groups. There was no difference in the odds of decreasing number of strongly anticholinergic medications among RCT participants when compared to the local and national control groups (OR [95% CI] 0.55 [0.15, 1.98] and 0.50 [0.16, 1.55]).

Discussion

Existing literature on deprescribing medications in older adults indicates that these interventions improve appropriate medication use and health outcomes.11,24 However, few studies follow subjects for extended periods of time, and even fewer measure medication use more than once. As a result, there is a paucity of data on the effectiveness and sustainability data for deprescribing MTM interventions in the literature.

The present study evaluates the one-year sustainability of a short-term deprescribing tMTM intervention to reduce inappropriate anticholinergic medications. We found that the marked decrease in anticholinergic burden seen in the formal intervention group during the RCT was attenuated after approximately one year (mean ADS change [SE] −1.0 [0.3] after 8-weeks compared to −0.33 [0.2] after approximately one year).17 While the short-term findings from the RCT are in line with existing evidence, the decreased effect size over time found in this follow-up was more pronounced than in other longer-term deprescribing studies.11 Though there are only a limited number of pharmacist-led deprescribing studies in community-dwelling older adults that have followed subjects for at least one year, most describe a more significant reduction in measures of inappropriate medication use than was found in this study.25–28 One potential explanation for this discrepancy is that this is the first deprescribing intervention that uses an MTM strategy targeting on specific medication class instead of the entire medication regimen. Indeed, even within this study we showed that the degree of sustainability varied by anticholinergic medication indication (all CNS-acting and cardiovascular agents remained discontinued, while only 33% of antidepressants and bladder agent discontinuations were sustained). Notably, there are many non-anticholinergic medications available to treat CNS and cardiovascular conditions, while nearly all agents used to treat overactive bladder are anticholinergic. Alternative agents are a key component to ensuring patient preferences29,30 are taken into consideration, as without an effective alternative patients may re-iniate. Thus, the attenuated sustainability of this tMTM intervention may have been related to its targeted nature, which limited the pool of available alternatives. In line with current literature,11 these findings suggests that balancing patient-specific goals with reducing anticholinergic burden is crucial to long-term sustainability for deprescribing interventions.

In this post-trial observational follow-up, we also compared RCT participants (who were recruited from the UKADC) to two different external groups: (1) participants in the UKADC who did not participate in the RCT, and (2) participants enrolled in ADCs throughout the country. All groups experienced a small, clinically insignificant reduction in the use of anticholinergic medications over the approximately one-year follow-up. In addition, RCT participants had similar odds of decreasing the number of total and strong anticholinergic medications used after one year as the external control samples. Although we noted that all these groups decreased with regard to anticholinergic utilization, we cannot clearly determine the reason behind this change. It is likely that external factors influencing care for older adults played a role in our observed trends, including an increased awareness in the potential harms caused by anticholinerging medications. in addition, this finding may be related to the fact that the average number of anticholinergic medications used at baseline was less than two, leaving little room for improvement. This stands in contrast to most community deprescribing interventions which focus on subjects with polypharmacy, where the baseline number of medications is high. The external control groups—a sample of individuals from the local ADC that served as the source population for the RCT, and ADC participants from around the country—served as an important contextualization, providing a picture of what trajectory RCT participants might have taken had they not participated in the trial. This comparison highlights the need to further examine anticholinergic medication use in this population, and determine what steps can be taken to further reduce the use of this dangerous31–33 medication class.

Given that patients are generally interested in reducing inappropriate medication use and that they value communication and interaction with their healthcare providers in the medication decision-making process,34,35 future deprescribing interventions should provide patient-specific recommendations and strive to engage patients throughout the process, including after initial deprescribing to ensure sustainability. Pharmacists provide an accessible and important healthcare resource who may be able to maintain continual patient relationships through the MTM and deprescribing process. In support of this notion, a recent pilot study showed that patients may be more willing to follow-up with pharmacists when they work in a team with primary care providers.36 A larger RCT with a follow-up of twelve months and repeated patient interaction to address long term sustainability is underway.37 Future studies of MTM deprescribing interventions should include longer-term follow-up of participants to provide more data on the characteristics of interventions that sustain over longer periods of time.

Limitations

Our study had some limitations. RCT participants and both external control samples were selected from ADCs and are recruited into these centers via clinician or community organization referral, or are volunteers interested in contributing to dementia research. Thus, RCT participants and ADC participants in the external control groups were highly educated and cannot be considered a nationally representative sample of older adults limiting the generalizability of our results. In addition, medication use for participants in the study were based on self-report through a brown-bag medication review approach, except for the baseline and EOT visits for the trial participants.

Another key caveat to interpreting these findings lies in the lack of a universally agreed-upon rating scale for anticholinergic burden. It is possible that another measurement tool for anticholinergic burden would have provided different results.

Additionally, this current investigation is observational. Generally, observational studies can make only weak causal inferences based on results due to less control for confounding factors. However, the adjustment for imbalanced baseline covariates and addition of the external control groups increases this study’s strength to make causal inferences about the sustainability of the tMTM deprescribing intervention.

Lastly, given the sample size of the RCT, we are underpowered to detect small changes in ADS over the one-year follow-up. Nevertheless, the effect size of the RCT estimates are similar to those in the external control groups, leading us to the conclusion that there is little clinically meaningful sustainability. Thus, even beyond the interpretation of the numbers, our study shed light into important aspects of medication optimization and deprescribing interventions, including sustainability.

Conclusion

Pharmacist-engaged, multidisciplinary MTM programs are important tools for deprescribing and optimizing medication-related outcomes in older adult patients. However, in this post-trial observational follow-up, we did not find significant differences in the sustainability of reductions in anticholinergic burden, or in number of anticholinergic or strongly anticholinergic medications used, between participants in a tMTM intervention and similar groups of community-dwelling older adults at one year follow-up. Future studies should explore how optimizing patient engagement and providing ongoing deprescribing support may improve sustainability of MTM interventions. Furthermore, studies should evaluate interventions to enhance and optimize communication between patients, pharmacists and primary care providers to facilitate and sustain deprescribing.

Summary Bullets

What is already known about this subject

Anticholinergic medications are common culprits of adverse cognitive effects in older adults.

Medication therapy management (MTM) interventions can reduce inappropriate medication use in older adults and aid in deprescribing efforts to improve health outcomes.

There is insufficient evidence regarding the sustainability of deprescribing MTM interventions over longer periods of time due to lack of studies including sustained intervention and post intervention long-term follow-up.

What this study adds

This study demonstrates that targeted anticholinergic deprescribing during an 8-week MTM RCT is successful, but that overall anticholinergic medication use one-year post-intervention is similar to comparable subjects nationwide.

This study highlights the importance of future trials examining factors that may contribute to longer sustainability of individualized MTM interventions targeting deprescribing in older adults.
