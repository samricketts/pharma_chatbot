Introduction:

In the context of Alzheimer’s disease phenotypes, patients may present with symptoms and signs that do not exclusively fit into one of the existing phenotypic categories, which often delays timely diagnosis and initiation of services to optimize patient awareness and coping.

Case Report:

A 74-year-old woman presented with the complaint of progressive word finding difficulty, raising our suspicion for primary progressive aphasia. Clinical evaluations, however, also revealed emerging cortical visual deficits consistent with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). During evaluation one year later, Gerstmann’s syndrome was evident. Her in vivo neuroimaging was positive for beta-amyloid and tau biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology.

Conclusion:

In addition to contributing to the literature on the heterogeneity of the clinical manifestations of AD, this report highlights that a breakdown in the visual-lexical interface can account for anomia in PCA at least in some cases. Other relevant clinical insights pertinent to this case are discussed.

pmcAlzheimer’s disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, was initially thought to predominantly manifest as an amnestic disorder. Over the past two decades, however, awareness about atypical manifestations of AD, particularly in the younger (&lt; 65 years of age) population, is increasing. These atypical manifestations are heterogenous, and currently include phenotypic posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), behavioral variant AD, dysexecutive AD, corticobasal syndrome AD and logopenic variant (lv) of primary progressive aphasia (PPA).1 To promote clinical awareness and add to the literature on the heterogeneity of the clinical manifestations of AD, we present an unusual case of AD that straddled the boundary between PPA and PCA. Clinical insights from this case report are discussed.

CASE REPORT

A 74-year-old right-handed Caucasian woman, with 16-years of education, presented with a 2-year history of progressive word-finding difficulty specifically for names of objects. Reportedly, she was independent in her activities of daily living including driving. Her medical history was significant for elevated cholesterol for which she took a statin. Her family history was significant for AD in a second-generation family member. She underwent an interdisciplinary evaluation. Her performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)2 was severely impaired (scored 8/30).

Speech and language assessment: She exhibited word retrieval difficulty, more so during confrontation naming (scored 8/30 on the naming subtest of the Sydney Language Battery (SYDBAT)3) than conversation, without explicit semantic (i.e., loss of word meaning) or phonological impairment. During picture naming, for example, she said “play music” for “radio”, and for “dinosaur” and “hippopotamus,” her response was “animal.” On the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R4), her auditory mediated naming (sentence completion = 8/10, responsive speech = 7/10) seemed better than visually mediated naming (object naming = 41/60). Tactile cues (holding the object in hand) benefitted her object naming performance on 3/8 occasions, with an additional phonemic and/or a semantic cue facilitating naming on two occasions. Verbal fluency was impaired (animal fluency: 4; verb fluency: 6; letters “F”, “A” &amp; “S” fluency: 11 total). Auditory verbal comprehension and verbal (sentence and digit) repetition (requiring auditory attention and phonological working memory) were well preserved. She had mild word substitutions while reading (e.g., reading the word “machine” as “mechanic”) and was unable to read nonwords (0/10 on the reading nonwords section of the WAB-R,4) which are consistent with mild phonological alexia. Reading comprehension was preserved (scored 40/40 on WAB-R4, reading comprehension of sentences). Spelling errors suggesting surface and phonologic agraphia were evident in writing (Figure 1. A, B &amp; C). Occasional grammatical errors in writing (Figure 1. A) were also noted. Motor speech was preserved.

Assessment of other cognitive domains: She was oriented to the year and day, but did not retrieve the correct date, month, place and city. She exhibited visuo-spatial/visuo-constructional (Figure 1. D &amp; E) difficulties and acalculia (0/3 on the subtraction task, MoCA2). She had mild difficulty finding target objects in a cluttered presentation (e.g., six objects presented for the WAB-R auditory word recognition testing). She had moderate difficulty matching semantically related pictures (scoring 18/30 on the semantic association task from SYDBAT), with most responses reflecting visual processing difficulty as opposed to impairment of semantic knowledge (e.g., verbally describing a relationship but pointing to a distractor response). Verbal memory was impaired, but aphasia could have interfered with assessment. Performance on visually-based memory and executive function testing was impaired, but again, visual processing deficits might have confounded assessment. Executive function deficits were evidenced by impaired backward digit span and verbal fluency. She did not have an apperceptive prosopagnosia.

Neuroimaging: MRI and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) revealed atrophy and hypometabolism, respectively, of the left posterior inferior lateral temporal lobe with extension into the left occipital and parietal lobes (including angular gyrus) (Figure 2). There was also involvement of the left medial temporal lobe and frontal cortex, with relative sparing of the right hemisphere. The Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET scan showed beta-amyloid deposition consistent with AD. The [18F]flortaucipir PET scan showed uptake in the occipital, parietal and temporal lobes, with uptake greatest in the left hemisphere, consistent with uptake levels observed in AD.

Follow-up evaluation: Evaluations one year later revealed worsening of anomia, acalculia, alexia, and visual-spatial/visuo-constructional abilities. There was evidence for simultanagnosia (2/6 on Ishihara color plates and 0/6 on Navon figures), but none for achromatopsia (5/5 on color matching). Completing the features of Gerstmann syndrome, she showed right/left confusion and finger agnosia which are compatible with her neuroimaging showing involvement of the angular gyrus. Flortaucipir uptake was similar to the scan at the initial evaluation.

DISCUSSION

We describe a case in which the patient’s presenting concern was word finding difficulty, raising suspicion for PPA, while interdisciplinary evaluations revealed emerging cortical visual processing difficulty and features of Gerstmann syndrome consistent with PCA, an atypical form of AD. Even though PCA has been regarded primarily as a syndrome impacting visual processing, co-occurring anomia is not rare.5,6,7,8 Phonological processing difficulty similar to what occurs in lvPPA (another atypical manifestation of AD) has been reported5,6 in PCA. While neuroimaging showed patterns consistent with both lvPPA (left hemispheric dominance) and PCA, this patient did not show phonological processing difficulties such as phonemic paraphasias or impaired repetition. Given that her word retrieval difficulty was greater during confrontation naming (cf. conversation and auditory mediated naming), and neuroimaging revealed left ventral visual stream (occipitotemporal) disruption, it likely reflected a breakdown in the visual-lexical interface (VLI) similar to previously described cases.9,10 We did not assess naming across modalities (visual, auditory and tactile) with targets that were matched for psycholinguistic variables (e.g., word frequency, phonological neighborhood density). In this regard, we do not have conclusive behavioral evidence in favor of the disrupted-VLI hypothesis. Disruption of the VLI, however, might not be unique to this case as it (specifically, with processing “visual feature knowledge” of objects) has also been regarded as one of the contributors to anomia in the semantic variant of PPA11. Further investigations are required to operationalize the definition of VLI and determine appropriate assessment tools.

This case report supports that not all AD patients strictly fall under one of the existing clinical phenotypic categories and that overlapping features across categories are possible.8,10 The patient reported here was 74-year-old at presentation and showed an atypical (i.e., non-amnestic) clinical profile, which supports that heterogeneity in clinical manifestations of AD is not restricted to younger (&lt; 65 years) population.12 As to why the patient reported here did not have complaints related to her visual processing difficulty, it is possible that she had misinterpreted her emerging symptoms13 and/or that it had not yet reached the threshold to substantially interfere with her activities of daily living. The publication of more case studies such as this and larger group studies will help us better understand the nature of visual deficits in ventral PCA.

Finally, we emphasize that detailed neurological and neuropsychological evaluations are critical to appropriately characterize/diagnose patients with symptoms suggestive of a neurodegenerative disease, so that appropriate counseling can be provided to facilitate patients’ (and family members’) illness awareness and pertinent coping process.
