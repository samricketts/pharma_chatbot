INTRODUCTION:

The AT(N) research framework categorizes eight biomarker profiles using β amyloid (A), tauopathy (T) and neurodegeneration (N), regardless of dementia. We evaluated associations of AT(N) profiles and incident dementia in the last five years in a community-based cohort by approximating AT(N) profiles using autopsy-based neuropathology correlates, and considered cost implications for clinical trials.

METHODS:

We used CERAD (moderate/frequent) to approximate A+, Braak stage (IV-VI) for T+, and temporal pole lateral ventricular dilation for N+. Outcomes included dementia at death and in the last 5 years of life.

RESULTS:

A+T+(N)+ was most common (31%). Dementia prevalence ranged from 14% (A−T−(N)−) to 79% (A+T+(N)+). Between 8% (A+T−(N)−) and 68% (A+T+(N)−) of decedents developed incident dementia. Trials would incur substantial expense to characterize AT(N).

DISCUSSSION:

Dementia varied across approximated AT(N) profiles. Many people with preclinical AD will never develop clinical dementia during life, highlighting resilience to clinical expression of AD neuropathologic changes.

pmc1. Narrative

1.1 Background

There is widespread enthusiasm for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in pre-symptomatic stages using biomarkers. The use of biomarkers as a research framework gained acceptance with publication of the National Institute on Aging – Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) recommendations[1–4] and the International Working Group (IWG) Alzheimer’s disease criteria.[5, 6] These recommendations separate the clinical syndrome from the biomarker-based diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, which is identified by cerebral amyloidosis (A) based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays or amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, tauopathy (T) based on CSF assays or tau PET scans, and neurodegeneration (N) based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resulting in the AT(N) framework.[7] This approach has been codified as the NIA-AA research framework.[8]

Evaluation of the AT(N) framework in population-based cohorts is recognized as an important next step.[9, 10] In a 2017 Lancet Neurology paper, Jack et al. evaluated the prevalence of eight AT(N) biomarker profiles among cognitively unimpaired older people from a community-based cohort.[11] A follow-up study highlighted discrepancies between the clinical syndrome and biomarker-based Alzheimer disease, with lower prevalence of clinically defined probable Alzheimer disease compared to biomarker-based Alzheimer disease, particular for older ages. [12] Jack et al. emphasized the need to determine associations between AT(N) biomarkers and cognitive outcomes: “answers to such questions require longitudinal clinical follow-up in many well characterized individuals with eventual autopsy correlation.” (p.443) [11]

In this study we evaluate the theoretical performance of AT(N) in a large community-based prospective cohort with autopsy follow-up, the Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPW) / University of Washington (UW) Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. ACT’s autopsy protocol is the same regardless of clinical status, allowing us to approximate AT(N) profiles using neuropathology correlates of fluid and imaging biomarkers and evaluate the prevalence of biomarker-based Alzheimer’s and clinical dementia. People who consent to autopsy are not representative of the larger ACT cohort, and we used inverse probability weighting to address potential selection bias.[13] Our primary outcomes were dementia prevalence at death and development of dementia in the last 5 years of life for each autopsy-derived, approximated AT(N) profile.

One goal of the AT(N) framework is targeted selection of participants for clinical trials.[10] Secondary prevention trials for dementia based on the AT(N) research framework will require screening large numbers of older adults to achieve adequate power.[14] Current screening methods require candidates to undergo PET scanning or lumbar puncture with CSF assay and MRI. As a thought experiment, we used our results and published information to estimate the number of U.S. older adults who could potentially be screened for clinical trials, and cost implications for imaging and CSF-based screening methods.

In the ACT study, participants may opt to have their biennial screening visit at the research clinic or at their home. We previously found that volunteering for an MRI was related to attending the preceding study visit in our research clinic, and we considered clinic attendance as a proxy for ability to have AT(N) characterized.[15] Using this sample, we estimated imaging and CSF-based screening costs per 1000 potential trial candidates identified, and costs per dementia case prevented for three hypothetical recruitment scenarios.

Additional neuropathological findings likely contribute to the risk of clinical dementia among those on the biomarker-based Alzheimer’s continuum (A+ with any other biomarker). Mixed pathologies are common among older adults, and the AT(N) framework acknowledges the need to include additional biomarkers by including an “X” term.[16, 17] One commentary emphasized the relevance of Lewy bodies, vascular disease, and neuroinflammation.[18] We considered six pathological changes beyond amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration, and evaluated the prevalence of non-AT(N) neuropathologic findings for each approximated AT(N) profile. Finally, we evaluated whether these six pathological changes independently predicted dementia onset among people who were free of dementia 5 years ante mortem.

1.2 Study conclusions and implications

Based on data from a prospective community-based cohort, we found more heterogeneity than expected in the relationship between neuropathology-based approximations of fluid and imaging biomarker profiles for AT(N) and clinical dementia status. Among all participants estimated to have biomarker-based preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (A+T+), nearly one in five was dementia-free at death. For participants with preclinical AD who were dementia-free at least 5 years ante mortem, more than 30% showed apparent resilience to clinical expression of those neuropathologic changes by remaining dementia-free until death. These results provide additional evidence of discrepancies between the clinical syndrome and biomarker-based Alzheimer disease in the community at large.

Our findings can be used to consider the theoretical implications of screening older adults for secondary prevention trials based on the AT(N) framework. Results from our thought experiment question the viability of any of the screening strategies we evaluated due to substantial costs and the exclusion of a significant proportion of older adults unable to attend screening. Approximately 57% of all dementia-free ACT participants attended a research clinic study visit preceding 5 years ante mortem, a group likely to volunteer for inclusion in prevention trials. On a population level, this translates to nearly 7.4 million older adults who might be unable to have AT(N) characterized. For those who can present for screening, one strategy – which has been adopted by several trials such as the A4 study – is to enroll based on amyloid positivity alone, regardless of tau or neurodegeneration. For a clinical trial enrolling A+ participants age 80–89, 52% would be expected to develop dementia. If a very effective therapy reduced dementia incidence by 25%, the costs just to characterize amyloid positivity using imaging for a 1000-person trial total to $177,000 per case prevented – and that is before figuring in the costs of the treatment in terms of administration (many current treatments require infusion clinics) and monitoring for toxicity (such as MRI scans to identify amyloid-related imaging abnormality). Importantly, treating people based on this scenario exposes older adults to potential toxicity from the treatment, but only 52% of these would develop dementia in the absence of treatment. The remaining 48% would not develop dementia whether they were treated or not. Costs increase to nearly $400,000 per dementia case prevented for a similar trial that enrolls participants based on both amyloid and tau positivity. Successful early intervention could offset screening costs by reducing the estimated $150 to $200 billion attributable to dementia care in the U.S,[19] but actual net savings would depend on the effectiveness and costs of a hypothetical treatment, which are currently unknown.

Research suggests the relationship between AD pathology and dementia may be attenuated in the oldest old,[20] and we found lower rates of dementia among those with biomarker-defined preclinical AD who were dementia-free five years ante mortem at age 80–89 compared to the rates of dementia among those with biomarker-defined preclinical AD who were dementia-free five years ante mortem at age 70–79. Ethical implications of treating asymptomatic people who are found to be A+ depend on the toxicity of the intervention, and caution would be warranted for interventions with nonnegligible side effects, particularly for the oldest old, since ~1/3 of those treated may remain dementia-free regardless.

Our findings for neuropathologic changes beyond amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration are also important. As suggested in the NIA research framework, our regression results suggest the tremendous potential for a biomarker-based strategy that incorporates indicators of neuropathology elements beyond AT(N), particularly neocortical Lewy bodies, macroscopic cystic infarcts, and cortical or deep microinfarcts. It has long been appreciated that mixed pathologies are common among people with late-life dementias.[16, 17] Among all participants, more than 80% of those on the Alzheimer’s continuum had significant additional pathological findings. Macroscopic cystic infarcts (which may be identified by in vivo structural MRI) and cortical or deep microinfarcts (which have no in vivo correlate to date) were common, and were among the strongest predictors of dementia independent of amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration. Of note, our neuropathology findings are similar to those of several other community-based cohorts.[16, 21, 22] Neuropathologic changes likely share some interdependence and future studies of potential interactions using a systems approach could be informative.[9] Regardless, the limited explanatory power of the AT(N) framework to identify people who will develop dementia should be appreciated by researchers, and the potential to extend this framework with as-yet undeveloped biomarkers of other neurodegenerative processes should be pursued.

We obtained data from the Mayo study of AT(N) [11] (Michelle Mielke, personal communication) and also compared findings with those from the Gothenberg cohort. [23] Our findings among dementia-free octogenarians were similar to those from Mayo [11] (Figure S6 in supporting information). Our sample size for people who died at younger ages was smaller. For dementia-free ACT participants under age 75, we had a smaller proportion assigned to the A−T−(N)− group compared to both Mayo [11] and Gothenburg [23] (Figure S7 in supporting information). The similarity of our findings for the proportions of people in each category to the findings from the Mayo data for octogenarians provides evidence of the validity of our autopsy-derived approximation of AT(N) and gives insight into the potential for the AT(N) framework to predict dementia, particularly for older age groups, that was not possible with the cross-sectional evaluation from the Mayo study.

Our findings should be understood in the context of our study limitations. We extrapolated based on the subset of approximately 30% of ACT that consented for autopsy. We weighted to the whole cohort, but there could be residual selection bias.[13] Since ACT is population-based with high completeness of follow-up, this allows for greater confidence in generalizability of findings, however, compared with convenience samples that require autopsy for participation. Limitations in using autopsy data to approximate A, T, and (N) are also relevant. We used neuritic plaque assessments rather than a more general assessment of amyloid beta plaque distribution that might correlate more closely with current biomarker strategies. Our A measurement is not directly comparable to neuroimaging or CSF biomarkers. Our measure of T is Braak stage, which is approximated by current T biomarker strategies. It should also be noted that our assessment of tau pathology utilized two different antibodies as diagnostic recommendations changed over time. Both antibodies (Tau-2 and AT8) prominently highlight neurofibrillary tangles, while AT8 is more sensitive for additional tau pathologies.[24, 25] Concomitant Bielschowsky silver stains have always been performed in addition to tau immunostains for confirmation of tangle pathology in relevant tissue sections providing added consistency across the cohort with respect to Braak staging. Also, our measure of (N) is an assessment of cerebral white matter loss that occurs secondarily in AD but also can occur in other neurodegenerative conditions such as VBI. We considered several operational definitions for (N), and sensitivity analyses of the distribution of approximated AT(N) profiles using measures of hippocampal and temporal atrophy did not vary significantly (Table S5 in supporting information). Results may have varied with other approximations.

It should also be appreciated that the nomenclature of A−, T−, or (N−) does not mean the complete absence of amyloid, tau, or neurodegeneration. Each amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration measure, whether based on fluid or imaging biomarkers, or the approximation of the AT(N) framework from neuropathology data we report on here, applies specific thresholds to define a low category vs. a high category, such as A− vs. A+ for amyloid. An amyloid PET-based definition of the A parameter that assigned an individual to A− status would not imply that there was zero amyloid on the PET scan, but rather that the level of cerebral amyloidosis was lower than the critical threshold that defined A+. In the same way, for our approximation, A− refers to either none or sparse CERAD levels. Certainly people with a sparse CERAD rating have cerebral amyloidosis, but just as for people with sub-critical levels of amyloid on an amyloid PET scan, that level of cerebral amyloidosis is postulated to be lower risk. The minus signs should not be thought to indicate the complete absence of the corresponding factor, but rather sub-threshold levels of the corresponding factor.

We made the simplifying assumption that AT(N) profile would change slowly if at all in the five years ante mortem. There are neuropathological changes we did not consider, most notably TDP-43 proteinopathy. TDP-43 has gained recognition as a common comorbid pathology with strong correlations to disease severity. [26,27] Currently there are no accepted and reliable ante mortem assessment methods for TDP-43 proteinopathy, Lewy bodies, microinfarcts, and other findings (i.e., X in the ATX(N) nomenclature); this will be an important focus of future research. The participants in this phase of the ACT study were not characterized for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), so we could not draw conclusions on impairment that did not rise to the level of dementia. The ACT study’s ethnic diversity resembles that of older adults in King County. While there are reasons to suspect the AT(N) framework may work less well among ethnic minorities, [28] we have limited ability to comment on this. Our estimates of cost were based on published data. Economies of scale could result in some cost savings if there was universal rollout of a lumbar puncture or imaging-based AT(N) screening program.

The AT(N) research framework has engendered robust discussion in the research community. [29] Here, we add findings from a community-based cohort. Our work indicates that a substantial proportion of nondemented older individuals could have high degrees of amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration but not develop dementia during life. Our findings reinforce the critical need to identify those most likely to benefit from enrollment in clinical secondary prevention trials.[10] Our results also reinforce the need for improved tools for prediction beyond current AT(N) biomarkers. These tools may come from the ATX(N) approach to include biomarkers still to be developed, such as biomarkers for Lewy body disease, vascular brain injury, and TDP-43 proteinopathy. Detection rules may also benefit from additional modalities which could include cognitive testing, subjective cognitive change, sensory processing changes, and/or physical changes. Clearly late life dementia and AD involve multiple complex processes. Sorting these out will be challenging, especially if the aim is to target persons most likely to benefit from prevention efforts.

2. Consolidated Results and Study Design

2.1 Adult Changes in Thought study

We used the Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPW) / University of Washington (UW) Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. AT(N) profiles were approximated using neuropathology correlates of fluid and imaging biomarkers for amyloidosis, tauopathy and neurodegeneration in participants autopsied by October 2017. All ACT participants are evaluated at 2-year intervals to identify incident dementia using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI). Diagnoses of incident dementia [17] were made using standard research criteria. Dementia-free participants continued with scheduled follow-up.

2.2 Amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration

ACT autopsies follow NIA guidelines.[30,31] Associations between biomarker findings and gold standard neuropathology findings are detailed in the Jack et al. NIA-AA Framework paper.[8] Amyloid in neuritic plaques were scored according to Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) criteria.[32,33] We used CERAD levels of moderate or frequent to approximate A+, and none to sparse to approximate A− (Figure 1). Tau-associated neurofibrillary degeneration was scored according to Braak and Braak.[34,35] Braak stage 0-III to approximated T−, and stages IV-VI approximated T+ (Figure 1). Neurodegeneration was determined by lateral ventricle enlargement, which was assessed by measuring maximal cross-section of lateral ventricles following coronal section at the temporal poles, similar to common practice in interpreting brain images by CT or MRI.[13,36–39] We used any value &gt;0 cm to approximate (N+) and 0 cm to approximate (N−) (Figure 1).

2.3 Samples

We analyzed two samples. First, we considered the entire autopsy cohort. This sample comprises the prevalence dataset. For people without dementia, a study visit confirming no dementia occurred within two years of death. We determined the distribution of decedents in each approximated AT(N) profile and evaluated dementia prevalence at death. We used inverse probability weighting to address potential selection bias into the autopsy sample.[13]

To evaluate incident dementia, we considered participants free of dementia at least 5 years before death. This sample comprises the ante mortem dataset. Models of secondary prevention trials with dementia as a clinical primary outcome require follow-up of at least 5 years.[14] While progression for each biomarker is unknown, these processes are likely relatively stable, so we assumed approximated AT(N) profiles at death were the same as 5 years ante mortem.[40] We determined the proportion of participants who developed incident dementia in the last five years of life by approximated AT(N) profile using inverse probability weighting.

2.4 Imaging-based screening for secondary prevention trials of dementia

Imaging-based ante mortem AT(N) characterization requires MRI plus PET scanning. We estimated the dementia-free U.S. population age 70–79 and 80–89 based on U.S. Census data [41] and Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures.[42] Ability to attend screening was based on the proportion of ACT participants in the ante mortem dataset whose visit 5 years ante mortem occurred in our research clinic. The median age at that visit was 85 years, so age 80–89 years was our primary analysis and 70–79 was our secondary analysis. One common strategy is to enroll based on amyloid positivity alone, regardless of tau or neurodegeneration. We evaluated costs for this scenario, plus two additional scenarios: enrolling based on both amyloid and tau positivity, and enrolling based on amyloid positivity plus either tau or neurodegeneration. We assumed costs of $4500 each for amyloid and tau PET scans and $1000 for an MRI.[43–45] Costs were estimated for a hypothetical 1000-person trial testing a therapy with 25% efficacy and 1:1 allocation ratio.

2.5 Prevalence dataset

In the prevalence dataset (n=603), 315 people met our criteria for A+ (52%), 312 met our criteria for T+ (49%), and 432 met our criteria for (N)+ (70%) (Table 2). A+T+(N)+ was the most common profile (31%), followed by A−T−(N)+ (22%). Weighted prevalence of dementia at death ranged from 14% for A−T−(N)− to 79% for A+T+(N)+. Approximately 18% of participants estimated to have biomarker-based AD (A+T+) were dementia free at death. A graphical representation is shown in Figure 2.

2.6 Ante mortem dataset

In the ante mortem dataset (n=398), weighted proportions who met our criteria for A+ (44%), T+ (42%), and (N)+ (66%) were similar to the prevalence dataset (Table 1). A−T−(N)+ was the most common profile (27%), followed by A+T+(N)+ (21%). Weighted 5-year incident dementia ranged from 8% for A+T−(N)− to 67% for A+T+(N)+ and 68% for A+T+(N)−. For participants estimated to have biomarker-based AD, more than 30% remained dementia-free until death. A graphical representation is shown in Figure 2.

2.7 Imaging-based screening for secondary prevention trials of dementia (age 80–89)

There were 9.3 million people in the U.S. in 2010 ages 80–89. Of these, an estimated 7.2 million were free of dementia, and nearly 3.9 million (54%) of these might be able to have AD biomarkers characterized. We estimate that 40% of the scanned population would be amyloid positive, so 1.5 million people could be eligible for a trial.

In the first scenario, candidates are enrolled based on amyloid positivity only. At $4500 per scan, costs would total $11.3 million per 1000 A+ individuals identified (Figure 3). Of those, we anticipate that nearly 52% would develop dementia in the next five years without treatment. For a therapy with 25% efficacy, we would need to treat 7.8 people per dementia case prevented. Screening costs to characterize amyloid for a hypothetical 1000-person trial total $177,000 per case prevented. The second scenario performs both amyloid and tau scans to enroll A+T+ candidates. At $9000 for both scans, this strategy would cost $29.8 million per 1000 A+T+ individuals identified (Figure 3). For a therapy with 25% efficacy, we would need to treat 6.3 people per dementia case prevented. Screening costs for a hypothetical 1000-person trial total $378,000 per case prevented. The third scenario performs amyloid and tau scans along with MRI to enroll people who are A+ and either T+ or N+. At $10,000 for all three scans, this strategy would cost $30.6 million per 1000 individuals identified (Figure 3). For a therapy with 25% efficacy, we would need to treat 6.4 people per dementia case prevented. Screening costs for a hypothetical 1000-person trial total $392,000 per case prevented.

3. Detailed Methods and Results

3.1 Study design

ACT initially included 2581 randomly selected dementia-free members of a healthcare system in Washington State. Participants were ≥65 years old at enrollment from 1994–1996. An additional 811 participants were enrolled in 2000–2003. In 2005 the study began enrollment of 10 to 15 participants monthly. ACT methods have been published.[46] ACT uses the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI; range 0–100); higher scores indicate better functioning.[16] Scores ≤85 prompted clinical and psychometric evaluation. The results of these evaluations, laboratory and imaging records were reviewed in a consensus conference. Diagnoses of incident probable or possible Alzheimer’s disease[18] and dementia[17] were made using standard research criteria. We assumed dementia was irreversible. We used t-tests or chi squared tests to compare characteristics by autopsy and dementia status at death. Since ACT visits occur every two years, we evaluated clinical characteristics at the visit preceding 5 years ante mortem (up to 7 years ante mortem).

Study procedures were approved by KPW and UW institutional review boards. Participants provided written informed consent. The first two and last two authors vouch for study accuracy and data and analysis completeness.

3.2 Neuropathology procedures

ACT Neuropathology workup has been published.[21, 47] Neuropathology examinations were performed in the UW Division of Neuropathology and the UW Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) Neuropathology Core. All assessments were performed blind to clinical diagnosis. Brains were immersion-fixed in formalin ≥2 weeks before dissection and evaluated wholly and after coronal sectioning for gross lesions.

Tissue sections were dissected from middle frontal gyrus, superior and middle temporal gyri, inferior parietal lobule, anterior cingulate gyrus, primary visual cortex, basal ganglia at the anterior commissure, thalamus, hippocampus at the level of the uncus and lateral geniculate nucleus, amygdala, midbrain including substantia nigra, pons at the level of the locus ceruleus, medulla, cerebellar hemisphere, and pituitary gland. These tissue sections were processed and embedded in paraffin prior to sectioning and staining.

3.3 Other neuropathological findings

Measurement methods have been described.[21, 26, 48] We noted presence or absence of six additional pathological findings: (1) cortical or deep microinfarcts (≥2 vs. ≤1), (2) macroscopic cystic infarcts (any vs. none), (3) atherosclerosis (moderate/severe vs. none/mild), (4) amyloid angiopathy (moderate/severe vs. none/mild), (5) neocortical Lewy bodies (any vs. none), and (6) hippocampal sclerosis (any vs. none).

We used Poisson regression with robust error variances to evaluate associations between dementia and the six pathological findings for the prevalence and ante mortem datasets. We first evaluated amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration as independent dementia predictors. We then added the six additional neuropathological findings. We controlled all models for age at death, sex, white race vs. any other race, ≤12 vs. ≥13 years of education, and enrollment cohort.

3.4 Inverse probability weighting

We used logistic regression to evaluate predictors of autopsy in both datasets. We considered health, demographic, and study-related factors, including dementia, as independent predictors of autopsy (Methods 1 in supporting information). Although the approximated AT(N) profiles were similar regardless of weights, dementia proportions were generally greater in the unweighted results (Tables S1 and S2 in supporting information). This is consistent with the theoretical risk of selection bias from participants consenting to autopsy after receiving a dementia diagnosis, so we present weighted results for approximated AT(N) profiles and dementia status. Weighted and unweighted results from Poisson regression models of non-AT(N) neuropathologic changes and dementia status were nearly identical, so we present unweighted results for simplicity.

3.5 Screening for secondary prevention trials of dementia

Costs were estimated for hypothetical 1000-person clinical trials using a therapy with 25% efficacy and 1:1 allocation ratio of treatment and placebo. Imaging and CSF-based approaches were evaluated separately. We assumed imaging screening costs of $4500 each for amyloid and tau PET scans and $1000 for an MRI.[41–43] We assumed costs of $600 each for a lumbar puncture with CSF amyloid and tau immunoassays.[43] For a CSF-based strategy, we used data from a Johns Hopkins University lumbar puncture clinic to estimate success rates.[40] To estimate the number needed to screen, we divided 1000 by the age category-specific percent of ACT participants identified with the biomarker(s) of interest for each scenario. Costs per 1000 individuals identified were estimated by multiplying screening costs times the number needed to screen. The number needed to treat was calculated by taking the inverse of the absolute risk reduction, the age category-specific difference in dementia incidence between treatment and placebo. Screening costs per dementia case prevented were estimated by dividing the total screening costs per 1000 individuals identified with the biomarkers of interest by the number of cases prevented in the 500-person treatment arm.

3.6 Results

As of October 2017, there were 2870 deaths among 5236 ACT participants (54.8%). Of these, 2210 (77% of deaths) had a dementia diagnosis or a study visit confirming no dementia within two years of death. Of that group, 603 had an autopsy with complete amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration data (27%). Of these, 398 (66% of those with an autopsy and 18% of the 2210 target cohort) were dementia-free 5 years before death. Demographic and clinical characteristics of decedents by autopsy status are shown in Table 2.

3.7 Other neuropathological findings

Among all participants, more than 80% of those on the Alzheimer’s continuum had significant additional pathological findings. Atherosclerosis was the most common, followed by cortical or deep microinfarcts and macroscopic cystic infarcts. Across all approximated AT(N) profiles, people with prevalent dementia (Figure S1 in supporting information) and those who were diagnosed with dementia 5 ante mortem (Figure S2 in supporting information) generally had more non-AT(N) neuropathologic findings compared to people without dementia. In the prevalence dataset, neocortical Lewy bodies (relative risk [RR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15–1.67) and macroscopic cystic infarcts (RR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.17–1.56) were the strongest predictors of dementia independent of amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration (Table 3). In the ante mortem dataset, macroscopic cystic infarcts (RR 1.45, 95% CI: 1.17–1.78), neocortical Lewy bodies (RR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.05–1.92) and cortical or deep microinfarcts (RR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06–1.61) were the strongest predictors independent of amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration (Table 3).

3.8 CSF-based screening for secondary prevention trials of dementia (age 80–89)

There were 9.3 million people in the U.S. in 2010 ages 80–89. Of these, an estimated 7.2 million were free of dementia, and nearly 3.4 million (47%) of these might be able to have AD biomarkers characterized. We estimate that 40% of the scanned population would be amyloid positive, so 1.3 million people could be eligible for a trial.

Costs for hypothetical 1000-person clinical trials using a therapy with 25% efficacy were estimated for three scenarios. In the first scenario, candidates are enrolled based on amyloid positivity only. At $600 per amyloid assay, screening costs total $1.5 million per 1000 A+ individuals identified (Figure S3 in supporting information). We would need to treat 7.8 people per dementia case prevented, and screening costs total $23,000 per case prevented. The second scenario characterizes both amyloid and tau to enroll A+T+ candidates. At $1200 for amyloid and tau assays, this strategy would cost $3.9 million per 1000 A+T+ individuals identified (Figure S3). We would need to treat 6.3 people per dementia case prevented, and screening costs total $50,000 per case prevented. The third scenario characterizes amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration to enroll candidates who are A+ and either T+ or (N)+. At $2200 for amyloid and tau assays along with MRI, this strategy would cost $6.7 million per 1000 individuals identified (Figure S3). We would need to treat 6.4 people per dementia case prevented, and screening costs total $86,000 per case prevented.

3.9 Imaging-based screening for secondary prevention trials of dementia (age 70–79)

There were nearly 16.6 million people in the U.S. in 2010 ages 70–79. Of these, an estimated 15.1 million were free of dementia, and 11.5 million (77%) of these might be able to have AD biomarkers characterized. We estimate that 44% of the scanned population would be amyloid positive, so 5.1 million people could be eligible for a trial.

Costs for hypothetical 1000-person clinical trials using a therapy with 25% efficacy were estimated. In the first scenario, candidates are enrolled based on amyloid positivity only. At $4500 per amyloid scan, screening costs total $10.2 million per, 000 A+ individuals identified (Figure S4 in supporting information). We would need to treat 8.6 people per dementia case prevented, and screening costs total $176,000 per case prevented. The second scenario characterizes both amyloid and tau to enroll A+T+ candidates. At $9000 for amyloid and tau scans, this strategy would cost $35.7 million per 1000 A+T+ individuals identified (Figure S4). We would need to treat 5.7 people per dementia case prevented, and screening costs total $411,000 per case prevented. The third scenario characterizes amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration to enroll candidates who are A+ and either T+ or (N)+. At $10,000 for amyloid and tau scans along with MRI, this strategy would cost $31.8 million per 1000 individuals identified (Figure S4). We would need to treat 6.4 people per dementia case prevented, and screening costs total $408,000 per case prevented.

3.10 CSF-based screening for secondary prevention trials of dementia (age 70–79)

There were nearly 16.6 million people in the U.S. in 2010 ages 70–79. Of these, an estimated 15.1 million were free of dementia, and 10.1 million (67%) of these might be able to have AD biomarkers characterized. We estimate that 44% of the scanned population would be amyloid positive, so 4.4 million people could be eligible for a trial.

Costs for hypothetical 1000-person clinical trials using a therapy with 25% efficacy were estimated. In the first scenario, candidates are enrolled based on amyloid positivity only. At $600 per amyloid assay, screening costs total $1.3 million per 1000 A+ individuals identified (Figure S5 in supporting information). We would need to treat 8.6 people per dementia case prevented, and screening costs total $23,000 per case prevented. The second scenario characterizes both amyloid and tau to enroll A+T+ candidates. At $1200 for amyloid and tau assays, this strategy would cost $4.7 million per 1000 A+T+ individuals identified (Figure S5). We would need to treat 5.7 people per dementia case prevented, and screening costs total $55,000 per case prevented. The third scenario characterizes amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration to enroll candidates who are A+ and either T+ or (N)+. At $2200 for amyloid and tau assays along with MRI, this strategy would cost $7.0 million per 1000 individuals identified (Figure S5). We would need to treat 6.4 people per dementia case prevented, and screening costs total $90,000 per case prevented.

3.11 Ante mortem sensitivity analysis

As a sensitivity analysis we repeated these analyses with a shorter window (3 years ante mortem). With that shorter ante mortem window, weighted proportions in each approximated AT(N) category were similar (Table S3 in supporting information). Three-year dementia diagnoses were lower in each category, reflecting shorter follow-up.

* A+ shows Bielschowsky silver staining of amyloid-laden neuritic plaques in cerebral cortex from an 85-year-old man who died without dementia. CERAD assessments were made using Bielschowsky silver stains.

† T+ shows extensive paired helical filament (PHF)-tau antibody staining throughout hippocampus, showing a Braak stage at least IV, from an 87-year-old man who died without dementia. Braak stages were assessed using antibodies to hyperphosphorylated tau (Tau2 historically (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich)) and AT8 (1;1000, ThermoFisher) more recently, with a period of time where both stains were deployed and significant differences in Braak stages were not identified.

‡ (N)+ shows lateral ventricular enlargement at the level of the temporal tips from an 87-year-old man who died without dementia.

§ A− shows sparse neuritic plaques in cerebral cortex from a 96-year-old man who died with dementia.

¶ T− shows rare neurofibrillary tangles in CA1 and subiculum of the hippocampus, equating to a Braak stage of III, from a 91-year-old man who died with dementia.

# (N)− shows lack of lateral ventricular enlargement from an 88-year-old woman who died with dementia.

* AT(N) profiles were approximated using neuropathology correlates of biomarkers at autopsy. A was approximated using CERAD level (A− = none/sparse, A+ = moderate/frequent), T was approximated using Braak stage (T− = 0-III, T+ = IV-VI), and (N) was approximated by the absence (N)− vs. presence (N)+ of lateral ventricular dilation at the level of the temporal tip.

† Dementia-free status was confirmed &lt;2 years prior to death in dementia-free participants.

‡ NINCDS-ADRDA= National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA) criteria for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Note: We did not exclude people with rare findings at autopsy such as fronto-temporal dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies, since we were considering the possible performance of AT(N) strategies as a screening tool among people without dementia, which will include a small number of people who will go on to develop rare forms of dementia
