Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) catalyzes the cleavage of sphingomyelin to phosphorylcholine and ceramide, an essential step in the formation and release of exosomes from cells that is critical for intracellular communication. Chronic increase of brain nSMase2 activity and related exosome release have been implicated in various pathological processes, including the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), making nSMase2 a viable therapeutic target. Recently, we identified phenyl (R)-(1-(3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2,6-dimethylimidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-8-yl)-pyrrolidin-3-yl)carbamate 1 (PDDC), the first nSMase2 inhibitor that possesses both favorable pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, including substantial oral bioavailability, brain penetration, and significant inhibition of exosome release from the brain in vivo. Herein we demonstrate the efficacy of 1 (PDDC) in a mouse model of AD and detail extensive structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies with 70 analogues, unveiling several that exert similar or higher activity against nSMase2 with favorable pharmacokinetic properties.

Graphical Abstract


INTRODUCTION

Exosomes are extracellular vehicles (EVs) that are involved in intracellular communication through the trafficking of protein, lipid, and genetic material in both physiological and pathological processes.1–3 Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) is a phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) to phosphorylcholine and ceramide; nSMase2 is an important regulator of exosome biogenesis by controlling the availability of ceramide, a pivotal component of exosomal membrane architecture.4 Although transient increases in nSMase2 activity are part of normal physiological processes, chronic increases in nSMase2 activity result in exosome dysfunction.5 There are a number of diseases that have been associated with increases in nSMase2 activity and/or exosome dysfunction, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD),1,6–9 HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND),10–14 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),15 and metastatic cancer.16,17 Moreover, by use of a variety of animal models by independent investigators, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of nSMase2 has been shown to reduce exosome secretion.6–8,18 As a result, there has been an interest in identifying nSMase2 inhibitors that could be used for the treatment of these diseases.19,20 To date, nSMase2 inhibitors have shown poor drug-like properties that have prevented their advancement into clinical development; they exhibit high molecular weight, potencies at the μM level, poor aqueous solubility, metabolic stability, bioavailability, and/or brain penetration.19,20 Recently, after a high throughput screen for nSMase2 inhibitors and subsequent hit optimization we identified phenyl (R)-(1-(3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2,6-dimethylimidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-8-yl)pyrrolidin-3-yl)carbamate 1 (PDDC), a new, potent (IC50 = 300 nM) nSMase2 inhibitor that inhibits exosome secretion in vitro and shows brain penetration, inhibition of exosome secretion from brain, and target engagement in an acute in vivo model of inflammation.21 In the present work, we extend our previous findings through a systematic and extensive SAR effort around 1 (PDDC) in order to improve on potency of inhibition while maintaining the compound’s metabolic stability. Further, we follow up on the ability of 1 (PDDC), as representative of this chemical series, to show efficacy in reversing cognitive impairment in a chronic model of AD.

RESULTS

Chemistry.

The most critical part of the present study is the detailed SAR reported on a newly identified nSMase inhibitor termed 1 (PDDC), which has been identified by our team originally via high-throughput screening of human nSMase2.21 The original screening hit compounds 3 and 4 differed only in the configuration of their chiral center (Figure 1). Despite the fact that these compounds are related to our phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KB) inhibitors reported recently (e.g., compound 2),22–24 they are devoid of the kinase activity due to the bulky pyrrolidine ring and lack of essential hydrogen bond donor that prohibit interaction with the hinge region of the kinase (Figure 1). In addition, the compounds do not exert inhibition of other PI4Ks or cytotoxicity (Figure 1, Supporting Information Table S3). Since 3 was the more active against nSMase2 in comparison with its enantiomer 4, our further explorations were focused on this enantiomer and its derivatives.

Here, we report extensive and systematic modifications prepared within our SAR exploration. This series of 70 compounds can be divided into several groups. Initially, we modified the central core of the molecule (Figure 1, in blue). Second, we studied the influence of southern moiety modifications (Figure 1, in red). Next, we focused on modification of the northern part of the molecule (Figure 1, in green). Finally, we explored the effect of the removal of methyl substituents of the central core. For the AD mice studies, we selected compound 1 (PDDC) as a tool inhibitor. Our SAR study has, however, unveiled several other derivatives that share similar or even higher potency against human nSMase 2 with similar metabolic stability. These compounds can be regarded as potential candidates for selection of a lead structure for clinical development.

Synthesis of the Compounds with Modified Central Core.

The central imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine core was substituted by several bicyclic heterocycles including purine (6), furo[3,2-b]pyridine (7), thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine (8), thieno[3,4-d]pyrimidine(9) following the procedures depicted in Schemes 1–4.

The purine derivative 6 was prepared from compound 10, following a reported procedure.25 Initially, the pyrrolidine side chain protected by Boc group was installed onto the purine moiety by nucleophilic displacement of chlorine atom at position 6. Subsequently, the Boc group was substituted by the acetyl group (Scheme 1).

The synthesis of furane containing bicyclic heterocycle 7 started by methylation of 2,4-dibromo-6-methylpyridin-3-ol 13 followed by Sonogashira coupling. The crucial cyclization–iodination step, which was promoted by iodine monochloride, yielded iodinated derivative 16 used in the following cross-coupling reaction with 3,4-dimethoxyphenylboronic acid to give compound 17. Finally, we introduced the northern part of the molecule by nucleophilic substitution of bromine atom to obtain the final derivative 7 (Scheme 2). Regioselectivity of Sonogashira reaction (formation of compound 15) was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. In the ROESY spectrum of compound 7, cross-peaks between H-6 on the central core and 2′-CH2 and 5′-CH2 groups on pyrrolidine ring corresponding to their through-space interaction have been found.

Bromination of compound 18 and subsequent Suzuki cross coupling were also the initial steps in the synthesis of thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine derivative 8 (Scheme 3). Removing of the protecting methyl groups from compound 20 and successful chlorination were essential for installing the pyrrolidine part of the molecule, leading to derivative 23. The target compound 8 was then synthesized by palladium-catalyzed introduction of a methyl group utilizing DABAL-Me3 as the methyl group source.

Finally, the thieno[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivative 9 was gained by consecutive bromination and amination of compound 24 followed by two cross-coupling reaction steps leading to introduction of 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl and methyl groups, respectively.

Synthesis of the Compounds with Southern Part Modified.

We have used a modular approach starting from compound 31(R) for preparation of the most derivatives modified in the southern part of the molecule with imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine core, which was synthesized as depicted in Scheme 5. Dichloroderivative 28 was used as a starting material.22 Halogen atom in position 8 was replaced by (R)-N-(pyrrolidin-3-yl)acetamide (11(R)) to give derivative 29(R). Second chlorine atom in position 6 was then converted to a methyl by treatment with trimethylaluminum–DABCO complex to afford compound 30(R), which was in the last step iodinated by NIS in dichloromethane. Compound 31(R) served as a starting material for synthesis of majority of the final compounds. The opposite enantiomer 31(S) was obtained in the same way using (R)-N-(pyrrolidin-3-yl)acetamide (12(S)).

Alternative starting material 33 bearing chlorine in position 6 and iodine in position 3 was prepared from derivative 3222 using same conditions as in the preparation of 29(R).

The southern position was modified by either Suzuki or Stille coupling. Method A utilizing appropriate boronic acids was used for preparation of compounds 3, 34–42, and 46–48. In contrast, the compounds 43–45 were obtained by cross-coupling reaction with stannane derivatives (Scheme 6). The Suzuki reaction was also applied to preparation of the chloro derivative 49 (Scheme 7).

Synthesis of the Compounds with Modified Northern Part.

Compound 4, which can be regarded as the closest modification of the northern part of the molecule, was prepared in the same way as the main hit 3 using the pyrrolidine 31(S) with the opposite chiral center (see above). The crucial intermediate for synthesis of most of the derivatives with modified northern moiety was obtained by removing the acetyl group from compound 3 under acidic conditions. Four different modifications have been selected, acyl derivatives (51–57), ureas (58 and 59), carbamates (1 and 60–63), and sulfonyl derivatives (65–76), which have been easily accessible by reaction of hydrochloride 50 with various acyl chlorides (or HATU coupling agent and carboxylic acids), isocyanates, carbamates, and sulfonyl chlorides, respectively, under the basic conditions. Compounds 61–63 were prepared by a slightly modified method. First, p-nitrophenylcarbamate was prepared, and this intermediate was immediately treated with appropriate alcohol or phenol (Scheme 8). The opposite enantiomer 1(S) was prepared in the same manner as the lead compound 1 (PDDC). In brief, this reaction sequence started from 31(S) by the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction, which afforded compound 4, followed by removal of acetyl group and subsequent reaction with phenyl chloroformate to give the desired compound 1(S) (Table 1).

We have also tried to substitute the 3-aminopyrrolidine motive by various other cyclic and acyclic amines as shown in Scheme 8. We focused mostly on pyrrolidine analogues due to the extensive activity of compound 76c in our preliminary experiments. The synthesis started by substitution of chlorine atom in position 8 under SNAr conditions (DIPEA, CH3CN, or ethanol). Dimethoxyphenyl substituent was then introduced to position 3 by Suzuki coupling, which was followed by methylation using trimethylaluminum–DABCO complex as a methylation reagent.

Further modifications on pyrrolidine ring were achieved under Mitsunobu conditions applied on the hydroxy derivative 83 (Scheme 9). We prepared S-acetyl derivative 85 and azido compound 86 using this methodology. Huisgen cycloaddition of the azido compound 86 with phenylacetylene afforded triazolo derivative 87 under the standard conditions (copper sulfate/sodium ascorbate). Morpholino derivative 88 was prepared by closing the morpholino ring on the amino group of 50 using bis 2,2′-dichloroethyl ether. Acetylation (Ac2O) of the hydroxy group in compound 82 yielded O-acetyl derivative 89.

We prepared two more piperidine-based derivatives starting from Boc-protected analogue 90, which was converted to cyclohexanoyl and acetyl derivatives 91 and 92, respectively.

Finally, we have tried to remove, successively, the methyl substituents on the central core. Compound 93 was obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of the compound 49. Compound 98 with no substituent in position 2 was prepared by following the synthetic route described in Scheme 10. First, chlorine in position 8 in compound 95 (prepared by condensation of 94 with aq chloroacetaldehyde) was replaced by (R)-N-(pyrrolidin-3-yl)acetamide and the obtained substrate 96 was then converted to the chloro intermediate 97 by Suzuki coupling. Position 6 was then methylated with trimethylaluminum–DABCO complex in a similar fashion as previously. Finally, the derivative 99 was obtained by hydrogenation of compound 97.

Novel Inhibitors of Human nSMase2.

We used the fluorescence-based assay described previously to characterize the potency of this series of inhibitors in vitro.26 The inhibitory potencies of the compounds ranged from completely inactive derivatives (e.g., derivative 6) to highly active inhibitors with nanomolar potencies (e.g., compound 66) (Table 1).

Further characterization of the selected derivatives was performed using in vitro metabolic stability assays in both mice and human microsomes using the assays previously described.27 These data are summarized in Table 1.

1 (PDDC) Pharmacokinetics in 5XFAD Mice.

The pharmacokinetic profile of 1 (PDDC) was previously reported by our group in normal mice.21 These studies were repeated in 5XFAD mice harboring presenilin and amyloid mutations related to familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD), and it was confirmed that there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics in 5XFAD mice versus normal mice. Moreover, the studies were conducted using the intraperitoneal (ip) route of administration to ensure sufficient brain exposures were achieved for efficacy studies. Aged 11-month hemizygous 5XFAD mice received an ip dose of 10 mg/kg 1 (PDDC) and were sacrificed at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 h postdose (Figure 2A). 1 (PDDC) exhibited excellent pharmacokinetics, with the plasma Cmax and AUC0–t of 7.70 ± 0.75 nmol/mL and 22.1 ± 1.33 h·nmol/mL, respectively, whereas the brain Cmax and AUC0–t were 3.89 ± 0.75 and 13.0 ± 0.94 h·nmol/mL, respectively. The AUCbrain:AUCplasma ratio of 0.6 showed modest brain penetration (Figure 2B) and is similar to that described in wild type mice.

1 (PDDC) Effect on Weight Changes and Fear Conditioning in 5XFAD Mice.

We evaluated body weight and fear conditioning in hemizygous 5XFAD mice and littermate wild type (WT) mice that received daily vehicle or 1 (PDDC) (10 mg/kg ip daily for 5 months). WT mice gained approximately 20% body weight throughout the study. As compared to WT mice, 5XFAD mice treated with vehicle (two-way ANOVA P &lt; 0.001) or 1 (PDDC) (two-way ANOVA P &lt; 0.05) gained significantly less body weight, but 5XFAD mice treated with 1 (PDDC) gained significantly more weight than 5XFAD + vehicle mice (two-way ANOVA P &lt; 0.05, Figure 3).

Fear conditioning tests conducted at 8 months of age demonstrated equivalent freezing behaviors between groups on the first day of testing, when mice are trained to associate the conditioned stimulus (CS) tone with the unconditioned stimulus (US) footshock (Figure 4A). On the second day of testing, significant impairments in contextual fear memory were measured in 5XFAD mice versus WT mice (P &lt; 0.01, Figure 4B). 5XFAD mice treated daily for 5 months with 1 (PDDC), however, performed like WT mice and froze at significantly higher levels than 5XFAD + vehicle mice (P &lt; 0.05), indicating improvements in memory. Cued fear memory measured by freezing behavior in response to the CS was measured on the third day of testing (Figure 4C). Trend reductions in freezing behavior were observed in 5XFAD mice treated with vehicle versus WT mice during both the acclimation period and the CS presentation. 5XFAD mice treated with 1 (PDDC) froze significantly more than 5XFAD + vehicle mice during CS presentation (P &lt; 0.05), demonstrating improved fear memory. Male and female mice were utilized, and two-way ANOVA to measure the effects of sex on test performance revealed no within-group differences between males and females, with the exception of the 5XFAD + vehicle mice on the 100–200 s bin on the second day of testing. Although both male and female 5XFAD + vehicle mice displayed significantly worse contextual memory versus WT + vehicle controls (P &lt; 0.01), male 5XFAD + vehicle mice experienced a more significant decrease in memory performance versus female counterparts (P &lt; 0.01).

DISCUSSION

The hydrolase nSMase2 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with release of extracellular vesicles from cells. One major obstacle in the validation of nSMase2 as a pharmacological target has been the lack of drug-like inhibitors. Prototype inhibitors exhibiting IC50 &gt; 1 μM (GW4869 and cambinol), are insoluble (GW4869), have molecular weight of &gt;500 (GW4869), or exhibit poor metabolic stability (cambinol).26,28 Moreover, neither GW4869 nor cambinol has been amenable to improvement through structural modifications.26

Through high throughput screening and subsequent hit optimization we have recently identified PDDC, a selective, noncompetitive nSMase2 inhibitor with IC50 of 0.3 μM. PDDC is metabolically stable, orally available, penetrates the brain, and was shown to be an inhibitor of extracellular vesicle release from astrocytes and from brain in an acute model of inflammation.21 However, the compound does not exert a significant inhibition of the catalytic domain of nSMase2 expressed in E. coli (data not shown), which might be attributed to the transmembrane character of the protein. In the present study we advance our work with the PDDC chemical series in two significant ways. First, we carried out a systematic, extensive SAR to improve PDDC’s inhibitory potency while maintaining metabolic stability, and second, using PDDC as representative of the chemical series, we demonstrate it is efficacious in a chronic model of AD.

SAR Studies Identified nSMAse2 Inhibitors That Are 3- to 4-Fold More Potent than PDDC.

We found that the central core of PDDC must be conserved to maintain activity. Apart from compounds based on imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine scaffold, none of the alternative central cores examined exerted significant activity against nSMase2. Therefore, subsequent structural modifications of the northern and southern moieties retained the imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine moiety.

Our data show that the southern moiety plays a critical role in inhibitory activity. Complete removal of the southern moiety led to a significant drop of activity by almost 1 order of magnitude (compound 30(R) IC50 = 7.5 μM). The activity of compounds bearing an aromatic moiety at this position ranged from 0.2 μM (e.g., compound 47) to 2.5 μM (compound 37). The most active derivatives contained the phenyl group substituted at the para position such as compounds 40 and 47 with methylthio or trifluoromethoxy group, respectively.

We also investigated the impact of substituents in the northern part of the structure. Among the derivatives bearing amide or urea moiety attached to the pyrrolidine, compounds 53, 55, 56, and 59 exhibited IC50 &lt; 0.3 μM. In contrast, all the carbamate derivatives (1 and 60–63) stayed at the 0.3 μM inhibitory potency level. Moreover, a number of sulfonamides derived from the amine derivative 50 showed improvement of inhibitory activity against nSMase2. Surprisingly, complete removal of pyrrolidine substituent led to the most active compound in the series: compound 76c. Further expansion of the ring using morpholine instead of pyrrolidine ring led to a significant drop of activity by 2 orders of magnitude (compound 77c). Any further substitution on the pyrrolidine ring at position 3 did not lead to higher inhibitory activity except compounds 85 and 87 displaying the 0.3 μM level of activity. In addition to inhibitory activity, the substituent on the pyrrolidine ring seems to regulate selectivity. We routinely carry out a counterscreening assay that utilizes the coupling enzymes including alkaline phosphatase, choline oxidase, and horseradish peroxidase without nSMase2. Alkaline phosphatase, being a phosphodiesterase like nSMase2, provides initial selectivity data within the phosphodiesterase family of enzymes (Table S2). Thus, we can tell, for example, compound 1 is over 300-fold more selective for nSMase2 vs alkaline phosphatase than compound 60 which exhibits similar potency but is 60-fold more selective. Finally, removal of methyl substituent from the central core led either to the comparable inhibitory potency as in the hit compounds, as in case of derivative 98, or to a significant drop of activity, compounds 93 and 99. SAR results are summarized in Figure 5.

In summary, the aromatic central core is crucial to observe nSMase2 inhibition while a wide range of substitutions on the northern and southern moieties are tolerated. PDDC is a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to sphingomyelin21 while its potency of inhibition is reduced with increasing concentrations of phosphatidyl serine, suggesting it binds to one of two hydrophobic segments on the N-terminus of the protein (data not shown). Even though the crystal structure of nSMase2 containing these segments is not available, the SAR evidence suggests the aromatic central core defines the major discriminating interaction with the enzyme; this interaction can be further enhanced or diminished through electron donating/withdrawing effects or steric substituents on the northern and southern moieties.

New Potent nSMase2 Inhibitors Are Metabolically Stable.

Further characterization of the potent inhibitors from each SAR category was performed using stability studies in mice and human microsomes. Among the analogues with modified southern moiety only 47 bearing a 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl exerted reasonable metabolic stability. Compounds modified in the northern moiety, e.g., 52, 53, 59, PDDC, 66, and 73, were also generally stable. Metabolite identification (MET-ID) of PDDC in both human and mouse liver microsomes (Figure S1) confirmed the formation of O-demethylated metabolite (m/z = 474.2135), albeit with a low abundance, suggesting O-dealkylation as a minor metabolic pathway. One of the most active compounds 76c, containing the unsubstituted pyrrolidine, was metabolically unstable. However, sulfonamide derivatives at the northern moiety (66 and 73) were almost 3-fold more potent than 1 (PDDC) and also completely stable in both mice and human microsomes. These compounds are being evaluated in in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies.

PDDC Reversed Cognitive Impairment in 5XFAD Mice.

Following confirmation of PDDC brain penetration in 5XFAD mice (AUCbrain/AUCplasma = 0.6), in vivo efficacy studies were initiated. Because nSMase2 has been implicated in the spreading of tau and amyloid β pathology in AD,29 we wanted to determine if long-term PDDC therapy could successfully treat cognitive impairment in AD mice. Cognitive deficits are well documented in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD, and the fear conditioning test demonstrates reproducible impairments in this strain beginning at 5–6 months of age.30,31 Knockdown of nSMase2 in the 5XFAD model improves both pathology and cognition as measured by performance on the fear conditioning test.8 Previous studies have also reported that this model and another model of AD are sensitive to nSMase2 inhibition via GW4869 using pathological end points.6,7 Ours is the first study, however, to measure the effects of nSMase2 inhibition on cognitive outcomes. A limitation of the present study is a lack of direct comparison of the in vivo efficacy of the previously utilized GW4869 and PDDC in the present study, and future studies that include both behavioral and pathological outcomes will include this control.

Both male and female mice were utilized in the present 5XFAD cognition study. While other laboratories have reported that male 5XFAD mice experience more significant behavioral deficits versus female counterparts,8 we only observed significant within-group differences in performance due to sex at one time point of fear conditioning testing, the 100–200 s bin of the contextual test, in the 5XFAD + vehicle mice. Although no within-group sex differences were observed at any other time point of testing for 5XFAD + vehicle mice or at any time point of fear conditioning testing for either WT + vehicle or 5XFAD + PDDC mice, future directions will include increasing the sample size of groups to determine if the male sex drives more impairments in 5XFAD + vehicle mice as previously reported.8

Herein we report that daily dosing of PDDC in 5XFAD mice significantly reversed their impairment in contextual fear memory when tested at 8 months of age, resulting in cognitive responses like those observed in WT mice. In tandem, PDDC treatment also increased body weight in 5XFAD mice. There is clear evidence of weight loss in both human AD32 and mouse models of the disease, including 5XFAD.33 There is no single cause for this phenomenon, but decreased food intake and higher resting energy expenditure are possible contributors.32 A recent study showed increased glucose consumption in the brains of 5XFAD mice with concurrent microglial and astrocyte activation and amyloid β accumulation.34 It is reasonable to hypothesize, therefore, that metabolic demands increase in 5XFAD mice with CNS inflammation and amyloid pathology, which could contribute to the stalled weight gain of 5XFAD mice compared to WT controls observed here and in other studies. Therefore, if PDDC impacts microglial or astrocyte activation and/or amyloid deposition, body weight would be positively impacted as observed here following PDDC treatment in 5XFAD mice. Future pathology studies are planned to explore this hypothesis, with a focus on the amygdala based on the present behavioral findings in the fear conditioning test. Future studies to measure the effects of PDDC treatment on glial and amyloid pathology will also take into account the effects of male or female sex, as previous studies have observed more severe phenotypes in male 5XFAD mice8 and a more pronounced amelioration of amyloid deposition due to the nSMase2 inhibitor GW4869 in males versus females.7

Even though head-to-head comparisons of compounds in vivo are hard to make, positive efficacy results using PDDC in the 5XFAD model are consonant with a previous study, in another laboratory, also using the 5XFAD model and another nSMase2 inhibitor GW4869 where reduction of amyloid plaque formation was observed.7 Though GW4869 has been used as tool compound in vivo, it has extremely poor solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents, has low potency (IC50 = 1 μM), and has never been characterized in the brain to show actual target engagement of nSMase2 following systemic dosing. We have also recently identified DPTIP, a more potent nSMase2 inhibitor (IC50 = 30 nM) from a different chemical series.35 We did not conduct direct comparison in vivo with DPTIP because this compound is not orally bioavailable and shows poor brain penetration vs PDDC. In short, the present study reports on a novel class of structurally distinct, orally bioavailable nSMase2 inhibitors that could be clinically developed for AD.

CONCLUSION

We report on a systematic and extensive SAR study of a novel series of nSMase2 inhibitors initially identified by high-throughput screening. Our SAR study provided 70 novel analogues and led to numerous derivatives with submicromolar nSMase2 inhibitory activity. On the basis of potency and microsomal stability, we identified several promising candidates for further development. Using PDDC as a representative tool compound of this series, we explored its efficacy in a chronic mouse model of AD. We report significant improvement of cognition in 5XFAD mice following 5 months of daily PDDC treatment. These results pave the way toward the development of a novel treatment for this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

General Instrumental Methods and Chemical Procedures.

NMR spectra (δ, ppm; J, Hz) were recorded on a Bruker Avance III-400 instrument (400.0 MHz for 1H and 101 MHz for 13C) using inverse broadband probe with ATM module (5 mm BBO-1H Z-GRD) or Bruker Avance III-400 instrument with broadband PRODIGY cryoprobe with ATM module (5 mm CPBBO BB-1H/19F/D Z-GRD). The NMR experiments were performed in DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 and referenced to the solvent signal (δ 2.50 and 39.70, respectively, 7.26 and 77.16). Mass spectra were measured on a LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using electrospray ionization (ESI). Column chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 (Fluka) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel 60 F254 foils (Merck). Solvents were evaporated at 2 kPa and bath temperature of 30–60 °C; the compounds were dried at 13 Pa and 50 °C.

Screening Assay.

Preparation of human recombinant nSMase2 and the fluorescence-based assay to monitor its activity in the presence or absence of potential inhibitors has been described.19 In brief, lysates of HEK293 cells that have been transfected with full human length nSMase2 were used to catalyze the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Phosphorylcholine in the presence of the Amplex Red system generates the fluorescent molecule resorufin. Extent of fluorescence is directly proportional to the extent of SM hydrolysis. The assay showed high reliability (Z′ = 0.8–0.9). A counterscreen was concomitantly carried out to identify false positives resulting from inhibition of the coupling enzymes. For the counterscreen, the alkaline phosphatase, choline oxidase, and HRP reactions were carried out in the absence of human nSMase2 and initiated by the addition of phosphorylcholine (2 μM), the alkaline phosphatase substrate. Compounds that showed inhibition of the coupling enzymes were considered false positives and were not used further.

In Vitro Metabolic Stability Studies.

The metabolic stability was evaluated using mouse and human liver microsomes (Xenotech LLC, USA) as previously described.38,39 For the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism, the reaction was carried out with 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in the presence of NADPH regenerating system (1.3 mM NADPH, 3.3 mM glucose 6-phosphate, 3.3 mM MgCl2, 0.4 U/mL glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 50 μM sodium citrate). Reactions, in triplicate, were initiated by addition of the liver microsomes to the incubation mixture (compound final concentration was 1 μM; 0.2 mg/mL microsomes). Controls in the absence of cofactors were carried out to determine the specific cofactor-free degradation. After 60 min of incubation, aliquots of the mixture were removed, and the reaction was quenched by addition of three times the volume of ice-cold acetonitrile spiked with the internal standard. Compound disappearance was monitored over time using a liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method. Additionally, metabolite identification (compound 1) was performed by full scan analysis on Thermo Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer, and phase-I metabolites were monitored.

5XFAD Mice.

Hemizygous 5XFAD males, overexpressing human PS1 and APP695 driven by the mouse Thy1 promoter (Jackson Laboratories, MMRRC Stock 34840-JAX), were bred in-house to wild type B6SJLF1/J female mice (Jackson Laboratories, stock 100012). Resultant litters were genotyped for APP695 and PS1 (Transnetyx). Mice were housed in the Johns Hopkins Miller Research Building animal facility and maintained on a 12 h light–dark cycle. All animal studies were conducted according to protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee.

Pharmacokinetics and Bioanalysis of 1 (PDDC).

To confirm that the pharmacokinetic profile of 1 (PDDC) was similar in AD mice to that our laboratory recently reported in wild type mice,21 aged 11-month hemizygous 5XFAD mice received a terminal intraperitoneal dose of 10 mg/kg 1 (PDDC). 1 (PDDC) was formulated in NMP–Tween 80–saline (2.5:5:92.5 v/v/v) and dosed ip at a dosing volume of 10 mL/kg for pharmacokinetic studies. Blood and brain tissue were collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 h postdose (n = 3 per time point). Blood was obtained after terminal sacrifice via cardiac puncture, and plasma was harvested from blood by centrifugation at 3000g for 15 min and stored at –80 °C. Brain tissues were harvested following blood collection and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Bioanalysis was performed as we have described previously. Briefly, calibration standards were prepared using naive mouse plasma or brain spiked with 1 (PDDC). 1 (PDDC) standards and samples were extracted from plasma and brain by a one-step protein precipitation using acetonitrile (100% v/v) containing internal standard (losartan, 0.5 μM). The samples were vortex mixed for 30 s and centrifuged at 10 000g for 10 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of the supernatant (50 μL) was diluted with water (50 μL) and transferred to a 250 μL polypropylene vial sealed with a Teflon cap and analyzed via LC–MS/MS. Chromatographic analysis was performed using an Accela ultrahigh-performance system consisting of an analytical pump and an autosampler coupled with a TSQ Vantage mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). Separation of analyte was achieved at ambient temperature using Agilent Eclipse Plus column (100 mm × 2.1 mm i.d.) packed with a 1.8 μm C18 stationary phase. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water with gradient elution. The [M + H]+ ion transitions for MS-882 were m/z 488.050 → 394.249, 378.218, and for losartan (IS) they were m/z 423.130 → 207.090, 180.071.

Mean plasma and brain concentrations of 1 (PDDC) were analyzed using noncompartmental method as implemented in the computer software program Phoenix WinNonlin version 7.0 (Certara USA, Inc., Princeton, NJ). The maximum plasma and tissue concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (Tmax) were the observed values. The area under the plasma and tissue concentration time curve (AUC) value was calculated up to 6 h (AUC0–t) by use of the log–linear trapezoidal rule. Brain to plasma ratio is calculated from mean total AUCbrain versus AUCplasma.

Cognitive Tests in 5XFAD Mice.

Male and female hemizygous 5XFAD and WT mice were aged to 3 months, and intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (5% DMSO, 5% Tween 80, 90% PBS) or 1 (PDDC) 10 mg/kg body weight were delivered daily for 5.5 months, until the time of sacrifice (n = 13–16). At 8 months of age, mice were subjected to fear conditioning test as previously described.40 Briefly, on the first day of testing, mice were placed in a fear conditioning chamber (Clever Sys Inc.) for 240 s and trained to associate a 30 s CS 1000 Hz tone with a 2 s US 0.5 mA footshock, via two tone-footshock pairings at 120 and 180 s. On the second day of testing, contextual fear memory was measured by placing mice back into the same fear conditioning chamber for 300 s. On the third day of testing, mice were placed in a novel wooden box container within the fear conditioning chamber for 240 s, and cued fear memory was measured by playing the CS 1000 Hz tone for the last 120 s of the test. Freezing behavior was recorded using FreezeScan software (Clever Sys Inc.).

Figure 3. Effect of 1 (PDDC) on weight changes in AD mice. WT and 5XFAD mice were administered daily ip vehicle or 10 mg/kg 1 (PDDC) from age 3 months (study day 0) to 8 months (study day 150). WT mice gained significantly more weight than both 5XFAD cohorts of mice. 5XFAD mice treated with 1 (PDDC) gained more weight than 5XFAD treated with vehicle. Significantly different from WT + vehicle at P &lt; 0.05 (*), P &lt; 0.01 (**), P &lt; 0.001 (***); significantly different from 5XFAD + vehicle at P &lt; 0.05 (+), P &lt; 0.01 (++), P &lt; 0.001 (+++), n = 13−16.

Figure 4. Fear conditioning. At 8 months of age and following 5 months of daily vehicle or 1 (PDDC) treatment, WT and 5XFAD mice underwent fear conditioning tests. On day 1 (A), mice were trained to associate the conditioned stimulus (CS) tone to the unconditioned stimulus (US) 0.5 mA footshock. On day 2 (B), 5XFAD + vehicle mice had significantly lower contextual freezing rates as compared to WT + vehicle mice, while 5XFAD + 1 (PDDC) mice performed like WT controls. On day 3 (C), 5XFAD + 1 (PDDC) mice exhibited significantly higher freezing rates during CS presentation versus 5XFAD + vehicle mice. Significantly different from WT + vehicle at P &lt; 0.01 (**), P &lt; 0.001 (***); significantly different from 5XFAD + vehicle at P &lt; 0.05 (+), P &lt; 0.01 (++); n = 13–16.
