PURPOSE OF REVIEW:

This article discusses neuroimaging in dementia diagnosis, with a focus on new applications of MRI and positron emission tomography (PET).

RECENT FINDINGS:

Although the historical use of MRI in dementia diagnosis has been supportive to exclude structural etiologies, recent innovations allow for quantification of atrophy patterns that improve sensitivity for supporting the diagnosis of dementia causes. Neuronuclear approaches allow for localization of specific amyloid and tau neuropathology on PET and are available for clinical use, in addition to dopamine transporter scans in dementia with Lewy bodies and metabolic studies with fludeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET).

SUMMARY:

Using computerized software programs for MRI analysis and cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluations of hippocampal, ventricular, and lobar volumes improves sensitivity in support of the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia. MRI protocol requirements for such quantification are three-dimensional T1-weighted volumetric imaging protocols, which may need to be specifically requested. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and 3.0T susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequences are useful for the detection of white matter hyperintensities as well as microhemorrhages in vascular dementia and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. PET studies for amyloid and/or tau pathology can add additional specificity to the diagnosis but currently remain largely inaccessible outside of research settings because of prohibitive cost constraints in most of the world. Dopamine transporter PET scans can help identify Lewy body dementia and are thus of potential clinical value.


pmcINTRODUCTION

Neuroimaging traditionally has played a focused role in the diagnosis of dementia. For Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia worldwide,1 neuroimaging has historically been used to rule out structural causes of dementia,2 including large strokes, brain tumors, infectious causes, and, in rare cases, reversible vascular causes such as dural arteriovenous fistulas.3–5 When using neuroimaging in dementia, several points should be emphasized. First, MRI is a widely available modality, with a total 40 million MRI scans done in the United States in 20196,7 across almost 12,000 MRI scanners and all bodily organs compared to a total 2 million positron emission tomography (PET) scans8 for all indications across about 2500 PET scanners. Also, the cost of an MRI is much less than the cost of a PET scan; in the United States, a noncontrast brain MRI costs as little as $437 compared to about $2700 for a brain fludeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) scan.9 For perspective, the cost of an MRI in the Netherlands is $190,10 further highlighting the relatively low cost of MRI internationally. Also, brain MRI is the first-line neuroimaging modality recommended in the imaging guidelines for dementia as published by the American Academy of Neurology,2 National Institute on Aging,11 and American College of Radiology12; CT also can be recommended, especially when MRI cannot be accomplished (eg, when a patient has a pacemaker). These recommendations are mirrored in the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, which recommend CT of the head or MRI without contrast. However, because head CT has lower anatomic resolution than MRI, particularly for regional quantification,13 it is reduced in sensitivity for detecting atrophy in neurodegenerative disease and is exceeded by MRI for detecting vascular disease.14 Based on a combination of patient access, financial costs, anatomic resolution, and formal society guidelines, brain MRI is the main focus of this article, with additional commentary on the role of FDG-PET in complex cases and of amyloid and tau PET in clinical trials and emerging therapeutic strategies for AD and related dementias.

MRI PROTOCOL CONSIDERATIONS

The minimum elements of a dedicated dementia MRI protocol should include a high-resolution T1-weighted imaging sequence to allow for quantitative analysis of specific brain atrophy patterns. To evaluate for vascular pathology, the protocol should also include diffusion-weighted MRI sequences to detect acute infarction, as ongoing infarcts may present as sudden memory loss.15 T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences allow for assessment of white matter disease, whereas blood-sensitive susceptibility-weighted sequences enable evaluation for cerebral microhemorrhages.16 These microhemorrhages are caused by structural abnormalities of small cerebral blood vessels that generally relate to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) or to hypertensive vasculopathy in dementia populations. Additional sequences may also be helpful for clinical evaluation or research but may be difficult to use in older individuals as longer scan times may not be tolerated, leading to increased motion or premature cessation of the imaging study. For volumetric acquisitions, the three-dimensional T1-weighted scan is used; this scan has different designations but is most commonly called either a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence or a spoiled gradient recalled acquisition (SPGR) sequence, depending on manufacturer. Standardized protocols are available for download from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/documents/mri-protocols) and National Institute on Aging (scan.naccdata.org).

Use of gadolinium contrast is not recommended for dementia evaluation unless clinical suspicion exists of a neoplastic, infectious, or inflammatory process. The most common field strengths of scanners are 1.5T and 3.0T, with lower field strengths occasionally encountered on open MRI machines. In general, patients should be scanned on either 1.5T or 3.0T machines as either field strength can detect brain atrophy related to neurodegenerative disease.17 However, 3.0T scanners are preferred, when available, as they allow for the acquisition of sequences such as susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) that optimize evaluation of hemorrhage. When considering longitudinal analysis in patients to track brain volume changes, it is important to image on scanners that have the same field strength and vendor.

POTENTIAL PITFALLS

When considering neuroimaging for cognitive decline, several caveats should be considered. Appropriate imaging should include correct sequences as detailed previously, such as three-dimensional T1-weighted sequences for volumetric quantification as well as susceptibility-sensitive sequences to detect microhemorrhages, particularly for evaluating for CAA or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Postcontrast MRI may be frequently ordered for evaluation of rapidly progressive cognitive decline, with potential etiologies that may include neoplastic, infectious, toxic-metabolic, or autoimmune disorders.18 However, the most common type of MRI recommended is without IV contrast, according to the American College of Radiology guidelines.12 Thus, a common pitfall to avoid when ordering imaging for dementia is the use of IV contrast unless a suspected etiology may warrant the use of contrast, such as those for rapidly progressive dementias. Discordance between image interpretation and clinical evaluation can be minimized by (1) evaluation of a chronically progressive versus rapidly progressive development of dementia, (2) the presence of fluid biomarkers, and (3) understanding of potential comorbidities that may occur with common dementias such as AD and vascular disease. Clinical communication between neurologists and neuroradiologists remain important in facilitating the diagnostic process.

MRI SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

When scanning people in late life, the main consideration for neurologists and neuroradiologists is the safety of scanning with the various medical devices a patient may have. The main example found in clinical practice is a pacemaker, but the variety of devices has expanded and includes cochlear implants and orthopedic hardware. Thus, when considering whether to request a brain MRI in a person with any medical hardware, it is essential that the neurologist consult with the neuroradiologist about the device and its MRI compatibility. The neuroradiologist then must consider several factors. First, if no documentation exists on the MRI compatibility or incompatibility of the device, MRI should not be performed because the risk is unknown. If prior medical documentation is available noting that the device requires no specific conditions for MRI, the scan can be performed. If specific conditions are documented by the manufacturer, the conditions can be viewed on a central common website (mrisafety.com), which provides ratings of MRI safety as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): MRI Safe, MRI Unsafe, and MRI Conditional. Patients with devices rated MRI Unsafe should not undergo MRI examinations. Patients with devices designated as MRI Safe can be scanned. Patients with devices rated as MRI Conditional devices may be scanned only if specific conditions are met. MRI Conditional devices are further rated as Conditional 1 through Conditional 8, with specific considerations noted for each rating (mrisafety.com/Terminology.html). With some MRI safety policies, MRI Conditional 4 and MRI Conditional 5 ratings may warrant scanning done by a certified magnetic resonance safety officer as these conditions are particularly manufacturer specific. Such cases are typically urgent or emergent clinical situations in which the risks of the scan must be weighed against the clinical benefit. Clinical collaboration between the neurologist and neuroradiologist is essential in the decision-making process. In some circumstances, the neuroradiologist may also consult with an MRI physicist to further determine MRI safety. Neurologists should familiarize themselves with the MRI safety categories and related documentation of devices to best inform their neuroradiology MRI safety consultations.

CHRONICALLY PROGRESSIVE AND RAPIDLY PROGRESSIVE DEMENTIAS

When evaluating brain MRIs from a neuroradiologic perspective, is it important to consider whether the dementia under evaluation is chronically progressive or rapidly progressive. Chronically progressive dementias, such as AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), typically develop insidiously over months to years.19 Vascular dementia may have an acute onset commensurate with the occurrence of stroke and then not progress until and unless additional vascular insults occur. In contrast, the rapidly progressive dementias typically develop over weeks to months. Rapidly progressive dementias can have a wide variety of causes, ranging from vascular to toxic/metabolic, infectious, and systemic causes; heavy metal poisoning; autoimmune diseases; and neoplastic processes. This article focuses on chronically progressive dementias and the use of quantitative MRI volumetrics as a practical clinical aid to dementia diagnosis.

APPLICATION OF NEUROIMAGING TO DEMENTIA

This section will overview the use of volumetric quantification techniques on brain MRI for dementia.

Brain Atrophy Quantification With MRI Volumetrics

AD is the most common cause of dementia, with longitudinal brain MRI revealing progressive atrophy in the hippocampal, temporal, and parietal regions. Jack and colleagues20 determined that the normal age-related annualized hippocampal atrophy rate is 1.73% from a cubic millimeter unit of measurement of hippocampal volume. With early symptomatic AD (eg, mild cognitive impairment due to AD),21 this annual rate is increased to 2.5% and rises with greater AD dementia severity.20,22 Another study by Fotenos and colleagues23 noted whole-brain atrophy rates of 0.45% in cognitively normal individuals and 0.98% per year in individuals with AD. Brain atrophy begins around age 30 and progresses throughout the lifespan.24 From 30 to 80 years of age, humans experience frontal lobe volume loss of 14% and hippocampal volume loss of 13%.25 The same study found that white matter volume in particular shrinks, with a 24% loss of volume in the frontal lobe and the majority of this loss occurring after the age of 70.25 However it is important to note that many so-called normative older cohorts included individuals with preclinical AD, so truly normal aging may not be affected as greatly by atrophy as the literature might indicate.

Tracking these structural changes is enabled by volumetric quantification on brain MRI. Although this can be done with research software programs,26–28 FDA-cleared software programs also exist and are shown alongside research software programs in TABLE 7–129–40.41

Automated volumetric analysis programs, whether FDA cleared or research based, are readily available both nationally and globally and are increasingly being used. Many are accessible through Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)–compliant web portals, increasing the range of access. The average turnaround time for FDA-cleared programs ranges from 10 minutes on a web portal to contemporaneous with images as they are acquired on MRI scanners. One FDA-cleared program processed 115,000 clinical brain MRIs from 2006 to 2016.42 Additionally, the applications demonstrated in peer-reviewed literature have expanded from dementia29 to multiple sclerosis,43 traumatic brain injury,44 and mesial temporal sclerosis.45 The cost of such programs is modest.9 An ordering neurologist can specify a request for volumetric quantification in their ordering comments if the electronic medical record lacks this option. Automated volumetrics agree with manual volumetry, with one study of an FDA-cleared program showing average Dice similarity coefficients (a similarity metric) of between 86% and 88% in hippocampal measurements across cognitively normal controls, prodromal AD, and AD dementia in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (CASE 7–1).30 Automated volumetry demonstrates a high degree of accuracy in detecting brain atrophy related to a clinical diagnosis of dementia, with another FDA-cleared volumetric program showing accuracy of 99%.31 Additionally, automated volumetry can detect both cross-sectional and longitudinal atrophy that can be missed on conventional visual reads (CASE 7–2).48,49 It is important to note that hippocampal volume loss is not specific for AD as it has been observed in other conditions, including in relation to traumatic brain injury,50 mesial temporal sclerosis,45 and hippocampal sclerosis of aging.51 Normal volumetric findings on brain MRI, however, do not exclude AD dementia (CASE 7–3).

Brain atrophy related to neurodegenerative dementing diseases is progressive in nature and worsens over time. By this rationale, brain volumes that are technically within a “normal” range when compared to a normal database, but worsening over time, may suggest progressive atrophy related to neurodegeneration even if still within the “normal” range (FIGURE 7–5). In other words, a decline in regional brain volume even within a statistically normal comparative range can be compatible with progressive brain atrophy in the setting of neurodegenerative disease.

In summary, longitudinal brain quantification in the workup of dementia can improve both the sensitivity of the workup and confidence in support of the underlying diagnosis. Brain atrophy can be detected with intervals as short as 6 months,53 but the majority of studies track atrophy over 1 year.54

Molecular Imaging Studies in Dementia

The relatively recent amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration (A/T/N) framework for AD research55 may also offer some insights into the diagnostic imaging evaluation of dementia. In this framework, A stands for the amyloid found in the amyloid plaques of AD that can be identified with amyloid PET and/or CSF or plasma biomarker evaluations. T stands for tau identified in neurofibrillary tangles that can also be noted on tau PET and/or fluid biomarker sampling. Although tau PET agents, including flortaucipir F 18, have been important in ongoing investigations of AD pathology,56,57 the clinical use of tau PET scans has yet to be defined. Currently, tau PET holds promise as a surrogate marker for monitoring drug treatment response in clinical trials. It also can potentially identify different AD clinical phenotypes.58 Although first-generation tau tracers in some instances were limited by off-target binding, newer tracers avoid these pitfalls and can potentially track different patterns of tau deposition in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy.59 N stands for neurodegeneration, the correlates of which on imaging include brain atrophy on MRI or glucose hypometabolism on FDG-PET.60 The A/T/N framework is being examined in research settings, but in clinical practice, physicians caring for patients with dementia are most likely to monitor the N component using brain MRI and/or FDG-PET. Brain MRI characterizes the anatomic specificity and extent of neurodegeneration.

The current FDA-cleared amyloid PET tracers are florbetapir, florbetaben, and flutemetamol. These tracers have similar standards of visual interpretation, with comparable sensitivity for detecting amyloid deposition ranging between 87.2% and 91.7%.61 Each of these tracers can be requested by a practicing neurologist based on their FDA clearance. However, given the lack of coverage by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the clinical availability of both amyloid and tau PET tracers is limited by individual patient ability to pay. The cost of an amyloid PET scan can be prohibitive.9

Standard clinical interpretations of such scans are focused on grayscale images, and thus color scales are not required for this purpose but are used for one of the current FDA-cleared tracers, flutemetamol F 18, to provide an improved ability to visually identify the progression of low to high intensity.52 Although visual analysis is the current standard in amyloid PET image interpretation, standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) with a reference region such as the cerebellum can generate high diagnostic accuracy. The cerebellum is the most commonly used reference region for SUVR calculations because of the very low to no amyloid-β in the cerebellar gray matter and white matter, respectively.62 One study found using SUVR with the cerebellum as a reference region generated an area under the curve of 93.5%.63 Use of machine learning further improves upon this accuracy.64 The IDEAS (Imaging Dementia—Evidence for Amyloid Scanning) study showed that use of amyloid PET changed management in more than 60% of cases with very mild and mild dementia, more than twice what the study predicted.65

CASE 7–1

An 80-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of insidious-onset memory loss, perseverative behaviors, inattention, and irritability. The patient was a retired corporate officer. Her medical history was notable only for hypertension. Her blood pressure at time of evaluation was 171/ 88 mm Hg. Her Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)46 was 0.5, indicating very mild dementia.

The diagnostic considerations included Alzheimer disease (AD) as well as small vessel disease and vascular dementia, although the insidious course argued against a vascular cause. Brain MRI was obtained, which showed mild-appearing hippocampal volume loss (FIGURE 7–1A), minimal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities (FIGURE 7–1B), and no findings of basal ganglia/thalamic microbleeds from hypertension or cortical microbleeds suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (FIGURE 7–1C). Volumetric brain MRI quantification showed abnormally low hippocampal volumes (FIGURES 7–2A and 7–2B), higher lateral ventricular volumes (FIGURE 7–2C), and normal range parietal lobe thickness (FIGURE 7–2D).

COMMENT

The clinical interpretation of the patient’s MRI precluded hypertensive vascular disease as the primary factor behind the patient’s dementia given the lack of white matter hyperintensities or microbleeds to indicate end organ damage from chronic vascular disease. The mild hippocampal volume loss suggested AD. Hippocampal volumes have been identified as 17% smaller in people who subsequently develop AD dementia compared with people who remain cognitively normal 2 to 3 years later.47 FIGURE 7–2 shows that the quantified hippocampal volumes in this patient are at the first percentile when compared to a normal database, signifying more than 2 standard deviations from the mean. Note that the figure shows ventricular and parietal lobe volumes within 2 standard deviations of the mean of the normal database. Temporal lobe cortical thickness, not shown, was between 1 and 2 standard deviations from the mean. Thus, the quantified low hippocampal volumes were the most sensitive metrics of brain abnormality in this patient with mild dementia and the clinical read of hippocampal atrophy. In the context of the hippocampal findings, the lateral ventricular volumes and parietal lobe thickness, although technically within 2 standard deviations from the mean, may also be abnormal. These findings further illustrate added value of quantified brain volumes with statistical comparisons to normal data.

CASE 7–2

A 69-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of the gradual onset and progression of memory loss and behavioral changes. He no longer recognized people he previously knew well, purchased unneeded items, and had experienced personality changes.

Initial neuroimaging evaluation done at this initial visit after 2 years of progressive decline showed brain volumes within 2 standard deviations of the mean, hence within the normal range. However, follow-up volumetric quantification 2 years later revealed volumetric declines in frontal and temporal lobe thickness and in hippocampal volume at rates higher than expected in normal aging (FIGURE 7–3); he was ultimately clinically diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.

COMMENT

This case emphasizes the utility of longitudinal imaging in frontotemporal dementia as well as Alzheimer disease dementia by showing the progressive loss of frontal and temporal lobe thickness. This case also highlights the additional sensitivity conveyed with cortical thickness measurements in addition to volumes.

CASE 7–3

A 67-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of cognitive decline, including repetition of questions and stories, forgetting details, omitting ingredients from a recipe, and increasingly low tolerance to stress.

Brain MRI volumetric quantifications, including hippocampal volumes, were all in the normal range of within 2 standard deviations from the control mean. However, a brain amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) obtained as part of a research study showed brain amyloidosis consistent with underlying AD pathology (FIGURE 7–4), with cortical52 florbetapir F 18 uptake in the gray matter distributed out to the periphery with concurrent loss of gray-white matter contrast.

COMMENT

In this case, the patient had normal-range derived MRI brain volumes, including in the hippocampus. However, further PET imaging revealed amyloid-positive binding indicative of underlying Alzheimer pathology.

Brain FDG-PET images show glucose metabolism, and hypometabolism is frequently seen in dementia.60 This method may be useful in differentiating between FTD and AD because of the characteristic temporoparietal hypometabolism in AD compared to the predominant frontal hypometabolism in behavioral variant FTD.66 This distinction has high diagnostic utility, with one study showing sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 97.6% in evaluating 31 individuals with pathologically confirmed AD and 14 individuals with FTD.66 The distribution of FDG-PET changes can suggest other neurodegenerative conditions, especially when postprocessed with z score maps (FIGURE 7–6).67 Such processing can be done with FDA-cleared software tailored for FDG-PET brain analysis68 in addition to visual reads. As the imaging abnormalities seen on FDG-PET can substantially overlap across different types of neurodegeneration, the use of more specific amyloid and tau biomarker studies will remain important to utilize as clinical practice evolves.

Much interest exists in the development of fluid and, in particular, plasma biomarkers for the detection of AD,69,70 which have been shown to predict brain amyloidosis on PET.71 Such work is essential as these tests will be needed to demonstrate biomarker positivity in individuals with suspected AD who are being evaluated for possible anti-amyloid therapy and have substantially lower costs than PET. Although amyloid and tau PET demonstrate the full anatomic distribution of these biomarkers, patient access to PET scanners is not ubiquitous. Thus, plasma biomarkers will remain important for maximizing this access to determine eligibility for anti-amyloid therapy.

White Matter Hyperintensities

The role of chronic hypertensive vascular disease as an etiologic factor for cognitive decline is best evaluated on FLAIR images, which can demonstrate abnormally high signal in the white matter known as white matter hyperintensities or white matter lesions.72 The distribution of such lesions in the setting of chronic small vessel ischemic changes is typically in periventricular or subcortical regions or in the deep white matter, and the location of these lesions in older people supports the underlying small vessel ischemic etiology73 and can independently predict brain atrophy.74 On histopathology, these lesions signify underlying vascular disease, including cerebral infarcts, lacunes, and subcortical arteriosclerotic leukoencephalopathy.75 Grading the magnitude of such changes as mild, moderate, or severe is done with the Fazekas scale,72 which provides a simple visual scale of white matter lesion severity (FIGURE 7–7). As the severity of white matter disease increases, so too does the confluence of the lesions, mainly in a periventricular distribution. Additional lesions in subcortical and deep white matter would demonstrate an increasingly cloudlike appearance.

Cerebral Microbleeds

Cerebral microbleeds manifest as focal round areas of reduced signal on susceptibility-sensitive sequences, such as SWI on 3.0T and gradient recalled echo (GRE) on 1.5T systems. Three or more of these lesions confer a higher risk of cognitive impairment.76 However, cerebral microbleeds have several etiologies, and these different causes can be suggested by the spatial distribution of these lesions (FIGURE 7–8).77 Differentiating between these findings is important as the bleeding risk as evidenced by the development of lobar hemorrhage in CAA is high, ranging from 3.9% to more than 11% with the presence of cortical superficial siderosis (deposition of chronic blood product over the cerebral convexities).78 Cerebral microbleeds are abnormal accumulations of hemosiderin in blood vessels, and with hypertension this is presumed to be due to endothelial cell damage and related inflammation.77 This commonly happens in the basal ganglia because of the vulnerability of the supplying medial lenticulostriate arteries to chronic hypertension.79 With traumatic brain injury, this is secondary to diffuse axonal injury in which hemosiderin-filled macrophages next to small vessels are related to prior extravasation of blood80; this frequently asymmetrically affects frontal and temporal lobes as these are frequent areas of injury.81 In CAA, cerebral microhemorrhages relate to amyloid-β deposition and insoluble amyloid fibrils within the walls of leptomeningeal and cortical arterioles.82

Brain MRI in Amyloid-related Imaging Abnormalities

Brain MRI is essential for the recently approved anti-amyloid therapy with aducanumab to monitor for the complications of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with hemorrhage and superficial siderosis (ARIA-H) or with vasogenic edema with or without sulcal effusion (ARIA-E).83 These findings are collectively seen in up to 35% of individuals treated with aducanumab, which as of January 11, 2022, has been approved by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for coverage with evidence development.84,85 Monitoring for these complications in the clinical trials for aducanumab occurred at baseline or within 1 year of starting treatment, after the seventh infusion (first dose of 10 mg/kg), and after the twelfth infusion (sixth dose of 10 mg/kg). The ARIA classification criteria from the aducanumab FDA label are listed in TABLE 7–2.86 FIGURE 7–9 shows examples of ARIA-H and ARIA-E.

Dementia With Lewy Bodies

DLB refers to a syndrome characterized neuropathologically by the abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein,87 an abundant 140-amino acid neuronal protein seen mainly in the neuronal presynaptic terminal. Clinically it is identified by progressive cognitive decline that often involves executive and visuospatial dysfunction.88 On imaging, a biomarker suggestive of DLB is ioflupane I 123, which labels the dopamine transporter in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway on PET or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Reduced binding of ioflupane I 123 in the basal ganglia on a dopamine transporter scan reflects abnormally low presynaptic dopamine. This finding, in turn, relates to loss of dopaminergic neurons that can occur in DLB,89 Parkinson disease,90 multiple system atrophy,91 progressive supranuclear palsy,91 and corticobasal degeneration.92 Given the overlapping findings, an abnormal ioflupane I 123 dopamine transporter scan does not establish a specific diagnosis of DLB but can be an indicative biomarker when other clinical information is supportive of the diagnosis. One systematic review found that dopamine transporter scans change management in 54% of cases and resulted in a change in diagnosis in 31% of cases.93 FIGURE 7–10 shows examples of normal and abnormal dopamine transporter scans.

Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), classically consisting of the clinical triad of gait dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and dementia, is a differential diagnostic consideration in some patients with dementia. MRI findings suggestive of NPH include ventriculomegaly out of proportion to sulcal dilatation (FIGURE 7–11A), as evidenced by a reduced callosal angle94 (FIGURE 7–11B) and tenting of the lateral ventricle (FIGURE 7–11C) with a CSF flow void in the cerebral aqueduct (FIGURE 7–11D). The callosal angle is drawn at the posterior commissure on coronal T1-weighted MRIs; it is typically abnormal in the setting of NPH when it is between 50 and 80 degrees and typically normal when it is between 100 and 120 degrees.94 Tenting of the lateral ventricle is seen from the communicating hydrocephalus of NPH, but the finding is not exclusive to this disorder. This is also true with increased CSF flow manifesting as a cerebral aqueduct flow void.

Although the clinical management of NPH does not always yield positive outcomes and ventricular shunting can have complication rates of up to 35%,95 the question of NPH versus AD can be a diagnostic dilemma; however, volumetric quantification can be useful in resolving the dilemma. In FIGURE 7–12, the increased ventricular volume (99th percentile) and the comparison of ventricular to cerebral volume suggests ventriculomegaly out of proportion to brain atrophy. Lack of hippocampal atrophy for this amount of ventriculomegaly in the presence of suggestive clinical findings for NPH suggests that the clinical findings are more likely related to NPH rather than to AD dementia, although these pathologies can coexist.96

CONCLUSION

The elements of neuroradiologic reporting are changing from historically focused reports that rule out structural causes of dementia. New reporting is now supplemented by quantification of regional brain volumes to characterize neuroimaging correlates of neurodegeneration. Additional semiquantitative imaging metrics of small vessel ischemic disease and cerebral microbleeds provide additional insights into other contributors to cognitive decline and dementia. All this information is obtainable from a single brain MRI that is already recommended in dementia evaluation. However, volumetric quantification, although readily available, has yet to be widely implemented and may require increased education and awareness among practicing clinicians. Additionally, further work must be done to combine available brain MRI information with other biomarkers from PET and fluid biomarkers to identify individuals at risk for dementia earlier in the disease process, thus allowing for increased effectiveness of risk reduction measures and new treatments.

FIGURE 7–12 Volumetric quantification findings in a case of normal pressure hydrocephalus show abnormally elevated ventricular volume out of proportion to cerebral volume (A, B) and relatively preserved hippocampal volume (C, D).

KEY POINTS

Brain MRI is the first-line neuroimaging as recommended by the American Academy of Neurology, National Institute on Aging, and American College of Radiology imaging guidelines for dementia, although CT is also recommended as an alternative.

The minimum elements of a dedicated dementia MRI protocol should include a high-resolution T1-weighted imaging sequence to allow for quantitative analysis of specific brain atrophy patterns.

For volumetric acquisitions, the three- dimensional T1-weighted scan is used; this scan has different designations but is most commonly called either a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence or a spoiled gradient recalled acquisition (SPGR) sequence, depending on manufacturer.

KEY POINTS

If specific conditions for use of MRI in patients with medical devices are documented by the device manufacturer, the conditions can be evaluated on mrisafety.com.

When evaluating brain MRIs from a neuroradiologic perspective, is it important to consider whether the dementia under evaluation is chronically progressive or rapidly progressive.

KEY POINTS

Brain atrophy related to neurodegenerative dementing diseases is progressive in nature and worsens over time.

A decline in regional brain volume even within a statistically normal comparative range can be compatible with progressive brain atrophy in the setting of neurodegenerative disease.

The relatively recent amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration (A/T/N) framework for AD research may offer some insights into the diagnostic imaging evaluation of dementia.

The amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration (A/T/N) framework is being examined in research settings, but in clinical practice, physicians caring for patients with dementia are most likely to monitor the N (neurodegeneration) component using brain MRI and/or fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).

The current US Food and Drug Administration– cleared amyloid positron emission tomography tracers are florbetapir, florbetaben, and flutemetamol.

KEY POINTS

Although visual analysis is the current standard in amyloid positron emission tomography image interpretation, standardized uptake value ratios with a reference region such as the cerebellum can generate high diagnostic accuracy.

The distribution of FDG- PET changes can suggest other neurodegenerative conditions, especially when postprocessed with z score maps.

As the imaging abnormalities seen on FDG- PET can substantially overlap across different types of neurodegeneration, the use of more specific amyloid and tau biomarker studies will remain important to utilize as clinical practice evolves.

Much interest exists in the development of fluid and, in particular, plasma biomarkers for the detection of AD, which have been shown to predict brain amyloidosis on PET.

KEY POINTS

The role of chronic hypertensive vascular disease as an etiologic factor for cognitive decline is best evaluated on fluid- attenuated inversion recovery images.

The distribution of white matter hyperintensities in the setting of chronic small vessel ischemic changes is typically in periventricular or subcortical regions or in the deep white matter, and the location of these lesions in older people supports the underlying small vessel ischemic etiology and can independently predict brain atrophy.

In cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral microhemorrhages relate to amyloid-β deposition and insoluble amyloid fibrils within the walls of leptomeningeal and cortical arterioles.

Brain MRI is essential for the recently approved anti- amyloid therapy with aducanumab to monitor for the complications of amyloid related imaging abnormalities with hemorrhage and superficial siderosis (ARIA-H) or with vasogenic edema with or without sulcal effusion (ARIA-E).

On imaging, a biomarker suggestive of dementia with Lewy bodies is ioflupane I 123, which labels the dopamine transporter in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway on PET or single- photo emission computed tomography (SPECT).

KEY POINT

The callosal angle is drawn at the posterior commissure; it is typically abnormal in the setting of normal pressure hydrocephalus when it is between 50 and 80 degrees and typically normal when it is between 100 and 120 degrees.
