Synaptic dysfunctions precede cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by decades, affect executive functions, and can be detected by quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). We used qEEG combined with Stroop testing to identify changes of inhibitory controls in cognitively healthy individuals with an abnormal versus normal ratio of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid/total-tau. We studied two groups of participants (60–94 years) with either normal (CH-NAT or controls, n = 20) or abnormal (CH-PAT, n = 21) CSF amyloid/tau ratio. We compared: alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD), alpha spectral entropy (SE), and their relationships with estimated cognitive reserve. CH-PATs had more negative occipital alpha ERD, and higher frontal and occipital alpha SE during low load congruent trials, indicating hyperactivity. CH-PATs demonstrated fewer frontal SE changes with higher load, incongruent Stroop testing. Correlations of alpha ERD with estimated cognitive reserve were significant in CH-PATs but not in CH-NATs. These results suggested compensatory hyperactivity in CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs. We did not find differences in alpha ERD comparisons with individual CSF amyloid(A), p-tau(T), total-tau(N) biomarkers.

pmc1. Introduction

Neuropathology and biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) demonstrate that synaptic dysfunction and pathology (amyloid/tau) precede cognitive impairment by decades (Harari et al., 2014; Nathan et al., 2017) and can be detected by resting electroencephalography (EEG) (Babiloni et al., 2020a). The lack of effective AD treatment requires efforts to identify early pathology and predict clinical decline in late-onset AD(Cummings et al., 2019). The US National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) updated scientific progress and unified the 2011 guidelines as a “research framework”(Jack et al., 2018). This research framework classifies AD and AD related dementia spectrum based on ATN status, where A+ pathology is the main AD pathology. The framework envisions combinations of AD biomarkers that can help understand AD progression before cognitive symptoms appear and encourages investigation of the interaction between amyloid/tau biomarkers and cognitive symptoms (Jack et al., 2018).

Previous studies by our group and others demonstrated decreased inhibitory control in AD, using Stroop interference testing (Harrington et al., 2013; Tissier et al., 2018; van Veen and Carter, 2005). The classic Stroop color-naming task, where participants are asked to name the color of the ink in which a word is printed while ignoring the word itself, has been used to test one core executive function - interference, selective attention, and goal maintenance. Stroop performance is impaired in preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD(Belanger et al., 2010; Patten et al., 2018; Tse et al., 2010). FMRI study of the prefrontal cortex during Stroop reported hyperactivity in MCI and hypoactivity in AD compared to elderly controls (Li et al., 2009). With higher temporal resolution, complementary EEG techniques identified changes of alpha power or event-related activities during interference tests in frontal and posterior areas (Jiang et al., 2015; Larson et al., 2009; Nombela et al., 2014). Interestingly, during resting state, several studies reported altered frontal and occipital alpha activity: reduced occipital alpha activity in EEG studies of progressive MCI or AD(Babiloni et al., 2015; Bajo et al., 2012); frontal alpha power augmentation related to local amyloid deposition in magnetoencephalography (MEG) in predementia stages of AD(Nakamura et al., 2018). Further, EEG during Stroop testing highlighted the frontal and occipital alpha involved in the interaction between stimulus and age, the best-known risk factor for AD(Nombela et al., 2014). On the other hand, during cognitive challenge, alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) and spectral entropy (SE) were considered as functional correlates of brain activation(Inouye et al., 1991; Klimesch, 2012; Klimesch et al., 2007; Nunes et al., 2004). Cognitively healthy individuals with pathological amyloid/tau (CH-PATs) demonstrated decreased (more negative) alpha ERD and greater alpha SE during working memory testing, indicating hyperactivity compared to those with normal amyloid/tau(Arakaki et al., 2019). Since working memory is related to Stroop interference processing(Jaiswal et al., 2019), we predict that altered alpha ERD and SE during Stroop testing will reveal individuals with CH-PAT biomarkers.

Cognitive reserve has been reported to account for inter-individual differences in cognitive symptomatic onset from aging or neurodegenerative pathology(Stern, 2009). Cognitive reserve can be estimated by proxies of education years and verbal IQ(Frankenmolen et al., 2018; Narbutas et al., 2019). Higher cognitive reserve has been related to resilience to cognitive decline from white matter lesions(Giogkaraki et al., 2013; Mortamais et al., 2014). To our knowledge, no other studies correlate cognitive reserve with alpha ERD.

Our goal for this study was to test whether frontal and occipital alpha ERD and SE during Stroop interference challenge is differentially altered in CH-PATs. As amyloid/tau ratio outperforms amyloid or tau alone (Fagan et al., 2011; Ritchie et al., 2017; Roe et al., 2013), we focused our alpha ERD and SE analysis based on CSF amyloid/tau ratio, which can include both AD type and non-AD type pathology. In a four year follow up, none of the CH-NATs but 40% of the CH- PATs declined cognitively (Harrington et al., 2013; Harrington et al., 2019; Wilder et al., 2018), evidence that the CH-PAT have greater risk of cognitive decline.

We also explored the alpha ERD changes on individual ATN biomarkers. Based on the observations of hyperactivity in an early stage of disease (Arakaki et al., 2019; Li et al., 2009; Nakamura et al., 2018), our hypotheses are that compared to CH-NATs during Stroop testing, CH-PATs will present: 1) decreased (more negative) alpha ERD at frontal and/or occipital regions; 2) higher frontal/occipital alpha SE and reduced changes in alpha SE from congruent to incongruent trials at the frontal/occipital regions.

This study uses cognitive challenge with objective measures of central (qEEG) to understand potential interference processing dysfunction in CH-PATs. Our results are the first to provide a template strategy and set of objective measures to detect early Alzheimer’s changes that correlate with invasive biomarkers (CSF amyloid/tau) and perhaps to assess potential efficacy of preventive treatments for cognitively healthy individuals, however we do plan additional studies to further validate and extend our methodology.

2. Participants and Methods

2.1. Participants

Fifty cognitively healthy elderly participants were recruited from advertisements placed in local newspapers and newsletters, the Pasadena Huntington Hospital Senior Health Network, the Pasadena Senior Center, and meetings with local physicians to present this research. All participants provided consent via an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol (HMRI # 33797). Assessments included collecting demographic data, physical exams, fasting blood studies, disease severity and disability scales, and CSF amyloid/tau measurements(Harrington et al., 2013). Inclusion criteria: over 60 years, classified as CH after a ~4 hour comprehensive neuropsychological battery using age, sex, and education normative references, including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Third Edition (WAIS-III), from which the verbal IQ was estimated, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), as referenced in detail (Harrington et al., 2013). Exclusion criteria: other active, untreated disease, use of anticoagulants or other contraindications to lumbar puncture. To reduce chronobiological variability of amyloid(Bateman et al., 2007), we collected all CSF between 8 and 10 am after a 12 h overnight fast.

CSF amyloid Aβ42 and phospho-tau

CSF proteins were measured as published (Montagne et al., 2020). Briefly, we used the MSD multiplex assay (Cat. No. K15200E, MSD, Rockville, MD) to determine CSF levels of Aβ42; participants were stratified based on CSF analysis as either Aβ1–42-positive (Aβ1–42+, &lt;190 pg/mL) or Aβ1–42-negative (Aβ−, &gt;190 pg/mL) using the accepted cutoff values as previously reported for the MSD 6E10 Aβ peptide assay (Pan et al., 2015). We determined phosphorylated tau (pT181) by ELISA (Cat. No. 81581, Innotest, Belgium); participants were stratified based on CSF analysis as either pTau181-positive (pTau+, &gt;78 pg/mL) or pTau181-negative (pTau−, &lt;78 pg/mL), using the accepted cutoff value as previously reported (Roe et al., 2013).

CSF amyloid/total tau ratio

We previously used Aβ/total tau ratios to differentiate between individuals with normal versus abnormal CSF (Harrington et al., 2013) because these ratios had outperformed any single analyte in discriminating individuals with, versus without, abnormal levels of cortical amyloid (Fagan et al., 2011). We found a cutoff for the ratio of Aß42/total tau (2.7132) provided at least 85% sensitivity in discriminating AD from CH participants; we then used this regression to assign cognitively healthy participants (CH) into two groups, one with normal CSF Aβ/tau ratio (CH-NATs) and the other with abnormal Aβ/tau ratio (CH-PATs) (Harrington et al., 2013). As provisional evidence for the capacity of this CSF Aβ/total tau ratio to predict clinical decline, a longitudinal study found that 40% of CH-PATs declined cognitively over 4 years, ranging from significant impairment, to MCI, or to AD, while none of the CH-NATs declined over 4 years (Harrington et al., 2019). The Innotest immunoassay used for this published amyloid/tau ratio (Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium) is, however, no longer available and, to overcome this, we compared data from 35 samples run on both Innotest and MSD platforms, using the MSD assay (catalog no. K15121G, MSD, Rockville, MD) to determine total tau (cutoff value &gt;450 pg/mL) (Pan et al., 2015) along with the aforementioned MSD Aβ42 assay; regression analysis (Fig. S1) allowed us to estimate Innotest values (reported in the Results section) for amyloid and total tau on these new samples run only on the current MSD platform.

CSF/EEG analyses

We compared participants in three approaches: 1) we compared the estimated CH-NAT to the CH-PAT group; 2) we compared the group with Aβ42 &lt;190 pg/mL (A+ for AD biomarker) to those with all normal CSF biomarkers for Aβ42, p-Tau, and total Tau (A−T−N−); 3) we compared the group with any combination of abnormal ATN biomarker: Aβ42 &lt;190 pg/mL, or pTau+&gt;78 pg/mL, or total tau&gt;450 pg/mL (ATN(+)) to those with all normal CSF CSF biomarkers Aβ42, p-Tau, and total Tau (A−T−N−).

2.2. Procedures

All study participants were seated in a quiet illuminated room under similar constant conditions and were first asked, during resting state baseline measures, to “sit still” and “empty their minds” for 5 minutes with eyes open (eyes fixed at the DELL sign on the bottom of the dark screen), and then for 5 minutes with eyes closed. All participants were in a quiet awake state during the resting state condition.

We administered the Stroop interference test using E-prime software (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Sharpsburg PA) on a Dell Precision T5610 with a 20” screen. Participants were comfortably seated in front of the computer screen. One of the three colored words ‘Red’, ‘Blue,’ or ‘Green’ presented on the screen one at a time in three different colors (red, blue, or green). The ink color and word can be congruent (“C”, e.g., ‘Red’ in red ink) or incongruent (“I”, e.g., ‘Red’ in blue ink). The researcher instructed participants to respond to the color of the ink and ignore the word using their right hand: press ‘1’ for ‘red’, ‘2’ for ‘blue’, and ‘3’ for ‘green’ on a keyboard. Each trial was composed of a pre-set duration of 500 ms, then word presentation until a response or 2000 ms (whichever was shorter), followed by 500 ms wait time till the next trial. Participants took the Stroop test after a practice run of 2–3 minutes. Each test included 3 blocks of 110 trials and the entire task took about 20 minutes to complete. All participants had accuracy over 76%, indicating alertness. This consistent data collection environment help control all drowsiness, sleepiness, or tiredness and alertness level between the two groups.

2.3. EEG recordings

Online EEG data were collected during the resting state or during the Stroop challenge as previously described(Arakaki et al., 2018). Briefly, a 21-head-sensor, dry electrode system (Quasar Wearable Sensing, DSI-24, San Diego, CA) was used to collect EEG signals. Sensor configuration followed the international 10–20 system. Sensors were placed approximately at the following locations: Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, O2, M1, and M2, referring to frontal (F), temporal (T), central (C), parietal (P), occipital (O), and mastoidal (M) locations, respectively. EEG signals were sampled at 300 Hz, and bandpass filtered between 0.003–150Hz. To help signal processing, electrooculographic (EOG), electrocardiographic (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) were recorded by three auxiliary sensors. A trigger channel encoded the time of color-word stimuli onset, the participants’ responses, and the type of test (C or I) for further analysis.

2.4. Behavioral and EEG Data Processing

The study was double blinded, i.e., the subjects were not aware of group placement and researchers performed all behavioral and EEG data collection and processing without knowledge of CH-NAT/CH-PAT status. Behavioral performances were described and compared by accuracy (ACC) and response time (RT): we define ACC as the percentage of correctly responded trials out of total trials; RT as the duration from stimulus onset to participant’s response on correct trials.

We analyzed all datasets in EEGLAB version eeglab14_1_0b(Delorme and Makeig, 2004) running in MATLAB R2016b (The MathWorks, USA) and with custom codes developed in-house. The continuous EEG recordings were segmented into 1500 ms epochs of all correctly responded Stroop trials using the stimulus onset as a reference [−500 1000], or specific time windows of 1500 ms duration during eyes closed for resting state. Preprocessing and time-frequency analyses were performed as described(Arakaki et al., 2018). Briefly, we filtered epochs between 2 and 30 Hz, re-referenced EEG data to the mean of two mastoid sensors (M1 and M2), and independent component analysis (ICA)(Delorme and Makeig, 2004) was used to remove eye blinks, cardiac, and muscle artifacts. Large artifacts activity higher than three standard deviations (SDs) from a specific sensor’s mean were rejected. There were no differences in the number of epochs rejected between CH-NATs (36±17 for congruent trials and 45±25 for incongruent trials) and CH-PATs (35±16 and p=0.85 for congruent trials, 37±17 and p=0.23 for incongruent trials). No channels were labelled bad for either group. For time-frequency analysis, epoched EEG data were decomposed with logarithmic scaling between 2 and 30 Hz by fast Fourier transform and Morlet wavelet [ei2πtfe−t2/2σ2] convolution in the frequency domain, followed by the inverse fast Fourier transform(Cohen, 2014; Cohen and Donner, 2013). Power values were normalized by decibels to the baseline power from −400 to −100 ms pre-stimulus at each frequency band [dB power=10*log10(powerbaseline)], to sufficiently estimate baseline activity(Cohen, 2017). Based on the TF plots and published data(Hu et al., 2013; Pagano et al., 2015; Vazquez-Marrufo et al., 2017), alpha ERD (mean power in the range 200–500 ms, 8–15 Hz) were then extracted for comparison across sensors, participants, and groups based on the literature(Klimesch, 2012). This was done separately for each sensor, condition, and participant.

Besides alpha ERD, other frequency bands, such as delta, theta, and beta bands, are reported to be essential for Stroop interference processing (Ergen et al., 2014). Therefore, we compared delta (2–4), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–15 Hz), and beta (15–30 Hz) bands at the early [0 to 500] ms window (except alpha at [200 to 500] ms) or late [500 to 1000] ms window between CH-NAT and CH-PAT participants. Alpha SE change from congruent to incongruent trials were also compared.

2.5. Spectral entropy (SE) analysis

We calculated alpha SE for baseline EEG using the [−400 to −100] ms time window during Stroop test trials to avoid early post-stimulus activity influences(Cohen, 2017), and alpha SE for active (ERD) EEG using the [200–500] ms time window. For each time point, we calculated the SE in the respective temporal windows of each EEG channel using the following formula: SE=1ln(N)∑fi=f1f2Pn(fi)ln(1Pn(fi)) (Quandt et al., 2016), where N is the number of frequency components in the [f1 f2] range, with f1 and f2 being the lower (8 Hz) and upper (15 Hz) limit of the alpha frequency band respectively, and Pn(fi) is the normalized power spectrum.

2.6. Cognitive reserve and neuropsychology tests

Verbal IQ was calculated from education, sex, &amp; age norms from our WAIS-III testing. We calculated cognitive reserve from proxies of verbal IQ and education years(Frankenmolen et al., 2018): 1) we calculated Z-scores for verbal IQ and education years for each participant (the difference between individual score and the sample mean score divided by the sample standard deviation). 2) we averaged the Z-scores of verbal IQ and education years. Mini Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment were measured by standard questionnaire(Crum et al., 1993; Freitas et al., 2013).

2.7. Statistical methods

Alpha power measurements were analyzed by averaging individual sensors within and across participants to derive statistics. We compared group differences in participant baseline characteristics using two-sided t-tests or Fisher’s exact tests. We summarized alpha power and alpha SE statistics for 6 regions(Arakaki et al., 2018; Lianyang et al., 2016): frontal or F (Fz, F3, F4), central or C (Cz, C3, C4), parietal or P (Pz, P3, P4), left temporal or LT (F7, T3, T5), right temporal or RT (F8, T4, T6), and occipital or O (O1, O2). We hypothesize that: 1) frontal and/or occipital alpha ERD is more negative in CH-PATs than CH-NATs; 2) frontal and/or occipital alpha SE is higher in CH-PATs than CH-NATs, and frontal and/or occipital alpha SE change from congruent to incongruent trials were lower in CH-PATs compared with CH-NATs. For information, we listed alpha power and SE in all 6 regions.

The strength of associations between frontal alpha ERD/SE with cognitive reserve from the same individuals were assessed as slope factors, determined using linear regression methods and correlation coefficients, and p values were computed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to determine whether frontal/occipital alpha ERD or SE alone can classify CH-NAT and CH-PAT participants, and whether multiple logistic regression including alpha ERD or SE with cognitive reserve (main effects only or with two-way interactions) can improve the group classification.

Alpha ERD were compared between CH-NATs and CH-PATs, between A+ and A−T−N− groups, and between a group with any combination of A+ or T+ or N+ biomarker versus a group with all normal biomarkers (A−T−N−).

T-statistic values for comparisons between CH-NATs and CH-PATs were calculated assuming unequal variance and a paired t-test (for Tables S1c&amp;d) was done between congruent and incongruent trials (Kim, 2015). Effect size was calculated using Cohen’s d (Rochart et al., 2020). Analyses were done using PRISM v8.4.0 (GraphPad), Excel (Microsoft Office 2013), or MATLAB 2020a. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all tests unless otherwise stated.

3. Results

3.1. Study participant demographics

Cognitively healthy participants with normal Aβ/tau ratios (CH-NAT, n=20), and abnormal Aβ/tau ratios (CH-PAT, n=21), were matched by age, gender, education, and handedness (Table 1). Additional measures were listed including MSD amyloid, p-tau, and total-tau; estimated Innotest amyloid, tau, and amyloid/tau ratio; verbal IQ, cognitive reserve score, and other cardiovascular risk related measures (total cholesterol, HDL, smoke, resting SBP, and resting DBP). No group differences were found. In preliminary re-assessment after 2 years from the time of qEEG/Stroop testing, 3 of the CH-PAT group and none of the CH-NAT group have declined.

3.2. Behavioral Performance (ACC and RT)

For the congruent and incongruent trials, neither ACC nor RT was significantly different between the CH-NAT and CH-PAT participants (Table 2). RT during incongruent trials was longer than that during congruent trials for both groups (p&lt;0.001). Accuracy during incongruent trials was lower than that during congruent trials for both CH-NATs and CH-PATs (p&lt;0.01).

3.3. Alpha during resting state and alpha during task baseline values

We compared CH-NAT and CH-PAT participants on time-frequency plots for mean alpha power during resting, and during congruent and incongruent trial baselines. Our analyses suggest that alpha power is comparable between the two groups, during eyes open resting (Frontal: −0.79±1.20 for CH-NATs and −0.32±1.18 for CH-PATs, p=0.214; Occipital: −0.68±1.47 for CH-NATs and −0.22±0.65 for CH-PATs, p=0.200), during eyes closed (Frontal: −0.73±0.69 for CH-NATs and −0.77±1.29 for CH-PATs, p=0.908; Occipital: −0.69±1.18 for CH-NATs and −0.77±1.36 for CH-PATs, p=0.830), and baseline of congruent and incongruent trials (was used for normalization).

3.4. Time-Frequency Plots and Alpha ERD differences during cognitive challenge

Figure 1 shows the fronto-posterior distribution of alpha ERD during the Stroop test, comparing CH-NAT versus CH-PAT, assessing the time-frequency plots of mean power of EEG in the sagittal plane in the frontal, central, parietal, and occipital regions of the brain. Despite comparable behavioral performance measures (Table 2), the total power of alpha ERD, in the white box in the occipital region (congruent trials), was significantly decreased (more negative, blue color) (200~500 ms, 8–15 Hz) in the CH-PAT group compared to age-matched CH-NATs, indicated by the arrows in Figure 1.

During congruent trials, occipital alpha ERD was lower in CH-PAT than CH-NAT (df=38, t=2.35, p=0.024) (Fig 2, Table 3a). During incongruent trials, frontal and occipital alpha ERD was not different between CH-NATs and CH-PATs (Frontal: p=0.423, Occipital: p=0.193) (Fig 2 and Table 3b). Compare alpha ERD changes from congruent to incongruent trials, CH-PATs presented lower occipital alpha ERD changes than CH-PATs (df=34, t=2.68, p=0.011) (Figure 2, Table 3c).

When comparing the normal CSF group (A−T−N−) (n=19) to the group with the most widely accepted AD biomarker (A+) (n=12), alpha ERD was not different among any of the regions during congruent trials, incongruent trials, or changes from congruent to incongruent trials (Tables 4a–c). When comparing alpha ERD between the A−T−N− group (n=19) versus the A+ or T+ or N+ group (n=22), no different alpha ERD was observed (Data not shown).

3.5. Frontal/occipital alpha SE differences during cognitive challenge

During congruent trials, CH-PATs presented higher alpha SE (active ERD windows) compared to CH-NATs (Frontal: df=38, t=−2.49, p=0.017 and Occipital: df=38, t=−2.43, p=0.020). There were no frontal or occipital alpha SE differences between the two groups during incongruent trials (Fig 3 and Table 5). Comparing alpha SE changes from congruent to incongruent trials, CH-PATs presented lower frontal alpha SE changes than CH-NATs (df=27, t=2.55, p=0.012) (Fig 3, right column; Table 5c).

3.6. Frontal/Occipital Alpha ERD, SE and cognitive reserve correlation by groups

Alpha ERD correlated positively with cognitive reserve during incongruent trials in the frontal (r=0.66, p=0.001) and occipital (r=0.55, p=0.009) regions for CH-PATs, but not for CH-NATs. Neither group shows correlations during congruent trials (Fig 4). Cognitive reserve correlated negatively with alpha SE during incongruent trials at frontal (r=−0.57, p=0.007) and occipital (r=−0.47, p=0.033) regions for CH-PATs, but not CH-NATs. Neither group shows correlations between alpha SE and cognitive reserve during congruent trials (Fig 4E–H).

3.7. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves

We examined whether frontal and occipital alpha ERD or SE, and cognitive reserve distinguished CH-PATs from CH-NATs. The overlap ROC curves show frontal alpha ERD during congruent trials (Fc, AUC=0.58, p=0.389), occipital alpha ERD during congruent trials (Oc, AUC=0.69, p=0.039), cognitive reserve (AUC=0.56,p=0.514), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA: AUC=0.63, p=0.167), and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE: AUC=0.61, p=0.241) were different classifiers. The combinations of frontal/occipital alpha ERD (Fc, Oc) and cognitive reserve improved the prediction of CH-PATs (AUC=0.72, p=0.014). Further considering the two-way interactions, the combinations of frontal/occipital alpha ERD (Fc, Oc) and cognitive reserve were significant classifiers of CH-NATs and CH-PATs (AUC=0.81, p=0.0006). However, incongruent frontal alpha ERD (Fi, AUC=0.54, p=0.649), occipital alpha ERD (Oi, AUC=0.60, p=0.297) were not significant. Combinations of incongruent alpha ERD (Fi, Oi) and cognitive reserve were significant binary classifiers of CH-NATs/CH-PATs (AUC=0.65, p=0.110), which were more significant when considering two-way interactions (AUC=0.75, p=0.008).

For alpha SE, overlap ROC curves show congruent alpha SE at frontal (Fc, AUC=0.73, p=0.012), occipital (Oc, AUC=0.69, p=0.035) regions, cognitive reserve (AUC=0.56,p=0.514), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (AUC=0.63, p=0.167), and Mini Mental State Examination (AUC=0.61, p=0.241) were different classifiers for CH-NATs and CH-PATs. The combination of frontal and occipital alpha ERD during congruent trials (Fc, Oc) and cognitive reserve improved the prediction of CH-PATs (AUC=0.75, p=0.005), which were more significant when considering two-way interactions (AUC=0.83, p=0.0003). However, the congruent to incongruent alpha SE changes at frontal (Fci, AUC=0.72, p=0.020), occipital (Oci, AUC=0.58, p=0.403) regions were different classifiers. The combinations of congruent to incongruent changes of alpha SE (Fci, Oci) and cognitive reserve improved the prediction of CH-PATs (AUC=0.72, p=0.021), which were more significant when considering two-way interactions (AUC=0.81, p=0.0001) (Figure 5).

3.8. Other frequency band by groups

Delta, theta, alpha, and beta power at early (before 500ms) and late (500–1000ms) window during Stroop testing were compared. Table S1 shows some differences besides the aforementioned alpha ERD domain. During congruent trials, late delta power at the occipital region was also lower in CH-PATs than CH-NATs (p = 0.017) (Table S1a); During incongruent trials, late theta power was lower in CH-PATs than CH-NATs (p = 0.013 for right temporal and 0.048 for occipital region) (Table S1b). Compared to that during congruent trials, CH-NATs had higher centroparietal theta during incongruent trials, while CH-PATs had more negative temporo-occipital alpha and beta in addition to higher parietal theta (Tables S1c&amp;1d).

3.9. Spectral power correlate with Response time by groups

The correlation between participants’ spectral power and RT for different trials were shown in topoplots (n=17 for CH-NATs and n=21 for CH-PATs). During congruent trials, CH-PATs beta power positively correlated with RT (p=0.006~0.048, r=0.44~0.58, at frontocentroparietal regions); CH-NATs theta power negatively correlated with RT (p=0.006~0.033, r=−0.63 ~ −0.52, at frontocentroparietal regions); Both groups’ delta negatively correlated with RT, with CH-NATs limited at centroparietal regions (p=0.003~0.016, r=−0.67~ −0.58) and CH-PATs at all regions (p=0.001~ 0.017, r=−0.68~ −0.51). Similarly, during incongruent trials for delta power, both groups correlate negatively with RT, with CH-NATs limited at frontocentroparietal regions (p=0.003~0.022, r=−0.68~ −0.55), while CH-PATs have all except left temporal regions (0.004~0.039, r=−0.60~ −0.45) (Figure 5B). Details and correlations with ACC are shown in supplement (Tables S2).

3.10. Spectral power correlates with CSF amyloid, total Tau, Mini Mental State Examination, and amyloid/tau ratio

The participants’ EEG spectral powers were correlated with CSF amyloid, total Tau, and Mini Mental State Examination (n=17 for CH-NATs and n=21 for CH-PATs). Briefly, for CSF amyloid level during congruent trails, CH-NATs’ delta correlated positively with amyloid (p=0.013~0.042, r=0.50~0.59 for Parietal, Right temporal regions). During incongruent trials, CH-NATs’ delta correlated positively with amyloid (p=0.002~0.043, r=0.50~0.69 for Frontocentroparietal regions). For CSF tau level during congruent trials, CH-PATs’ alpha correlated with Tau (p=0.016~0.047, r=0.44~0.52 in Frontocentral and Left temporal regions), CH-NATs’ delta correlated with Tau (p=0.004~0.024, r=0.45~0.59, F, P, RT regions); during incongruent trials, CH-NATs’ delta correlated with Tau (p=0.004, r=0.65~0.67 for Parietal and Right temporal regions). Details in Tables S3a&amp;b). For Mini Mental State Examination during congruent trials, CH-NATs’ beta correlated negatively with Mini Mental State Examination (p=0.028~0.039, r=−0.53~−0.50 for Centroparieto-occipital regions); during incongruent trials, CH-NATs’ beta correlated negatively with Mini Mental State Examination over all regions (p=0.006~0.043, r=−0.64~−0.50). Tables S3a&amp;b show details. We listed the relationships between alpha ERD or SE with CSF amyloid/Tau ratios across all cognitively healthy individuals, and within each group (Table S4).

4. Discussion

Our study demonstrates that the Stroop challenge reveals subtle changes in CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs and supports our two predictions: First, despite similar behavioral responses, occipital alpha ERD was decreased (more negative) and frontal and occipital alpha SE were higher in CH-PATs during a low interference load, indicating hyperactivity; frontal alpha SE changes from low to high interference load were lower in CH-PATs, suggesting insufficient cognitive resources with increasing interference load. The different qEEG between CH-NAT and CH-PAT groups during Stroop testing highlights the importance of the qEEG data in revealing underlying susceptibility for individuals with pathological CSF amyloid/tau. We emphasize the accuracy and generalizability of our qEEG in this paradigm, since the RTs (600~1000 ms) of our participants are consistent with the reported range for computerized Stroop testing(Tse et al., 2010), and both groups exhibited the expected Stroop effects with longer RT during incongruent than congruent trials. Second, there are significant correlations between alpha ERD with cognitive reserve in CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs. These qEEG measures during a simple cognitive “interference” challenge were linked to cognitive reserve, suggesting that the cognitive resistances (proxies of education and verbal IQ) to early amyloid/tau abnormalities are related to compromised interference processing in CH-PATs.

Our participants CH-PATs had higher CSF total tau than that in CH-NATs, while amyloid levels are comparable between two groups. The amyloid and tau status suggest our population likely included individuals with non-Alzheimer’s pathology, or suspected non-Alzheimer’s pathophysiology (SNAP): A−T+(N)−, A−T−(N)+, or A−T+(N)+(Jack et al., 2018). CSF measures have been reported to be more sensitive than imaging measures(Lee et al., 2020). In this study, differences in alpha ERD were observed between groups based on amyloid/tau ratio, but not between A−T−N− and A+ (AD biomarker) groups or between A−T−N− and any combination of the A+ or T+ or N+ group. This is consistent with previous studies about amyloid/tau ratio advantages. For example, the amyloid/tau ratio outperforms any individual protein in discriminating those with cortical amyloid(Fagan et al., 2011), and thus should be a more sensitive predictor of AD risk than total tau alone(Roe et al., 2013). Studies have also demonstrated the CSF tau (t- or p-Tau)/Abeta ratio’s capacity to predict MCI progression to AD(Ritchie et al., 2017). The ratio of CH individuals with AD-biomarker among CH with A+ (12 out of 22, or ~55%) is a bit lower than that in the CH group from a previous ATN biomarker study (39% out of 58%, or ~67%) (Ekman et al., 2018), but still covers over half of the individual biomarker population. In addition to the ATN research framework (Jack et al., 2018), there are some interesting facts. Firstly, the most common dementia type is AD and pathological heterogeneity is extensive in sporadic, late-onset AD (Schneider et al., 2009). Secondly, there are reports of tau or neurodegeneration biomarkers changing first in preclinical AD and in AD pathology(Dubois et al., 2016; Jack and Holtzman, 2013; Jack et al., 2013). As AD is the dominant etiology among all dementia types, we focus our discussion on AD in this study. Ongoing longitudinal follow up of the clinical, CSF biomarkers and the amyloid/tau ratio, and qEEG in our population will help to interpret the alpha ERD relationship to combinations of these and other biomarkers.

4.1. The yield of interference challenge

We focused on frontal and occipital alpha ERD and alpha SE in this study based on previous publications. Firstly, abnormal frontal/occipital alpha were reported during the resting state: Nakamura et al. reported local amyloid-beta deposition related frontal alpha band augmentation in preclinical AD(Nakamura et al., 2018), Qi’s group has reported increased frontal activity in amnestic MCI using fMRI(Qi et al., 2010). Babiloni’s group has reported that occipital alpha current density decreased in MCI and AD participants than healthy elderlies and occipital alpha activity related to local gray matter density in all participants(CH, MCI, AD)(Babiloni et al., 2015). Secondly, Nombela et al. reported reduced frontal and occipital alpha with age (the main risk factor for AD) during Stroop testing(Nombela et al., 2014). Lastly, our previous pilot study, and others, supported frontal hyperactivity (more negative alpha ERD and higher alpha SE) in CH-PATs during working memory testing, a core executive function related to Stroop interference (Arakaki et al., 2019; Harrington et al., 2013; Jaiswal et al., 2019; Rochart et al., 2020).

Our study is novel because it uses both an early stage of amyloid/tau pathology detectable only by CSF biomarkers, and cognitive challenge (interference) to reveal alterations in dynamic neural responses detected by both qEEG and by its link to cognitive reserve. We have listed alpha ERD’s potential interactions with other AD related measures (Mini Mental State Examination, and CSF amyloid/tau) in the Supplementary Tables S3&amp;4 in order to stimulate future interests of these new qEEG related findings and potential AD pathophysiology.

4.2. Context of Previous Work and relation to prior EEG and MEG-based biomarkers

Several studies reported impaired Stroop performance with AD risk, including: higher Stroop reaction time variations in preclinical AD or early AD(Patten et al., 2018; Tse et al., 2010), reduced interference and goal maintenance in MCI and further reduction in AD(Belanger et al., 2010). We did not find behavioral performance changes in Stroop, probably due to different study group (cognitively healthy vs. early AD or MCI).

Resting EEG studies report alpha changes in AD. In the symptomatic stage, alpha in MCI and AD patients changes mostly at the frontal and occipital regions: Bajo et al. reported higher parieto-occipital synchronization in alpha and beta bands for progressive MCI compared to stable MCI(Bajo et al., 2012); Babiloni’s group reported reduced frontal and occipital alpha and alpha connectivity in AD than healthy elderly participants(Babiloni et al., 2016); AD patients presented occipital hypo-synchronous alpha by resting MEG than age-match controls, and the hypo-synchronous alpha in AD related to decreased Mini Mental State Examination score and co-localized with local tau deposition(Ranasinghe et al., 2020); and preclinical AD individuals demonstrate frontal hyperactivity(Nakamura et al., 2018). We did not see resting frontal or occipital alpha changes, possibly due to the early disease stage (amyloid/tau pathology detected by CSF earlier than by brain imaging) or different techniques (low-density EEG vs. high-density MEG).

For EEG during Stroop, Jiang et al. reported semantic and response conflict revealed frontal theta modulation and occipito-parietal alpha reduction, in undergraduate students aged 19–24(Jiang et al., 2015). Older adults presented decreased alpha and theta activity during epochs related to mind-wandering (after errors)(Atchley et al., 2017). Older participants (60’s) show decreased frontal and occipital alpha during Stroop than younger ones(Nombela et al., 2014). Different reports in the literatures could be partly attributable to different methods (e.g., different workload or alpha measurements). For example, alpha activity (e.g., event-related synchronization, ERS) has been linked to inhibitory gating in task-irrelevant areas(Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010; Klimesch, 2012; Klimesch et al., 2007), and alpha ERD responses were considered as a functional correlate of brain activation(Klimesch, 2012; Klimesch et al., 2007). We interpret our finding of more negative alpha ERD in the occipital region with higher alpha SE over the frontal and occipital regions during congruent trials as supporting compensatory hyperactivity in CH-PATs. This result corroborates our previous findings of higher frontal alpha SE during low load working memory testing(Arakaki et al., 2019). An interesting connection is that working memory capacity can predict the Stroop interference level(Kane and Engle, 2003; Tse et al., 2010). Our data during the low load interference challenge supports our hypothesis that CH-PATs present more negative alpha ERD in the occipital region and higher alpha SE over the frontal and occipital regions. This frontal and occipital hyperactivity seems to be transitional for lower long-distant connections seen in AD participants(Stam et al., 2009). Additionally, we interpret the lower alpha SE from congruent to incongruent trials in the frontal region in CH-PATs to suggest insufficient cognitive recruitment in response to higher load challenge.

Alpha ERD was induced at different frequency ranges: 8–13 Hz from nociceptive stimuli (Hu et al., 2013), 10–14 Hz during a visual oddball cognitive task (Vazquez-Marrufo et al., 2017), 8–15 Hz during an enumeration task (Pagano et al., 2015), and 8–12 Hz during memory task (Krause et al., 2008). Interestingly, the 12–15 Hz range has been studied during nonrapid eye movement sleep as sigma activity or “sleep spindles” (Riedner et al., 2016), during encephalopathy as “coma spindles” (Bortone et al., 1996; Dadmehr et al., 1987), or part of low beta. We used 8–15 Hz for alpha frequency range as previously studied (Arakaki et al., 2019; Pagano et al., 2015).

Besides alpha, frontal theta has been related to conflict responses(Atchley et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2015; Nombela et al., 2014; Xavier et al., 2020). We observed higher centroparietal theta during incongruent trials than congruent trials in CH-NATs (Supplementary Tables S1c&amp;d). These are not discussed further as they are beyond the scope of this study.

4.3. Cognitive reserve and alpha ERD are correlated in CH-PATs

Structural and functional changes are known to precede cognitive decline in AD progression, and there are inter-individual differences in cognitive symptomatic delay(Menardi et al., 2018). Cognitive reserve has been used to account for cognitive performance variabilities: cognitive reserve reflects an individual’s ability to preserve cognitive function from aging or neurodegenerative pathology in the early stage(Stern, 2009), however after AD diagnosis, individuals with higher cognitive reserve deteriorate faster(Wilson et al., 2000). Higher cognitive reserve is associated with more effective strategies in executive tasks(Barulli et al., 2013; Frankenmolen et al., 2018) and with lower levels of cardiovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities), which may offer resilience to other pathologies(Pettigrew et al., 2020). Higher cognitive reserve has been related to resilience to cognitive decline from white matter lesions(Giogkaraki et al., 2013; Mortamais et al., 2014) and greater resting-state lagged linear connectivity as a measure of inter-regional connectivity(Fleck et al., 2019). To our knowledge, no other studies correlate cognitive reserve with alpha ERD.

Cognitive reserve can be estimated by proxies of education years and verbal IQ(Frankenmolen et al., 2018; Narbutas et al., 2019). We interpret the alpha ERD correlation with cognitive reserve in CH-PATs during incongruent trials to indicate a strain on cognitive reserve by the high load interference challenge. Interestingly, CH-PATs with higher cognitive reserve have increased alpha ERD values (less negative), indicating a better neural efficiency that more resembles the findings in CH-NATs. Although spectral entropy is not different between the two groups during incongruent trials, the correlation with cognitive reserve is only significant (negatively) in CH-PATs: CH-PAT participants with higher cognitive reserve used less alpha SE for high load incongruent trials, suggesting higher neural efficiency with fewer resources used for the task. These results are consistent with our interpretation of the alpha ERD results. Therefore, our data support the idea that cognitive reserve may protect neural function (higher ERD and lower SE) from pathological CSF amyloid/tau levels, in line with the protective role of education(Gatz, 2005). Our study also echoed study of resting state occipital/temporal alpha interaction with education attainment in a preclinical AD population (amyloid PET-positive subjective memory complaint seniors)(Babiloni et al., 2020b). The different neuroprotective alpha 2 and compensatory alpha 3 effects in Babiloni’s study are beyond our focus here but are worth exploring further. We used the common cognitive reserve calculation from verbal IQ and years of education; adding factors such as occupational complexity, physical activity, leisure activities, etc., may further improve this type of analysis(Narbutas et al., 2019).

The cognitive reserve and alpha ERD/SE correlation in CH-PATs is significant during incongruent trials, suggesting their interference processing during high load Stroop challenge depends on the protective effects of cognitive reserve. On the other hand, cognitive reserve is not different when directly compared between the two groups, suggesting that compromised interference processing in CH-PATs does not result from different cognitive reserve directly. This relationship is worth further study at different AD stages.

In summary, our pilot study supports compensatory hyperactivity in CH-PATs during low load interference challenge and insufficient brain resources with higher workload compared with CH-NATs.

4.4. Limitations, clinical implications, and future studies

There are limitations to this study. First, the investigation was exploratory, and participants from the local Pasadena area were mainly Caucasian with higher socioeconomic status. This work needs to be repeated in a larger, more diverse population. With longitudinal follow up, potential biomarkers can be calculated to set standards for clinical screening. In addition, Stroop interference does not include typical conflicts in real life (e.g., left vs. right). Future studies could incorporate different interference factors, such as the Simon effect (Ma and Shang, 2013). Finally, more participants are female than male, both for CH-NATs and CH-PATs, which may reflect either greater altruism in participation, or greater resilience to aging in females. Our results regarding alpha ERD and alpha SE during Stroop task performance provide new insight into early amyloid/tau pathology and encourage further research.

5. Conclusions

Stroop testing combined with qEEG in a cross-sectional study revealed that interference processing is compromised in cognitively healthy individuals with AD biomarkers defined by CSF pathological amyloid/tau ratio. Our results show that alpha ERD correlates with cognitive reserve in individuals with CH-PAT biomarkers. We demonstrate for the first time that insufficient brain resources in CH-PAT individuals are revealed by interference Stroop testing and are probably a transitional stage to further deterioration. We propose that treatment strategies to improve cognitive reserve at the pre-symptomatic stage of AD may help resist neurodegeneration(Suffczynski et al., 2001). Cognitive challenge with Stroop testing combined with qEEG have valuable screening potential to differentiate CH-PAT from CH-NATs and offer useful tools to monitor and guide new therapies.
