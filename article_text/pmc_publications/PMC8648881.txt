INTRODUCTION:

Despite advances, understanding the protective role of the APOE ε2 allele in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains elusive.

METHODS:

We examined associations of variants comprised of the TOMM40 rs8106922 and APOE rs405509, rs440446, and ε2-encoding rs7412 polymorphisms with AD in a sample of 2,862 AD-affected and 169,516 AD-unaffected non-carriers of the ε4 allele.

RESULTS:

Association of the ε2ε3 heterozygote of men with AD is 38% (p=1.65×10−2) more beneficial when it is accompanied by rs8106922 major allele homozygote and rs405509 and rs440446 heterozygotes than by rs8106922 heterozygote and rs405509 and rs440446 major allele homozygotes. No difference in the beneficial associations of these two most common ε2ε3-bearing variants with AD was identified in women. The role of ε2ε3 heterozygote may be affected by different immunomodulation functions of rs8106922, rs405509, and rs440446 variants in a sex-specific manner.

DISCUSSION:

Combination of TOMM40 and APOE variants defines a more homogeneous AD-protective ε2ε3-bearing profile in men.

pmc1. BACKGROUND

Despite decades of research, the roles of genetic variants from the 19q13.32 region harboring the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene in late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (herein referred to as AD) remain controversial [1, 2]. Large-scale analyses using a statistical approach of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) mainly attempted to identify individual loci conferring AD risk [3–5]. They emphasized the roles of the APOE ε2/ε3/ε4 polymorphism in AD pathogenesis and supported the ε4 allele as the strongest individual genetic risk factor for AD [4]. There are also views that the effects of the APOE alleles can be modulated by other genetic and non-genetic factors, or their effects can be due to a linkage with other variants [6–8]. For example, the interplay of genetic factors can be in the form of familiar gene-by-gene interaction or a more complex form of a coherent influence of multiple variants as haplotypes, compound genotypes, complex transcriptional regulatory structures, etc. [8–12]. The roles of non-genetic factors can also range from well-known gene-by-environment interactions to systemic influences such as AD exposome [13].

Several approaches were used to examine the interplay of the APOE polymorphism with other genetic variants in AD-affected and unaffected subjects. One logical approach was to analyze promoter variants in the 19q13.32 region because they could modulate the risk of AD by affecting APOE messenger RNA. For example, it was reported that APOE promoter variants rs449647 (−491A/T) and rs405509 (−219T/G) conferred the AD risk in addition to the ε4 allele [14]. A study of individuals from Central-Northern Italy showed that AD was associated with a haplotype comprised of the ε4 and rs405509_T alleles [10].

Another approach focused on the associations of non-coding variants in the 19q13.32 region with AD because they may have functional consequences on the same or nearby genes and, thus, exert their effects by differentially modulating the effects of the APOE ε2/ε3/ε4 alleles or independently of them. Haplotypes statistically inferred from multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the region harboring NECTIN2, APOE, and APOC1 genes were shown to be associated with AD independently of the ε4 allele [9]. Two haplotypes comprised of three non-coding SNPs (rs440446, rs769449, rs769450) and the ε2/ε3/ε4 alleles, differentiated by rs769449 alleles, were identified as correlates of AD [15].

Studies examining the roles of TOMM40 poly-T rs10524523 and APOE ε2/ε3/ε4 haplotypes in AD pathogenesis leveraged the phylogenetic approach [16]. The key of this approach is that it first “identifies collections of related haplotypes with common ancestral history” and then associates them with AD [17]. The poly-T rs10524523 might be more informative for AD than the APOE alleles because of the richness of poly-T length variations [18].

Unlike the ε4-AD research, the beneficial impact of the ε2 allele on AD and its interplay with other variants in the APOE region are substantially less explored. In part, this is due to a small population frequency of the ε2 allele and a small number of AD cases among the ε2 carriers [19, 20]. The ε2-AD research is also complicated by inherent complexity (i.e., heterogeneity) in genetic predisposition to non-Mendelian diseases such as AD, even in genetically homogeneous populations [21, 22]. This complexity is driven by two major and unavoidable factors. The first is an interdependence of metabolic pathways evolutionarily adapted to maximize fitness at reproductive age in changing environments [23–25]. The second is the lack of apparent and direct connections between the evolutionarily adapted genetic factors and non-Mendelian diseases characteristic for post-reproductive life [26, 27]. These complexities complemented by the small prevalence of AD-affected and unaffected ε2 carriers warrant exploring novel approaches to gain further insights into the beneficial role of this allele in AD.

Our approach is logically similar to the phylogenetic method in the sense that it first prioritizes genetic variants and then performs association analysis. Prioritization is based on analyzing the differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) structures between AD-affected and unaffected subjects. An advantage of our approach is that it leverages the LD concept. As LD is of statistical nature, it can identify not only haplotypes (driven by genetic linkage) but also combinations of genotypes (referred to as compound genotypes) from nearby and even distant loci clustered due to, e.g., functional linkage [28]. Our association analysis leverages prioritized variants in the form of compound genotypes.

Following this approach, we recently examined the relationship of triples of SNPs in the APOE region to AD using a novel co-skewness metric, which generalized LD between pairs of SNPs to triples of SNPs [8]. We identified two AD-associated SNP triples, which included APOE ε2-coding rs7412 and TOMM40 rs8106922 SNPs and either rs405509 or rs440446 APOE SNP. These triples supported the roles of the ε2-bearing polygenic variants in AD. Here, we examine the roles of the ε2-bearing compound genotypes comprised of these four SNPs in protection against AD. The analyses were performed in the sample of 2,862 AD-affected and 169,516 AD-unaffected non-carriers of the ε4 allele from seven independent studies.

2. METHODS

2.1 Study cohorts and phenotypes

The main focus was on three population/community-based studies and three AD studies (Table 1). The population/community-based studies included the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) original and offspring cohorts [29], Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) [30], and Health and Retirement Study (HRS) [31]. They were pooled together and referred to as the population/community-based (PCB) sample. Three AD-focused studies included the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease Family Study (LOADFS) [32], three cohorts from the NIA Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs), which are a part of the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) initiative [33], and the NIA collaborative study from the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) [34]. LOADFS, FHS, and ADSP released information on AD ascertained by researchers in each contributing study using diagnoses made according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the AD and Related Disorders Association. A diagnosis of AD in HRS and CHS was defined based on ICD-9:331.0x codes in Medicare files. The ADGC sample consisted of autopsy- and clinically-confirmed AD-affected and cognitively normal subjects who were ascertained by the clinical and neuropathology cores of the NIA-funded ADCs. In the ADSP sample, we excluded overlapping studies.

The main findings were additionally validated using population (65+ years at the end of follow-up) from UK Biobank (UKB) [35]. The diagnoses of AD in UKB were derived from hospital admissions and death register (https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/showcase/docs/alg_outcome_dementia.pdf).

All analyses were performed using individuals of European ancestry.

2.2. Genotypes

We used four previously identified TOMM40 and APOE SNPs (see the Introduction): rs7412 (C/t; upper/lower case denotes here major/minor allele; allele “t” encodes the ε2 allele), rs8106922 (TOMM40, A/g), rs405509 (APOE, G/t), and rs440446 (APOE, G/c). To select samples with no carriers of the APOE ε4 allele, we included rs429358 (T/c) SNP, whose minor allele encodes the ε4 allele.

2.3. Analysis

We evaluated effect sizes (beta) and odds ratios (ORs) for AD risk (unless explicitly stated) for carriers of compound genotypes constructed from the four selected SNPs, excluding carriers of the ε4 allele. The compound genotype variable included four categories. Two categories are for the most common specific compound genotypes with the ε2 allele, denoted as 1001 and 0111. Here, symbols 0 and 1 represent major allele homozygote and heterozygote, respectively, of SNPs ordered as rs8106922, rs405509, rs440446, and rs7412. Accordingly, variant 0111 implies major allele homozygote of rs8106922 and heterozygotes of the other SNPs (AAGtGcCt). Variant 1001 is comprised of rs8106922 heterozygote, major allele homozygotes of rs405509 and rs440446, and heterozygote of rs7412 (AgGGGGCt). With no ε4 carriers, rs7412 heterozygote encodes the ε2ε3 genotype. The third category pooled the remaining compound genotypes with one and two copies of the ε2 allele (denoted as other_ε2) because of a small number of AD cases for individual genotypes. With no ε4 carriers, the fourth category was comprised of carriers of the ε3ε3 genotype; it was mainly used as a reference.

We used the base R function glm for logistic regression. The models were adjusted for age, sex (except sex-stratified models), and the study cohorts included in the aggregated samples. No other adjustments have been made. We used p&lt;0.05 as a significance level.

3. RESULTS

The analyses were first performed in the LOADFS, PCB (pooled sample of the FHS, CHS, and HRS datasets), ADGC, and ADSP samples separately to examine the consistency of the associations of the compound genotypes with AD. Such consistency is considered as replication because pooling these results may strengthen the association [36]. Table 2 shows consistent beneficial associations of each of the three ε2-bearing compound genotypes with AD across all samples. It can be seen, however, that these beneficial associations were non-uniformly distributed across these genotypes. The largest beneficial effect (i.e., the smallest OR) was consistently observed for the 0111 genotype in all studies except ADGC, in which the smallest OR was for the other_ε2 category. In all studies, this category was a mix of compound genotypes with one or two copies of the ε2 allele.

An advantage of the PCB sample is that the number of AD-unaffected subjects in PCB is much larger than that in the AD-focused studies (Table 1). Leveraging the AD-unaffected PCB sample as a reference, we examined the potential selection bias of the substantially smaller samples of the AD-unaffected subjects in LOADFS, ADGC, and ADSP. Unlike the other analyses, this analysis did not evaluate the AD risk but contrasted AD-unaffected subjects only from each of these AD-focused studies and the reference PCB sample. Table 3 shows no substantial bias in the selection of the AD-unaffected sample in LOADFS or ADSP. In contrast, we observe a strong selective (i.e., genotype-specific) bias for AD-unaffected carriers of the other_ε2 genotypes in ADGC (p=1.65×10−5).

Next, we contrasted AD cases from ADGC to the reference PCB sample of AD-unaffected subjects. Table 4 shows that the estimates of ORs are about the same for all genotypes with slightly smaller OR for the 0111 genotype, consistently with all the other studies.

We evaluated ORs for AD in a sample of all studies combined with a biased sample of the ADGC AD-unaffected subjects excluded. The strongest beneficial effect was for carriers of the 0111 compound genotype (Table 5, Pooled). This result was further validated in UKB (Table 5, UKB). In the mega sample of all studies combined (Table 5, Mega), the 0111 genotype was 20.2% more beneficial than 1001 (OR=0.798, p=8.64×10−2 in the test contrasting 0111 to 1001). Interestingly, the 0111 genotype was more beneficial than pooled genotypes in the other_ε2 category even though the latter included carriers of two copies of the ε2 allele (14 AD cases and 1321 non-cases).

We examined whether sex affected the associations of compound genotypes with AD. Consistently beneficial associations of the 0111 variant with AD were observed in PCB, LOADFS, ADGC, and ADSP for each sex (Supplementary Table S1). These associations were highly significant in the pooled sample of these studies, and they were nearly the same in men and women (Figure 1, Pooled). We validated these findings in UKB (Figure 1, UKB). Significances of the beneficial associations with AD were improved in the mega sample of all studies combined in each sex (Figure 1, Mega). In contrast, odds of AD for carriers of the 1001 genotype were consistently less beneficial for men than women in all samples, including UKB (Figure 1, Supplementary Table S1). In the mega sample of all studied combined, the association of 1001 with AD was significantly less beneficial in men than women (Figure 1; p=1.59×10−2, chi-square test [37]). Contrasting the associations of the 0111 and 1001 variants with AD in the mega sample of men showed that 0111 was 38% more beneficial than 1001 (OR=0.625, p=1.65×10−2).

We examined whether the selected compound variants were associated with AD biomarkers such as CSF (cerebrospinal fluid, mm3) and brain volume (normalized for head size, cm3) available in UKB. The analyses were performed using all available data (mean age±standard deviation=64.42±7.74 years) and those limited to 65 years and older as above (70.63±3.89 years). Only the 1001 genotype attained marginally significant association with CSF (beta=−14.53, p=4.96×10−2; not significant after Bonferroni correction) in the sample of women of all ages (Supplementary Table S2).

4. DISCUSSION

Prior research emphasizes the beneficial effect of the ε2 allele itself on AD [19, 20]. Here, we report that this effect is strengthened by variants from three SNPs from the TOMM40 (rs8106922) and APOE (rs405509 and rs440446) genes and that this modulation is men-specific. The strongest beneficial effect in men was observed for the ε2ε3 carriers, who also carry rs8106922 major allele homozygote and APOE rs405509 and rs440446 heterozygotes (0111 genotype). This beneficial effect is 38% larger (p=1.65×10−2) than the effects for the other common ε2-bearing protective genotype 1001 (i.e., ε2ε3 carriers who carry the rs8106922 heterozygote and rs405509 and rs440446 major allele homozygotes). The beneficial effect of 0111 in men is the same as in women, whereas that of 1001 is significantly smaller in men than women (p=1.59×10−2).

Using a large sample from the population/community-based cohorts as a reference, we show that a small sample of controls in the available ADGC dataset can have selective (i.e., genotype-specific) bias. This bias implies that carriers of specific genotypes can be over/under-represented in a small sample of controls compared to a larger sample of the disease-unaffected subjects from a more general population. This bias is challenging to control in an individual study, as it requires a comparative analysis of the differences in proportions of the studied genotypes in unaffected subjects from the study-specific and reference populations.

Genetic association studies of complex (non-Mendelian) traits typically report risk variants assuming that they are proxies for actual causal variants. However, despite decades of APOE-AD research [1], recent discoveries in large-scale analyses [4, 5, 38, 39], and recognition of a major role of the APOE gene in AD [40], neither ε2 nor ε4 allele is considered a causal factor for developing AD [39]. If a variant is a risk rather than a causal factor for a trait, it means that some carriers of an adverse (or beneficial) variant develop (or are protected against) that trait, whereas the others do not (or do) develop. The reason for that can be of deterministic (e.g., heterogeneity) or stochastic (e.g., unknown or uncontrolled factors) origin [41]. A more beneficial effect of the ε2-bearing 0111 compound genotype in men implies a more homogeneous polygenic profile of people who have stronger protection against AD. This finding contributes to a better understanding of the deterministic part of the risk concept by attributing a fraction of the heterogeneous AD protection to this more homogeneous profile rather than just the ε2 allele itself. This more homogeneous profile can be caused by various factors such as AD-related ancestral component, lifestyle, toxins, familial AD-related risk factors, AD exposome, etc.; its origin needs to be elucidated yet.

Mainstream APOE research attempts to better understand the protective effect of the ε2 allele because of apparent differences in molecular properties of the ε2/ε4-related isoforms [42]. Prior studies suggest that protection against AD could be through amyloid β (Aβ) dependent and independent mechanisms [43]. For example, positron emission tomography shows a considerable difference of about 55 years in a 15%-level Aβ deposition in cognitively normal carriers of the ε4ε4 homozygotes (40 years) and the ε2ε3 heterozygotes (95 years) [44]. These findings suggest that the ε2 allele can be protective against the premature accumulation of Aβ plaques. Studies also show that the oldest-old ε2 carriers have a higher burden of various neuropathological outcomes, such as neuritic plaques and Braak plaque stage, than the ε3ε3 carriers. Despite that, however, they do not develop AD [45]. These findings indicate a potential resilient function of the ε2 allele, possibly through protection against Aβ toxicity [46]. Among the non-Aβ pathways, studies implicate neuroprotection, immunomodulation, lipid metabolism, and synaptic function [47–51]. Overall, it is hypothesized that protection of the ε2 allele against AD is through coherent effects of multiple interconnected mechanisms with a leading role of lipid metabolism [43].

Our study suggests that function of the ε2 allele is at least modulated by other variants from TOMM40 (rs8106922) and APOE (rs405509 and rs440446) genes. Both rs405509 and rs440446 SNPs are localized in the APOE promoter region and can modulate the gene expression. This promoter is inactive in 113 of 118 cell lines, as reported in Ensembl (https://useast.ensembl.org), and is repressed in the remaining 5 of them, i.e., B, CD4+ CD25+ab Treg (PB), DND-41, A549, and MCF-7. The rs405509 acts also as a CTCF binding site with active and poised states in 19 and 7 of 118 cell lines, respectively. For the remaining cell types, regulatory activity is unknown.

Cell-type-specific repressed state of the APOE promoter harboring rs405509 and rs440446 is associated with major alleles of these SNPs. These alleles are also a signature of the less favorable 1001 compound genotype. Accordingly, these findings suggest that the less beneficial effect of the ε2 allele when it is in the 1001 profile can be due to the rs405509- and rs440446-associated repressed promoter state. The five repressed cell lines are models in studies of an immune response and T/B cell biology, and in cancer research. In particular, CD4+ CD25+ab Treg cells negatively regulate the immune response and are involved in the regulation of the immune system homeostasis; they can affect immune functions by inhibiting monocytes/macrophages responses [52]. These cells were also studied for their roles in autoimmune diseases; CD4+ T cell specific eQTLs were particularly found to be enriched among autoimmune-diseases-associated alleles [53]. Thus, we can hypothesize the role of immunomodulation in diminishing the protective effect of the ε2 allele in the 1001 profile. Repressed promoters can be de-repressed by environmental exposures influencing, for example, the epigenetic landscape [54].

Ensembl reports the strongest association (i.e., the largest magnitude of the effect size and the smallest p-value) of TOMM40 rs8106922 intron variant with lower expressions of the APOC1 and APOE in monocyte naive cells. Both these genes are expressed in monocyte-derived macrophages [55, 56]. Studies also suggest that the APOE immunomodulation effect can be partly mediated by the APOC1 gene [57, 58]. These insights provide further support for the hypothesis on the role of immunomodulation in diminishing the protective effect of the ε2 allele in the 1001 profile. TOMM40 regulates protein transport into mitochondria, and mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in neurodegeneration. Gottschalk and colleagues thoroughly reviewed the potential role of TOMM40 in mitochondrial protein intake and its role in neurodegenerative processes [59]. Because mitochondria play important roles in most aspects of cellular metabolism, including innate immunity [59], their dysfunction may also contribute to AD through immunomodulation.

Studies of potential sex dimorphism in the association of the ε2 allele with AD are scarce and controversial. Farrer et al. [60] reported the lack of the differences in the associations of the ε2 allele with AD between sexes in a large-scale meta-analysis. An even larger recent meta-analysis identified a more beneficial effect of the ε2ε3 genotype in women, whereas homozygosity for the ε2 allele was more protective in men [61]. Also, the ε2 allele was associated with better protection against mild cognitive impairment in men [62]. Sex dimorphism in genetic predisposition to AD is typically attributed to the sex-specific function of the APOE protein due to its interaction with sex hormones [63]. Sex hormones such as androgens and estrogens may exert a neuroprotective role by modulating innate immune response [64]. However, studies of potential APOE-related sex-specific functions in neurodegeneration were limited mainly to the ε4 allele [63].

Despite rigor, we acknowledge the limitations of this study. First, studies of the protective effect of the ε2 allele are inherently limited by its small frequency in the general population of European ancestry and a small number of AD cases among them due to the beneficial effect of this allele. Accordingly, although this study included a large sample from seven cohorts, further validation of our results in other independent cohorts would provide additional strength. Second, larger samples are needed to understand better the relative roles of the ε2 homozygosity and the 0111 genotype in AD. Third, we did not examine the roles of many AD biomarkers, physiological, behavioral, and cardiovascular factors as potential mediators or modulators of the identified genetic associations with AD because such information was not readily available in most datasets in our study.

In conclusion, we show that the ε2ε3 heterozygote exerts a strong protective association with AD in men when it is accompanied by the major allele homozygote of TOMM40 rs8106922 and heterozygotes of APOE rs405509 and rs440446 SNPs. This effect is the same as in women, and it is 38% more beneficial than that of the ε2ε3 heterozygote when it is accompanied by the rs8106922 heterozygote and rs405509 and rs440446 major allele homozygotes. These findings implicate a critical role of genetic heterogeneity in predisposition to AD. No differences in the AD associations of these two most common genotypes were identified in women. These compound genotypes were not robustly associated with AD biomarkers such as CSF and brain volume in our exploratory analysis of UKB. The differential role of the ε2ε3 heterozygote may be affected by different immunomodulation functions of the rs8106922, rs405509, and rs440446 variants. The observed sex dimorphism may be attributed to the effects of sex-specific hormones. This study shows that the analyses of the effects of SNP combinations may dissect genetic heterogeneity in predisposition to AD and, consequently, help in determining more homogeneous polygenic profiles with stronger protection against AD. By implicating the effects of compound genotypes in AD, our study emphasizes the need for examining processes generating such complex architectures of AD. This can be done by studying coherent genomic processes at different omics levels and a better understanding of the roles of endophenotypes in AD pathogenesis.

Column Sample indicates PCB, LOADFS (Late-Onset AD Family Study), ADGC (AD Genetics Consortium), and ADSP (AD Sequencing Project) samples. The PCB sample includes data from the Health and Retirement Study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, and the Framingham Heart Study original and offspring cohorts.

Column Genotype shows the reference APOE ε3ε3 genotype and the other compound genotypes used in the analysis. Symbols 0 and 1 in genotypes 0111 and 1001 indicate the major allele homozygote and heterozygote, respectively, of SNPs ordered as rs8106922 (TOMM40, A/g), rs405509 (APOE, G/t), rs440446 (APOE, G/c), and rs7412 (APOE, C/t). Upper/lower case denotes here major/minor allele. Variants 0111 and 1001 denote AAGtGcCt and AgGGGGCt compound genotypes, respectively. With no carriers of the ε4 allele, the rs7412 Ct heterozygote encodes the ε2ε3 genotype. The other_ε2 category denotes all other ε2-bearing compound genotypes pooled together because of a small number of AD cases in individual compound genotypes.

NAD and NNAD depict the number of AD-affected and unaffected subjects; SE is the standard error.

The “other_ε2” category in PCB sample included less than 10 AD cases. To comply with the data use agreement with HRS, which is a part of PCB, the estimates for this category were omitted.

Column PCB AD-unaffected vs. indicates outcomes constructed using AD-unaffected subjects only in each sample. PCB subjects are used as non-cases, whereas LOADFS, ADGC, or ADSP subjects are used as cases in the model.

NNL shows the number of the AD-unaffected subjects in PCB sample; N is the number of the AD-unaffected subjects in the study shown in column PCB AD-unaffected vs.; SE is the standard error.

The effect size indicates the increase (positive direction) or decrease (negative direction) of frequencies of the ε2-bearing compound genotypes in the AD-unaffected sample from LOADFS, ADGC, or ADSP compared to the AD-unaffected sample from the PCB reference population.
