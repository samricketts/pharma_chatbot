INTRODUCTION:

The impact of cardiovascular risk burden on brain pathologies remains unclear. We aimed to examine the association of Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score (FGCRS) with dementia risk, and brain pathologies.

METHODS:

Within the Rush Memory and Aging Project, 1,588 dementia-free participants were assessed FGCRS at baseline and followed up to 21 years. During the follow-up, 621 participants died and underwent autopsies.

RESULTS:

The multi-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of FGCRS were 1.03 (1.00–1.07) for dementia and 1.04 (1.01–1.07) for Alzheimer’s dementia. Further, a higher FGCRS was associated with higher gross chronic cerebral infarctions (odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% CI 1.02–1.14), cerebral atherosclerosis (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03–1.17) and global Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.12).

CONCLUSIONS:

A higher FGCRS is associated with an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia. Both vascular and AD pathologies in the brain may underlie this association.

pmc1. INTRODUCTION

Due to population aging worldwide, the number of people affected by dementia is increasing, posing one of the greatest challenges for health and social care in the 21st century [1]. As an effective treatment for dementia is still not available, identifying modifiable risk factors and promoting the prevention of it has been the priority of public health authorities [1, 2].

Many studies have investigated the impact of individual cardiovascular risk factors, including old age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking and hypercholesterolemia, on dementia risk, and shown inconsistent results [3–8]. Given that these cardiovascular risk factors tend to cluster and interact in an individual [9], a multivariate risk prediction algorithm incorporating these risk factors is preferable to examine the overall impact of cardiovascular risk burden on dementia. The Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score (FGCRS) is a predictive algorithm to assess cardiovascular risk burden and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), by incorporating demographics (i.e., age and sex) with traditional cardiovascular risk factors [10]. We have recently reported that FGCRS was associated with cognitive decline [11]. Several other studies have used different composite scores summarizing vascular risk factors (including FGCRS and the dementia risk score) to predict dementia risk [12–15]. However, uncertainty remains regarding the association of multiple vascular risk factors in combination (such as FGCRS) with the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia.

Although a cardiovascular risk burden has been recognized as important target to prevent dementia [2], the mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood. In aging and dementia research, postmortem neuropathological evaluation generally includes a uniform and structured assessment of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, vascular pathology, Lewy body disease, and other pathologies [16]. Several neuropathological studies have focused on individual cardiovascular risk factor and brain pathologies with some inconsistent findings [17–22]. Few studies have shown the association of diabetes or hypertension with AD pathology such as neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [17, 21]. However, other studies have shown that diabetes, hypertension, or the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (including age, systolic blood pressure, current smoking status, antihypertensive medication use, prevalent diabetes, prevalent CVD, and prevalent atrial fibrillation) is related to cerebrovascular pathologies (including cortical infarctions and arteriosclerosis stage) but not AD pathology [18–20, 22]. Possible explanations for the discrepancies could be explained by the differences in age of the study populations, study settings, ascertainment of the exposure, assessment of brain pathologies, follow-up time and major causes of death among these studies. Therefore, the association of vascular risk burden with brain pathology, especially AD pathology needs to be further clarified in population-based cohort studies with neuropathological examinations.

In the present study, we aimed to examine the association of cardiovascular risk burden assessed by FGCRS with the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia, and further to explore the relationship of FGCRS with vascular and AD pathologies in the brain.

2. METHODS

2.1 Study population

The Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) is an ongoing, longitudinal cohort study consisting of older adults from continuous care retirement communities, senior and subsidized housing, church groups and social service agencies in northeastern Illinois [23]. At the time of enrollment and thereafter, all participants underwent a comprehensive clinical assessment, neurologic examination, and extensive cognitive testing conducted by trained staff. Details regarding the MAP study design and evaluation protocol have been provided previously [23].

Beginning in 1997 through 2019, 2,155 participants were annually followed up for a maximum of 21 years. Among all participants, we excluded 115 participants with prevalent dementia, 311 with missing information on FGCRS at study entry, and 282 without data on clinical diagnosis of cognitive status after baseline examination. Thus, 1,588 dementia-free participants were included in the current study. Among them, 727 participants died during the follow-up, and of whom, 621 (85.42%) underwent autopsy (Supplementary Figure 1).

The study was approved by an Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Written informed consent and an Anatomic Gift Act was obtained from all participants at baseline as well as a repository consent, which allowed the data to be shared.

2.2 Data collection

Data on demographic characteristics, anthropometrics, and lifestyle factors were collected at study entry [24]. Education was recorded as the maximum years of formal schooling. Weight and height were measured and recorded by a trained technician; body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2). Grams of alcohol consumption was measured by the average amount of alcohol (including beer, wine, and liquor) consumed per day during the past year. Physical activity was assessed by the total hours of participation per week, based on the National Health Interview Survey. Smoking was categorized as never or former, and current smoker.

Information on medical conditions was also collected based on self-report during the interview and clinical/neurologic examination at study entry [24]. Blood pressure was measured twice in the sitting position with a 5-minute interval using a mercury sphygmomanometer. The mean of two values was recorded. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg or the use of antihypertensive drugs. Diabetes was defined by any of the following criteria: hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%, fasting plasma glucose ≥126mg/dL, random blood glucose ≥200mg/dL, history of diabetes, or the use of diabetes medication [25]. Heart disease was ascertained based on self-report. Clinical stroke diagnosis was made by clinicians through self-report and neurological examination and was dichotomized as probable versus not present. Blood samples were taken at study entry and total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were measured with a lipid panel. In addition, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) alleles genotype was assessed by Polymorphic DNA Technologies (Alameda, CA) and was categorized as ε4 carriers or non-carriers. Additional details about the data collection can be found on the RADC Resource Sharing Hub at www.radc.rush.edu.

2.3 Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score

FGCRS was calculated based on age, sex, smoking, SBP, medication for hypertension, TC, HDL cholesterol, and diabetes for each participant at study entry (as shown in Supplementary Table 1 and 2) [10]. Missing data on TC and HDL cholesterol at study entry (n=340) was imputed using data within five years, if the participants had no dementia. The score was obtained by summing up the points from all these risk factors and was further categorized into tertiles as the lowest, middle, and the highest (risk categories: lowest risk= 4~13, middle risk=14~16, highest risk=17~28). A higher FGCRS indicates a greater risk of future cardiovascular events.

2.4 Assessment of mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer’s dementia

Clinical diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (including Alzheimer’s and non-Alzheimer’s dementia) were made by clinicians at each assessment following a standard procedure, taking into account scores of cognitive tests and clinical judgment of neuropsychologists [26, 27]. MCI was defined as having cognitive impairment without meeting criteria for dementia [26]. Clinical diagnoses of dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia were based on criteria of the joint working group of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) [27]. The diagnosis of Alzheimer’s dementia requires evidence of a meaningful decline in cognitive function relative to a previous level of performance with impairment in memory and at least one other area of cognition [27].

2.5 Assessment of brain pathologies

The procedures of postmortem neuropathological evaluation followed recommendation by the National Alzheimer’s Disease Coordinating Center (NACC). Examiners blinded to all clinical data followed a standard protocol for tissue preservation, tissue sectioning, and quantification of pathologic findings, as previous described [28]. We also generated a global AD pathology burden which was dichotomized by the median [29]. Chronic infarcts including gross infarcts and microinfarcts [16], cerebral vascular disease pathology including atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy [30], typical hippocampal sclerosis [31] and Lewy bodies [16] were categorized as present or absent.

2.6 Statistical analysis

The characteristics of the study population by FGCRS tertiles were compared using one-way ANOVA and nonparametric tests (chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests).

Multiple imputation by chained equation was used to impute data for 381 (24.0%) participants with missing values on covariates. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia associated with cardiovascular risk burden (i.e., continuous and categorical FGCRS). Follow-up time was calculated as the time from study entry to dementia diagnosis, death, or the last examination. To further explore the role of APOE ε4 in the association between FGCRS and dementia, an interaction term of FGCRS categories and APOE ε4 status was included in the models first, and then stratified analysis by APOE ε4 was performed. Binomial logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs of the relationship between FGCRS at baseline and burdens of AD and other brain pathologies. The basic models were adjusted for age [13], sex and education. The multi-adjusted models were further adjusted for BMI, heart disease, stroke, alcohol consumption, physical activity and APOE ε4. Considering that persons with a lower FGCRS might live longer leading to further accrued brain pathology due to other insults to the brain, we additionally adjusted for the time from study entry until death in logistic regression.

In supplementary analysis, we excluded 385 individuals with MCI at study entry, and the association between FGCRS and dementia was checked among cognitively intact participants at study entry (n=1,203). We also repeated the analyses by excluding participants with missing values for covariates. The level of statistical significance was set at a P value less than 0.05. All analyses were performed with Stata SE for windows, version 15.0 (Stata Corp LP., College Station, Texas, USA).

3. RESULTS

3.1 Characteristics of the study population

Among the 1,588 dementia-free participants (1,203 [75.76%] women and 385 [24.24%] men; mean [SD] age, 79.50 [7.45] years), FGCRS ranged from 4 to 28 (mean [SD] score= 15.64 [3.74]). Of all participants, 454 (28.6%) had the lowest cardiovascular risk burden, 475 (29.9%) were in the middle tertile, and 659 (41.5%) belonged to the highest tertile. Compared to participants with the lowest FGCRS tertlie, those with the highest were more likely to be older and male, to have lower education, HDL, physical activity and MMSE, higher BMI and SBP, as well as more likely to have diabetes, heart disease and stroke at study entry (Table 1).

Participants with incident dementia were more likely to have higher FGCRS compared to those without (Supplementary Table 3). Compared to the survivals, participants died were more likely to be male, older, less educated, and have higher FGCRS and more vascular disorders (Supplementary Table 4).

3.2 Relationship of cardiovascular risk burden to dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia

Over 10,030 person-years of follow-up (median= 6.00 years, range= 1–21 years), 378 participants developed dementia, including 343 with Alzheimer’s dementia. In both basic- (age, sex and education) and multi-adjusted (additionally adjusted for BMI, heart disease, stroke, alcohol consumption, physical activity and APOE ε4) Cox models, FGCRS as a continuous variable was dose-dependently related to dementia (multi-adjusted HR=1.03, 95% CI 1.00–1.07), and Alzheimer’s dementia (multi-adjusted HR=1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.07). Compared with those in the lowest FGCRS tertile, the multi-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia related to the highest FGCRS were 1.31 (1.00–1.72) and 1.37 (1.03–1.83), respectively (Table 2). No interaction between FGCRS and APOE ε4 on dementia was detected (all P values &gt;0.05). In the stratified analysis by APOE ε4, the association between higher FGCRS and increased dementia or Alzheimer’s dementia risk was present only among APOE ε4 non-carriers, but not among carriers (Table 3).

3.3 Relationship of cardiovascular risk burden to brain pathologies

Among 621 participants who underwent autopsies, multi-adjusted logistic regression showed that a higher FGCRS was associated with a higher burden of gross chronic cerebral infarctions (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02–1.14), cerebral atherosclerosis (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03–1.17) and AD pathologies (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.12), but not with other brain pathologies (Table 4).

Compared with those in the lowest FGCRS tertile, ORs (95% CIs) of gross chronic cerebral infarctions, cerebral atherosclerosis and AD pathology in relation to the highest FGCRS tertile were 1.43 (0.90–2.29), 2.18 (1.28–3.73) and 1.73 (1.09–2.74), respectively (Figure 1).

3.4 Supplementary analysis

The association of FGCRS with dementia or Alzheimer’s dementia was not substantially altered when we repeated the following analyses: 1) by excluding participants with MCI at study entry (n=385) (Supplementary Table 5), and 2) by excluding participants with missing values (n=380) (Supplementary Table 6), and 3) by removing age from the covariates in the Cox regression analysis (Supplementary Table 7). Finally, we performed stratified analysis by sex, and the association between FGCRS and dementia did not differ much between men (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00–1.16) and women (HR 1.03, 95% 1.00–1.06).

4. DISCUSSION

In this community-based prospective study of older adults, we found that: 1) a higher cardiovascular risk burden assessed by FGCRS was associated with an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia in a dose-dependent manner; and 2) a higher FGCRS was related to the presence of both cerebral infarctions and atherosclerosis, and AD pathologies. Our study suggests that in addition to vascular lesions, a high cardiovascular risk burden is also associated with neurodegenerative changes in the brain.

The relationship between individual cardiovascular risk factor and dementia has been well documented, yet the findings have been inconsistent. Three studies showed that older age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were individually associated with dementia [3, 5, 6]. By contrast, one study reported that the decline in serum TC level may be a marker of preclinical dementia [4]. Another study also found that TC was significantly lower in both Alzheimer’s dementia and vascular dementia cases [8]. Moreover, pooled results from a secondary analysis of the 10/66 population-based cohort study indicated that there was no significant association between smoking and dementia of any kind [7]. Only longitudinal study examining the association between FGCRS and dementia showed that a higher CVD risk was associated with a greater risk of dementia [13]. In the current study, we found that FGCRS was associated with an increased the risk of dementia, and Alzheimer’s dementia.

Exploring the association between FGCRS and neuropathological changes in the brain is essential to understand the pathogenesis of dementia in relation to cardiovascular risk burden. Although several neuropathological studies have examined the association between cardiovascular risk factor and AD pathologies, the underlying mechanisms have not been entirely understood. Studies showed that diabetes was associated with neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus [17], and that an elevated blood pressure has also been suggested to compromise vascular integrity, leading to cerebral amyloid angiopathy and impaired Aβ clearance from the brain [21]. However, the association of diabetes or hypertension with AD pathology was not found in other studies [18–20]. Moreover, mid-life vascular risk burden assessed by the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile was predictive of cerebrovascular pathologies, but not AD pathology [22]. In addition, another autopsy study showed the association between dementia risk score (incorporating age, sex, education, SBP, BMI, cholesterol, physical activity and APOE ε4 status) and cerebral infarcts [32]. However, neuroimaging studies indicated the association of vascular risk factors (including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, depression, smoking, alcohol abuse, ischemic attack, stroke, obesity and cardiovascular disorders) with Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid [33], and the relation of dementia risk score to both neurodegeneration and vascular lesions [34–36]. Accumulating evidence has suggested the impact of vascular risk factors on both vascular and degenerative brain changes.

In the current study, we found that a higher FGCRS was not only associated with higher gross chronic cerebral infarctions and cerebral atherosclerosis, but also AD pathology. These findings support our recent report that a higher FGCRS was related to smaller volumes of the hippocampus, total gray matter and total brain volumes (i.e., neurodegenerative markers), but a greater white matter hyperintensities volume (i.e., a marker of vascular lesions) [11].

A cerebral infarction is an area of necrotic tissue in the brain resulting from a blockage or narrowing in the arteries supplying blood and oxygen to the brain. While, cerebral atherosclerosis is a type of atherosclerosis where build-up of plaque in the blood vessels of the brain, and this may cause infarctions leading to stroke, as well as vascular dementia. It is well-known that vascular risk burden is related to stroke, thus it is not surprise that we found high vascular risk burden in relation to dementia risk. However, emerging evidence suggests that brain vascular lesions (such as infarcts and atherosclerosis) caused by cardiovascular risk factors might disclose the expression of AD pathology in old age [37]. Vascular and neurodegenerative brain damage may overlap and develop in parallel, leading to more severe cognitive disorder than either single pathological process [38]. Mixed pathologies are very common in the aging brain [38]. Indeed, in this study, we found a significant association between high vascular risk burden and AD pathologies, supporting the notion that both brain vascular and neurodegenerative lesions may underlie the vascular risk burden-dementia association. Therefore, it is crucial for public health to identify older adults with higher vascular burden for the prevention of clinical consequences (i.e., dementia) using tools measuring vascular risk burden. FGCRS was developed to identify clinical peripheral vascular events and has been extended to identify individuals at risk for stroke. However, there is a paucity of studies which have examined to what extent FGCRS may predict brain pathologies. Our results indicate that cardiovascular risk burden may contribute to not only vascular but also AD pathologies, suggesting that FGCRS may also identify older adults at risk for accumulating AD pathologies in the brain.

The biological mechanisms contributing to the link of FGCRS to both vascular and AD pathologies may involve complex processes. Exposure to cardiovascular risk factors might accelerate cognitive decline by causing cerebral hypoperfusion, hypoxia, emboli, or infarcts [39]. In addition, cardiovascular risk factors have divergent effects on cerebral blood flow velocity, which may contribute to dementia due to vascular brain lesions [40]. Furthermore, epidemiological and clinicopathological studies have shown that multiple larger infarcts are more commonly present in mixed dementia (i.e., Alzheimer’s dementia plus vascular dementia) [41–43]. Meanwhile, vascular impairment accompanies or even precedes the development of AD pathology, which plays a dominant role in the pathogenesis of AD [37]. Blood-brain barrier dysfunction and cerebral hypoperfusion play a central and pivotal role in the heterogenous etiological profile of AD [37]. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular events may trigger AD pathological processes in the brain through mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress, reduced adenosine triphosphate synthesis and impaired cellular metabolism [44]. This process particularly occurs in the brain areas that are most susceptible to brain hypoperfusion [45, 46]. At the same time, further circulation defects caused by hypoxia change the peptide clearance rate, promoting brain deposition of Aβ and, consequently Alzheimer’s dementia occurrence [47]. Therefore, some researchers even consider that Alzheimer’s dementia is mainly a cerebrovascular injury rather than a neurodegenerative disorder [48, 49].

APOE ε4 is a well-established genetic risk factor for dementia. Several studies have examined the role of APOE ε4 in the association between vascular risk factors and dementia, and results have been mixed. Two studies reported that diabetes and smoking were associated with a higher dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia risk in APOE ε4 carriers [50, 51]. One study found that high cholesterol in late life was associated with a higher Alzheimer’s dementia risk in APOE ε4 carriers [52], while in APOE ε4 non-carriers in another study [53]. In the current study, we found that the association between FGCRS and dementia/Alzheimer’s dementia was present among APOE ε4 non-carriers, but not among carriers. This can be explained by the following reasons. First, APOE ε4 carriers might have been excluded at study entry because they were more likely to develop dementia [54], whereas APOE ε4 non-carriers might require further physiological insults, such as cardiovascular risk burden, to bring them to the threshold for expressing dementia/ Alzheimer’s dementia. Second, similar to a previous study assessing the interaction between APOE genotype and different vascular risk to the occurrence of dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia among old people [55], we also did not find a significant interaction between cardiovascular risk burden and APOE ε4 status on dementia/ Alzheimer’s dementia. However, the smaller sample size of APOE ε4 carriers (n=367) in our study might have led to a lack of statistical power. Thus, the role of ε4 in the FGCRS-dementia associations needs further investigation.

Notable strengths of our study involve the long-term follow-up, a relatively large sample size, and the access to brain pathological data among deceased participants. Furthermore, by generating a composite score using multiple cardiovascular risk factors, we were able to study the risk of dementia in relation to the overall cardiovascular risk burden. However, several limitations need to be pointed out. First, our participants were volunteers who were not randomly selected from the community, and about 76% of participants were woman in this study. However, the association between FGCRS and dementia was similar in men and in women. Second, 13.09% of participants dropped out mainly due to poor health conditions, thus, the association of FGCRS with dementia and brain pathologies in this study might have been underestimated. Third, several medical conditions and lifestyle behaviours were self-reported retrospectively, which could be subject to measurement error. Fourth, caution is required when generalizing our findings, especially the results regarding the brain pathology, to younger population because of the mean age of our population was 79.5 years. Finally, residual confounding due to unmeasured factors could not be completely ruled out.

In conclusion, our study provides new evidence that a higher cardiovascular burden evaluated by FGCRS is associated with an increased risk of demetnia and Alzheimer’s dementia, and both vascuar leisions and neurodegeneration may underlie this association. Our findings underscore the detrimental effect of a high cardiovascular risk burden on the brain. Interventions designed to maintain cardiovascular health may represent important opportunities for the prevention of dementing disorders.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

1. Systematic review:

PubMed and Web of Science databases were systematically searched, and titles and abstracts were screened. The Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score (FGCRS) is a multivariate risk prediction algorithm incorporating traditional cardiovascular risk factors, which is preferable to examine the overall impact of cardiovascular risk burden on dementia. Several studies have used composite scores summarizing vascular risk factors (such as FGCRS and the dementia risk score) to predict dementia risk, however the association of vascular risk burden with Alzheimer’s dementia remains to be further explored. Moreover, studies examining the association of FGCRS with brain pathologies based on autopsy data have been sparse. It is still unclear about the relation of cardiovascular risk burden and AD pathology.

2. Interpretation:

In this population-based cohort study, we found that a higher cardiovascular risk burden evaluated by FGCRS was associated with an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia. In addition to vascular lesions, high cardiovascular risk burden may also lead to neurodegenerative changes in the brain. Our findings underscore the detrimental effect that a heavy cardiovascular risk burden can have on the brain and highlight the importance of maintaining cardiovascular health to prevent or delay dementing disorders.

3. Future directions:

Further studies are warranted to examine the effect of cardiovascular risk burden on the risk of dementia and explore the mechanisms linking cardiovascular risk, neurodegenerative disease, and cognitive disorders.
