Down's syndrome (DS; also known as trisomy 21; T21) is caused by a triplication of all or part of human chromosome 21 (chr21). DS is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability attributable to a naturally-occurring imbalance in gene dosage. DS incurs huge medical, healthcare and socioeconomic costs and there are as yet no effective treatments for this incapacitating human neurogenetic disorder. There is a remarkable wide variability in the ‘phenotypic spectrum’ associated with DS, the progression of symptoms and the age of DS onset fluctuate, and there are further variabilities of the biophysical nature of the chr21 duplication. Besides the cognitive disruptions and dementia in DS patients other serious health problems such as atherosclerosis, altered lipogenesis, Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; Lou Gehrig's disease), autoimmune disease, various cancers including lymphoma, leukemia, glioma and glioblastoma, status epilepticus, congenital heart disease, hypotonia, manic depression, prostate cancer, Usher syndrome, motor disorders, Hirschsprung disease, and various physical anomalies such as early aging occur at elevated frequencies, and all are part of the Down syndrome ‘phenotypic spectrum’. This communication will review the genetic link between these fore-mentioned diseases and a small group of just 5 stress-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) - that include let-7c, miRNA-99a, miRNA125b, miRNA-155 and miRNA-802 – encoded and clustered on the long arm of human chr21 and spanning the chr21q21.1-chr21q21.3 region.

Introduction

Linking the chr21 gene dosage imbalance in DS with the considerable variability of the DS phenotype has been an elusive goal in the study of trisomy 21 activity, function, genetics and epigenetics (Hattori et al., 2000; Antonarakis 2017; Castro et al., 2017; Max Plank Institute 2017; NCBI 2017; Vega Genome Browser 54: Homo sapiens 2017). Interestingly a single copy gene encoding the 770 amino acid beta amyloid precursor protein (βAPP), the precursor to the 42 amino acid amyloid beta (Aβ42) peptide that accumulates in both familial and sporadic AD and DS brains is encoded at chr21q21.3; virtually all DS patients exhibit AD-type pathological change as they age, including progressive Aβ42 peptide accumulation (Castro et al., 2017a; Hithersay et al., 2017). Evidence associating a specific gene or chr21 domain to a particular phenotype has been restricted and relatively limited in chr21 genomic studies (Hattori et al., 2000; Antonarakis 2017; Castro et al., 2017; Hithersay et al., 2017). Another understudied and perhaps underappreciated area of trisomy 21 gene triplication are the potential contribution of chr21-encoded micro RNAs (miRNAs), their DS-associated increase in abundance (because of the extra chr21 copy - a gene dosage effect), and their enormous potential to shape and regulate the DS transcriptome, and hence alter both pathogenic and global gene expression patterns (Hattori et al., 2000; Li et al., 2012; Ghorai et al., 2014; Hithersay et al., 2017).

miRNAs represent a novel and intriguing group of endogenous small non-protein-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) that are evolutionary conserved and widely distributed amongst all species so far studied in both the plant and animal kingdoms (Guo et al., 2010; Eichhorn et al., 2014; Hruska-Plochan et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2015; Hill and Lukiw 2016; Liu et al., 2017). Interestingly a single miRNA can regulate multiple target genes dispersed throughout all somatic chromosomes, indicating that miRNAs may regulate multiple signaling pathways and participate in numerous physiological and pathological processes. The major mode of action of these sncRNAs is to interact, via base-pair complementarity, with the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and in doing so decrease the expression of that particular target mRNA, and hence act as negative regulators of target gene expression. Ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing have shown that up-regulated miRNAs act predominantly to decrease their target mRNA levels, and miRNA-mediated destabilization of mRNAs is the main reason for the observed reductions in gene expression as are characteristic of both AD and DS brains (Guo et al., 2010; Codocedo et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017).

Consisting of 48 million base pairs (Mbp) and representing ∼1.5% of total cellular DNA, chr21 contains a relatively low number of identified genes (∼225), for example, compared with the 545 genes reported for the 49 Mbp chromosome 22 (chr22; Hattori et al., 2000). Equally under-represented is the small number of just 5 microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded and clustered around the long arm of chr21 spanning the chr21q21.1-chr21q21.3 region (compared to the ∼46 miRNAs encoded on chr22; Dunham et al., 1999; “Vega Genome Browser 54: Homo sapiens 2017; http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org/Indexbychrom/idxg_22.html). Chr21 encoded miRNAs include let-7c, miRNA-99a, miRNA125b, miRNA-155 and miRNA-802. Together specific members of this small miRNA family (i) have been found to be readily detectable in control brains and significantly up-regulated in both AD and DS brains (Zhao et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2016); (ii) are observed to be up-regulated more than gene-dosage effects alone would predict (Li et al., 2012); (iii) includes a subset of micro RNAs including miRNA-99a, miRNA125b and miRNA-155 that are inducible and under NF-kB regulatory control (Lukiw 2007; Lukiw 2012; Prasad 2017; unpublished observations); and (iv) are known to down-regulate the expression of key innate-immune regulatory and anti-inflammatory genes in AD and/or DS (Pogue et al., 2010; Lukiw et al., 2012; Maciotta et al., 2013; Hill et al., 2015; Hill and Lukiw 2016; Nadim et al., 2017). For example, gene dosage mediated increases in the chr21-encoded miRNA-155 have been shown in part to down-regulate the expression of complement factor H (CFH), an important soluble, innate-immune regulatory glycoprotein in AD and DS tissues and in primary brain cell models of AD, and be centrally involved in pathogenic signaling pathways that include inflammatory neurodegeneration (Li et al., 2012; Lukiw 2012; Zhao et al., 2015; Hill and Lukiw 2016).

Concluding Remarks

As research into the molecular-genetics of Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) progresses, more and more neurological (and non-neurological) diseases have been shown to be significantly linked to the Trisomy 21 phenotype. This ‘Short Communications’ paper provides 4 novel findings hitherto unrecognized or undocumented in the research field involving the molecular-genetics of Trisomy 21: (i) for the first time we point out that the 5 microRNAs encoded on the extra copy of chromosome 21 in Downs syndrome have potential to regulate the expression of over 3600 genes (see Table 1 and text); (ii) largely due to the containment of 5 microRNAs encoded on chromosome 21, and the fact that DS is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability attributable to a naturally-occurring imbalance in gene dosage; this communication provides the first example of what was classically considered a neurological-developmental-dementing disorder as also a serious contributor to the development of disease in other major organ systems including the heart, lung, blood, bladder, prostate, thyroid and circulatory system, GI tract, as well as predisposition to many types of cancer; (iii) for the first time we point out the hitherto unappreciated regulatory potential of chromosome 21 in the development of a very broad clinical spectrum of potentially fatal human disease; and (iv) that further study and analysis of these chr21-encoded miRNAs, their mRNA interactions and induction of pathogenic biological pathways provides a greatly expanded list of potential therapeutic targets which would ultimately define the basis for more effective treatments in the clinical management of secondary maladies associated with development of chr21-linked disease.

Perhaps most importantly, miRNA-mRNA integration mapping, in depth RNA sequence analysis using complementarity algorithms and bioinformatics evaluation indicate that these five chr21-encoded miRNAs have the remarkable capacity to potentially regulate the expression approximately 3630 protein-coding genes (Table 1). This rather large number of protein-coding genes targeted by chr21-encoded miRNAs and the chr21 miRNA-mediated potential down-regulation of vast numbers of mRNAs may in part explain the tremendous diversity and complexity of human maladies associated with DS. This knowledge should be useful in targeting miRNA-mediated molecular mechanisms that cause or modify the development and propagation of different DS phenotypes. For example, employing anti-miRNA-based therapeutic strategies directed toward a single or a few chr21 specific miRNAs: (i) could be of therapeutic use in the restoration of essential and homeostatic mRNA and gene expression patterns in DS patients; and/or (ii) may ultimately provide more effective treatments in the clinical management of ancillary maladies associated with the Trisomy 21 phenotype (Lukiw 2013; Antonarakis 2017; Castro et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017).

Down syndrome (DS) or trisomy 21 (T21) results from a gene dosage imbalance that translates into a surprisingly broad clinical spectrum. DS is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability attributable to a naturally-occurring imbalance in gene dosage - a major objective in the study of DS is the identification of functional genetic elements that impact alterations and variations in the DS phenotype. Indeed DS is a primary human model for studying imbalances in gene dosage and provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the molecular and pathogenic consequences of extra chromosomal copies; note that: (i) DS is also associated with multiple other serious age-related human maladies (see text and Table 1 column function/disease association); (ii) the majority of the disease associations listed above are the result of the mis-regulation of let-7c, miRNA-99a, miRNA-125b, miRNA-155 and/or miRNA-802 abundance and expression; (iii) all 5 chr21-encoded miRNAs are located within the relatively narrow domain on the long arm of chr21 from chr21q21.1 to chr21q21.3; (iv) all 5 chr21-encoded miRNAs have strong genome-wide regulatory effects; (v) miRNA-99a, miRNA125b and miRNA-155 are inducible and under NF-kB regulatory control (Hill et al., 2015; unpublished observations); and (vi) at least 3 of these miRNAs encoded on chr21 are significantly increased in expression in AD and/or DS (miRNA-125b, miRNA-155 and miRNA-802; Lukiw 2007; Li et al., 2012; Devier et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2015; Castro et al., 2017). Interestingly, of the 2650 human miRNAs so far identified, only about 35-40 are highly expressed in the human brain and retina and of these miRNA-125b and miRNA-155 are encoded on chr21 (Hattori et al., 2000; Li et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2015; Antonarakis, 2017);

* the number of potential miRNA-mRNA interactions was assessed using the MicroCosm Targets Version 5 (miRBase; EMBL-EBI) algorithm.
