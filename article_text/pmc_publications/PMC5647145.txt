Protein modification by O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is emerging as an important factor in the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, however detailed molecular characterization of this important protein posttranslational modification at proteome level has been highly challenging, due to its low stoichiometry and labile nature. Herein we report the most comprehensive, quantitative proteomics analysis for protein O-GlcNAcylation in post-mortem human brain tissues with and without Alzheimer’s disease using isobaric tandem mass tags labeling, chemoenzymatic photocleavage enrichment and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. A total of 1,850 O-GlcNAc peptides covering 1,094 O-GlcNAcylation sites were identified from 530 proteins in the human brain. One hundred and thirty one O-GlcNAc peptides covering 81 proteins were altered in Alzheimer’s brain as compared to controls (q &lt;0.05). Moreover, alteration of O-GlcNAc peptide abundance could be attributed more to O-GlcNAcylation level than to protein level changes. The altered O-GlcNAcylated proteins belong to several structural and functional categories, including synaptic proteins, cytoskeleton proteins and memory-associated proteins. These findings suggest that dysregulation of O-GlcNAcylation of multiple brain proteins may be involved in the development of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease.

Introduction

O-GlcNAcylation is an important protein modification in which Ser/Thr residues are modified with a single β-N-acetylglucosamine [1]. O-GlcNAcylation is generally considered as a post-translational modification (PTM), but it may also occur co-translationally [2]. In living organisms, O-GlcNAc is dynamically regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). O-GlcNAc has been found to modify many proteins and may play important roles in regulating diverse cellular processes such as metabolism [3], signalling [4], transcription [5] and protein quality control [2].

Recently, the possible link between O-GlcNAc and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has attracted attention [6,7]. Most cases of AD (~99%) are sporadic and may be caused by multiple etiological factors including epigenetic, environmental and metabolic factors. Metabolic factors may play the most significant roles in the development of this disease [8]. One of the earliest and most obvious brain metabolic changes is decreased brain glucose uptake and metabolism [9]. As a known molecular sensor of intracellular metabolism and stress, O-GlcNAcylation may mediate several pathways in disrupted brain metabolism. Thus, comprehensive understanding of brain protein O-GlcNAcylation and its dysregulation in AD may contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to its sporadic development.

However, issues such as the low levels and labile nature of O-GlcNAcylation have posed significant analytical challenges for the direct proteomic characterization of O-GlcNAc peptides using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); the ability to quantify O-GlcNAc in large scale is also largely absent. Advances recently made in the proteomics field are increasingly enabling high-fidelity MS characterization of O-GlcNAc peptides [10] using techniques such as lectin affinity chromatography [11] and chemoenzymatic photocleavage (CEPC) [12] methods for enrichment, electron transfer dissociation (ETD) for site determination [13], and stable isotope labeling methods for precise quantification [14–16]. In this report, we developed an integrated proteomic pipeline consisting of isobaric tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling [17], high-pH reversed-phase LC (bRPLC) fractionation and concatenation [18], CEPC enrichment [12,19] and LC-MS/MS for comprehensive, quantitative and large-scale analysis of protein O-GlcNAc. Application of this proteomic pipeline to characterize O-GlcNAcylation in post-mortem human brains from individuals with or without AD led to the identification of a total of 1,850 O-GlcNAc peptides from 530 proteins (with 1,094 confidently assigned O-GlcNAc sites), among which 131 O-GlcNAc peptides altered significantly in AD.

Materials and Methods

Brain tissue homogenization and digestion

Autopsied post-mortem frozen brain tissue samples from 10 pathologically confirmed AD cases and 10 matched controls with no neurological pathologies or symptoms (Table S1) were obtained from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program (Sun City, AZ). The use of the frozen human brain tissue was in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of New York State Institute for Basic Research and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. All AD cases were in Braak stage V or VI. AD cases and controls were matched in terms of age of death, post-mortem interval and gender. The grey matter (~0.1 g) of the mid frontal gyrus of each sample was homogenized in 600 μl lysis buffer (8 M urea, 60 mM NH4HCO3, 1x HALT phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Pierce), 20 μM PUGNAc and 10 mM dithiothreitol). After homogenization, proteins were reduced at 37 °C for 1 h and alkylated at room temperature (RT) for 30 min in the dark (25 mM iodoacetamide). The sample was then diluted one fold with 50 mM NH4HCO3, 2 mM CaCl2, and digested twice with trypsin (1:50 enzyme-to-substrate ratio), first for 3 h at 37 °C, then overnight at RT. The sample was acidified with 10% trifluoroacetic acid and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 20 min before being desalted by C18 solid phase extraction and dried. Peptide concentration was determined with BCA assay (Pierce).

TMT labeling and fractionation

A pooled reference was first created with equal contribution from each sample. Each individual sample containing ~600 μg of peptides was dried and dissolved in 180 μL of 250 mM sodium borate, pH 8.6, before 5 mg of TMT reagent in 430 μL acetonitrile was added. The TMT-6 labeling scheme is shown in Table S2. The reaction was allowed to carry on at RT for 90 min before termination with 5% hydroxylamine. Samples with different TMT labeling in the same TMT-6 experiment were combined, acidified and desalted on C18 solid phase extraction column, followed by bRPLC fractionation and concatenation [18]. Mobile phases were: A) 10 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB), pH 7.5 and B) 10 mM TEAB, 90% acetonitrile, pH 7.5. Sample separation was carried out at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min using the following gradient (minute: B%): 0:0, 35:0, 41:10, 127:30, 137:42.5, 142:55, 147:100, 148:0 and 178:0. Fractions were collected from 48 to 164 min with equal intervals of 1.2 min and the fractions were concatenated into 6 final fractions.

Enrichment of O-GlcNAc peptide

Enrichment of O-GlcNAc peptide from the fractions followed the CEPC method [12,19] with minor modifications. After removing a small aliquot (~10 μg) for direct LC-MS/MS analysis to provide global protein quantification and as a means for loading normalization, the fractionated peptides (~300 μg) were dried in vacuum and re-suspended in 1.1 mL of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, and 80 μL of 100 mM MnCl2, 75 μL of 0.5 mM UDP-GalNAz, 62 μL of GalT1 and 2.5 μL of PNGase F (New England Biolabs) were added (N-glycans were removed by PNGase F to improve specificity of the O-GlcNAc enrichment). The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for ~20 h and then at RT for 3 h. After this glycotransfer step, the peptides were reacted with 1 mM biotin-PEG-PC-alkyne (Ambergen) in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9 using 0.8 mM CuSO4, 4 mM tris(3-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl)amine, 20 mM sodium ascorbate, 20 mM aminoguanidine as the catalyst for copper catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition [20]. Extra reagents were removed by C18 and strong cation exchange solid phase extractions. The peptides were neutralized with PBS and incubated with NeutrAvidin agarose resin (Pierce) for 2 h at RT, and washed thoroughly with 2 M Urea in PBS (6x), 4 M Urea in 50 mM NH4HCO3 (6x), 2 M NaCl (6x), water (1x) and 70% methanol (5x). The O-GlcNAc peptides were released from the resin by 365 nm UV radiation for 25 min. One fourth of the enriched sample was injected for LC-MS/MS analysis.

LC-MS/MS analysis

Samples were injected and analyzed using a Waters nanoAquity UPLC system coupled online to a LTQ Orbitrap Velos MS (Thermo Scientific). Mobile phases are: A) 0.1% formic acid in water and B) 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Samples were separated on a 75 μm-i.d. and 70 cm-long column packed with 3μm C18 particles (Phenomenex) using gradient 1 (minute: B%): 0:1, 6:5, 60:12, 225:30, 290:45, 300:95, 310:95 and 315:1 (Experiment 1 and 2; Table S2) or gradient 2: 0:1, 4:8, 45:12, 160:35, 208:60, 215:75, 220:95 and 222:1 (Experiment 3 and 4; Table S2); both at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Full MS spectra (400–2,000 m/z) were acquired with a resolution of 60,000. Top-10 most intensive precursor ions were selected for MS/MS using alternating ETD and higher energy collision dissociation (HCD), both with an isolation window of 2 Da. 100-ms activation time and supplemental activation were used in ETD, and the product ions were detected in an ion trap. 32% normalized collision energy was used in HCD fragmentation, and the product ions were detected in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 7,500.

MS/MS identification

As previously reported [19], the MS raw data were searched against a UniProt protein database (version 2015_04) using MS-GF+ (v9881) [21]. The searching parameters are: precursor ion mass tolerance (±10 ppm), partial tryptic specificity, dynamic oxidation of Met (15.9949 Da), static alkylation on Cys (57.0215 Da), static TMT6 labeling on N-terminal and Lys (229.1629 Da), and dynamic O-GlcNAcylation on Ser and Thr (502.2023 Da). The search results from HCD and ETD spectra were first filtered separately to obtain a false identification rate of &lt;1% at peptide level. The identification of an O-GlcNAc peptide was then confirmed/filtered by the presence of the diagnostic 300.13 m/z ion in subsequent corresponding HCD spectra [19]. An Ascore &gt;13 was required for confident O-GlcNAc site assignment (p &lt;0.05) [22].

Quantitative and statistical analysis

The intensities of all six TMT reporter ions were extracted using MASIC software [23]. The reporter ion intensities from different scans and/or different fractions corresponding to the same O-GlcNAc peptide or protein (in the case of global proteome analysis) were summed. Relative peptide/protein abundance was then calculated as the ratio of sample abundance to abundance of the pooled reference (in the 126 channel) using the summed reporter ion intensities (i.e., sample/reference) and log2 transformed to obtain final relative expression values. This allows comparison of relative protein abundances across the entire sample set with minimum variation from each TMT-6 experiment. The strategy of using a common “internal” reference for merging different multiplexed experiments in isobaric labeling analysis has been demonstrated recently as a highly effective and reliable way for large-scale quantitative proteomics analysis [24,25].

To correct for potential difference in sample loading in the same TMT6 experiment, the median log2 relative abundance of the peptides present in each of the original labeled but not enriched samples were computed and re-centered, and the normalization factors obtained therein were applied to corresponding O-GlcNAc data. Moderated t-test was performed using the limma package [26]. The null hypothesis was that there is no difference between the AD and control groups. To correct for multiplicity of hypothesis testing, individual O-GlcNAc or protein values were adjusted by converting to q-values using corresponding R package [27].

Gene function classification and pathway analysis of the O-GlcNAc proteins in AD were performed using DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) [28]. Motif analysis was carried out using pLogo (https://plogo.uconn.edu/) [29].

Western blotting

Tissue lysates containing 200 μg of protein were subjected to reduction (10 mM dithiothreitol) and alkylation (90 mM iodoacetamide) before precipitation by the methanol/chloroform method and re-constituted in 40 μL of 1% SDS, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9. The sample was then subjected to GalNAz labeling with Click-iT labeling kit (ThermoFisher C33368) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The azide-labeled proteins were linked with a 5 kDa PEG molecule via copper free click chemistry as reported [30]. After the reactions, the proteins were precipitated and re-constituted for SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and detected with rabbit antibodies for QK1 or SYNPO (Pirece PA5-30563 and PA5-21062) using the Fast Western Kits (Pierce) with β-tubulin antibody as loading control.

Data deposition

The LC-MS/MS raw data, database searching results and TMT reporter ion intensity information have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org dataset PXD004510).

Results

Integrated quantitative proteomics for O-GlcNAc modification

An overview of our new quantitative proteomic pipeline for comprehensive O-GlcNAc analysis is shown in Figure 1A. It has several attractive features: (1) TMT labeling allows for precise quantification and sample multiplexing hence much increased analysis throughput, and can be applied to tissues, cells, or biofluids; (2) the “common” reference strategy [24,25] allows for robust O-GlcNAc quantification in a large sample cohort; (3) the CEPC method (Figure 1B) for enriching O-GlcNAc peptides is robust and highly specific and sensitive; and (4) every precursor is analyzed by both ETD and HCD for peptide identification and quantitation and O-GlcNAc site determination. A pair of alternating ETD/HCD spectra are shown in Figure 1C,D.

Mapping of O-GlcNAc in human brain

A total of 1,850 unique peptides (Table S3) from 530 O-GlcNAc proteins (Table S4) were identified. Gene ontology (GO) classification results for these O-GlcNAc proteins are shown in Figure S1. These results supported the involvement of O-GlcNAc in various cellular functions in the brain, including cytoskeleton organization, axonogenesis, cell adhesion and regeneration. KEGG pathway analysis indicated the involvement of O-GlcNAc in extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, lysosome, adherens junction, long-term potentiation and the MAPK signaling pathway. Interestingly, nine secreted proteins related to ECM (TNXB, TNC, COL6A2, COL6A3, LAMA5, LAMC1, LAMB2, HSP2, and LAMA) as well as some membrane proteins including NOTCH were also found to be O-GlcNAcylated. O-GlcNAcylation on these proteins may be the result of the action of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain specific O-GlcNAc transferase (EOGT), which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is responsible for O-GlcNAcylation of extracellular proteins [31].

A total of 1,094 O-GlcNAcylation sites (Table S5) were unambiguously determined (≥95% confidence). More than 85% of the O-GlcNAc sites were identified from ETD (data not shown), while HCD provided additional O-GlcNAc peptide identifications as well as important information on the oxonium ion (additional evidence of O-GlcNAcylation) and TMT reporter ion intensities (quantitation). Eighty six sites were in the O-GlcNAc database from the Phosphosite website (http://www.phosphosite.org) [32], which covered 411 previously reported O-GlcNAcylation sites from human proteins. Many of the O-GlcNAc sites have reciprocal (20.3%) or proximal (within ±10 aa, 54.3%) relationships with phosphorylation sites (Table S5). Moreover, most of (98.9%) O-GlcNAc-modified proteins identified in the present study are known phosphoproteins (Table S4). In our previous study, significantly fewer O-GlcNAc sites found in the healthy mouse brain appeared to have reciprocal (4.6%) or proximal (within ±10 aa, 21.4%) relationships with phosphorylation sites [19].

Interestingly, there is virtually no difference in the motifs of O-GlcNAc modification between human (Figure 2) and mouse (Figure S2). Moreover, the motifs of Ser O-GlcNAcylation and Thr O-GlcNAcylation are surprisingly similar (Figures 2 and S2). This brain O-GlcNAcylation motif feature is consistent to that predicted using the O-GlcNAc prediction programs YinOYang 1.2 server and OGlcNAcScan [33], and predictions based on 410 experimentally verified O-GlcNAcylation sites extracted from dbOGAP, OGlycBase and UniProtKB [34]. Thus, the O-GlcNAcylation motifs appear to be fairly conserved crossing various species and in various organs.

Quantification of O-GlcNAcylation

A total of 623 peptides with quantitative information and also &gt;50% occurrence in the samples were further considered for downstream analyses (Table S6). 131 of the 623 O-GlcNAc peptides showed significant change of abundance in AD (q &lt;0.05; Table S6 and Figure 3A). The changes of these O-GlcNAc peptides across the individual samples are shown as a heatmap in Figure 3B. GO analysis of the proteins carrying these peptides showed that these proteins are involved in zinc ion binding, mRNA transport, transcription, chromatin modification and cell projection organization, as well as the focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction and prion diseases pathways (Figure 3C). Interestingly, among these 131 O-GlcNAc peptides, only 12 peptides from three proteins (SYNPO, ANK3 and SH3RF1) decreased in AD while the majority, 119 peptides, increased in the disease.

We briefly analyzed an aliquot of the TMT-6-labeled, unenriched peptide samples for correcting loading differences in the TMT channels for the enriched O-GlcNAc samples. This also allows us to initially examine if the changes in O-GlcNAc abundance are affected by the changes in protein expression. We quantified a total of 1,635 proteins, and the results are provided in Table S7. Among these quantified proteins, only 27 proteins (1.65%) showed significant changes (q &lt;0.05) in AD (Figures S3 and S4), a much lower frequency of changes than that observed in the O-GlcNAcylated peptides (&gt;20% differed significantly). Moreover, statistical tests of the global peptide quantitation results with (Table S7) and without (Table S9) protein roll-up showed that the proportion of differentially abundant global peptides appeared to be even lower (0.35%) than proteins (see Table S10), confirming the significantly higher level of change in O-GlcNAcylation in these AD samples.

The expression of O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes (OGT and OGA, both quantified in our study) may be an important contributor to the differences in O-GlcNAc abundance. However, we did not find significant changes in the abundances of these enzymes in brains with Alzheimer’s (Figure S5; q =0.60 and q =0.224 for OGT and for OGA, respectively). These global proteome results suggest that most of the changes in O-GlcNAc abundance were due to changes at the O-GlcNAc modification level instead of protein abundance.

The net changes in O-GlcNAcylation (i.e., the change of O-GlcNAcylation on top of the protein expression) were calculated for 306 O-GlcNAc peptides where the protein expression data were also available (Table S8). For these O-GlcNAc net changes, a heatmap is shown in Figure S6, and a volcano plot is shown in Figure S7. Twelve peptides showed increase and twelve peptides showed decrease in O-GlcNAc net changes (q &lt;0.05, Table 1).

Initial validation of protein O-GlcNAcylation level

Western blotting was performed to initially verify the MS quantification data for two proteins, SYNPO (Synaptopodin) and QKI (Protein quaking). The O-GlcNAc was first labelled with GalNAz using Click-iT kit, then a PEG tag (5 kDa) [35] was linked to the azide through copper free click chemistry [30]. Anti-SYNPO and anti-QKI antibodies were used to visualize the proteins in the non-glycosylated and glycosylated forms (Figure 4). O-GlcNAcylation of SYNPO decreased in the Alzheimer’s samples while QKI increased in these samples compared with control samples. These data are in concordance with the MS quantification results.

Discussion

AD has two types, early onset familial AD and late onset sporadic type. Most (~99%) cases are sporadic and appear to be caused by multiple etiological factors through several pathogenetic mechanisms [36]. Our findings of the alterations of multiple O-GlcNAcylated proteins in the brains of sporadic Alzheimer’s are consistent with the complex nature of the disease. These altered O-GlcNAcylated proteins cover various functional categories, with more proteins involved in mRNA transport and transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. A pivotal role of epigenetic dysregulation has gained much attention recently in the development of sporadic AD, which could result from or through the altered O-GlcNAcylation of these proteins [37,38].

There have been several studies on the overall O-GlcNAcylation level in AD using antibody-based approaches, however with conflicting results (downregulated [39,40] and upregulated [41,42]). Note that no PUGNAc was used to preserve O-GlcNAc in these studies. With PUGNAc used in the present study, our MS quantification data showed more O-GlcNAc peptides increased rather than decreased in abundance in brains with AD. The MS-based methods also provided a powerful tool for site-specific quantification of O-GlcNAcylation (both total and “net” changes in abundance) of hundreds of brain proteins simultaneously (623 O-GlcNAc peptides covering 284 proteins in this study).

To determine whether the changes in O-GlcNAc peptide abundance are the result of the alteration of native protein expression or OGT/OGA function/activity, two approaches were taken. First, the same TMT-6-labeled samples without enrichment for O-GlcNAc peptides were analyzed and compared to the O-GlcNAc results. The remarkable differences noted between the O-GlcNAc and global proteome analyses (&gt;20% vs. &lt;2% changed) suggest the selective alterations of either protein O-GlcNAcylation levels or the expression levels of O-GlcNAcylated proteins. Second, we analyzed the net change in O-GlcNAcylation of 306 O-GlcNAc peptides where their protein expression data were also available. We found significant increase and decrease in net change of O-GlcNAc of 12 and 12 peptides, respectively. Therefore, the O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes have functioned differently on these sites/peptides than other sites in AD brain. The imbalance of O-GlcNAc cycling on these sites may be due to the changes of the structure of the proteins that carry these O-GlcNAc sites, or differential neuronal cell loss and/or glial response in AD.

Among the proteins carrying altered O-GlcNAcylation in Alzheimer’s, ankyrin-3 (ANK3, also called ankyrin-G), synaptopodin (SYNPO) and A-kinase anchor protein 11 (AKAP11) are of particular interest. ANK3 is an adaptor protein expressed in neurons and epithelial cells and mediates the attachment of integral membrane proteins to the spectrin-actin based membrane cytoskeleton. This linkage is required to maintain the integrity of the plasma membrane and to anchor specific transmembrane proteins in the plasma membrane. The pivotal role of the disrupted integrity of the brain plasma membrane in AD brain has been recognized [43]. Altered trafficking of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide and other critical proteins in the membrane is thought to be crucial to the development of AD [44]. A previous gene linkage study found significant association between sporadic Alzheimer’s and the single nucleotide polymorphism of ANK3 [45]. Mis-localization of ANK3 and its role in the disruption of axon polarity have been recently reported [46]. Our findings of the marked decrease in ANK3 O-GlcNAcylation in AD brains may open a new avenue for further investigation of its role in the molecular pathogenesis of AD, such as, the influence of O-GlcNAc of ANK3 in the membrane integrity and axon polarity. Synaptopodin is a postsynaptic protein important for synaptic plasticity [47]. Our finding of the marked decrease in synaptopodin O-GlcNAcylation in AD brains suggests its role in the synaptic dysfunction and degeneration that occur in AD. AKAP11 has one O-GlcNAc site (S719) that showed significant increase in abundance in AD. Change of O-GlcNAc on this site is worthy of attention because AKAP11 is related with important kinases in AD. AKAP11 was reported to target protein kinase-A, which may inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3α, a kinase regulating the production of Aβ [48]. AKAP11 also binds to glycogen synthase kinase 3β [49], which is responsible for the phosphorylation of tau protein [50]. Thus, the function of this site is of great interest for further research and highlights the importance of the crosstalk between O-GlcNAc and phosphorylation in the pathology of AD.

It has been reported that O-GlcNAc modifies several important brain proteins, such as tau [39,40,51,52] and Aβ [53–55], which have been implied in the pathogenesis of AD. We also detected O-GlcNAc-modified tau peptides (Table S3), but too many missing values occurred (i.e., only detected in &lt;50% of the samples) in the present study. Thus, tau O-GlcNAcylation could not be quantified reliably. O-GlcNAcylated peptides from Aβ were not detectable in the present study, probably due to the very low level of O-GlcNAcylation of Aβ comparing to other proteins, e.g., bassoon. Nevertheless, the regulation of O-GlcNAcylation on these proteins may still be important for the pathogenesis of AD, as reported by previous studies.

In conclusion, the present study is the most comprehensive quantitative proteomic study for brain O-GlcNAcylation to date, reporting O-GlcNAc modifications on over one thousand sites from human brain tissue samples. The use of multiplexed isobaric labeling with the pooled common reference strategy enabled us to compare the levels of hundreds of O-GlcNAc peptides in 20 individual samples quickly and reliably and to discover changes of more than a hundred O-GlcNAc peptides in AD. The number of samples analyzed in this study is still relatively small and hence some of the findings can be underpowered; it is also possible that not all of these changes were due to AD. However, the initial identification of altered O-GlcNAc peptides/proteins, such as AKAP11, opens new avenues for future investigations of the molecular mechanisms of AD. Moreover, the quantitative proteomics analytical pipeline developed and implemented in the current study can be further expanded to accommodate the need for higher throughput (e.g., using TMT-10) as well as integrated proteome, phosphoproteome and/or O-GlcNAc proteome analysis (e.g., via sample splitting or sequential enrichment). The increased number of samples to be included in the comparison and the integrated proteome/phosphoproteome/O-GlcNAc-ome analysis will help prioritize some of these findings for further verification, and shed light on the crosstalk between protein phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation in AD pathology.

Figure 1 Quantitative proteomic pipeline for O-GlcNAc analysis. (A) Pipeline overview. Peptides were labeled individually with TMT-6 reagents before being equally mixed and separated into six fractions, followed by enrichment of O-GlcNAc peptides and LC-MSMS analysis. (B) Chemical principle of the CEPC enrichment method for O-GlcNAcylated peptides. First, the terminal GlcNAc motif (O-GlcNAc and GlcNAc on N-glycans) was labeled with an azide modified monosaccharide (GalNAz) using the Click-iT O-GlcNAc Enzymatic Labeling System. At the same time, N-glycans were removed by enzyme PNGase F to improve specificity. Second, the O-GlcNAc peptides were linked with a cleavable biotin reagent through click chemistry between the azide group and the alkyne group. Third, O-GlcNAc peptides were enriched by avidin chromatography and released by ultraviolet radiation after washing. The ETD spectra (C) and HCD (D) spectra respectively of an example O-GlcNAc peptide (sequence: GPQVSgSALNLDTSK, g indicates GlcNAc) after TMT labeling and CEPC enrichment reactions. The insert in (D) shows the TMT reporter ions region. The oxonium ion with m/z value of 300.13 was the fragment of the part shown in gray in the final product in (B).

Figure 2 Sequence motif analysis of protein O-GlcNAcylation in human using sites determined in this study. The images were generated in pLogo. The red horizontal lines suggest a threshold of p = 0.05. Upper panel, the T motif; lower panel, the S motif. FG, foreground; BG, background.

Figure 3 The O-GlcNAc abundance in human brain was quantified and compared between Alzheimer’s disease and control cases. (A) Volcano plot of the O-GlcNAc peptides with &gt;50% occurrence in all samples. Dotted line indicates the significance cutoff of q &lt;0.05; Label: the protein (gene name) that carries the O-GlcNAc modifiication/peptide; log2 fold change = log2 (AD/C). (B) Heatmap of the O-GlcNAc peptides with &gt;50% occurrence in samples and q value &lt;0.05. Value = log2(Sample channel/Reference channel). (C) GO (DAVID) analysis of O-GlcNAc proteins showing significant changes in Alzheimer’s disease: molecular function, biological process and KEGG pathways.

Figure 4 Verification of O-GlcNAc quantification with Western blotting analysis using lysate of the human brain tissue. (A) PEG labeling of O-GlcNAcylated proteins. First, the O-GlcNAc motif was labeled with GalNAz by GalT1 and UDP-GalNAz while the N-glycans were removed by PNGaseF. Second, the azide group was linked to a PEG tag with 5 K Da through copper free click chemistry. The proteins were precipitated and separated on SDS page and detected by antibody against synaptopodin (SYNPO) (B) or protein quaking (QKI) (C) through Western blotting. β-tubulin was used as loading control.
