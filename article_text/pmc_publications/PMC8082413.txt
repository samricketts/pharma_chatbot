The majority of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk genes are highly and selectively expressed by microglia in the brain. Several of these genes are related to lipid and cholesterol metabolism, lipid synthesis, lipid transport, endocytosis, exocytosis and phagocytosis. Therefore, studying the roles of cellular membrane biophysics in microglial function should improve our understanding of the AD pathology. In this chapter, we discuss how lipid rafts and membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion impact microglial-mediated oxidative stress and clearance of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). We also discuss potential roles of lipid membrane-bound extracellular vesicles as carriers of pathological factors to promote inflammation and cytotoxicity.


1. Introduction

Microglia are the major neuroimmune cells. They provide three essential functions including constant sensing of their environment changes, promoting neuronal health and operation, providing defense function and neuroprotection (Hickman, Izzy, Sen, Morsett, &amp; El Khoury, 2018).

Microglial functions play pivotal roles in driving the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). For example, microglia mediate early synapse loss in AD (Hong et al., 2016; Rajendran &amp; Paolicelli, 2018). The presence of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) in microglia is essential for microglia to surround and alter amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) plaque structure, thereby limiting neuritic damage to protect from AD (Wang et al., 2016). Microglia mediate synaptic remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress (Bisht, Sharma, &amp; Tremblay, 2018), spreading of tau (Asai et al., 2015), and clearance of Aβ (Paolicelli et al., 2017).

In microglia-specific transcriptomic studies, genome wide association study (GWAS) shows that variants of highly expressed microglial transcripts are associated with an increased risk of AD, suggesting microglia play an important role in both the development and onset of the disease (Gosselin et al., 2017; Heneka, Kummer, &amp; Latz, 2014; Karch &amp; Goate, 2015). Importantly, more than 50% of genes associated with noncoding GWAS risk alleles for AD are preferentially expressed in microglia (Gosselin et al., 2017). In addition, numerous AD risk genes expressed by microglia are related to lipid and cholesterol metabolism, lipid synthesis, lipid transport, endocytosis, exocytosis and phagocytosis (McQuade &amp; Blurton-Jones, 2019). Therefore, investigating the roles of cellular membrane biophysics in microglial function should further our understanding of the AD pathology. In this chapter, we discuss how physical properties of cellular membranes impact microglial-mediated oxidative stress and clearance of Aβ. We will also discuss potential roles of extracellular vesicles in promoting pathological spreading from microglia.

2. The roles of lipid rafts in microglial-mediated oxidative stress

Specialized regions of plasma membranes, such as lipid rafts and caveolae, govern the states of reactive oxygen species (ROS) producing systems (Nordzieke &amp; Medrano-Fernandez, 2018). Many redox enzymatic systems exert their activity at the membrane. An integral membrane protein, NADPH oxidases (NOX), produce ROS (DeYulia Jr., Carcamo, Borquez-Ojeda, Shelton, &amp; Golde, 2005). While xanthine oxidases (XOR) generate ROS at the outer part of the membrane (Radi, Rubbo, Bush, &amp; Freeman, 1997), they generate nitric oxide synthases (NOS) at the inner part (Sessa, Barber, &amp; Lynch, 1993). Since increased activation of NOX have been observed in AD brains, and microglial-mediated ROS are the major source of oxidative stress (Ansari &amp; Scheff, 2011; Bruce-Keller et al., 2010; Choi, Aid, Kim, Jackson, &amp; Bosetti, 2012; Shimohama et al., 2000), here we focus on the effects of lipid rafts on NOX activity in microglia.

Microglia produce ROS mainly through activation of NOX (Wilkinson &amp; Landreth, 2006), which is an enzyme complex comprised of the membrane bound cytochrome b558 (p22phox and the enzymatic subunit, gp91phox), cytosolic subunits (p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox), and the Rac G-protein (Babior, 2000, 2004). Phosphorylation of cytosolic subunits and activation of Rac result in their translocation to the membrane forming the active NOX complex with cytochrome b558, and subsequently producing superoxide. NOX activation to produce ROS can be stimulated by amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) (Bianca, Dusi, Bianchini, Dal Pra, &amp; Rossi, 1999; Qin et al., 2002). Consistently, a significant translocation of p47phox and p67phox from the cytosol to the membrane was found in AD brains (Shimohama et al., 2000). Immunohistochemical evaluations of NOX expression indicate that gp91phox in microglia was upregulated specifically in a vulnerable brain region of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients (Bruce-Keller et al., 2010). Increased activation and upregulation of NOX in frontal and temporal cortex were found in the MCI and AD groups (Ansari &amp; Scheff, 2011). Another study also showed a twofold increase in p47phox, but not gp91phox in the brain of AD patients (Choi et al., 2012). Increased expression of NOX was also found in the 5xFAD early onset mouse model of AD (Landel et al., 2014). These findings suggest that NOX participate in the early pathogenesis of AD.

Lipid rafts are dynamic structures. They are assemblies of mainly saturated lipids and cholesterol. Modifications of lipid raft structures and composition with nonpathological aging (Díaz, Fabelo, Ferrer, &amp; Marín, 2018) and at different diseased stages including AD and Parkinson’s diseases (PD) (Mesa-Herrera, Taoro-González, Valdés-Baizabal, Diaz, &amp; Marín, 2019) have been observed. In normal aging, major changes in the levels of plasmalogens, polyunsaturated fatty acids (especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA)), total polar lipids (mainly phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, sulfatides, and cerebrosides), and total neutral lipids (particularly cholesterol and sterol esters) were detected in brain cortex (Díaz et al., 2018). These membrane and lipid raft modifications may impact activities of membrane molecules including NOX and caveolae (Fig. 1).

Numerous studies have reported the roles of caveolin-containing lipid rafts in NOX activities. For example, caveolae can serve as the membrane target for p47phox, a cytosolic subunit of NOX in macrophages (Wang et al., 2018), and act as mediators of strain-induced ROS generation through NOX in glomerular mesangial cells (Zhang, Peng, Gao, Ingram, &amp; Krepinsky, 2010). In turn, caveolae function is also dependent of NOX activity. NOX deficiency alters caveolin phosphorylation in vascular smooth muscle cells (Basset et al., 2009). High glucose downregulates caveolae in monocytes through oxidative stress from NOX (Hayashi, Juliet, Miyazaki, Ignarro, &amp; Iguchi, 2007). However, the roles of caveolae in NOX activities in microglia, and their relations to the AD pathology have yet to be fully elucidated.

Besides caveolin, lipid raft modifications due to changes in the membrane cholesterol content have been reported to modulate NOX activity in microglia. Disruption of lipid rafts with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, fumonisin B1 or nystatin inhibit NOX-mediated ROS production and its downstream caspase-1 pathway in microglia stimulated with the pro-inflammatory lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (Schilling &amp; Eder, 2010). Consistently, prolonged application of oxysterol significantly enhances lysophosphatidylserine (LPS)-induced association of cytosolic NOX subunit, p47phox, with detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs) in BV-2 cells, thereby increasing ROS production (Rackova, 2013). (−)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibits function of voltage-gated proton channels probably through its ability to disturb lipid rafts by sequestering cholesterol and subsequently inhibits NOX-dependent ROS generation (Jin, Park, &amp; Song, 2013).

In addition to cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have recently been studied for their ability to incorporate into cellular membranes, alter physical properties of membranes, and subsequently alter cellular pathways. In fact, DHA supplement has been found to be beneficial to AD patients and animal models. DHA-enriched diet reduces amyloid burden in an aged AD mouse model (Lim et al., 2005). It has been shown to slow the progression of AD in E4FAD mouse (Ma et al., 2018). Therefore, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of DHA are of research interests.

In fact, DHA can incorporate into and fluidize plasma membranes in neuronal cells, resulting in an upregulation of a neurotrophic α-secretase-dependent amyloid precursor protein processing (Eckert et al., 2011; Yang, Sheng, Sun, &amp; Lee, 2011). Although there is no direct evidence showing the effects of DHA on lipid rafts in microglia resulting in subsequent inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity, numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of DHA to inhibit microglial-mediated oxidative stress. For example, omega-3 fish oils, including DHA, inhibit ROS production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Hadad &amp; Levy, 2017; Yang et al., 2018, 2020), interferon-γ (IFNγ) (Hadad &amp; Levy, 2017) and oligomeric amyloid-β peptide (oAβ) in microglial cells (Geng et al., 2020). However, these studies lack examinations of how DHA alters lipid rafts in microglia, and the roles of lipid rafts in the inhibiting effects of DHA on microglial-mediated oxidative stress have yet to be fully elucidated.

3. The roles of membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion in microglial-mediated clearance of Aβ

As the resident macrophage cells, microglia are key cells responsible for scavenging cell debris in the brain, plaques, damaged neurons and synapses, and infectious agents (Gehrmann, Matsumoto, &amp; Kreutzberg, 1995). The clearance of Aβ by microglial cells has become an important AD research direction. Aβ phagocytosis has been found to be mediated by a range of receptors in microglia (Zuroff, Daley, Black, &amp; Koronyo-Hamaoui, 2017), including CD14-Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to decrease phagocytosis of fibrillar Aβ42 (Reed-Geaghan, Savage, Hise, &amp; Landreth, 2009; Udan, Ajit, Crouse, &amp; Nichols, 2008), macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (SCARA1) to facilitate both soluble and fibrillar Aβ42 uptake (Chung, Brazil, Irizarry, Hyman, &amp; Maxfield, 2001; El Khoury et al., 1996; Frenkel et al., 2013; Yang, Shiao, et al., 2011), CD36 to mediate phagocytosis of fibrillar Aβ42 through interactions with two distinct receptor complexes acting as a functional unit (Koenigsknecht &amp; Landreth, 2004; Wilkinson &amp; El Khoury, 2012; Yu &amp; Ye, 2015), and a functional triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 protein (TREM2) required for microglia to appropriately phagocytose Aβ (Guerreiro et al., 2013; Jonsson et al., 2013). TREM2-mediated uptake of lipoprotein-Aβ complexes and modeling the ApoE-Aβ interactions have been observed in vivo (Yeh, Wang, Tom, Gonzalez, &amp; Sheng, 2016). Increased expression of CD33, a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (SIGLECS) family was shown to significantly reduce the ability to phagocytose Aβ (Hollingworth et al., 2011; Naj et al., 2011).

In addition to receptor-mediated Aβ phagocytosis, endocytosis as well as exocytosis are not only biochemical but also mechanical processes governed by the physical properties of plasma membranes and the membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion (Fig. 2) (Sheetz, 2001). Yet cellular and mechanical pathways dictating Aβ internalization in microglia are still not fully understood. From the viewpoint of energetics, the formation of an endocytic vesicle is similar to membrane tether formation using modern cell mechanics techniques, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) or laser tweezers (Sheetz, 2001). There are three mechanical factors governing the formation of an endocytic vesicle. They are in-plane bilayer membrane tension, the membrane bending stiffness, and the membrane-cytoskeleton connectivity (Sheetz, 2001). In turn, the major mechanical energy required to overcome and then produce an endocytic vesicle is the membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion (Fig. 2). Under normal conditions, the main changes in membrane tether force are the consequence of changes in membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion (Dai &amp; Sheetz, 1999; Raucher et al., 2000). A marked rise in the membrane tether force has been found to parallel the drop in endocytosis rate (Raucher &amp; Sheetz, 1999). Decrease in tether force paralleled the rise in endocytosis rate (Dai, Sheetz, Wan, &amp; Morris, 1998; Raucher &amp; Sheetz, 1999). Therefore, measuring membrane tether force is a powerful method to study the mechanical pathway of endocytosis, especially macropinocytosis.

In fact, microglia have been reported to mediate the clearance of soluble Aβ through fluid phase macropinocytosis (Mandrekar et al., 2009). Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that cell signaling molecules involving in lipid metabolism, such as cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), play a role in microglial-mediated clearance of Aβ. Indeed aberrant cPLA2 activity has been observed in AD brains (Stephenson et al., 1999). As activated cPLA2 is known for its ability to hydrolyze membrane phospholipids, cPLA2 has been found to be involved in Aβ-induced alterations in the physical properties of cellular membranes, such as membrane molecular order, in astrocytes (Hicks et al., 2008). In addition, cPLA2 has also been found to mediate actin rearrangements (Liu, Zhao, Fang, &amp; Chen, 2012; Moes, Boonstra, &amp; Regan-Klapisz, 2010). Both dynamic rearrangements of cytoskeleton and alterations of cellular membranes due to cPLA2 activity may subsequent alter the mechanical energetics of endocytosis. In fact, cPLA2 has been reported to drive recycling through the clathrin-independent endocytic route (Capestrano et al., 2014). Subsequently, we recently reported that cPLA2 facilitates Aβ oligomer uptake in microglia through its ability to lower the membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion (Teng et al., 2019).

DHA can directly alter physical properties of cell membranes through its ability to integrate into cellular membranes (Yang, Sheng, et al., 2011), but also indirectly through its ability to modulate cPLA2 (Geng et al., 2020; Hicks et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2019, 2020). Therefore, DHA can affect Aβ uptake in microglia through its direct and indirect effects on the mechanical energetics of endocytosis. In fact, omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have been reported to enhance phagocytosis of Aβ by human microglia (Hjorth et al., 2013), yet the underlying mechanism needs further investigations.

4. Roles of microglial-derived extracellular vesicles in AD

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid membrane-bound, cell-secreted nanoparticles that play important roles in intercellular communication (van Niel, D’Angelo, &amp; Raposo, 2018). EVs are generally classified into exosomes (50–150nm in size), which are formed by fusion of multivesicular bodies, and larger microvesicles (150–500nm in size), which are formed by outward budding of the plasma membrane (Meldolesi, 2018). Interestingly, plasma membrane-derived vesicle budding is known to be driven by phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine asymmetry (Hugel, Martínez, Kunzelmann, &amp; Freyssinet, 2005) suggesting potential roles of lipids in EV release.

In neurodegenerative diseases, activation of microglia could result in EV release to promote inflammation and neurotoxicity. For example, microglial EVs were found to be neurotoxic and myelinotoxic in the presence of Aβ (Agosta et al., 2014). Accumulation of pro-inflammatory EVs from microglia was also observed in rat brains of post focal cerebral ischemia, which was inhibited by GW4869 that suppresses inward budding of multivesicular bodies (Gao et al., 2020). Glutaminase C regulates microglial activation and pro-inflammatory exosome release (Gao et al., 2019). Interestingly, the miR-124-3p level in microglial exosomes from injured brain was significantly altered after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (TBI)—this miRNA was then transferred into hippocampal neurons and able to alleviate post-traumatic neurodegeneration by targeting the Rela/ApoE signaling pathway (Ge et al., 2020). While the roles of microglial-derived EVs have been recognized in brain injury and AD, how cell and membrane mechanics affect EV production in microglia has yet to be fully elucidated.

A recent study shows that EVs have the natural ability to undergo transport in confined tissue environments in part by tuning EV membrane deformability via water flux (Lenzini, Bargi, Chung, &amp; Shin, 2020). Thus, microglial-derived EVs may also facilitate the transport of larger proteins within the brain, such as neurotoxic AD protein aggregates. Aβ Protofibrils are trafficked through microglial-derived EVs (Gouwens et al., 2018). BIN1 favors the spreading of tau via EVs (Crotti et al., 2019). Depletion of microglia and inhibition of their EV synthesis halt Tau propagation (Asai et al., 2015). In turn, microglial-EVs are also involved in clearance of these neurotoxic AD protein aggregates. Statin has been reported to trigger clearance of extracellular Aβ by microglia through the secretion of insulin-degrading enzyme in a nonconventional pathway in association with EVs (Glebov &amp; Walter, 2012; Tamboli et al., 2010).

5. Conclusion

Microglia are reservoirs of lipids and their regulators, which impact biophysical properties of cell membrane. Understanding how lipid rafts and membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion of microglia regulate oxidative stress and clearance of Aβ will help deepen a fundamental insight into AD pathology from the perspective of cellular biophysics. Since EVs are lipid membrane-bound particles, understanding how EVs navigate in brain tissues and transport secreted factors will provide a novel angle to understand AD pathology, which can be helpful to devise effective treatment for the disease.

Fig. 1 A schematic depicts Aβ induces activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX), in which the cytosolic subunits of NOX translocate to the membrane subunits located at the lipid raft. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that alterations in nano-structure and composition of lipid rafts affect NOX activation for producing superoxides.

Fig. 2 A schematic describes the role of membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion in endocytosis and exocytosis. Mechanical energy is required to overcome the membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion for detaching the membrane from cytoskeleton during the formation of invagination to produce intracellular vesicles for endocytosis and outward membrane budding for exocytosis.
