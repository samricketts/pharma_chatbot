The linear sequence of amino acids in a protein folds into a 3D structure to execute protein activity and function, but it is still challenging to profile the 3D structure at the proteome scale. Here we present a method of native protein tandem mass tag (TMT) profiling of Lys accessibility and its application to investigate structural alterations in human brain specimens of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this method, proteins are extracted under a native condition, labeled by TMT reagents, followed by trypsin digestion and peptide analysis using two-dimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS). The method quantifies Lys labeling efficiency to evaluate its accessibility on protein surface, which may be affected by protein conformations, protein modifications and/or other molecular interactions. We systematically optimized the amount of TMT reagents, reaction time and temperature, and then analyzed protein samples under multiple conditions, including different labeling time (5 and 30 min), heat treatment, AD and normal human cases. The experiment profiled 15,370 TMT-labeled peptides in 4,475 proteins. As expected, the heat treatment led to extensive changes in protein conformations, with 17% of the detected proteome displaying differential labeling. Compared to the normal controls, AD brain showed different Lys accessibility of tau and RNA splicing complexes, which are the hallmarks of AD pathology, as well as proteins involved in transcription, mitochondrial and synaptic functions. To eliminate the possibility that the observed differential Lys labeling was caused by protein level change, the whole proteome was quantified with standard TMT-LC/LC-MS/MS for normalization. Thus, this native protein TMT method enables the proteome-wide measurement of Lys accessibility, representing a straightforward strategy to explore protein structure in any biological system.

Introduction

Protein function depends on its 3D structure through a folding process after translation. The protein structure is mainly determined by the sequence of amino acids, and is also regulated by a range of post-translational modifications (PTMs) and diverse interactions with other proteins or bioactive molecules, such as DNA, RNA and metabolites. Protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is maintained by the cooperation of tens of thousands of proteins in highly regulated structural configurations in cells. The dynamic structure of the whole proteome is the key for normal function of cells and tissues1. Protein misfolding contributes to aging and a range of human disorders as exemplified by Alzheimer’s disease (AD)2–5. Thus, measuring the proteome structure on a systems level is fundamental to the understanding of protein networks and protein misfolding diseases.

MS-based profiling methods mainly focus on the acquisition of amino acid sequence information for protein identity and quantity, whereas global profiling of the proteome 3D structure is still difficult. Traditional strategies for protein structural analysis, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and single molecule spectroscopy, utilize highly purified single protein or protein complexes, therefore are not applicable to proteome-wide conformation studies. Current structural proteomics technologies collect two different aspects of information in protein 3D structure: amino acid accessibility and intrinsic structure stability6–7. For example, cross-linking MS relies on dual labeling of adjacent amino acids, providing the distance information of crosslinked residues, which makes it a synergistic method when combined with other traditional strategies to probe the detailed structure of protein complexes8–12. However, during a proteome-wide analysis, crosslinked peptides are extremely complex in a high dynamic range, resulting in identification challenge and low proteome coverage (e.g. usually hundreds of proteins). Covalent labeling methods, including hydroxyl radical footprinting and fast photochemical oxidation of proteins, rely on chemical reactivity to probe amino acid accessibility13–16. Hydrogen deuterium exchange MS is another powerful technique used for protein folding and protein-protein interactions analysis, which measures exchange of hydrogen isotope between the protein backbone and its surrounding solvent17–18. These modifications on multiple residues rapidly increase proteoform complexity, restricting their applications at a proteome scale.

Recently, protein painting and limited proteolysis have been developed to provide similar information of amino acid accessibility19–23. By decorating the protein surface with small molecules to block the tryptic cleavage sites of the painted surface, the protein painting is designed for characterizing protein complex interaction interface. However, excessive non-specific protein surface masking may perturb protein conformations, and it is not applied to a large-scale proteome analysis. Limited proteolysis provides information of solvent accessible amino acids during non-specific enzyme digestion, but the data interpretation still suffers from large non-specific semi-tryptic peptides generated. Alternatively, protein structure stability can be investigated by MS upon denaturing conditions24–28, such as thermal proteome profiling (TPP) to monitor protein aggregation under a series of heat treatments. The TPP method shows a high proteome coverage (e.g. thousands of proteins), but not all protein conformation changes is accompanied by stability alteration, and the method needs multiple denaturing conditions to generate protein denaturation curves, which reduces the throughput of the analysis29. In addition to these peptide-centric strategies, protein-centric strategies can also provide protein structural information, such as native MS30–31, top-down MS32–33 and ion mobility MS34. However, these methods are also not applicable to proteome-wide analysis.

The multiplexed tandem mass tag (TMT) method is widely used to improve the throughput of protein quantitative analysis35–36. Different from non-specific modifications in oxidation-based labeling methods, TMT reagents specifically modify the amine groups at protein/peptide N-termini and Lys residues, although minor side reactions are observed on other amino acids37. This reactive specificity largely reduces the complexity of peptides in a bottom-up analysis, presumably suitable for large-scale investigation of protein structures. Moreover, Lys residues are positively charged and usually accessible for chemical labeling. Indeed, applications of Lys-specific labeling reagents to protein structural analysis have been published for purified proteins in small scales38–42.

In the present study, we systematically optimized native protein TMT profiling of Lys accessibility in the whole proteome of human brain specimens of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The alterations of Lys accessibility may be resulted from the changes of intrinsic protein conformations, protein posttranslational modifications, and/or the interactions between proteins and other biomolecules (collectively termed protein structure changes for simplicity hereafter). Combining with two-dimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS), the method enabled the analysis of more than 4,700 proteins in a single experiment, revealing potential protein structure changes relevant to AD pathology.

Experimental Procedures

Human and mouse brain tissues

Human postmortem brain tissues (superior parahippocampal gyrus) were provided by the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, with well characterized criteria for clinical and pathological diagnoses43. A total of 4 cases (2 controls and 2 AD cases, Supporting Information, Table S1) were used in this study. Mouse brain tissue samples were dissected rapidly, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Mice were bred and maintained in a specific pathogen free facility in the Animal Resource Center at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Brain tissue lysis and protein extraction

Human and mouse brain tissues were extracted by vortexing in the presence of the glass beads with native lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.05% sodium deoxycholate) that is compatible with TMT reaction. The protein concentration was estimated by a Coomassie-stained short SDS gel44 and confirmed by BCA analysis (Thermo Fisher). The protein lysates were aliquoted and saved at −80 °C.

TMT labeling and protein digestion

Mouse brain lysates were used to optimize the labeling parameters. Titrated amounts of the TMTzero reagent (TMT:tissue weight ratio of 0:1, 0.1:1, 0.3:1, 1:1, 3:1, or 10:1, Thermo Fisher) were tested with a fixed labeling time of 30 min at 21 °C. Time course labeling was carried out in 0, 1, 3, 10, or 60 min, with a fixed TMT:tissue ratio of 1:1. The labeling was also carried out on ice with the reaction time of 10, 30, 100, 300, and 1000 sec, with a fixed TMT:tissue ratio of 1:1, with the same reaction of 300 sec at 21 °C as a reference. After quenching the reaction, the proteins were denatured by adding urea to 8 M, and digested by LysC and trypsin with an optimized protocol45, followed by LC-MS/MS analysis.

For human brain lysates, two aliquots from one normal brain lysate were first heated at 70 °C for 10 min and cooled down to 21 °C before labeling. Five samples (two normal brain samples, two AD cases, and one heated normal brain lysate) were individually labeled with the 11-plex TMT reagents for 5 and 30 min (i.e. 10 conditions), together with a replicate (one normal brain lysate labeled for 30 min). The labeled samples were equally pooled, denatured and digested, followed by C18 desalting.

Extensive LC/LC-MS/MS analysis of TMT samples

The desalted TMT-labeled peptides were fractionated by offline basic pH reverse phase LC (XBridge C18 column (3.5 μm particle size, 4.6 mm × 25 cm, Waters), buffer A (10 mM ammonium formate, pH 8.0), buffer B (95% acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate, pH 8.0)) with a 200 min gradient of 15–50% buffer B. 400 fractions were collected every half min and concatenated to 100 fractions. Each fraction was analyzed with acidic pH reverse phase LC-MS/MS with a self-packed column (75 μm × 15 cm with 1.9 μm C18 resin from Dr. Maisch GmbH, heated at 68 °C to reduce back pressure) coupled with a Q Exactive HF Orbitrap MS (Thermo Fisher). Peptides were eluted with a gradient of buffer A (0.2% formic acid, 5% DMSO) and buffer B (buffer A plus 65% acetonitrile) within 90 min: 5–15% buffer B in 1 min, 15–20% in 10 min, 20–45% in 60 min, 45–95% in 1 min and maintained for 3 min, and rapidly returning to 5% for equilibrium in 15 min. MS settings included MS1 scans (60,000 resolution, 410–1600 m/z, 3 × 106 AGC and 50 ms maximal ion time) and 20 data-dependent MS2 scans (60,000 resolution, starting from 120 m/z, 1 × 105 AGC, 105 ms maximal ion time, HCD, 35% normalized collision energy, and 15 s dynamic exclusion).

Peptides identification and quantification by JUMP software suite

Peptide identification was processed by a recently developed JUMP search engine with improved sensitivity and specificity46. A composite target/decoy (reversed) database was created to evaluate the false discover rate (FDR)47. The protein database was generated by combining Swiss-prot, TrEMBL, and UCSC databases and removing redundancy (human: 83,955 entries; mouse: 59,423 entries). Major parameters included 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor and product ion, full trypticity, two maximal missed cleavages, and three maximal modification sites of fixed Cys carbamidomethylation (+57.02146), dynamic TMT modification of Lys and N-termini (+229.16293), and oxidation of Met (+15.99491). The resulting PSMs were filtered by mass accuracy, and then grouped by precursor ion charge state followed by the cutoffs of JUMP-based matching scores (Jscore and ΔJn) to reduce FDR below 1% for peptides. When the same peptide was derived from numerous homologous proteins, the peptide was matched to the protein with the top PSM number, according to the rule of parsimony. The TMT quantification was performed with the reported method48. The dynamic range distribution of quantified TMT proteins was mapped to our recent deep proteomic analysis of human brain (&gt;10,000 identified proteins)49.

Experimental Design and Statistical Rationale

The total number of samples are listed above and with two biological replicates for each comparison (differential labeling time and AD vs control) except for the comparison of heat treatment. The logarithm ratios of two technical replicates (a null experiment) were fit into a Gaussian distribution to generate the experimental standard deviation (SD). The statistical analysis was based on the null experiment variation and empirical FDR estimation4.

Comparison of TMT peptides allowed the identification of differentially exposed peptides (termed DE peptides) at Lys residues. To estimate the FDR of DE peptides between different biological conditions, null and authentic comparisons were plotted according to SD-based cutoff. The FDR was estimated by the null comparison peptide number divided by the authentic comparison peptide number.

Pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis

Pathway enrichment analysis of DE proteins was manually performed by DAVID 6.8 (https://david.ncifcrf.gov). Briefly, the DE protein list was input in the website while setting only the identified proteins as background. The DAVID tool computed the fold of enrichment of each protein category, with specified FDR. We accepted the protein categories with FDR lower than 0.05. The PPI analysis of DE proteins was carried out with the STRING database containing PPI connections (version 11.0, https://string-db.org). The DE proteins were used to search for known protein-protein interaction networks and filtered by the highest confidence (0.90) in the website. Each node represents one protein and the edges between the nodes represent protein-protein interactions recorded in the database.

Results

Workflow and optimization of native protein TMT profiling of Lys accessibility

In the standard TMT quantitative experiment, proteins in initial samples are usually extracted and digested under fully denaturing conditions to enhance digestion efficiency, and then the resulting peptides are labeled by TMT reagents, in which protein structural information (e.g. Lys accessibility) is lost by the denaturing conditions. To recover the Lys accessibility information in the protocol, proteins are extracted under a mild condition to retain native protein folding, and directly labeled with the TMT reagents, in which Lys residues with different levels of surface exposure (e.g., Lys residues in a loop or an alpha helix) are anticipated to be differentially modified (Fig. 1a). The TMT-labeled proteins are further pooled, fully denatured and proteolyzed into peptides for LC/LC-MS/MS analysis. Differentially labeled TMT peptides are quantified by MS2 spectra, indicating different accessibility of the modified Lys residues in the proteins (Fig. 1a).

The reaction of TMT labeling follows a second-order kinetics, the modification rate increases and reaches a plateau in a dose and time-dependent manner38. To systematically optimize the labeling condition for complex protein mixtures, we first titrated the amount of the TMTzero reagent with different ratios to mouse brain tissue (w/w). We did not use TMT:protein ratio in this experiment because the crude brain lysate contains reactive amine moieties in a range of biomolecules, such as proteins, amino acids and other metabolites. By increasing the ratio of TMT:tissue from 0:1 to 10:1 in a standard 30-min reaction, the percentage of identified TMT-labeled peptides (termed TMT peptides hereafter) increased linearly before ratio 1:1, reached a plateau at ratio 3:1, and slightly dropped at ratio 10:1 (Fig. 1b). The decrease of TMT peptides with excess TMT reagent may be due to trypsin miscleavage after Lys modification, reducing MS-compatible peptides, as trypsin hydrolyzes the peptide bond at the carboxyl side of Lys and Arg residues. Over labeling on non-Lys amino acids (e.g., His, Ser, Thr, and Tyr) may also cause the reduction of TMT peptide identification37. Consistently, we did observe a dramatic decrease in peptide identification and peptide peaks in LC-MS/MS with increasing TMT reagents (Supporting Information, Fig. S1a and S1b). Thus, a TMT:tissue ratio of 1:1 is suggested for high recovery of TMT peptides and avoiding over-labeling.

Next, we examined the effect of TMT labeling time with the 1:1 TMT:tissue ratio. The labeling reaction was carried out at 21 °C and quenched at 1, 3, 10, and 60 min, the percentage of TMT peptides increased almost linearly with time and reached the plateau after 10 min of incubation time (Fig. 1c), whereas the total identified peptides decreased along with the reaction time (Supporting Information, Fig. S1c). Thus the number of TMT peptides was increased from 1 to 10 min, and then dropped at 60 min (Supporting Information, Fig. S1c). The TMT labeling is a rapid reaction, as 1 min of incubation reached almost 20% of TMT peptides (Fig. 1c), consistent with previous work where the labeling time was as short as 1 min for simple protein systems38–41. To optimize a reasonable handling time for large-scale analysis, we further tested the labeling at a low temperature (on ice) to slow down the reaction. We found the reaction rate was too slow at 0 °C, compared to 21 °C and could not reach a plateau even with long time incubation (Supporting Information, Fig. S1d). Low temperature can stabilize protein structure within longer incubation time, however protein cold denaturation is also observed50. Based on these results, we decided to examine two conditions (5 min and 30 min at 21 °C) in the subsequent large-scale experiment.

Analysis of proteome-wide Lys accessibility in human brain tissue

We used the optimized conditions to profile the proteome-wide Lys accessibility between two controls and two AD human brain tissues by LC/LC-MS/MS (Fig. 2a), because protein misfolding and aggregation are hallmarks in AD pathology51. The four samples were labeled for 5 min or 30 min to further evaluate the effect of reaction time. Since it is known that heat can induce protein misfolding, we implemented a positive control condition by heating one control sample at 70 °C for 10 min before TMT labeling to validate if this approach can identify protein misfolding upon heat treatment. Finally a technical replication was implemented to analyze experimental variation, totaling 11 samples in this large-scale experiment (Fig. 2a). The 11 samples were TMT-labeled, equally pooled, fully denatured and digested by LysC and trypsin. The tryptic peptides were separated extensively with offline basic pH reverse phase liquid chromatography, leading to 100 fractions for acidic pH LC-MS/MS. In total, we collected 2.1 million MS/MS spectra and identified 37,062 peptides (false discovery rate &lt;1%), among which 15,370 peptides were TMT-modified, mapping to 4,475 proteins (Fig. 2a, Supporting Information, Table S2).

Proteomic analysis often has a limitation of detecting proteins of low abundance. To examine the coverage of the analysis, we matched the identified TMT proteins to a deep brain proteome dataset (10,544 proteins)49. Although the identified TMT-modified proteins were biased toward the proteins of high abundance, the coverage spanned approximately 4 orders of magnitude in dynamic range (Fig. 2b).

We then examined why the TMT dataset had a lower proteome coverage than the regular label free dataset49, in spite of extensive fractionation in the TMT analysis. First, the peptide population in the TMT experiment is highly complex, comprised of two entire proteome-wide peptide sets (the unmodified and TMT-modified). Moreover, the native protein TMT protocol (labeling before digestion) is notably different from the label free protocol (digestion before labeling). TMT modification causes trypsin miscleavage at Lys residues (Fig. 2c). The miscleavage also increases the length of tryptic peptides (Fig. 2d), and shifts the peptide charge distribution toward high charge states in LC-MS/MS (Fig. 2e), which also increases the complexity during peptide fragmentation for peptide identification52.

Protein tryptic cleavage generates four types of peptides based on the N- and C-terminal digestion sites, without counting for protein termini, including K.XnK.X, K.XnR.X, R.XnK.X, and R.XnR.X (dots represent cleavage sites and “X” represents any residues), which are named K-K, K-R, R-K, and R-R peptides respectively for simplicity (Fig. S2a). During TMT labeling of proteins, those K sites corresponding to the K-K, K-R and R-K peptides may be modified, resulting in miscleavage during tryptic digestion. To confirm this, we compared the distribution of the four types of peptides in our label-free and TMT datasets (Fig. S2b). In the label free dataset49, the percentages of the four types of peptides were almost equal, because the frequencies of K and R residues in the proteome are near the same53. In contrast, in the TMT dataset, the population of K-K, K-R and R-K peptides (termed K-flanking peptides) were dramatically reduced, when compared to the R-R peptides (termed R-flanking peptides). These results are in good agreement with the effect of TMT-induced Lys miscleavage.

Impact of labeling time and heat on the performance of TMT labeling under a native condition

Before analyzing differentially exposed (DE) TMT peptides under different conditions, we developed a stepwise method to define a log2 ratio cutoff for identifying DE peptides and estimating the associated FDR (Fig. S3a). First, we corrected for the loading bias by centering the log2 ratio at zero. Experimental variation was estimated by the null comparison (log2 ratio) within replicates. Fitting the null comparison into normal distribution generated the experimental standard deviation (SD) of 0.40 (Fig. S3b). To estimate the FDR of DE peptides between different biological conditions (e.g. heat vs no heat), null (Fig. S3c) and authentic (Fig. S3d) comparisons were plotted, allowing the analysis of FDR with adjustable cutoff of log2 ratio (shown as the fold of SD, Fig. S3e). For instance, when the cutoff was selected to be 3 SD, we accepted 25 and 1,635 peptides as DE peptides in the null and authentic comparisons, respectively. Thus, the FDR was estimated at 1.5% FDR (25/1,635). The same cutoff was also applied to other comparisons (e.g. 30 min/5min labeling time), accepting 738 peptides.

The two labeling time points (5 min and 30 min) were designed to examine if labeling time would cause global difference in the native protein TMT experiment. Out of 15,370 quantified TMT peptides, 738 DE peptides (mapping to 427 proteins) were identified, showing significant abundance difference (&gt;3 SD) between the 5 min and 30 min labeled samples (Fig. 3a &amp; 3b). Interestingly, all R-flanking DE peptides (n = 96) were escalated at the 30 min condition, consistent with the notion that a longer labeling time allows more TMT labeling of exposed Lys residues.

In the 427 DE proteins, 81 only have increased TMT peptides, 325 solely have decreased TMT peptides, and 21 proteins have both types of peptides (Fig. 3b). Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of proteins in energy metabolism, proteasome, ribosome and spliceosome (see Methods). When plotting the relative abundance of R-flanking peptides in a time course of the labeling reaction (5 min and 30 min), we found that the labeling level of ribosome proteins at 5 min was about 60% of that at 30 min, while the labeling of other highly abundant proteins reached 80–90% at the 5 min reaction (Fig. 3c). These results are consistent with our previous time course analysis (Fig. 1c), suggesting that the 5 min rapid labeling is appropriate for probing protein Lys accessibility.

Heat treatment is well known to cause dramatic protein conformational change20, 54, we used heat treatment as a positive control condition to evaluate the native protein TMT labeling strategy. The brain lysates were heated at 70 °C for 10 min to denature the majority of protein species20, cooled down to 21 °C to allow refolding, and then labeled with TMT reagents in a time course (5 min and 30 min). The two labeling time points yielded consistent results (Fig. S3d), leading to the identification of heat-induced 1,635 DE peptides (774 proteins) (&gt;3 SD) (Fig. 3d &amp; 3e). The DE peptides and proteins represented 11% and 17% of all quantified peptides and proteins, respectively (Fig. 3f), supporting the notion that a significant portion of proteome underwent structural changes upon the heat treatment.

Possible structural changes of tau and other pathway proteins in AD brain

To test this native protein TMT method with complex disease samples, we decided to examine if this method could detect the conformational change of proteins in Alzheimer’s disease by comparing two AD brain samples (AD1 and AD2) with two control cases (Ctl1 and Ctl2). Considering that TMT peptide level is influenced by its corresponding whole protein level, we performed the whole proteome profiling of the same samples by regular TMT-LC/LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 4a). The whole protein expression level was used to normalize the TMT peptide ratio. Comparison of the results before and after normalization clearly indicated the impact of the whole proteome level (Fig. 4b). 53 peptides were discarded and 37 peptides were added in during the normalization step, using 3 SD as the cutoff. For example, two ANLN peptides were decreased in AD, essentially due to its low expression level in AD (Fig. 4c). Conversely, two NEFM peptides did not pass the cutoff before normalization, but showed significant changes after normalization (Fig. 4c). Finally, 103 TMT peptides were accepted to show significant changes between AD and control cases.

The 103 DE peptides consist of R-flanking and K-flanking peptides, derived from 97 human proteins in the brain (Fig. 5a). These brain proteins are classified into functional categories of neurofibrillary tangle, RNA splicing, transcription regulation, mitochondrial and synaptic functions (Fig. 5b). Strikingly, protein-protein interaction analysis identified 10 RNA splicing proteins (DHX9, HSPA8, HNRNPH2, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, PPIL3, PTBP1, SNRPA1, SF3B1, and SF3B3) in the DE proteins list (Fig. 5c), and the majority (9 of 10) of their DE peptides have elevated abundance in AD samples, indicating higher Lys accessibility of RNA splicing proteins, which strongly suggesting protein misfolding and RNA splicing dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease, which is also supported by previous transcriptomic and proteomic work4, 55. Interestingly, the protein levels of these RNA splicing factors are not altered in AD brains (Supplementary Table 2), which suggests the TMT-labeling data can provide additional information beyond the whole proteome profiling in illustrating disease pathogenesis. Thus, the native protein TMT labeling successfully identified the Lys accessibility alterations of tau, RNA splicing proteins, and other pathway proteins, implicating their structural and functional changes in AD pathogenesis.

Discussion

We developed and optimized a native protein TMT method for profiling Lys accessibility to analyze protein structure at a large scale. Combining the sample multiplexing power of TMT reagents and extensive LC/LC-MS/MS, we were able to profile the Lys accessibility in more than 4,000 proteins directly in human brain tissue. The method allows the relative comparison of protein Lys accessibility under multiple biological conditions. The change of Lys accessibility implicates protein surface change, which may be due to a number of possibilities: (i) different structural configurations, (ii) protein posttranslational modifications on Lys residues56, such as ubiquitination, acetylation, and methylation, and (iii) interactions with other biomolecules including DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites. However, it is also possible that the detected TMT-Lys peptides are changed due to the alteration of whole protein level. To eliminate this possibility, we also performed the whole protein profiling and used the data for normalization, similar to the previous phosphoproteomics normalization57.

During the sample preparation and data interpretation, we observed that the trypsin cleavage was heavily blocked upon TMT modified Lys residues, which significantly suppressed the identification of TMT peptides (especially for K-flanking peptides) and lowered the proteome coverage. Although other enzymes cleaving at non-Lys residues can be used to avoid the miscleavage issue, trypsin was still used here because it generates the largest coverage of the proteome comparing to other alternatives in proteomics58. Combinations of trypsin and other enzymes may improve the proteome coverage and provide more information on TMT peptides, which may be worth further investigation. Nevertheless, even with the miscleavage on TMT modified Lys residues, our data is still informative in analyzing the differences in Lys accessibility.

Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia, with brain pathological hallmarks of protein misfolding and aggregation of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ), the tau protein59, as well as RNA splicing proteins4. Using the native protein TMT approach, we discovered DE peptides in protein tau and numerous RNA splicing components. As expected, the TMT-labeled tau peptide is decreased in AD brains, which is consistent with its assembly of neurofibrillary tangles and extensive modifications (e.g. ubiquitination and acetylation) in AD brains to reduce Lys accessibility. But the Aβ peptide was missed in this native protein TMT analysis, possibly due to its small size (mainly 40 or 42 amino acids) that did not generate LC/MS-compatible peptides after TMT labeling.

Overall, the native protein TMT method provides a straightforward, multiplexed approach to evaluate protein Lys accessibility, implicating protein surface changes. Like the reported limited proteolysis-coupled MS strategy60 that relies on the exposure of proteolytic sites to probe protein structural changes, the native protein TMT method is dependent on the exposure of Lys residues towards protein structural elucidation. In contrast to targeted structural approaches, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and single molecule spectroscopy, the MS profiling methods can provide information of protein structures on a proteome-level scale, which can be further integrated with other omics data to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying any biological or disease events.

The same protein may have different structures in the two samples, highlighted with color, in which a Lys residue with different surface exposure are differentially labeled. The TMT-labeled proteins are further pooled, fully denatured and proteolyzed into peptides for LC/LC-MS/MS analysis. Differentially labeled TMT peptides are quantified by MS2 spectra, indicating the difference in Lys accessibility. (b) Titration of TMT reagents. The percentage of identified TMT-labeled peptides in all identified peptides is shown with different TMT:tissue (w/w) ratios. The reaction time was fixed at 30 min. (c) Time course analysis. The percentage of identified TMT-labeled peptides is shown with different time points. The TMT:tissue ratio was fixed at 1:1.

Figure 2. Evaluation of native protein TMT labeling by analyzing samples under various conditions. (a) Proteome-wide Lys accessibility profiling of two controls and two AD human brain tissues by native protein TMT labeling, with or without heating, using different labeling time. One technical replicate was also added in the batch. (b) Comparison of proteome coverage with different MS protocols. The proteome coverage of the native protein TMT experiment was aligned with that of a deep brain label-free proteome dataset (10,544 proteins). (c) Miscleavage distribution. TMT modification causes trypsin miscleavage at Lys residue. (d) Peptide length distribution. The miscleavage increased the length of tryptic peptides in the native protein TMT analysis. (e) Peptide charge distribution. The miscleavage shifts the peptide charge distribution toward high charge states in the native protein TMT experiment.

Figure 3. Impact of labeling time and heat on proteome structure by the native protein TMT experiment. (a-b) DE peptides and proteins between the 5 min and 30 min labeled samples. (c) Relative abundance of R-flanking peptides in highly abundant protein species at 5 min and 30 min of labeling. (d-e) DE peptides and proteins between the heated and no heat samples. (f) Percentage of heat-induced DE peptides and proteins in all quantified peptides and proteins.

Figure 4. TMT peptide ratio normalization by protein level between AD and control samples. (a) Whole proteome profiling of the same samples (two AD cases and two controls) was performed to normalize the TMT peptide ratio. (b) Effect of normalization. The number of DE peptides before and after normalization. 53 peptides (45% in 119 DE peptides) were discarded and 37 peptides (36% in 103 DE peptides) were added during normalization. (c) Example proteins and their corresponding peptides showing the discarded (ANLN) and added (NEFM) DE peptides during normalization.

Figure 5. Structural alterations of tau and other pathway proteins in AD brain. (a) DE peptides between AD and normal control samples. (b) Functional categories of DE proteins and their corresponding DE peptides. The classification of DE proteins was manually performed according to protein function. (c) PPI network of RNA splicing proteins in the DE protein list. PPI analysis of DE proteins was carried out with the STRING database.
