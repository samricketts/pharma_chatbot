pmcIntroduction

The communication and behavioral manifestations of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) present ethical and practical challenges for individuals with this clinical syndrome as well as for individuals who are involved closely in their care. This neurodegenerative disease is defined by the insidious onset, gradual decline, and predominance of language impairments (in contrast to memory impairment as seen in Alzheimer’s disease [AD]) and compromised participation in activities of daily living due to these deficits.1,2

Three different PPA variants are specified by international consensus criteria based on clinical presentation (language manifestations), patterns of atrophy, and/or underlying neuropathology: logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA), nonfluent agrammatic PPA (nfaPPA), and semantic variant PPA (svPPA)3 (Table 1). Individuals with lvPPA are distinguished from other variants by impaired single word retrieval in spontaneous speech and naming, impaired repetition of phrases and sentences,4 and left temporo-parietal atrophy.5 Those with nfaPPA demonstrate nonfluent, effortful speech and agrammatism,6 and atrophy in the left posterior frontotemporal area.7,8 Those with svPPA present with impaired object knowledge, anomia, single word comprehension deficits,9 and atrophy in the anterior parts of the temporal lobe.10,11 The variants svPPA and nfaPPA are typically associated with pathologies in the spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)10,12,13,14; lvPPA is most frequently associated with Alzheimer pathology.15,16

Language impairments in PPA can complicate patients’ expression of preferences and decisions, on a range of topics from critical issues such as medical treatment, to minor issues such as meal times. Behavioral disturbances in PPA can exacerbate these communication breakdowns further.17–20 Because of these obstacles, individuals with PPA may need to rely on family members and other caregivers to convey, and even anticipate, communicative intentions. This reliance on communication partners may preclude full autonomy or self-determination, that is, the right to direct one’s own life. Beauchamp and Childress define autonomous decisions as those which are intentional, informed, and free from controlling influences.21 Even though individuals with PPA may lack full autonomy due to diminished decision making capacity, the principle of “respect for persons”22 requires us to protect their interests. Although those with diminished capacity may not be able to act autonomously, there is an obligation to protect these individuals’ former autonomous preferences as well as their current best interests (eg, safety, health, financial security, socialization).21 Ethical dilemmas can arise when attempting to balance former autonomous preferences and current best interests. In these difficult situations, family members and caregivers must follow both the principle of beneficence (obligation to act for the benefit of others) as well as the principle of nonmaleficence (obligation to not inflict harm)21 (Table 221). Conflicts can arise between an individual’s autonomy and a caregiver’s need to promote an individual’s welfare, or between an individual’s autonomy and a caregiver’s need to prevent harm.

There is a substantial literature addressing competency, decision making capacity and self-determination focusing on individuals with dementia, intellectual and developmental disabilities, psychiatric disturbances, and aphasia.23–27 In comparison, relatively less attention has been directed to self-determination in PPA. Le Rhun and colleagues28 reported that individuals with PPA who had high Mini-Mental State Examination scores, moderate aphasia, and fluent language on baseline clinical assessment subsequently retained greater autonomy in daily life. Establishing decision making capacity in PPA is complicated by the heterogeneity of the PPA variants and the difficulty diagnosing a specific PPA variant in some individuals who do not strictly meet the classification criteria for any one of the three subtypes.29,30

In this paper, cases representing all three PPA variants are presented to illustrate conflicts between autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence in commonly encountered situations regarding housing, driving, social interactions, and treatment interventions.

The Role of Patient and Family Education in Planning for the Future

Case 1: Ms. B is a 67-year old woman who was referred to a neurologist because of progressive word finding difficulties over an approximately 6-year period. Comprehensive cognitive/language testing was conducted, and Mrs. B was diagnosed with nfaPPA. Over the ensuing months, Mrs. B’s husband became increasingly distraught regarding her communication difficulties and perceived future needs. These concerns were exacerbated when her husband learned that he needed to undergo surgery, requiring a lengthy recuperation period. Although Mrs. B managed independently during her husband’s hospitalization and rehabilitation, her husband advocated strongly for her moving to an assisted living community and began investigating options in earnest, despite her objections. Ms. B was seen for a follow up visit with her neurologist and reported that she was not ready to move and felt sad and angry about her husband’s plan.

Comment: The ethical dilemma is that Mr. B was disregarding what Mrs. B perceived to be best for herself (autonomy principle) out of concern for doing what was in her best interests (beneficence principle). Patient/family education and counseling about the nature of nfaPPA and expected course can help to preserve this patient’s autonomy regarding her living environment and enable her husband to plan appropriately for future needs. Mrs. B’s test results revealed a profile expected in nfaPPA: preserved single word auditory comprehension and semantic knowledge and marked difficulty on naming, articulatory agility, and repetition tasks because of apraxia of speech.6 Sebastian et al31 found that rates of decline in oral naming were more precipitous in nfaPPA than other variants in part because of apraxia of speech. Education about apraxia of speech, highlighting that speech production is no longer a reliable means of communication despite spared ability to formulate communicative intentions and understand others, may facilitate insight regarding needed therapy and supports, such as structured oral reading,32 script training with speech entrainment,33 phonological and orthographic speech and language treatment,34 and implementation of personalized communication aids and assistive devices/apps.35 In this case, helping Ms. B’s husband understand that her apraxia of speech is not an insurmountable obstacle to her safety might ameliorate his concern about the level of assistance she might need. Thus, through education and counseling it is hoped that Mr. B will appreciate that beneficence-doing what is “good” or “best” for another person -- includes respecting the person’s choices as much as possible and avoiding being overly protective of them out of sincere concern for their well-being.

The Necessary Balance of Safeguards and Independence

Case 2: Mr. C, a 55-year old retired executive with lvPPA, attends speech-language pathology treatment for weekly sessions. He enjoys these sessions and feels that he is benefitting from therapy. When driving home after a treatment session, he had a minor motor vehicle accident for which he was at fault. Mr. C and his wife decided together that he should no longer drive. Mr. C was upset about this loss of independence and the prospect of not being able to continue therapy. A plan was made for Mr. C to use a rideshare app for transportation to therapy. This plan worked well for several months. One afternoon, Mr. C’s wife contacted the speech-language pathologist because he did not return home as expected after therapy. The police were contacted and the appropriate alerts were sent out via emergency messaging. He was found hours later in a convenience store several miles from his home. He had provided his communication notebook to the store manager who called his wife. After returning home, Mr. C reported that he did not have his house key and walked to locate someone to assist him.

Comment: The ethical dilemma in this case arises because Mr. C’s wife was concerned about Mr. C’s safety when traveling to therapy appointments (nonmalefience principle) while simultaneously wanting to support his desire to participate in therapy (autonomy principle). Language performance and behavioral disturbances are correlated in lvPPA, specifically negative behaviors do not develop in lvPPA until language deficits are severe.36 Mr. C’s decision to walk to find assistance might raise questions regarding his reasoning and judgment, or not, depending on the environment. In this case, it is prudent for healthcare providers to discuss guidelines with Mr. and Mrs. C at this point to avoid danger to Mr. C as he is now several months into his progression of lvPPA. Although discussions about behavioral changes may be appropriately deferred until later in disease progression, discussions about driving should occur at the time of PPA diagnosis.

Although PPA is characterized by disproportionate deficits in language relative to other cognitive domains, individuals with lvPPA (and svPPA) can develop deficits in visuospatial skills.37,38 A driving evaluation ensures the safety of the individual with PPA as well as pedestrians and other drivers, balancing the right to self-determination with the well-being of others. Mr. C provided his communication notebook to a store manager so that he could contact his wife, indicating that he was able to problem-solve. Other options are an aphasia wallet, identification card, or medical identification bracelet. An additional safeguard is a GPS (eg, Safe Link) or cellular (eg, iTraq) tracking device to aid family members and caregivers in locating someone who is unable to produce identification, or communicate relevant information, to others. Helping his wife realize that preventing harm may not require eliminating his autonomy would help her resolve the ethical dilemma. Thus, through counseling and implementing appropriate safeguards it is hoped that Mrs. C will appreciate that nonmaleficence – preventing harm – can be achieved while preserving autonomy compatible with the constraints of disease progression.

Combatting Social Isolation with Support Groups

Case 3: Ms. G, a 61-year old teacher, sought neurologic evaluation because she began to experience difficulty completing assignments in her graduate school studies. She underwent comprehensive cognitive-language assessment and was diagnosed with svPPA. Ms. G is single and lives alone. Her children live in another state. She has a small circle of friends, but has had fewer occasions to be in contact with them since withdrawing from her graduate school program. Despite her children’s concerns, Ms. G has taken some vacations on her own, and has managed to travel independently, although she missed a flight on one occasion because she did not understand that the flight time had been changed. On another occasion, Ms. G traveled to a distant location with little advance planning, arriving at her destination without sufficient or appropriate clothing.

Comment: The ethical issue in this case is that while Ms. G’s family has an obligation to respect Ms. G’s desire to be independent in various aspects of her life and stay engaged in social activities (autonomy principle), they also have obligation to ensure her safety when traveling (nonmaleficence). Social isolation is a devastating consequence of aphasia,39 whether due to stroke or neurodegenerative disease. It is especially problematic in PPA syndromes because of their early onset (middle age),28,40 rarity,41 and slowly progressive nature.1,2 “As noted earlier, PPA is predominantly characterized by language loss. Early in the disease progression, individuals with PPA have preserved insight; they are aware of their decline and consequent changes in their personal and professional lives.42,43 Individuals with PPA report symptoms of depression, which correlate with naming of impairment, even if they are not clinically depressed.42 In addition, individuals with svPPA develop FTLD-like behavioral symptoms and social difficulties, including restlessness, personal neglect, disinhibition, eating habit changes, stereotypical behavior, and empathy loss.19,20 Redirection to meaningful activities may help with improving overall mood, providing a safe alternative for socialization, and preserving some degree of autonomy.

Recent literature describes the benefits of group therapy for individuals with PPA and their caregivers, specifically the opportunity to engage with others who are facing similar challenges.44,45 Ms. C found solace in a support group, specific to PPA, and developed friendships in yoga and belly dancing classes. These commitments also served to structure her time and limit her opportunities to travel alone. Other ideas are creative outlets (eg, crafts, ceramics, art, music, flower arranging), exercise (eg, gardening, swimming, Zumba, tai chi), meditation, and volunteer work. Many people with PPA have latent artistic abilities that may be unmasked or enhanced by their left hemisphere atrophy; that is, artistic abilities are heightened in the setting of the preserved (nonatrophied) right hemisphere and loss of inhibitory effect of the left hemisphere (because of atrophy) on right hemisphere artistic abilities.46 In this case, the family considered the ethical dilemma by finding alternative and safer ways for her to exert her autonomy, particularly in social activities. This resolution reflects sensitivity to patients’ preserved insight regarding health decline despite language loss characteristic of PPA.

Patient-Centered Care to Facilitate Treatment Preferences

Case 4: Mr. S, a 62-year old man with nfaPPA, was accompanied to a speech-language pathology evaluation by his wife who explained that the clinician who had been treating her husband had accepted a position in another state, and a new clinician had been assigned to his care. Since starting therapy with the new clinician, Mr. S has refused to participate in treatment, leaving the therapy room and becoming distraught and agitated until departing the clinical setting. The new therapist and his wife have tried engaging him in 30-minute, rather than 60-minute, treatment sessions and having his wife remain in the treatment room without success. His wife sought this evaluation in hopes of establishing rapport between her husband and another speech-language pathologist. She expressed that she is eager for her husband to resume therapy because he is unable to communicate orally and is increasingly frustrated. She explained that Mr. S has little interest in daily activities, family members, and friends. She said that he requires her help to initiate any activity, including personal care.

Comment: The ethical issue in this case is that Mrs. S wished to engage her husband in therapy, which she perceives as best for him (beneficence principle) despite Mr. S’s apparent desire to disengage from therapy (autonomy principle). Informed consent and refusal depend upon the decision making capacity of patients and the adequacy of disclosure of information by health care providers. Adults are presumed to be competent to make decisions; if we respect their autonomy, then we fully disclose material information and accept their decisions. Decision making capacity can be established by the individual’s ability to demonstrate understanding of relevant information, consider alternatives, explain their decisions, and describe the consequences of their acceptance (or refusal) of recommendations. Decision making capacity will become compromised with progression of PPA; timely execution of legal documents is prudent to protect individuals’ healthcare (and financial) preferences. There are various ways to assess decision making capacity to formulate advance directives. Speech-language pathologists can be helpful in facilitating the expression of preferences of individuals with aphasia.47

In this case, neither Mr. S’s level of comprehension nor the reasons for his apparent refusal to participate in therapy is known. Auditory comprehension is spared in nfaPPA, especially in the early stages of disease, but affected individuals may become mute early in their disease progression.48 A comprehensive speech-language pathology evaluation (or the results of recent prior testing) is needed to determine Mr. S’s receptive and expressive language abilities and to provide alternatives to oral communication, optimizing the possibility for him to express preferences. A collaborative model of care can maximize affected individuals’ involvement in treatment decisions and planning. The Communication Bridge Care Model is a telemedicine approach for mild-to-moderate PPA based on patient-centered care.49 This model can be applied across treatment settings, protecting patients’ autonomy in directing their care. In this case, patient-centered care can facilitate Mr. S’s autonomy through the expression of his treatment preferences while addressing his wife’s goal to do what is best for him in the treatment of his PPA

Conclusions

The practical and ethical challenges presented by the language decline and behavioral manifestations in each of the variants of PPA (lvPPA, nfaPPA, svPPA) are complex. The former autonomy of individuals with PPA and their current best interests must be considered in these difficult situations, resulting in conflicts between the principles of autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence. The management of these challenges involves education of individuals and their caregivers, sensitive redirection to meaningful activities, and judicious implementation of safeguards and protections against vulnerability in critical decision making. Our understanding of PPA continues to evolve and this new knowledge will be vital in preserving autonomy in this neurodegenerative clinical syndrome.
