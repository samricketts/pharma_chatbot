INTRODUCTION:

Vitamin D purportedly protects against cognitive decline and dementia based on observational data using circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3). Little is known about vitamin D in the human brain and the association with dementia or neuropathology.

METHODS:

Decedents of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (n=290) had vitamin D concentrations measured in four brain regions. Associations with cognitive and neuropathological outcomes were estimated using linear and logistic regression.

RESULTS:

The main form of vitamin D in all brain regions was 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3). Higher brain 25(OH)D3 concentrations were associated with a 25% to 33% lower odds of dementia or mild cognitive impairment at the last visit before death (all p≤0.031). However, brain 25(OH)D3 concentrations were not associated with any post-mortem neuropathology outcome studied.

DISCUSSION:

Higher brain 25(OH)D3 concentrations were associated with better cognitive function prior to death. Additional research is needed to clarify the specific mechanisms underlying this potential protective relationship.

pmcINTRODUCTION:

By 2050, the global dementia prevalence is projected to exceed 150 million 1, representing a six-fold increase from 2019. Hence, there is an urgent need for preventive strategies to reduce the burden of AD and dementia as the population ages. Evidence is accumulating that nutritional strategies play a key role in delaying or preventing the onset of cognitive decline and dementia, either through directly affecting neuropathology or by fostering resilience to pathology 2. One nutritional factor that has received considerable attention is vitamin D, an essential fat-soluble vitamin and pro-hormone acquired through the diet and sun exposure.

The 1α-hydroxylase enzyme (CYP27B1) is required to convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), the main circulating form of vitamin D, to the biologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), the form that binds to the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) to exert its biological function 3,4. The resultant vitamin D signaling in the brain is purportedly involved in neurodegeneration 5,6. Several 7–11, but not all 12,13, epidemiological studies have associated low vitamin D intake or circulating 25(OH)D3 levels with cognitive decline and dementia. Whether low vitamin D represents an independent risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia is controversial 14. Several randomized controlled trials have tested the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cognitive performance 15–19, some with reported null findings 15–17. However, the limitations of these trials include not being designed to study cognitive decline as a primary outcome 16,17 and/or studying participants not necessarily at risk for cognitive decline or vitamin D insufficiency 15–17. The observation of change in cognitive performance has often been limited to a period of less than 3 years. Important outstanding questions remain including: (1) are brain levels of vitamin D metabolites associated with cognitive decline or underlying neuropathologies; and (2) do circulating 25(OH)D levels reflect the vitamin D in the human brain? The purpose of this study was to analyze human brain concentrations of vitamin D and related metabolites and determine the associations with antemortem measures of cognitive function and postmortem neuropathologic outcomes in participants of the well-characterized Rush Memory and Aging Project.

In circulation nearly 99% of 25(OH)D is bound, mostly to vitamin D binding protein (DBP) or, to a lesser extent, albumin. A small amount (~1%) is unbound (free). Because free 25(OH)D is more readily taken up by some tissues, it has been suggested free 25(OH)D levels may be more relevant to some health outcomes 20, including AD and dementia 21. Therefore, to identify optimal circulating biomarkers of vitamin D status in the brain, the associations of antemortem circulating total 25(OH)D, free 25(OH)D, and DBP concentrations with antemortem cognitive status and with postmortem neuropathology outcomes were also evaluated.

METHODS

Participants:

Ante- and postmortem measures were conducted in Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) participants. MAP is an ongoing community-based longitudinal study designed to identify risk factors for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Related Disorders and cognitive decline 22. At enrollment, MAP participants are free of known dementia and agree to participate in detailed clinical evaluations annually and organ donation upon death. All participants signed an informed consent and Anatomic Gift Act. The Institutional Review Boards of Rush University Medical Center and Tufts University approved this study. Vitamin D concentrations were measured in brain tissue samples obtained from 499 MAP decedents who died between 2005 and 2019. We previously reported that prolonged freezer storage time reduced brain vitamin D concentrations 23 so we excluded decedents whose brains were stored more than 6 years (n=207) or missing data on APOE genotype (n=2), leaving 290 decedents available for statistical analysis (Supplemental Figure 1). Plasma total 25(OH)D3, free 25(OH)D3, and DBP were measured in 270 of these participants.

Vitamin D Measurements:

Brain:

Vitamin D3, 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)D3 were measured in 4 brain regions [midtemporal cortex (MT), midfrontal cortex (MF), cerebellum (CR), and anterior watershed white matter (AWS)] as previously described 24. The lower limits of detection (LOD) for this assay are as follows: vitamin D3 0.06 pmol/g; 25(OH)D3 0.1 pmol/g, and 1,25(OH)2D3 0.06 pmol/g.

Blood:

Total plasma 25(OH)D3 was measured using LC-MS/MS (Waters Acquity UPLC with TQD triple quadrupole mass spectrometer; CV: 6%) and NIST-traceable standards for assay calibration at Tufts Medical Center. Free 25(OH)D3 was measured by Heartland Assays, LLC directly by immunoassay (Future Diagnostics, Wijchen, Netherlands) with an inter-assay CV of 5.6-6.9%. DBP was measured by a polyclonal ELISA (GenWay Biotech) at Heartland assays. Circulating measures of vitamin D were sampled an average of 2.1 (SD=1.6) and 3.4 (SD=1.9) years before the last assessment of global cognitive function and death, respectively.

Outcome Measurements:

Cognitive Function:

As described elsewhere, MAP participants are enrolled without known dementia and followed annually 25,26. At each visit, global cognitive function was determined using scores from a battery of 19 cognitive tests that evaluated the following cognitive domains: episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and perceptual orientation 27. The person-specific rate of change in the global cognition variable over time was previously determined to estimate individual trajectories of cognitive decline, as described 28. Annual diagnosis was assessed using computer scoring of cognitive tests, clinical judgment by a neuropsychologist, and ultimately by diagnostic classification by a clinician and classified as dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or no cognitive impairment (NCI) 29. At the time of death and blinded to the results of autopsy, a final cognitive diagnosis was made based on all available clinical data reviewed by a neurologist with expertise in dementia, and classified as dementia, MCI, or NCI 29,30.

Neuropathologic Evaluation:

After death, brains were removed and dissected during rapid autopsy using following established protocols as described 31 and evaluated histologically by examiners blinded to clinical information. The median (interquartile range) post-mortem interval was 7.4 (2.8) hours. A quantitative summary of global AD pathology was derived from counts of neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles in the Bielschowski stained sections of the midfrontal cortex, midtemporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus 26. Braak stages were based upon the distribution and severity of neurofibrillary tangle pathology 31. CERAD scores were based on neuritic plaques 31. The Braak stages for neurofibrillary pathology and the CERAD estimate of neuritic plaques was used to derive the NIA–Reagan diagnosis of AD 31. The percent area occupied by amyloid β protein in eight cortical regions was identified by molecular-specific immunohistochemistry and calculated as described 26. Neuronal PHF-tau tangle density and burden were identified by immunohistochemistry in eight regions and quantified as described 26. The age, volume (in mm3), side, and location of macroscopic and microscopic cerebral infarctions were identified as described 32,33. Lewy bodies were identified using immunohistochemistry 34.

Covariates:

At the baseline evaluation, date of birth, sex, and years of education were assessed by self-report. APOE genotype was evaluated as described 35, given the association between APOE genotype and dementia risk.

Statistical Analyses:

Linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate associations of brain 25(OH)D3 and plasma total 25(OH)D3, free 25(OH)D3 and DBP concentrations with continuous and categorical cognitive and neuropathological outcomes. Statistical analyses of the brain regions focused on 25(OH)D3 because 25(OH)D3 was main form of vitamin D in all human brain regions evaluated and was detected in all participants’ brains. Vitamin D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 were also detected but were below the assay LOD in 22% and 58% of participants respectively 23. Clinical cognitive diagnosis and final cognitive diagnosis were analyzed with ordinal logistic regression using dementia, MCI, and NCI categories. Participants who had MCI or AD diagnosis with another condition contributing to cognitive impairment were included in the MCI and AD groups, respectively; participants with other primary cause of dementia were excluded (9 in clinical cognitive diagnosis and 3 in final cognitive diagnosis). Ordinal logistic regression with proportional odds was used for ordered categories, as we saw no evidence for non-proportional odds. Global cognitive function and person-specific rate of change in global cognitive function (slope of global cognition) were analyzed as continuous outcomes. Domain-specific cognitive function and rate of change in domain-specific cognitive function were analyzed as exploratory outcomes using a parallel approach. AD neuropathology was considered as present or absent based on NIA-Reagan criteria and CERAD scores 31,36. Braak stage was categorized as ≤ III or ≥ IV. Lewy Body disease and infarcts were considered present or absent 32. Global pathology, amyloid burden, diffuse and neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangle density and burden were analyzed as continuous outcomes. Appropriate variable transformations were applied to continuous neuropathology outcomes as indicated by Box-Cox transformations and visual inspection of residuals. The 25(OH)D3 concentrations in the midtemporal and midfrontal cortexes were averaged (since the 25(OH)D3 concentrations in these two cortical regions was similar 23) and the anterior watershed and cerebellum were analyzed as separate regions. Covariates included age at death, sex, education (3 levels; ≤12 years, 12–16 years, &gt;16 years), presence of APOE4 allele (2 levels; E4 present or E4 not present), and season of death (for brain analyses) or season of blood draw (for blood measures analyses). When applicable, models were adjusted for post-mortem interval and/or time between last clinic visit and death. A log2 transformation was used for brain 25(OH)D3 to satisfy linearity assumptions. Estimated associations are reported as beta coefficients or odds ratios, OR=exp(β). The 25(OH)D3 concentrations between brain regions were compared using repeated measures ANOVA to model correlation on within-subject measures. Spearman rank coefficients were reported for pairwise correlations among brain regions and between brain and circulating vitamin D levels. Analyses were performed in R v 4.0 (R Core Team, 2020) and the VGAM package 37. An alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.

RESULTS

Participants were, on average, 92±6 years old at the time of death. Seventy-seven percent (77%) were female and 72% had at least 12 years of education Overall, the mean rate of decline in global cognitive scores before death was −0.007 standard units per year and 40% of participants had diagnosed dementia at their last clinic visit (Table 1).

While variable within regions, brain 25(OH)D3 concentrations were correlated across the four regions (intra-class correlation coefficient =0.87) (Figure 1). Plasma total 25(OH)D3 and free 25(OH)D3 were correlated with the brain 25(OH)D3 in the 4 regions measured (r= 0.32–0.39, p≤0.0001). Plasma total 25(OH)D3 and free 25(OH)D3 were correlated with one another (r=0.73, p≤0.0001), but were not correlated with DBP concentrations (r=0.08–0.10, p≥0.09).

The odds of having dementia or MCI at the last cognitive assessment before death were 25% to 33% lower per doubling of 25(OH)D3 in the four brain regions measured (Table 2) (ORs 0.669 to 0.754 all p≤0.031.) These odds were generally consistent with the odds for dementia or MCI at the final cognitive diagnosis. Higher brain 25(OH)D3 concentrations in all regions were also associated with better ante mortem global cognitive function scores (all p≤0.025), and in the AWS, was also associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline (p=0.044) (Table 2). Higher concentrations of 25(OH)D3 in all regions measured were associated with better semantic and working memory and higher 25(OH)D3 concentrations in the AWS were additionally associated with better episodic memory and perceptual speed (Supplemental Table 1). Brain 25(OH)D3 concentrations were not associated with any neuropathology outcome evaluated (Table 3).

Plasma 25(OH)D3, free 25(OH)D3 and DBP concentrations were not significantly associated with global cognitive function or global cognitive decline (all p&gt;0.06) (Supplemental Table 2). Higher DBP concentrations were associated with less decline in semantic memory and perceptual orientation (Supplemental Table 2). Otherwise there were no significant associations between any plasma measure and domain-specific cognitive function. Among the post-mortem neuropathologically-defined outcomes, higher plasma total 25(OH)D3 was associated with fewer chronic microinfarcts (β=0.025 (0.009), p=0.004). Otherwise, the associations of plasma total and free 25(OH)D3 and DBP concentrations with the neuropathologically-defined outcomes evaluated were not statistically significant (all p≥0.12).

DISCUSSION

In this study of older community-dwelling adults, higher brain 25(OH)D3 concentrations were associated with better global cognitive function prior to death but were not associated with any post-mortem neuropathology outcome studied. The 25(OH)D3 was the predominate form of vitamin D in human brain 23. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify vitamin D in human brain tissue and evaluate the associations with cognitive and neuropathological outcomes. That brain 25(OH)D3 was associated with global cognitive status but not with any neuropathology may indicate the 25(OH)D3 in the brain is relevant to neuropathologies not studied here. For example, circulating vitamin D has been associated with white matter hyperintensities 38 and regional brain volumes 39, both of which have been linked to cognitive impairment 40,41. Alternatively, it is plausible that brain 25(OH)D3 concentrations may be an indicator of cognitive resilience, such that individuals with higher levels may display fewer signs of cognitive impairment despite a high neuropathological burden 42. It is also possible 25(OH)D3 may be involved in cognition through pathologies not studied here. Results of our analyses suggest brain 25(OH)D3 concentrations may be more relevant to semantic and working memory. However, given the exploratory nature of these results, it is premature to infer any domain-specific role of 25(OH)D3 in cognitive health.

In this study, plasma total 25(OH)D3 concentrations were moderately correlated with the brain 25(OH)D3 concentrations, but not with cognitive status or cognitive decline. A recent meta-analysis reported that only vitamin D insufficiency (defined as circulating 25(OH)D3 10–19 ng/ml) and deficiency (defined as circulating 25(OH)D &lt;10 ng/ml) were associated with a significantly higher risk for AD and dementia 10. The mean±SD plasma 25(OH)D3 in our sample was 35.2±16.4 ng/ml, which is &gt;10ng/ml above the threshold considered sufficient by the Institute of Medicine (20 ng/ml), and only 12% of our participants had plasma 25(OH)D below this threshold 43, which may have blunted our ability to detect associations. A similar criticism has been made of randomized clinical trials in which the study participants were vitamin D sufficient at the onset of the trial, hence vitamin D supplementation would have little benefit on outcomes, such as cognitive performance 16. Alternatively, circulating 25(OH)D3 may not be a robust biomarker of vitamin D status in the brain, which presents a conundrum that could challenge the utility of basing vitamin D recommendations for cognitive outcomes on circulating 25(OH)D. Of note, we did detect an inverse association between plasma total 25(OH)D3 and chronic microinfarcts. The association with microinfarcts is not strong enough to be maintained if corrections for multiple testing were employed, but we consider this observation to be hypothesis-generating since we did not observe the same associations with brain 25(OH)D3 concentrations.

The majority of circulating 25(OH)D3 is bound to DBP for transport to target tissues. In vivo and in vitro experiments have implicated DBP in reducing amyloid-β aggregation and neuronal cell death 44. In a case-control study of adults ≥60 year old, circulating DBP concentrations were reported to be higher in those with AD than in cognitively normal controls 21. In an analysis of ~2000 older adults (mean age 73 yrs; 920 with AD, 277 with MCI, and 819 controls), higher circulating DBP concentrations were associated with poorer cognitive performance 45. In contrast, plasma DBP concentrations were not significantly associated with global cognitive function or any neuropathology outcome in our study. Given the overall paucity of studies in this area, the involvement of DBP in AD, dementia and cognitive function remains to be determined.

A novel finding in our study was that brain 25(OH)D3 concentrations were also moderately correlated with plasma free 25(OH)D3. However, free 25(OH)D3, while thought to be more readily available to some tissues, including brain 46, was not significantly associated with cognitive function or with any neuropathology outcome evaluated. The results of our study, in which plasma free 25(OH)D3 was measured directly, are in discordance with the only known study to link free circulating 25(OH)D to cognitive status 21. The latter study used the less precise approach of calculating free 25(OH)D3 47 to compare concentrations between adults ≥60 years old diagnosed with AD and those with normal cognitive function 21. It is now known that megalin, which is integral for cellular uptake of bound vitamin D, is expressed in neuronal tissues and has been implicated in neurodegenerative processes 48,49, so the importance of free 25(OH)D3 specifically to brain health remains to be clarified.

This study’s findings should be interpreted in context of its strengths and limitations. The unique application of antemortem biomarker and cognition measures combined with postmortem brain and neuropathologically-defined measures that were obtained from a well-characterized community-based cohort is a notable strength. We had previously conducted a sensitivity analysis that revealed freezer storage time &gt;6 years lowered 25(OH)D3 concentrations across all four brain regions measured 23, so we selected decedents whose brains were stored ≤6 years to enhance confidence that the measures reflected the 25(OH)D3 concentrations at time of death. However, this reduced our statistical power, which may account for detecting some associations that approached, but did not reach, statistical significance. The 1,25(OH)2D3 was below the assay LLD in over half of the brains analyzed, which limited our ability to evaluate the associations of the biologically active form of vitamin D with cognitive or neuropathological outcomes. Most decedents in this study were white, non-Hispanic, so generalizability to other race-ethnic groups is uncertain. Given the observational design, causation cannot be proven. There is the potential for residual confounding, as well as for reverse causation, although time ordering of ante-mortem exposures mitigates this limitation for some of our analyses.

In conclusion, the results of this study suggest vitamin D in the brain may be involved in cognitive decline. However, given the study’s results and acknowledged limitations, steps for future research include: (1) Developing and testing a priori hypotheses about potential domain-specific roles of brain 25(OH)D3 in cognitive health in cohorts with robust measures of performance across multiple cognitive domains; (2) Leveraging technology to develop assays with better sensitivity that more precisely quantify 1,25(OH)2D3 in the brain to advance our knowledge of how the active form of vitamin D is involved in human neuropathology; (3) Applying the design and methodologies of the present study to race-ethnically diverse cohorts, such as the Minority Aging Research Study 50, since vitamin D status is known to differ by race and ethnicity 51 and lower vitamin D intake has been associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline in older black adults 52; and (4) Expanding the analyses of brain structure outcomes, for example using ex-vivo neuroimaging to determine if vitamin D is involved in changes in brain tissue integrity not studied here and/or whether it is an indicator of cognitive resilience.

Systematic Review:

Observational studies report higher circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations were associated with better cognitive function in older adults. Little is known about vitamin D in the human brain. The goal of this study was to analyze postmortem human brain concentrations of vitamin D and related metabolites and determine their association with cognitive function. We also evaluated the association of brain vitamin D concentrations with dementia-related neuropathologies.

Interpretation:

In this study of Rush Memory and Aging Project participants, higher post-mortem brain concentrations of the vitamin D metabolite, 25(OH)D, were associated with better cognitive function prior to death. However, brain 25(OH)D concentrations were not significantly associated with any dementia-related neuropathology outcome studied.

Future Directions:

Additional research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which 25(OH)D has a cognitive protective effect.
