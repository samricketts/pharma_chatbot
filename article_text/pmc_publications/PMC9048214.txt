We described a targeted mass spectrometry assay based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for five apolipoproteins (apoA1, apoB, apoJ, apoD, and apoE) in plasma lipoproteins isolated by anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography using only 100 μL of plasma. We performed analytical characterization of the SRM assay and evaluated reproducibility of the entire workflow. The limit of detections for apoA1, apoB, apoD, apoJ, and apoE were 0.6, 4.6, 0.8, 1.2, and 0.7 nM, respectively; the limit of quantifications was 8.3 nM for all peptides except apoD (4.2 nM). The SRM assay was linear from 0.4 to 1667 nM. The intra-day and inter-day and total repeatability (CV%) of the assay ranged from 2.2% to 21.7% for all five peptides. The intra-day and inter-day and total reproducibility of the entire workflow ranged from 12.2% to 43.9% for all five peptides in fractionated high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and IDL. In the future, we will apply this workflow to investigate the association of fractionated plasma lipoproteins with amyloid deposition and cognitive changes in the context of Alzheimer’s disease.

pmcPlasma lipoproteins play an important role in neuroinflammation as well as in maintaining integrity of the blood–brain barrier, which contributes to development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1]. Each plasma lipoprotein (i.e., high-density lipoprotein [HDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], and very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL]) exhibits a specific and well-characterized subset of apolipoproteins [2–4]. Although changes in apolipoprotein levels (e.g., apoA1, apoE, and apoJ) in unfractionated plasma lipoproteins are correlated with the prevalence and severity of AD [5–7], the magnitude of the correlations were too low to be clinically useful. Our previous findings indicate that much stronger associations between plasma lipoproteins and AD could be identified by using fractionated plasma lipoproteins [8]. Most proteomic studies of plasma lipoproteins rely on ultracentrifugation techniques that are time consuming (e.g., 5.7 h), demand large sample volumes (e.g., 640 μL), and damage the integrity and loss of apolipoprotein content of lipoproteins due to its high shear force [9]. Recently, there have been advancement of methods for lipoprotein fractionation such as flow field-flow fractionation [10]. HDL subclass proteomics analysis also has revealed dynamic protein change during HDL maturation [11].

Anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography (AEX-FPLC) isolates plasma lipoproteins based on surface charge and hydrophobic properties and requires relatively small plasma sample volumes (e.g., 100 μL)[12]. Compared to other commonly used FPLC separation techniques such as size exclusion chromatography, AEX is three times faster and can isolate lipoproteins without overlapping fractions [13]. The objective of this study was to develop and characterize a targeted mass spectrometry assay based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for four apolipoproteins that were previously implicated in the etiology of AD (apoA1, apoD, apoE, and apoJ) [2–4,14]. We also included apoB as a major protein of LDL. We isolated plasma lipoproteins by AEX-FPLC and characterized analytical performance of the assay and reproducibility of the entire workflow based on guidelines [15]. This assay is qualified as a “Tier 2” targeted mass spectrometry assay because it includes heavy stable isotope-labeled (SIL) peptides as internal standards for each protein to ensure peptide identity and reduce variability [16].

Figure 1 illustrates the entire workflow comprised of plasma lipoprotein isolation, ultrafiltration, sample digestion, and targeted mass spectrometry assay (including on-line desalting). Figure 2 shows the AEX-FPLC separation of 100 μL of plasma and collection windows 6 fractions: Fraction 1 (0.51–2.36 min), Fraction 2 (6.7–9.1 min); Fraction 3 (11.68–15.00 min); Fraction 4 (16.66–20.2 min); Fraction 5 (21.83–25.23 min); and Fraction 6 (26.46–28.1 min). Fraction 1 contains poorly retained proteins such as hemoglobin and albumin [17], and the subsequent fractions (F2–F6) correspond to HDL, LDL, IDL, VLDL, and chylomicrons [12,17]. Repeatability (CV%) of the AEX-FPLC separation, based on area under curve of UV absorption at 280 nm, was 6.7%, 5.1%, 6.5%, and 7.4% (n = 4, four independent aliquots of a pooled plasma sample separated four times within 1 day) for HDL, LDL, IDL, and VLDL, respectively (Figure 1, Step 1).

Plasma lipoprotein fractions HDL, LDL, IDL, and VLDL were each concentrated first using a 4 mL and then a 0.5 mL centrifugal filter to a final volume of 20 μL. Both filters are 3000 Da, nominal molecular weight limit. Protein concentrations of the concentrated fractions were measured by UV at 280 nm (NanoDrop 2000c Spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Repeatability (CV%) after ultrafiltration, based on protein concentrations, were 14%, 15%, 29%, and 31% (n = 15, based on three independent aliquots of a pooled plasma sample processed each day for 5 days) for HDL, LDL, IDL, and VLDL, respectively (Figure 1, Step 2).

Sample preparation details including digestion are included in the Supplementary Materials. Table S1 lists proteotypic peptides and SRM transitions for detection of apoA1, apoB, apoJ, apoD, and apoE. Selection of these proteotypic peptides and SRMs are described in the Supplementary Materials. Figure S1 illustrates the extracted chromatograms of the proteotypic peptides and SRM transitions.

Because digested plasma lipoprotein fractions contain endogenous peptides from target proteins, we established sensitivity and linearity by establishing a reverse response curve using SIL peptides instead. Briefly, an SIL peptide stock was serially diluted into a matrix that was comprised of equal volume of digested plasma lipoproteins HDL, LDL, IDL, and VLDL from a plasma sample. The final concentrations of prepared SIL peptides were 1667.0, 833.5, 416.7, 83.3, 41.7, 8.3, 4.2, 0.83, and 0.42 nM. A blank sample was the matrix without SIL peptides. Samples were analyzed from the lowest to the highest SIL concentration in triplicates with blank samples in between to reduce carryover. Linearity was evaluated by fitting a linear regression (y = ax + b), where y = ratio of total peak area [sum of the three transitions] of an SIL to its endogenous peptide and x = expected SIL concentration) using at least five concentrations. The response is considered linear if r2 is &gt;0.99 or &lt;1.01. All the SIL peptides showed linear responses over at least four orders of magnitude (0.42–1667.0 nM) (Figure S2). LOD was determined as the SIL peptide concentration corresponding to the mean peak area ratio of blank plus three times the standard deviation while LOQ was determined as the lowest SIL concentration measured that meets the linearity (r2 &gt; 0.99 or &lt;1.01) and precision (CV &lt; 20%) requirements. The LODs for apoA1, apoB, apoD, apoJ, and apoE were 0.6, 4.6, 0.8, 1.2, and 0.7 nM, respectively; LOQs were 8.3 nM for all peptides except apoD that had an LOQ of 4.2 nM.

Then we evaluated the intra-day, inter-day, and total repeatability of targeted mass spectrometry assay including the on-line desalting using randomized triplicate injections of samples of three SIL concentrations: low (1.5 × LOQ), medium (25 × LOQ), and high (100 × LOQ) over 5 consecutive days (≥16 h apart) (n = 15) (Figure 1, Step 3). These samples were prepared by spiking an SIL mixture into the peptide digest mixture at concentrations of 12.5, 208.4, and 833.5 nM except for NILT-SNNIDVK (apoD) which were 6.3, 104.2, and 416.8 nM, respectively. Total peak area ratio of an SIL to its endogenous peptide was used for repeatability evaluation. The intra-day repeatability (CVintra) was calculated at each concentration as the mean CV of the total peak area ratios in the triplicate measurements of 5 days. The inter-day repeatability (CVinter) was the mean CV of the total peak area ratios of the first, second, and third replicates across 5 days. The total repeatability (CVtotal) was calculated using CVintra and CVinter based on the following equation: (1) (CVintra)2+(CVinter)2

Figure 3A shows the intra-day, inter-day, and total repeatability at low, medium, and high SIL concentrations in which total CVs ranged from 3.9% to 21.7%, 4.3% to 12.0 %, and 7.6% to 11.1%, respectively, with a median total CV of ≤9.6%. The results suggest that all peptides have acceptable levels of short-term (5-day) precision (CV &lt; 20%) except for HLIDSLIDFLNFPR (apoB) at the lowest SIL concentration (21.7%) (Table S2).

Lastly, we evaluated intra-day, inter-day, and total reproducibility of the entire workflow including plasma lipoprotein isolation, sample digestion, SRM assay (including on-line desalting). Three aliquots of a pooled plasma sample were isolated and digested each over 3 sequential days (&gt;16 h apart) and spiked with an SIL peptide mixture prior to SRM analysis (n = 9) (Figure 1). Figure 3B shows the overall intra-day, inter-day, and total reproducibility CV% for the entire workflow for all five peptides in HDL, LDL, IDL, and VLDL. The overall reproducibility of the workflow in HDL, LDL, IDL, and VLDL ranged from 20.1% to 43.9%; 19.1% to 37.1%; 23.7% to 33.7%, and 64.1% to 117.5%, respectively (Table S3). VLDL showed the greatest variability that may be a consequence of the lower abundances of these five apolipoproteins in VLDL compared to HDL, LDL, and IDL. Excluding VLDL, total CVs for all peptides was ≤35% except for apoE in HDL (43.9%), apoD in LDL (37.1%).[16]

Total CVs for the entire workflow were higher than the total CVs for the SRM assay alone, which is expected because the entire workflow included additional procedures such as sample digestion. Because SIL peptides were added after digestion, they cannot be used to correct for digestion variability. We added 15N-labeled apoA1 before sample digestion. When a heavy isotope-labeled peptide from digested 15N-labeled apoA1 was used to normalize endogenous (light) peptide, the total CV for the entire workflow was reduced from 42.2% to 20.2% for apoA1 in HDL (Table S4). This demonstrated that adding 15N-labeled apoA1 before digestion can further correct for digestion variability and improve the reproducibility of the entire workflow.

Our study has limitations. First of all, we did not perform proteomic survey (or profiling) of these plasma lipoproteins. Instead, we focused on five proteins based on their implications in AD. Second, we only evaluated reproducibility based on technical replicates of a pooled plasma sample and did not address potential sources of variations from clinical samples. Third, even though the higher variance reported for proteins in VLDL fraction appears to be due to lower protein abundance, we cannot exclude the possibility that other sources such as lipids that may be contributory. That being said, the online solid phase extraction step should be able to extract lipids out of digested peptides before targeted mass spectrometry analysis.

In conclusion, we developed a targeted proteomic assay for the analysis of five proteins (apoA1, apoB, apoJ, apoD, and apoE) in plasma lipoprotein [16]. Compared to commonly used ultracentrifugation approaches, the AEX-FPLC plasma lipoprotein isolation is nine times faster and consumes relatively small sample volume (i.e., 100 μL), which is an important factor to consider when precious samples from clinical trials and epidemiological studies are used.
