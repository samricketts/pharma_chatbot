To investigate how differences in income and education levels may contribute to disparities in incidence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), we compared ADRD incidence in traditional Medicare claims for 11,132 Black and 7,703 White participants aged 65 and over from a predominantly low-income cohort. We examined whether the relationship between ADRD incidence and race varied by income or education. Based on 2,015 incident ADRD diagnoses, Black and White participants had unadjusted incidence rates of 26.5 and 23.2 cases per 1,000 person-years, respectively (rate ratio 1.14, 95% CI 1.05–1.25). In multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, the relationship between race and incident ADRD diagnosis did not vary by education level (p-interaction=0.748) but was modified by income level (p-interaction=0.007), with higher ADRD incidence among Black participants observed only among higher income groups. These results highlight the importance of understanding how race and economic factors influence ADRD incidence and diagnosis rates.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Over 13 million adults in the United States are projected to develop Alzheimer’s disease or related dementia (ADRD) by 2060, including 2.2 million Black adults (Matthews et al., 2019). Black older adults have higher ADRD incidence rates than White older adults in most comparisons (Perkins et al., 1997; Tang et al., 2001; Fitzpatrick et al., 2004; Manly et al., 2008; Yaffe et al., 2013; Mayeda et al., 2016; Steenland et al., 2016; Weuve et al., 2018; Kornblith et al., 2022; Beydoun et al., 2022), although some studies with smaller numbers of Black participants find no statistical difference in ADRD incidence rates (Rodriguez et al., 2018; Fillenbaum et al., 1998). These studies and the broader literature (reviewed in (Barnes &amp; Bennett, 2014) have investigated multiple factors that may contribute to this disparity, including differences in comorbidities, socioeconomic resources, genetic risk factors, health behaviors, and baseline cognitive scores. The greater presence of some modifiable ADRD risk factors among Black individuals reflects that racism in the United States has limited access to health care, education, and economic opportunities and led to higher rates of chronic conditions for Black individuals (Williams &amp; Collins, 2001; Phelan &amp; Link, 2015; Wilkins et al., 2020).

To lower ADRD incidence and address this disparity, researchers have called for more studies that measure ADRD incidence within Black and African American populations (Barnes &amp; Bennett, 2014; Wilkins et al., 2020). The Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS), which has followed Black and White residents of the Southeastern United States for over 15 years, allows for this type of analysis in a large, predominantly low-income cohort. The SCCS combines Medicare claims data for identifying ADRD incidence with survey data collected at cohort entry on factors that may increase ADRD risk. This study focuses on the role of race, education, and income in ADRD incidence rates among SCCS participants.

Lower education levels predict a greater likelihood of developing ADRD, potentially because education may boost individuals’ cognitive reserves (Evans et al., 1997; Livingston et al., 2017; Stern et al., 1994). Recent declines in dementia incidence and prevalence may be partially attributable to gains in education levels across generations (C. Chen &amp; Zissimopoulos, 2018; Langa et al., 2017; Noble et al., 2017; Satizabal et al., 2016; Sheffield &amp; Peek, 2011). Less evidence is available on whether income levels are a risk factor for ADRD. Household income below $10,000 has been associated with greater dementia risk (Yaffe et al., 2013) and a few studies found a significant, independent association between dementia incidence and income even after adjusting for other socioeconomic factors that may be closely related to income. Higher income levels are independently associated with reduced risk of incident dementia in older adults with income below 500% of the federal poverty threshold in models that also adjusted for education level, financial strain, and occupational history (Samuel et al., 2020). After accounting for childhood socioeconomic status and education level, rates of cognitive decline are also lower among adults with higher income levels in late adulthood (Marden et al., 2017). In contrast, a smaller study based in Boston found no significant association between income and Alzheimer’s disease incidence after adjusting for education and occupational status (Evans et al., 1997).

When comparing ADRD incidence between Black and White individuals, some analyses have investigated whether education and adulthood income levels mediate the relationship between race and ADRD incidence. After accounting for differences in education or other socioeconomic factors, the increased risk of dementia incidence for Black adults is attenuated in several (Fitzpatrick et al., 2004; Weuve et al., 2018; Yaffe et al., 2013), but not all (Tang et al., 2001) studies. Fewer studies have examined whether the relationship between race and dementia incidence varies by education level or other socioeconomic factors. Fitzpatrick and coauthors (2004) found a significant relationship between education level and dementia incidence among White participants, but not among Black participants, although smaller numbers of Black participants limited evaluation. After adjusting for childhood socioeconomic status, Weuve and coauthors (2018) did not find a significant interaction between race and education level. Yaffe et al (2013) also found no significant interactions between race and several socioeconomic indicators (education level, literacy level, family income, financial inadequacy) when comparing dementia incidence among Black and White participants.

This study investigates differences in an incident ADRD diagnosis in claims data among Black and White SCCS participants. We examine whether the relationship between ADRD incidence and race varied by education level or income in adulthood. We hypothesize that there may be a significant interaction between these variables given prior evidence that education levels are more strongly associated with ADRD incidence for White individuals than Black individuals.

METHODS

Study setting and data

We analyzed ADRD diagnosis incidence among older participants of the SCCS, a prospective cohort study of over 84,000 residents from 12 Southeastern states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia). The SCCS was designed to study Black-White health disparities in cancer and other health outcomes. To be eligible for the SCCS, participants had to be between the ages of 40–79 at baseline with no recent history of cancer treatment. Recruitment occurred between March 2002 and September 2009 with most participants (85%) enrolling from recruitment sites at 71 community health centers and less than 15% recruited from the general population by mail. At enrollment, participants completed surveys detailing clinical diagnoses, lifestyle behaviors, and socioeconomic indicators (Signorello et al., 2010). The Institutional Review Boards of Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Meharry Medical College approved the protocol of the SCCS.

Linked Medicare claims data for inpatient, skilled nursing facility, outpatient, and physician services provided longitudinal information on SCCS participants’ history of ADRD diagnoses. Depending upon when a participant enrolled in Medicare, claims data were available from 1999 (prior to SCCS baseline survey completion) through 2016.

Study population and exclusion criteria

The study population included SCCS participants who were aged 65 or older between study enrollment and the year 2016. We selected beneficiaries continuously enrolled in traditional Medicare (Parts A and B) with fee-for-service coverage for at least 1 year at any point following SCCS enrollment.

Among the 32,158 SCCS participants who survived to age 65 by 2016, we linked 31,483 participants to Medicare data. We excluded those who never had at least 12 months of traditional Medicare enrollment (N=10,716), who had an ADRD claim before age 65 (N=275), or who had an ADRD diagnosis within their first 12 months of traditional Medicare enrollment (N=642) since we could not identify whether these diagnoses were incident cases (Griffiths et al., 2013). We also excluded participants who reported a race other than Black or White, reported multiple race or ethnic groups, or had missing information on race and ethnicity (N=1,015) because the relatively small number of SCCS participants in this group precluded examining other racial or ethnic disparities in ADRD incidence. Our final study cohort included 18,835 SCCS participants.

Outcome measure – ADRD

The primary outcome of interest was time to initial ADRD diagnosis, identified based on the first appearance of an ADRD diagnosis in Medicare claims data. According to validation studies that compared claims-based diagnoses to in-person cognitive assessments, claims data have 85% sensitivity and 89% specificity in identifying ADRD (Taylor et al., 2009). Using the same ICD-9 and ICD-10 ADRD diagnoses as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Chronic Conditions Warehouse (Appendix Table 1) (Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse, 2016), we identified participants’ first inpatient, skilled nursing facility, outpatient, or carrier claim with an ADRD diagnosis. Supplemental sensitivity analyses required participants to have at least two claims with ADRD diagnoses on two different dates to be identified as having incident ADRD. The number of diagnosis fields on CMS claims has expanded over time, which can be misinterpreted as an increase in comorbidity among the Medicare population (Ody et al., 2019). To avoid confusing this increase in data availability as increasing ADRD incidence over time, we only identified ADRD diagnoses in the initial 8 ICD codes of carrier claims and the initial 9 ICD Codes of outpatient, inpatient, and skilled nursing facility claims.

Because ADRD identification is based on claims data, one competing risk for ascertaining an ADRD diagnosis is discontinuing traditional Medicare coverage. Participants may instead enroll in a Medicare Advantage managed care plan. Because Medicare Advantage claims data were not available for our study period, this switch to Medicare Advantage censored follow-up of ADRD incidence. Accordingly, a participant’s observable time at risk in claims data may end due to Medicare Advantage enrollment or, in rare cases, end of any Medicare participation. Participants’ follow up time may also be censored due to death or the end of claims data availability (December 2016).

Observable time at risk in claims data was determined based on the timing of the SCCS baseline survey and traditional Medicare enrollment relative to a participant’s age (Appendix Figure 1). For each participant, we identified whether these events occurred in different calendar years: completion of the SCCS baseline survey, turning age 65, or initial enrollment in traditional Medicare Part A and B. To ensure that we were measuring incident diagnoses of ADRD, we required participants to have at least 12 months of traditional Medicare coverage without an ADRD claim starting in the calendar year of the last event. Participant’s time at risk in claims data started in the subsequent month.

Covariates

Except for age, all covariates describing individual characteristics are based on SCCS participants’ self-report on the baseline survey. To investigate Black-White disparities in ADRD diagnosis incidence, we used participants’ self-reported race and ethnicity to identify participants who were non-Hispanic Black (including African American) or White. To identify race and ethnicity, participants were asked to select all applicable categories from a pre-specified list. Demographic characteristics included sex and age. Age indicated participant’s age when her observable time at risk in Medicare claims data began (categorized as age 65–69, 70–74, 75–79, and 80 years and above). Sex and age are potential confounders for ADRD incidence with older adults facing much higher risk for ADRD.

Socioeconomic indicators included education (high school or less, some college, college or more than college), annual household income (&lt;$15,000, $15–24,999, $25,000–49,999, $50,000 or more), and employment status (not employed, employed). Indicators of household circumstances included marital status (married, previously married, never married) and household size (living alone, two people, three or more people). Collectively, these factors may be considered mediators of the relationship between race and ADRD diagnosis incidence because of limited economic and educational opportunities for Black adults (VanderWeele &amp; Robinson, 2014).

To account for other health-related factors that may affect risk of ADRD, we included covariates for smoking status (current, former, never smoker), alcohol consumption (None, &lt;=3 drinks per day, &gt;3 drinks per day), body mass index (&lt;25.0, 25.0–&lt;30.0, 30.0+ kg/m2) and self-reported diagnosis history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), diabetes, and cancer. Health-related behaviors and comorbidities can also be identified as potential mediators of the relationship between Black race and ADRD diagnosis incidence because of the economic factors discussed in the previous paragraph and barriers to accessing high quality health care.

All self-reported variables included categories to identify values that were missing or not reported by participants. Providers’ coding practices for identifying ADRD diagnoses may have changed over time, so one covariate was the calendar year that the observable time at-risk in claims data began (categorized as 2003–2006, 2007–2010, 2011–2013, 2014–2016).

Analysis approach

First, we summarized descriptive statistics of the study population and the unadjusted cumulative incidence of ADRD diagnosis and Medicare Advantage enrollment. We report incidence rates for the entire population and separately by income level and by education level. Next, we modeled incidence of ADRD diagnosis using a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model that included race and all the variables described in the covariates section. We tested for an interaction between race and income level and between race and education level by including each of these interaction terms in the fully adjusted model.

Since only the interaction between income and race was statistically significant, we then estimated Cox proportional hazard models stratified by income level to estimate whether ADRD diagnosis incidence differed between Black and White participants within the same income group. These models were estimated twice. Model 1 included adjustment for age, sex, and calendar year that observable time at-risk in claims data began. This approach allowed us to examine hazard ratios among individuals with similar income levels without adjusting for other covariates like comorbidities that could also be closely correlated with income levels and with ADRD incidence. Model 2 included adjustment for all covariates. If these covariates mediate the relationship between race and ADRD incidence, then hazard ratio estimates for the differences in ADRD incidence between Black and White participants could be attenuated relative to Model 1.

To assess if our results were sensitive to different approaches, we conducted several sensitivity analyses that examined whether the interaction between race and income was significant with stricter inclusion criteria and identification of incident ADRD diagnosis. We present one version of the fully-adjusted model that excluded all SCCS participants who reported any missing data for any of the covariates (n=2,241 participants excluded). The CCW algorithm for identifying ADRD diagnoses uses three years of claims data, so one sensitivity analysis limited our population to those who had at least 36 continuous months of traditional Medicare enrollment without an ADRD diagnosis, Medicare Advantage enrollment, death or discontinuation of Medicare benefits before measuring observable time at risk (n=5,860 participants excluded). Because some participants may have experienced a multi-year gap between when they completed the baseline survey and when they started Medicare coverage, we performed a sensitivity analysis that focused on participants whose baseline survey data was collected in closer proximity to when their Medicare claims data were available. This version excluded those participants who did not complete the baseline survey within three years of the start of their observable time at risk in claims data (n=10,637 participants excluded). To see if our measure of ADRD incidence was sensitive to requiring more than one claim with an ADRD diagnosis, we created an alternative date of ADRD incidence based on having at least two claims with ADRD diagnoses on two different dates. Finally, to assess whether competing risks of Medicare Advantage enrollment may have affected our assessment of whether there was a significant interaction between race and income, we estimated a Fine-Gray survival model treating Medicare Advantage enrollment as a competing risk.

Results

Among the 18,835 SCCS participants with continuous traditional Medicare, the majority self-reported race as Black or African American (59.1%, Table 1). Most SCCS participants reported annual household income lower than $25,000, but Black participants were more likely to report income levels lower than $15,000 (56.8%) compared to White participants (37.6%, p&lt;0.001). Black participants were also more likely to report having a high school education level or less (66.2%) compared to White participants (50.7%, p&lt;0.001). Black participants had higher rates of self-reported hypertension and diabetes than White participants, but lower rates of hyperlipidemia, stroke, cancer (including skin cancer), and any smoking or alcohol consumption. Black participants had higher BMI than White participants.

During 80,536 person-years of observable time at risk in claims data, 2,015 incident ADRD diagnoses (850 incident cases for White participants and 1,165 incidence cases for Black participants) were observed among the 18,835 participants. Based on observable time at risk available in traditional Medicare claims data, the ADRD diagnosis incidence rate was 25.0 cases per 1,000 person-years. The unadjusted incidence rates were 26.5 per 1,000 person-years for Black SCCS participants and 23.2 per 1,000 person-years for White participants (hazard ratio 1.17, 95% CI [1.07, 1.27], p=0.001).

Black participants were substantially more likely than White participants to enroll in Medicare Advantage plans throughout the follow-up period, which censored our ability to observe an ADRD diagnosis in traditional Medicare claims data and suggested that Medicare Advantage enrollment should be investigated as a potential competing risk to ADRD diagnosis. By the end of the follow-up period, a total of 36.9% of Black participants had enrolled in Medicare Advantage compared to 22.2% of White participants. Figure 1 shows these Medicare Advantage differences, as well as crude cumulative ADRD incidence rates, across the follow-up period. Appendix Table 2 provides more details about the differences in participants’ characteristics by their outcome status. Relative to beneficiaries who were followed in traditional Medicare claims data until the end of 2016 without an ADRD diagnosis, beneficiaries who enrolled in Medicare Advantage were older and more likely to have income below $15,000.

Risk of ADRD diagnosis increased with declining income, with unadjusted incidence rates at least twice as high among those with incomes less than $15,000 vs $50,000 or more among both Black and White participants (Table 2). In fully adjusted models, however, we observed a statistically significant interaction between race and income (p-interaction = 0.007). Among participants with income below $25,000, Black participants had lower incidence of ADRD diagnosis relative to White participants (significantly so for those with income $15,000-$24,999, hazard ratio 0.78, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.98). Among participants with income of $25,000 or more, ADRD diagnosis incidence was higher among Black than White participants. These differences were statistically significant for those with incomes of $50,000 or more with adjustment for age and sex (hazard ratio: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.05), but there was no statistical difference in the fully adjusted model (hazard ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.84, 1.77).

ADRD diagnosis incidence tended to rise with declining educational attainment for both Black and White participants (Appendix Table 3). Unadjusted incidence rates were at least 65% higher among participants with a high school education or less relative to participants with a college education. The interaction between race and education level was not statistically significant (p-interaction = 0.748) in fully adjusted models.

All sensitivity analyses that varied the study population or ADRD identification approach found a statistically significant interaction between race and income. These associations were observed when we excluded participants with missing data (p=0.03), excluded participants with less than three years of traditional Medicare claims data (p=0.04), limited the study population to those with less than three years between SCCS enrollment survey and observable time at risk in claims data (p=0.010), or required two different claims with an ADRD diagnosis to be counted as having an incidence ADRD diagnosis (p&lt;0.001). Stratified analyses based on these sensitivity specifications also usually found that Black participants in the $15,000–24,999 income group had lower risk of ADRD diagnosis incidence than White participants in that income group, although this relationship was not significant when excluding participants with missing data or participants with less than three years of traditional Medicare claims data (Table 3). When we used a Fine-Gray approach to treat Medicare Advantage enrollment as a competing risk to ADRD incidence, we still found a significant interaction between race and income (p&lt;0.001) and, in stratified analyses, lower risk of ADRD diagnosis incidence for Black versus White participants in two lower income strata (Appendix Table 4; hazard ratio for participants with income &lt;$15,000: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.70–0.90; hazard ratio for participants with income between $15,000 and $24,999: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.83).

DISCUSSION

Among a predominantly low-income cohort in the Southeast, the unadjusted ADRD diagnosis incidence rates were 26.5 cases per 1,000 person-years for Black participants and 23.2 cases per 1,000 person-years for White participants. Household income was a strong risk factor, with incidence rates more than twice as high among the lowest (&lt;$15,000) vs highest ($50,000+) income groups for both Black and White participants. In multivariable fully adjusted models, the relationship between race and ADRD diagnosis incidence varied significantly by income; when income levels exceeded $25,000 there was about a 20% higher ADRD risk among Black participants, but when income levels were below $25,000 there was up to about a 10–20% higher incidence among White participants. Educational level was also a strong rick factor, but the relationship between race and ADRD diagnosis incidence did not vary by education level.

Other studies have investigated whether the relationship between race and ADRD incidence may vary by socioeconomic factors, although evidence is mixed (Fitzpatrick et al., 2004; Weuve et al., 2018; Yaffe et al., 2013). Compared to these other recent ADRD incidence studies, our analysis has several differences in the population selection criteria and the approach for identifying dementia that could explain some differences in study findings. In contrast to previous studies that were limited to participants recruited in 1 or 2 sites, the SCCS cohort is much larger and more geographically diverse, spanning 12 states. Those analyses also had more robust data to identify incidence of dementia. Weuve et al 2018 identified dementia based exclusively on standardized exams and cognitive assessments, while Yaffe et al 2013 used information from standardized cognitive assessments supplemented with data from hospital admissions and prescription drug use. Because these studies used standardized cognitive assessments, there is less risk that those studies failed to identify cases of incident dementia compared to our claims-based approach.

Our study’s reliance on claims data for ADRD diagnosis means that ADRD incidence is probably undercounted in our population, especially for Black participants. Conditional on having dementia, White patients are more likely to be diagnosed with ADRD than patients who are Black: some studies with small sample sizes find no significant difference in underdiagnosis between White and Black participants after adjusting for other factors (Savva &amp; Arthur, 2015; Amjad et al., 2018) but more robust analyses of larger cohort populations find that White adults with dementia are more likely to have a Medicare claim for ADRD than Black adults with dementia (Chen et al., 2019; Gianattasio et al., 2019) or adults who are not White (Grodstein et al., 2022). Among patients with likely cognitive impairment according to standardized assessments, providers are also less likely to document an ADRD diagnosis on a health care claim for older adults with less than a high school degree (Amjad et al., 2018; Y. Chen et al., 2019; Savva &amp; Arthur, 2015).

A bias in identifying incident ADRD for Black participants could influence the interpretation of our results. It is possible that the lower ADRD incidence we observed among Black participants compared to White participants when income was low (&lt;$25,000) might reflect lower likelihoods of being diagnosed with ADRD instead of lower risk of developing ADRD. This possibility is enhanced by our observation that among those with higher incomes, where dementia underdiagnosis may be less likely, there was a higher incidence of ADRD among Black than White participants. Our study does not account for whether Black participants had worse access to health care or experienced poorer quality services than White participants, which might contribute to potentially underdiagnosing ADRD among Black participants.

Although our study cannot elucidate the mechanism underlying the relationship between socioeconomic factors and ADRD incidence, these findings provide further evidence of the importance of considering how socioeconomic resources affect ADRD trends among older adults, especially among Black older adults who have lower levels of income, wealth, and education on average compared to White older adults. As indicated in Table 2, while income was a key determinant among both Black and White participants, there was a strong monotonically declining incidence of ADRD with rising income among White participants, but the trend was less steep and more uneven among Black participants. A large body of evidence finds that racial disparities in health outcomes are usually attenuated after accounting for socioeconomic factors, but rarely eliminated due to the additional individual health effects of discrimination and other contextual factors (LaVeist, 2005; Nuru-Jeter et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2016). Racism and racist policies, such as those that established and perpetuate residential racial segregation in the United States and particularly the South, have led to large racial disparities in access to education and economic opportunities that put Black older adults at greater risk of poor health outcomes like dementia (Williams &amp; Collins, 2001; Phelan &amp; Link, 2015; Wilkins et al., 2020). As strategies to prevent, treat, or delay ADRD are developed, ADRD disparities could increase if access to these measures varies by race and socioeconomic resources or if these strategies are based on evidence from study cohorts that are not racially and ethnically diverse (Phelan &amp; Link, 2015; Wilkins et al., 2020). Aducanumab, for example, was approved to treat early Alzheimer’s disease based on a drug trial treatment arm that included only 6 Black participants and the drug’s high price could be a barrier to use among Black older adults with limited financial resources (Manly &amp; Glymour, 2021).

Our findings also highlight the importance of recognizing emerging limitations in measuring disease outcomes and health disparities for older adults in traditional Medicare claims data. Enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has surged over the past two decades, increasing from 17% of all Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in these managed care plans in 2000 to 36% in 2020 (Freed et al., 2020). Like what we observed in the SCCS population, another ADRD incidence analysis using claims found higher Medicare Advantage enrollment among Black individuals (Grodstein et al., 2022). National data show that Medicare beneficiaries who are Black or live in lower income areas are more likely to enroll in these plans (Meyers et al., 2021). This shift towards managed care has significant implications for disease and ADRD surveillance among older adults in administrative data sources. Until Medicare Advantage claims data are validated and more widely available, researchers will have less insight into disease outcomes and treatment patterns for older adults who are Black or have limited socioeconomic resources.

Our study has several limitations. First, in addition to the concerns outlined above about ADRD diagnosis accuracy, claims-based methods for identifying ADRD are more likely to identify more severe cases of ADRD and less likely to identify milder dementia (Grodstein et al., 2022; Taylor et al., 2009). Second, we cannot measure important additional mediating factors like wealth, quality of education, and perceived discrimination (Nuru-Jeter et al., 2018; Wilkins et al., 2020) nor can we measure potential confounding factors like a participant’s socioeconomic status at birth (VanderWeele &amp; Robinson, 2014). Third, since the SCCS cohort has fewer participants with higher income levels, our analyses have less statistical power to evaluate differences in ADRD incidence by race in higher income groups. Fourth, due to multiple years of follow-up data, participants’ socioeconomic circumstances and exposure to other ADRD risk factors may have changed between the SCCS baseline survey and the time Medicare claims data follow-up started. Fifth, the SCCS population was recruited almost entirely from community health centers and therefore is not representative of the broader population, which limits how generalizable our findings are regarding racial differences in ADRD incidence. It is unclear whether providers in community health centers are more or less likely to diagnose ADRD. Finally, we excluded the limited numbers of SCCS participants who reported a race other than Black or White and therefore could not assess differences by race in those populations.

In this analysis of a predominantly low-income population residing in the Southeast United States, we found that the relationship between race and ADRD incidence varied among income groups, with slightly lower incidence among Black than White participants in the lowest income groups but mildly higher incidence among Black than White participants among the higher income groups.

Appendix Figure 1 Observable time at risk in claims data

For each participant, we identified whether these events occurred in different calendar years: completion of the SCCS baseline survey, turning age 65, or initial enrollment in traditional Medicare Part A and B. To ensure that we were measuring incident diagnoses of ADRD, we required participants to have at least 12 months of traditional Medicare coverage without an ADRD claim starting in the calendar year of the last event. Participant’s observable time at risk in claims data started in the subsequent month:

Participants varied in terms of whether SCCS enrollment, starting traditional Medicare coverage, or turning age 65 occurred last (or concurrently). For example, observable time at risk began 12 months after his or her SCCS enrollment year for a participant who first enrolled in Medicare with a disability, then turned age 65, and then later enrolled in the SCCS.

Observable time at risk began 12 months after turning age 65 and concurrently joining Medicare for a participant who enrolled in SCCS prior to age 65 and then later enrolled in Medicare upon turning age 65.

What this paper adds

Although other studies have examined differences in ADRD incidence for Black and White individuals, this paper is one of the first to examine incidence ADRD diagnoses in a predominantly low-income cohort.

Application of study findings

This paper provides evidence that the relationship between incident ADRD diagnosis and race is modified by income. Policymakers should consider these factors while developing strategies to address disparities in disease incidence and access to treatment for ADRD.

Our results raise several questions for future research, including how claims-based analysis of ADRD can account for potential biases due to differential rates of diagnosis and differential rates of participation in traditional Medicare versus Medicare Advantage (where longitudinal claims data is not available).

Conflict of Interest: The authors report no conflicts of interest.

The Southern Community Cohort Study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Protocol Number 010345) and Meharry Medical College (Protocol Number 14-02-132).
