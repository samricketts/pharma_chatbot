BACKGROUND:

There is considerable heterogeneity in clinical presentation among people with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD). We have categorized people with LOAD into subgroups based on relative impairments across cognitive domains. These 6 groups are people with no relatively impaired domains (AD-No Domains), 4 groups with one relatively impaired domain (AD-Memory, AD-Executive, AD-Language, and AD-Visuospatial), and a group with multiple relatively impaired domains (AD-Multiple Domains). Our previous analysis demonstrated that genetic factors vary across cognitively-defined LOAD groups.

OBJECTIVE:

To determine whether risks associated with depression and traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness (TBI) for cognitively defined LOAD subgroups are similar.

METHODS:

We used cognitive data at LOAD diagnosis from three prospective cohort studies to determine cognitively-defined subgroups. We compared subgroups in endorsement of items from the Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale and history of TBI.

RESULTS:

Among 1505 people with LOAD from the three studies, there were substantial differences across subgroups in total CES-D score, with lower scores (less depression) for people with AD with relative impairments in memory (AD-Memory) compared to those in other groups. Differences were noteworthy for the sleep-related item of the CES-D, as people with AD-Memory were less likely to report restless sleep than people in other groups. There were no differences in TBI history across groups.

CONCLUSIONS:

Differences in risk factor associations across subgroups such as differences in endorsement of depression symptoms and restless sleep provide support for the hypothesis that there are biologically coherent subgroups of Alzheimer’s disease.

pmc1. Introduction

There is considerable heterogeneity in clinical presentation in late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD).1,2,3 We have developed a framework to assign people with LOAD to subgroups based on relative impairments across cognitive domains.4 This framework results in 6 groups, including people with no relatively impaired domains (AD-No Domains), 4 groups with exactly one relatively impaired domain (AD-Memory, AD-Executive, AD-Language, and AD-Visuospatial), and a group with multiple relatively impaired domains (AD-Multiple Domains). Analyses across multiple datasets suggest cognitively-defined subgroups have distinct genetic architectures and thus biological differences.5

Studies of LOAD risk factors have largely ignored clinical heterogeneity, though some studies have evaluated associations with cognitive profiles6. All people with LOAD are considered representatives of a single group in nearly all risk factor analyses. We previously found differences across cognitively-defined subgroups related to APOE genotype; higher proportions of the AD-Memory group had ≥1 APOE e4 allele.4,5

Different patterns of risk factor findings across different cognitively-defined LOAD subgroups may be important. Unique associations with a single subgroup or associations with multiple (but not all) subgroups may elucidate etiology. Similarly, differential associations with risk factors may facilitate more specific anticipatory guidance.

In this paper, we explored associations with LOAD subgroups for two risk factors: depression and traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness (TBI with LOC). Depression has been shown to be a LOAD risk factor in several studies, including in the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) and Religious Orders Study / Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) whose data are analyzed here.7,8 TBI with LOC’s status as a LOAD risk factor is not clear.9 In previous analyses in ACT and ROS/MAP, we did not find an association between TBI with LOC and LOAD risk.10 One possible explanation for our prior lack of finding between TBI with LOC and LOAD is there may be an association with some LOAD subgroups, but no association with others, leading to an overall null result when considering LOAD as a single group.

Our goals in this paper were to determine associations between cognitively-defined subgroups and depression and TBI with LOC. We harmonized cognitive and depression data from three large prospective cohort studies to meet these goals.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study population

ACT’s methods have been published4. The source population consists of communityliving members of Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPW; formerly Group Health), a health maintenance organization in western Washington State. A random sample of KPW members aged ≥65 years who did not have an established diagnosis of dementia or reside in a nursing home were invited to an enrollment visit in 1994–1996. The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) was administered.11 The CASI is a 100-point scale that assesses several cognitive domains. Individuals with scores &gt;85 were invited to enroll. Those with scores ≤85 were further evaluated with a neuropsychological battery and a clinical evaluation. The neuropsychological battery included clock drawing12, verbal fluency13, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale14, Boston naming13, verbal paired associations and recall, logical memory and recall15, Word List Memory13, Constructional Praxis and recall13, Trails A and B16, and Information and Comprehension subtest items15.

All results from the neuropsychological battery and clinical evaluation were reviewed in a multidisciplinary consensus conference to determine dementia status. Individuals free of dementia were invited to enroll in the longitudinal study. Essentially identical methods were used to enroll an expansion cohort in 2000–2003. In 2005, the study began a continuous enrollment phase in which essentially identical methods are used to enroll 10–15 new participants each month. Overall study size is based on the enrollment size of the first two waves of enrollment, and then by continuous enrollment to keep 2000 people alive and at risk of dementia outcomes; this report considers all enrollees through the June 2015 data freeze.

Once enrolled, participants are evaluated at study visits every two years with the CASI. The same threshold is used to identify people for further evaluation, and the same battery administered and clinical evaluation performed to identify incident dementia14 and probable and possible LOAD.13

Other than being a member of KPW, being free of dementia at enrollment, and being willing to volunteer for a longitudinal study, there are no additional inclusion or exclusion criteria for the ACT study. Importantly, ACT evaluates participants in their own homes or at a central research clinic for study visits.17

ROS and MAP’s methods have been published.18,19 ROS and MAP are longitudinal cohort studies run from Rush University. The study population for ROS consists of older Catholic nuns, priests, and brothers from about 40 groups across the US. Clinical evaluations started in 1994. MAP primarily recruits participants from continuous care communities throughout northeastern Illinois. Clinical evaluations started in 1997.

For both ROS and MAP, the only inclusion criteria was that persons understand the nature of the study and sign a consent for participation and an anatomical gift act for organ donation. In both studies, LOAD status is determined by a computer algorithm based on cognitive test performance with a series of discrete clinical judgments made by a neuropsychologist and a clinician. Diagnoses of dementia are consistent with NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.20 A battery of 21 cognitive performance tests is administered annually to assess cognitive abilities and determine diagnostic classifications.18,19

Institutional review boards from Group Health / Kaiser Permanente, the University of Washington, and Rush University approved all study procedures. Participants or their surrogates signed paperwork indicating their informed consent to participate.

For the present analyses, we focused on the group of individuals from each study who developed incident LOAD in the course of follow-up.

2.2. Ascertainment of subgroups

Methods for obtaining co-calibrated cognitive scores for all three studies have been published.4 Briefly, an expert panel (ET, AS, and JM) considered each item from the CASI and the neuropsychological battery and assigned each item to a specific cognitive domain – memory, executive functioning, language, visuospatial functioning, or other. We used modern psychometric methods to obtain scores for each domain. We used Mplus18 to fit confirmatory factor analysis single factor or bifactor models for each domain separately. All scores were scaled to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation (SD) of 1 in all those with incident LOAD who had all four scores from ACT (n = 825).

The same expert panel considered each of the tests administered in ROS and MAP and assigned each item to a specific domain. We co-calibrated ROS/MAP data together with data from ACT, the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. We used MPlus21 to fit confirmatory factor analysis models for each domain. We scaled scores to the standard of the ACT sample; the mean score for ROS and for MAP could be a value other than 0.

To determine subgroups, we initially determined overall average performance at the time of LOAD diagnosis for each participant as the simple numerical average across memory, executive functioning, language, and visuospatial ability. We then considered relative differences between each domain score and the individual overall average cognition score. We evaluated candidate thresholds to define substantial relative (“prominent”) impairments ranging from 0.40 points to 1.25 points at 0.05-point increments. For each candidate threshold, we classified people as having 0, 1 or ≥2 domains with prominent impairments; we further divided those with 1 domain according to which domain was relatively impaired. As outlined in our published report,5 we empirically selected a threshold of 0.80 points.

These methods produce 6 subgroups of people with LOAD (see Figure 1). There were very few people in the AD-Executive group in ROS or MAP so we omitted that group from analyses.

2.3. Depression measurements

In ACT, depression symptoms were measured using either an 11- or a 20-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D)22 at study enrollment. Each item assesses depressive symptoms in the past week and is rated on a scale of 0–3 based on frequency and severity (0 = rarely, or none of the time; 1 = some or a little of the time; 2 = occasionally or a moderate amount of the time; 3 = most of the time). A 20-item version of the CES-D was given at each follow-up visit.

In ROS/MAP, a 10-item version of the CES-D was administered at each annual visit. All ten items are also on the 20-item version administered by ACT at every follow-up visit; there is incomplete overlap with the ACT 10-item version administered at baseline for some participants. The ROS/MAP 10-item version has a yes/no response format. Responses were coded as a 1 if the patient’s answer is indicative of depression, and 0 if it is not.

To harmonize depression measures across the two studies, we considered only the ten CES-D items that were used in both ACT and ROS/MAP from the visit at the time of LOAD diagnosis. For each item, we made scores of 1–3 in ACT equivalent to a score of 1 in ROS/MAP. Given initial findings (see below) and recent interest in the field regarding relationships between sleep parameters, glymphatic flow, and risk of LOAD,23,24 we considered sleep separately from the other 9 items and determined a total depression score as the sum of the 9 non-sleep CES-D items. These models enabled us to address whether any associations with sleep are independent of their overall relationship with depression symptoms. 1,351 individuals were included in these analyses.

2.4. TBI with LOC assessment.

TBI with LOC ascertainment is detailed in a previous publication.10 ACT, ROS and MAP asked participants about history of head injuries. We re-coded responses to categories that were harmonized across all three studies: no TBI with a loss of consciousness, TBI with LOC&lt;1 hour, and TBI with LOC ≥1 hour.

2.5. Statistical Analyses

We used multinomial logistic regression with the AD-Memory group designated as the reference category. We determined relative risk ratios for depression and TBI for each of AD-No Domain, AD-Visuospatial, and AD-Language vs. AD-Memory, and tested overall heterogeneity with an omnibus chi-squared test. We controlled for age, sex, APOE genotype (coded as 0 vs. ≥1 ε4 allele), education (coded as ≥12 years vs. &lt;12 years) and study.

Primary analyses compared AD-No Domain, AD-Visuospatial, and AD-Language to AD-Memory, with the AD-Multiple Domains group omitted, and last observed values carried forward for any missing depression or TBI with LOC data. Sensitivity analyses included (1) adding the AD-Multiple Domains group to those in (1a) the AD-No Domain group, and (1b) to the group appropriate for the domain with the largest relative impairment, (2) only including observed data, and (3) varying the 0.80 threshold.

3. Results

3.1. Characteristics of individuals with incident AD

As of June 2015, ACT had enrolled 5,083 people, of whom 4,360 had at least one follow-up. Over 35,851 person-years of follow-up (mean 8.2) 1,076 people developed dementia,12 of whom 869 (81%) developed probable or possible LOAD;11 this number is consistent with typical percentages of dementia cases attributed to LOAD.25 We had sufficient data to compute all four cognitive domain scores for 825 (95%) of whom APOE genotype data were available for 736. This was our ACT analytic sample (Tables S1-S2).

MAP had enrolled 1,892 people by August 2016, ROS had enrolled 3,271. There were 99 people with prevalent LOAD in MAP, 89 in ROS. In MAP, 363 developed LOAD over 9,429 person-years of follow-up, bringing the total number of people with LOAD for these analyses to 462; for ROS there were 385 people with incident LOAD over 10,655 person-years. We had sufficient data to compute all four cognitive domain scores for 404 of these in MAP (of whom 386 had APOE genotype data) and 419 in ROS (of whom 393 had APOE genotype data). These were our analytic samples for ROS and MAP (Tables S1-S2).

The numbers of people identified in each cognitively-defined subgroup and their demographic characteristics and cognitive domain scores are shown in Table 1. Due to small numbers of people in ROS or MAP with AD-Executive, and with AD-Multiple Domains in both studies, we excluded those groups from primary analyses. In ACT and MAP, there were no important differences across cognitively-defined subgroups for demographic characteristics, including age at dementia onset. In ROS, there were no important differences except for male sex, which ranged from 17% of the AD-Visuospatial group to 34% in the AD-No Domain group (overall χ2 p-value = 0.03). In both studies, as we have previously reported, there were substantial differences in APOE ε4 genotype.5

3.2. Depression findings

Depression and TBI with LOC findings for ACT, ROS and MAP combined are summarized in Table 2. Of the 1,362 people with incident LOAD in the AD-No Domain, AD-Visuospatial, AD-Language, or AD-Memory groups, 1,351 had CES-D data (99%). There were significant differences across cognitively-defined subgroups in associations with depression symptoms at time of LOAD diagnosis as measured by the CES-D (overall χ2 p&lt;0.001). On average, compared to the reference group (AD-Memory), more CES-D items were endorsed by people with AD-No Domain (RRR = 1.15, p=0.001), people with AD-Visuospatial (RRR=1.21, p&lt;0.0001), and people with AD-Language (RRR = 1.18, p=0.001). These relative risk ratios can be interpreted as the adjusted ratio of CES-D scores between people in each group compared to those of the reference group, such that a person with the same demographic covariates in the AD-No Domain group on average had a 1.15 –fold higher total CES-D score than people with AD-Memory. We also analyzed CES-D data from each study separately to determine whether results were consistent across cohorts. Overall findings were driven by results from ROS and MAP, and were weaker or null in ACT (Table S3).

CES-D item level results are summarized in Table 3. Compared to the reference group, people in the other three groups in our primary analyses were about twice as likely to endorse item 1, “felt that everything I did was an effort” (AD-No Domain RRR=1.87, p=0.001; AD-Visuospatial RRR=2.08, p=0.001; AD-Language RRR=2.34, p&lt;0.001). People in those three groups were also roughly twice as likely to endorse item 2, “My sleep was restless” (AD-No Domain RRR=1.65, p=0.007; AD-Visuospatial RRR=2.29, p&lt;0.001; AD-Language RRR=1.98, p=0.002). Cohort specific findings for that item are shown in Table S3. People in two groups were more likely to endorse item 3, “felt depressed,” compared to the reference group (AD-No Domain RRR=1.72, p=0.008; AD-Visuospatial RRR=1.94, p=0.007) and people in these same groups were more likely to endorse item 8, “felt sad” (AD-No Domain RRR=1.51, p=0.035; AD-Visuospatial RRR=1.91, p=0.007). Compared to people in the reference group, people in the AD-Language group were more likely to endorse item 10, “could not get going” (RRR=1.55, p=0.039).

We modeled item 2 (“my sleep was restless”) together with a total score based on the remaining 9 CES-D items to see whether the signal for the sleep item was independent of the overall relationship with depression symptoms. We also adjusted for age at diagnosis, education, and APOE genotype. In these models, the AD-Visuospatial group was still more likely to endorse the sleep item compared to the reference group (RRR=1.89, (1.19,3.01), p = 0.007), as was the AD-Language group (RRR=1.63, (1.03, 2.57), p=0.04). The AD-No Domain group was also more likely to endorse the sleep item compared to the reference group, though the p-value was not significant (RRR=1.41, (0.96, 2.06), p=0.06).

ACT had additional depression data (Table 4). People in the AD-Language group had higher rates of new depression diagnosis in the 2 years prior to LOAD diagnosis compared to the reference group (RRR=2.78, p=0.03), which is consistent with the CES-D findings above. The omnibus statistic comparing recent new depression diagnosis rates of all five groups was not significant, however. Confusingly, almost all of the groups were less likely than the reference group to have received a new anti-depressant prescription in the 5 years prior to LOAD diagnosis. These differences were statistically significant for AD-No Domain (RRR = 0.54, p=0.02) and for AD-Visuospatial (RRR = 0.24, p=0.003). The omnibus statistic comparing all groups was significant (p=0.004, see Table 4).

Given the findings for the “restless sleep” item, we sought additional information on sleep from the studies. ACT had data on whether participants reported that healthcare providers had told them they had sleep apnea. Self-reported sleep apnea diagnoses were rarer than endorsement of the CES-D sleep item, so our power was lower. Point estimates for relationships between self-reported sleep apnea diagnoses were similar to those for the sleep item, but none of the RRRs were significantly different from the null, and the omnibus statistic was not significant (Table S4).

3.3 TBI with LOC findings

We did not find important or significant differences across cognitively-defined subgroups in either study or together in proportions with a history of TBI with LOC, whether considered as any duration LOC (Table 2) or as &lt;1 hour vs. ≥1 hour LOC (not shown).

3.4 Sensitivity analyses

Sensitivity analyses largely confirmed our findings. Assigning people in the AD-Multiple Domains group to either the AD-No Domain group or to the group defined by the domain with the largest relative impairment resulted in nearly identical findings. Using only observed data (not carrying forward missing values) resulted in similar results for TBI with LOC. The estimate for the difference between the AD-Memory and AD-Language groups in overall level of depression symptoms was somewhat smaller when we did not carry forward missing values, with a RRR of 1.06 (0.95, 1.18), but the omnibus p-value for comparisons of all of the groups was still 0.005. Depression symptom findings were robust to the choice of the 0.80 threshold (Table S5).

4. Discussion

We previously showed that cognitively-defined subgroups have different genetic architectures.5 The present findings indicate depression rates vary substantially across cognitively-defined subgroups, with an intriguing difference in rates of restless sleep that does not appear to be due to the relationship between sleep and overall depression. We did not find differences in TBI with LOC exposures across groups.

One explanation for these findings is there are differences in brain structure and function across subgroups. In data from VUMC in Amsterdam, gray matter density (GMD) attenuation is present only in hippocampus for the AD-Memory group compared to the other groups, while the other groups have GMD attenuation compared to the AD-Memory group in large areas of cerebral cortex.26 Studies of depression suggest no significant association with hippocampal GMD.27,28 Depressive symptoms are associated with GMD attenuation in anterior cingulate cortex.27,28 Differences in cortical GMD attenuation across subgroups appear to be concordant with the differences in depression symptoms across subgroups.

The AD-Memory group was less likely to endorse restless sleep compared with the other subgroups, and these differences persisted when controlling for overall depression. An intriguing possibility is that differences in restless sleep across subgroups reflect differential regional effects of restless sleep on glymphatic drainage. The importance of bulk astroglial-mediated interstitial fluid bulk flow (glymphatic clearance) in reducing toxic amyloid beta peptides has recently been reported.24 Emerging evidence suggests glymphatic clearance during sleep is important in LOAD pathogenesis.23 Whether sleep-related disruptions in glymphatic drainage differentially impact different brain regions is unknown. If so, cognitive functions corresponding to particular brain regions could be differentially impacted. If hippocampus was relatively unaffected by poor glymphatic drainage compared to other regions, this could explain lower associations between restless sleep and AD-Memory compared to other subgroups.

Cognitively defined subgroups may also differ in the proportion of people with common, age-related primary sleep disorders. We had limited data available to test this hypothesis.

A strength of these analyses is that they were performed in three different studies, and results were in the same direction across studies. A limitation is that the AD-Executive group was too small for analyses. These cohorts also have relatively limited racial and ethnic heterogeneity. Each study administered an extensive neuropsychological battery to each participant, either at every study visit (ROS and MAP) or at the time of dementia evaluation for participants with low CASI scores (ACT). Extensive efforts have been made to co-calibrate scores across these batteries.5 It is possible that different neuropsychological batteries would result in different subgroup assignments. Mis-classification in this way should bias towards the null, leading possibly to false-negative but not false-positive results. We harmonized the CES-D for these analyses, which led us to collapse response categories for ACT and ignore questions not asked in ROS and MAP. Beyond the CES-D we had limited information about sleep from either study, and we only had clinical information regarding depression from ACT. The CES-D is widely used in epidemiological research, including in studies of older adults, but is not used clinically to address depression among people with established AD. More extensive depression instruments or instruments that specifically target sleep difficulties may have elucidated additional findings.

Overall, this study has shown that in ACT, ROS, and MAP, depressive symptoms measured by the CES-D vary across AD subgroups. There appear to be differences in endorsement of restless sleep, with much lower rates of endorsement among those with AD-Memory compared to the other groups. These findings provide some support for the notion that these subgroups are biologically distinct, especially when considered together with our previous genetic findings.5 Further research into the implications of restless sleep on the clinical manifestations of LOAD are warranted.

Figure. Approach to cognitively defined subgroups.

These ovals depict scores ranging from low (bottom) to high (top) for memory (M), executive functioning (E), language (L) and visuospatial functioning (V) at the time of Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis. Person 1’s scores are clustered closely together. Person 2’s V score is much lower than their other scores. The average across domains is shown by the horizontal line. We consider differences from that average, shown by the brackets and asterisks, to place each person into a subgroup.
