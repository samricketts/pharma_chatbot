Interferons play a major role in microglial-mediated neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We investigated the interferon transcriptome (AD versus non-AD) using N9 and murine microglia. We identified 64 interferon-related differentially expressed genes (DEG) in LPS-stimulated N9 microglia versus control cells, 26 DEG in microglia from 5XFAD versus wild-type mice, with 13 DEG common to both datasets. Network analyses identified potential key mediators (Cxcl10, Ifit3) of the interferon response in AD. Gene-drug interaction analysis identified therapeutics targeting interferon-related genes. These data characterize the microglial interferon response in AD, providing new targets and therapeutics directed towards interferon-related neuroinflammation in AD.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder and the most common type of dementia. AD pathology is defined by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques followed by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, resulting in cognitive decline and brain atrophy (Gallardo and Holtzman, 2019). Currently, there are no effective treatments for AD with most of the research directed towards tau and Aβ reduction. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have advanced our understanding of pathological processes in AD development (Chen et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Shippy and Ulland, 2022; Shippy et al., 2022). As the size of GWAS increase, the number of associated risk loci in AD will also increase (Wightman et al., 2021) and integration of multi-omics data could provide drug targets of GWAS-identified variants (Fang et al., 2022). Therefore, identifying gene networks important in AD pathogenesis could result in new treatment options for AD.

Neuroinflammation is an inflammatory response mediated by the innate immune system within the central nervous system (CNS). Microglia, the primary immune cells of the CNS, are a major contributor to neuroinflammation in AD (Leng and Edison, 2021). Although AD appears to have a multifaceted etiology (Iqbal and Grundke-Iqbal, 2010), neuroinflammation is a major driver of AD pathogenesis by exacerbating tau and Aβ pathologies (Baik et al., 2016; Leyns and Holtzman, 2017). Furthermore, microglial activation by Aβ and tau also promotes neuroinflammation by the production of reactive oxygen species and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Wang et al., 2015a; Spangenberg and Green, 2017). Therefore, attenuation of the neuroinflammatory response could be a compelling therapeutic target for AD. Several studies have already evaluated the use of drugs (Etminan et al., 2003; Shadfar et al., 2015) and metabolites (Shippy et al., 2020) with anti-inflammatory properties as an AD treatment. Although several candidates have been identified, there is still an urgent need to further understand the role of neuroinflammation in AD pathology to identify additional targets and new therapeutics for AD.

In a previous report we examined the neuroinflammatory response in both a mouse model of AD and in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated N9 cells, a mouse microglial cell line (Shippy et al., 2022). In this study the interferon response, a classic immune response to viral infection, was shown to be changed in both sets of cells (Shippy et al., 2022; Isaacs and Lindenmann, 1957). Recent studies suggest that interferon production, particularly type 1 interferons, plays an important role in neuroinflammation-driven AD pathology (Hur et al., 2020; Moore et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2022). Furthermore, interferon-β1a, an anti-inflammatory cytokine used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) (Patti et al., 2013) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Cheng et al., 2015), is currently being investigated as a treatment for AD (Grimaldi et al., 2014; Mudo et al., 2019). Since the interferon response appears to be important in neuroinflammation-driven AD pathology, we chose to use microarray data from sorted microglia from wild type and 5XFAD mice and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from N9 cells and primary murine microglia stimulated with LPS to perform a targeted investigation of the changes in the interferon transcriptome. This targeted approach allowed us to examine the interferon response in detail, however this approach is more limited than a large-scale unbiased examination and as it constrains the number of genes in the in the downstream pathways analysis. We identified 64 interferon-related differentially expressed genes (DEG) in LPS-stimulated N9 microglia versus unstimulated control cells using RNA-seq, 26 interferon-related DEG in microglia from 5XFAD versus wild-type mice by microarray, with 13 DEG common to both datasets. Furthermore, enrichment, pathway, and network analyses identified several potential key mediators of the interferon response in AD, including Cxcl10 and Ifit3. Gene-drug interaction analysis was also performed to identify novel therapeutics targeting interferon-related genes. Finally, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed the induction of CXCL10 and IFN-β in LPS-stimulated N9 and primary microglia. Altogether, these data characterize the microglial interferon response in AD and provide new targets and therapeutics directed towards interferon-related neuroinflammation in AD.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Cell culture assays

Primary microglia were prepared from wild-type C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) as previously described using Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec) according to manufacturer’s instructions (Shippy et al., 2022). Briefly, mice were perfused with cold PBS containing 0.1% heparin. Brains were collected in C-tubes (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. No. 130–096-334) and dissociated using a Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (T) (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. No. 130–093-231). Microglia were labeled with anti-mouse CD45 magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. No. 130–052-301) and isolated on LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. No. 130–042-401). Approximately 50,000 microglia/well were seeded on poly-L-lysine coated 48-well plates in complete RPMI media supplemented with 20% L-cell conditioned media (LCCM) and human TGF-β (10 ng/ml) (PeproTech, Cat. No. 100–21). Media was changed three days after plating, and cells were used in the week following the media change. Microglia were stimulated with LPS (50 ng/ml) from Escherichia coli O111:B4 (InvivoGen) for 6 hours. Supernatants were flash frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until use.

Immortalized murine N9 microglia were cultured as previously described (Righi et al., 1989). N9 microglia were seeded at a cell density of 250,000 cells/well in a 24-well tissue culture plate. Cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) (Nikodemova and Watters, 2011) for 6 hours. Supernatants were flash frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until use.

2.2. ELISA

Primary microglia and N9 cell culture supernatants were assayed for CXCL10, IFN-α, and IFN-β by ELISA. The CXCL10 ELISA was performed using the Mouse CXCL10/IP-10/CRG-2 DuoSet ELISA (R&amp;D Systems, Cat. No. DY466) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The IFN-α ELISA was performed using the VeriKine™ Mouse Interferon Alpha ELISA (PBL Assay Science, Cat. No. 42120) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The IFN-β ELISA was performed using the VeriKine™ Mouse IFN Beta ELISA (PBL Assay Science, Cat. No. 42400) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

2.3. N9 microglia RNA-seq

The N9 microglial RNA-seq dataset was published previously by our group (GSE183038) (Shippy et al., 2022). Briefly, N9 microglia were stimulated with LPS as described above, and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat. No. 74134). Quality and quantity of RNA was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). All samples had an RNA integrity number (RIN) of 9.7 or higher. RNA library preparation and transcriptome sequencing were performed by Novogene using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System. Genes with FDR-adjusted P-values &lt; 0.5 and log2FC &gt; 0.5 were considered differentially expressed.

2.4. Mouse microglia microarray

The mouse microarray has been published in a previous study (Wang et al., 2015b) and the publicly available dataset (GSE65067) was used. Briefly, microglia from female 8 month old wild-type (n = 3) and 5XFAD (n = 5) mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were FACS-sorted directly into RTL-plus lysis buffer. RNA extraction from microglia was performed using an RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen, Cat. No. 74034). Microarray hybridization (Affymetrix MoGene 1.0 ST array) and data processing were performed at the Washington University Genome Center. Genes with P-values &lt; 0.05 and log2FC &gt; 0.5 were considered differentially expressed.

2.5. Gene analyses

In order to identify interferon genes, the datasets were searched for the term “interferon” and for genes from the RT2 Profiler™ PCR Array Mouse Type 1 Interferon Response (Qiagen, Cat. No. PAMM-016Z) gene list. Interferon genes found to be differentially expressed were selected for biological function analyses. The gene list was uploaded into the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, v. 2022q2) (Huang da et al., 2009b; Huang da et al., 2009a) for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. GO Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC), Molecular Function (MF) and KEGG pathways with gene counts ≥ 4 and FDR &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Scatterplots were created using Prism (GraphPad, v. 9.3.1). Venn diagrams demonstrating overlap in interferon DEG amongst the datasets were generated using InteractiVenn (Heberle et al., 2015). Gene constellations identifying genes in the Cxcl10 and Ifit3 regulatory network were created using the Immunology Genome Project (ImmGen) (Heng et al., 2008) using the “myeloid cells” reference populations option. Predicted regulators of Cxcl10 and Ifit3 were identified using ImmGens Predicted Interferons Network tool (Heng et al., 2008). Gene-drug interactions of the interferon DEG were identified using the drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb) (Cotto et al., 2018; Freshour et al., 2021) using the default settings.

2.6. Cxcl10-drug interaction validation assays

In order to validate our findings in the gene-drug interaction analysis, cell culture assays were performed with selected drugs found to target Cxcl10. N9 microglia were seeded at a cell density of 250,000 cells/well in a 24-well tissue culture plate and treated with DMSO (control), methylprednisolone (1 μM) (Cayman Chemical, Cat. No. 15013), and zidovudine (1 μM) (Cayman Chemical, Cat. No. 15492) for 15 minutes. Cells were then stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 6 hours and supernatants were assayed for CXCL10 by ELISA as described above.

To determine drug toxicity, N9 microglia were seeded at a cell density of 25,000 cells/well in a 96-well tissue culture plate. N9 cells were treated with methylprednisolone (1 μM), zidovudine (1 μM), and DMSO for 8 hours. Cytotoxicity was determined by the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in cell culture supernatants using the Cytotox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Cat. No. G1780) following manufacturer’s instructions.

2.7. Statistical analyses

Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (GraphPad, v. 9.3.1). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Comparison between two groups was performed using a Student’s t-test. Comparison between multiple groups was performed using one-way ANOVA with a Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test and one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. A P-value &lt; 0.05 (*P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001 and ****P &lt; 0.0001) was used as the significance cutoff.

3. Results

3.1. AD promotes differential expression of murine microglial interferon genes

In our previous analysis of RNA-seq data from LPS-stimulated N9 microglia versus non-stimulated control cells (Shippy et al., 2022) resulted in a total of 64 interferon DEG (log2FC &gt; 0.5, FDR-adjusted P-value &lt; 0.05) which constitutes 6.4% of all DEGs. For this reason, we chose to perform a focused but limited examination of these genes. Of the 64 DEG, 63 were up-regulated and one was down-regulated (Fig. 1A). Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3B (Ifit3b) was the most up-regulated interferon gene (log2FC = 8.08) and toll-like receptor 8 (Tlr8) was the only down-regulated interferon gene (log2FC = −2.65) (Supplementary Table S1).

Publicly available microarray data using sorted microglia from female 8-month-old 5XFAD mice versus wild-type mice (Wang et al., 2015b) revealed 26 interferon DEG (log2FC &gt; 0.5, P &lt; 0.05) which constitutes 1.5% of all DEGs. Of the 26 DEG, 21 were up-regulated and 5 were down-regulated (Fig. 1B). CD69 antigen (Cd69) was the most up-regulated gene (log2FC = 3.21) and interferon gamma receptor 1 (Ifngr1) was the most down-regulated gene (log2FC = −0.80) (Supplementary Table S2).

Altogether, 13 interferon DEG were common to both datasets (Fig. 1C). A comprehensive list of the 13 interferon DEG with the log2FC values for both datasets is shown in Table 1.

3.2. Enrichment and pathway analyses of altered interferon genes

GO and KEGG analyses were performed on the N9 and 5XFAD mouse microglial interferon DEG. For N9 microglia, BP GO indicated the interferon DEG participated in numerous neuroinflammatory processes (Fig. 2A). Several type 1 interferon pathways were identified including cellular response to interferon-beta, positive regulation of interferon-beta production, positive regulation of interferon-alpha production, type 1 interferon signaling, type 1 interferon production, positive regulation of type 1 interferon production, and response to interferon-alpha. CC GO indicated the N9 microglial interferon DEG were located in the cytosol, cytoplasm, nucleolus, and nucleus. Some of the top MF GO for the N9 microglial interferon DEG were identical protein binding, protein binding, RNA binding, and chemokine activity. A complete list of the GO, false discovery rates, and genes associated with each GO is shown in Supplementary Table S3.

For 5XFAD mouse microglial interferon DEG, BP GO indicated the genes participated in immune system process, innate immune system, cellular response to interferon-beta, type 1 interferon signaling, response to interferon-gamma, positive regulation of tumor necrosis factor production, cellular response to drug, immune response, defense response, and inflammatory response (Fig. 2B). For CC GO, DAVID was unable to determine the cellular location of the mouse interferon DEG under the defined parameters (gene count ≥ 4, FDR &lt; 0.05). For MF GO, identical protein binding was the only function identified for the 5XFAD mouse microglial interferon DEG. A complete list of the GO, false discovery rates, and genes associated with each GO is shown in Supplementary Table S4.

KEGG analysis was performed on the N9 and 5XFAD mouse microglial lipid interferon DEG. For N9 microglia, KEGG identified NOD-like receptor signaling, toll-like receptor signaling, cytosolic DNA-sensing, necroptosis, lipid and atherosclerosis, antigen processing and presentation, JAK-STAT signaling, C-type lectin receptor signaling, TNF signaling, chemokine signaling, type 1 diabetes mellitus, RIG-I-like receptor signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and NF-kappa signaling pathways. For the 5XFAD mouse microglial interferon DEG, KEGG identified toll-like receptor signaling, chemokine signaling, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways. A selected list of the KEGG pathways, false discovery rates, and genes associated with each pathway is shown in Table 2. A complete list of KEGG pathways is shown in Supplemental Table S5 and S6 for N9 and 5XFAD mouse microglia respectively. Together, these data suggest the interferon response is potentially associated with microglial-mediated neuroinflammation in AD.

3.3. Network analyses of interferon genes

Since Ifit3 was altered in both datasets, and highly up-regulated in N9 microglia, we performed network analysis to provide insight into the role of Ifit3 in the interferon signaling pathway. Several key genes involved in neuroinflammation and interferon signaling were found to be positively correlated with Ifit3 including Ifi208 (0.996), Tnfaip8l3 (0.995), Cd69 (0.995), Tnfsf10 (0.997), Mx1 (0.995), Mx2 (0.993), Igtp (0.994), Ifit1bl1 (0.999), Cxcl10 (0.999), Ifit2 (0.999), Ifit3b (1.000), Ifit1 (1.000), and Isg15 (1.000) (Fig. 3A). Additional analysis using ImmGens Predicted Interferons Network tool identified several predicted regulators for Ifit3 including Irf7, Stat1, Stat2, Irf9, Aim2, Jak2, Irf2, Irf1, Stat3, and Nfkbie (Fig. 3B).

As Cxcl10 was also altered in both datasets, and the target of several therapeutic drugs, expression network analysis was performed to identify genes positively correlated with Cxcl10. Numerous genes involved in neuroinflammation and interferon signaling were identified as being positively correlated with Cxcl10 including Ifi208 (0.993), Mx2 (0.990), Mx1 (0.994), Igtp (0.991), Tnfsf10 (0.996), Isg15 (0.999), Ifit3 (0.999), Ifit3b (0.999), Ifit2 (0.998), Cd69 (0.996), and Tnfaip8l3 (0.997) (Fig. 4A). Further analysis using ImmGens’s Predicted Interferons Network tool identified several important interferon-related predicted regulators of Cxcl10 including Irf7, Stat2, Stat1, Aim2, Irf9, Jak2, Nfkbie, Irf1, Irf8, and Irf2 (Fig. 4B). Together, these results identify potential key mediators in the interferon-related neuroinflammatory response in AD and could be promising targets for AD intervention regimens.

3.4. Interferon genes as targets for therapeutic drugs

In an effort to identify targets for therapeutic treatments of AD, we performed gene-drug interaction analysis in DGIdb on the interferon DEG in N9 and 5XFAD mouse microglia. For N9 microglia, a total of 18 interferon-related DEG had interactions with therapeutic drugs (Fig. 5A). For 5XFAD mouse microglia, a total of seven interferon-related DEG had interactions with therapeutic drugs (Fig. 5B). Cxcl10 was common to both datasets and DGIdb identified 12 therapeutic drug interactions with this gene. Some of the therapeutic agents identified included drugs to treat inflammation (methylprednisolone, eldelumab), cholesterol (atorvastatin), cancer (oxaliplatin), and HIV (zidovudine, stavudine, ritonavir). Experimental validation showed pre-treatment of LPS-stimulated N9 cells with methylprednisolone and zidovudine significantly reduced CXCL10 secretion when compared to the DMSO control (Fig. 5C) and these drugs were not toxic to N9 microglia (Fig. 5D). Risperidone was found to target Ccl2, common to both datasets, which is an antipsychotic used to treat mental disorders such as bipolar depression and schizophrenia. A complete list of the interferon DEG and their associated drugs for N9 and 5XFAD mouse microglia is shown in Supplementary Tables S7 and S8, respectively.

3.5. Secretion of interferon-related cytokines and chemokines by microglia

Since many of the interferon DEG were type 1 interferons, we performed ELISAs on supernatants from LPS-stimulated N9 and primary microglia for CXCL10, IFN-α, and IFN-β. We have previously shown significant induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, TNF-α, MIP-1α, RANTES, MCP-1) in LPS-stimulated N9 and primary microglia (Shippy et al., 2022). Furthermore, we showed no significant induction in IFN-γ, a type 2 interferon, in both cell types (Shippy et al., 2022). In this study, CXCL10 production was markedly increased in both primary (Fig. 6A) and N9 (Fig. 6B) LPS-stimulated microglia. Additionally, IFN-β production was significantly increased in both primary (Fig. 6C) and N9 (Fig. 6D) LPS-stimulated microglia. IFN-α levels were also evaluated, but were below the detection limit of the assay for both cell types.

4. Discussion

In our previous work we identified interferon pathways as a major shared neuroinflammatory pathway between microglia from a mouse with AD-like pathology and N9 cells stimulated with LPS (Shippy et al., 2022). Because of these results in this study, we examined sequencing and microarray data from N9 cells and mouse microglia to identify interferon-related genes important in microglial-mediated neuroinflammation in AD. Although we feel that these studies are important as they allow for a focused examination of the interferon pathway we acknowledge the important caveat that these studies are inherently biased by the small number of genes examined and the enrichment of interferon genes in the analysis. Further studies suggest neuroinflammation specifically enhances tau and amyloid pathologies (Baik et al., 2016; Leyns and Holtzman, 2017). As a result, therapeutics that target biomarkers of neuroinflammation are a promising strategy for AD. Several clinical trials have been conducted using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with mixed results (McGeer and McGeer, 2007). Although preliminary studies suggest NSAIDs are correlated with a decreased risk of AD (Zhang et al., 2018), placebo controlled clinical trials have resulted in neutral or negative results (Hampel et al., 2020) indicating a need for new therapeutics and targets. In our study, CXCL10 was highly up-regulated, and our analysis indicated that atorvastatin, a drug to treat high cholesterol and triglycerides, may target CXCL10. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia have been identified as major risk factors for developing AD (Zhang et al., 2022), so drugs used to treat other diseases that are risk factors for AD, and also target biomarkers of neuroinflammation, could result in an effective AD treatment strategy.

The type 1 interferon response is implicated in AD pathogenesis by promoting neuroinflammation, synapse loss, and cognitive impairment (Moore et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2022). Studies show brains of AD patients have higher expression levels of type 1 interferons (IFN-α, IFN-β) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) when compared to healthy controls (Taylor et al., 2014; Roy et al., 2020). These studies also identified increased protein expression of IRF7, a type 1 interferon regulator, in the prefrontal cortex of brains of AD patients (Taylor et al., 2014; Roy et al., 2020). In our study, transcripts of IRF7 were increased in both datasets. We also observed increased IFN-β in the supernatants of LPS-stimulated primary and N9 microglial, but did not detect IFN-α in the supernatants of either cell type. In viral infections, IFN-β is produced first, and activates IRF7, which in turn induces multiple subtypes of IFN-α (Marie et al., 1998). Whether or not a similar mechanism is used by microglia in AD remains unclear.

A marked increase in CXCL10 was detected in the supernatants of LPS-stimulated N9 and primary microglia compared to unstimulated control cells. Transcripts of Cxcl10 were also increased in both datasets, and network analysis showed a positive correlation of Cxcl10 with many interferon genes. In macrophages, type 1 interferons were reported to act downstream of toll-like receptor signaling, and activate a unique gene signature, including chemokines like Cxcl10 (Toshchakov et al., 2002). In the context of AD, CXCL10 levels were reported to be higher in the prefrontal cortex of AD (Bradburn et al., 2018) yet the role of CXCL10 in AD is not clearly understood. For example, Correa et al. reported a positive correlation between CXCL10 and Aβ levels, but found no difference in CXCL10 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients versus healthy controls (Correa et al., 2011). Other studies by Galimberti et al. showed CSF CXCL10 levels were higher in AD patients when compared to healthy control (Galimberti et al., 2003), but a follow up study did not validate these findings (Galimberti et al., 2006). Although CXCL10 may not be a viable biomarker for AD, these data indicate CXCL10 could be a key mediator in microglial-mediated neuroinflammation in AD, and could be a promising target for therapeutic intervention.

Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (Ifit3) has been implicated with protective activity to viral infections, such as dengue fever (Hsu et al., 2013), as well as viruses that affect the CNS (Wacher et al., 2007). IFIT3 has also been shown to be a key part of the immune defense response pathway during schizophrenia development (Guo et al., 2022). IFIT3 is reported to modulate the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) (Naranjo et al., 2021), and the Janus kinase (JAK) (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway is a major source of neuroinflammation in AD (Jain et al., 2021). Although IFIT3 and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway have been shown to be important in several diseases, the role of IFIT3 in AD has not been characterized. In our study, Ifit3 was highly up-regulated in LPS-stimulated N9 microglia (log2FC = 7.21) and modestly up-regulated in 5XFAD mouse microglia (log2FC = 1.14). Furthermore, Ifit3 was positively correlated with several other interferon genes, suggesting IFIT3 is a key member of the interferon-related response in AD. Together, these data suggest a pivotal role for Ifit3 in microglial-mediated neuroinflammation, and may be a potential candidate for use as a novel biomarker of AD.

IFN-γ is the only member of the type 2 interferon family. Previous studies have implicated IFN-γ in neuroinflammation and AD pathogenesis (Bate et al., 2006; Belkhelfa et al., 2014) while others suggest IFN-γ attenuates AD pathology (Chakrabarty et al., 2010; He et al., 2020) with a general consensus of a delicate balance between the type 1 and 2 interferon responses (Deczkowska et al., 2016). In our study, IFN-γ was not altered in either dataset, and we have previously shown no significant difference in IFN-γ secretion from LPS-stimulated primary and N9 microglial cells when compared to unstimulated control cells (Shippy et al., 2022). In contrast, our GO BP analysis in N9 microglia found interferon-related DEG responsible for the cellular response to IFN-γ (Casp1, Ccl2, Ccl4, Ccl5, Nos2, Stat1, Tlr3) and positive regulation of IFN-γ production (Tlr3, Tlr8, Tlr9, Tyk2). Furthermore, GO BP analysis of 5XFAD mouse microglia found interferon-related DEG in the response to IFN-γ (Bst2, Irgm2, Ifitm2, Ifitm3). Additional investigation is needed to determine if an antagonistic relationship exists between the type1 and 2 interferon responses in neuroinflammation and AD.

One limitation of our study is that only microglia were used. Several types of cells in the brain perform immune functions (microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes), including responding to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (De Strooper and Karran, 2016; Chen et al., 2020). Although initially underappreciated, several studies indicate reactive astrocytes play an important role in neuroinflammation-driven AD pathology (Gitter et al., 1995; Garwood et al., 2011). Furthermore, cross-talk between microglia and astrocytes may be an important neuroinflammatory mechanism in AD, as reactive astrocytes are induced by activated microglia (Liddelow et al., 2017). The study by Roy et al. describes type 1 interferon reactive astrocytes that expanded in an Aβ pathology-dependent manner after the initial type 1 interferon microglial response (Roy et al., 2022). Also, the study by Hasel et al. described specialized astrocytes expressing ISGs in the meningeal layers, blood vessels, and ventricles of 5XFAD mice (Hasel et al., 2021). A second limitation of our study is that only mouse microglia were used. We examined several human AD transcriptome datasets, but human microglial gene signatures are much more heterogeneous than in mice (Chen and Colonna, 2021). The validity of comparing the human and mouse microglial transcriptome in AD remains controversial as some studies suggest they are distinct (Olah et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) while others suggest they are analogous (Ulland et al., 2017; Sobue et al., 2021).

Overall, our interferon transcriptomic data provides a useful resource for further investigation of microglial-mediated neuroinflammation in AD. Furthermore, our data identified several drugs that may inhibit interferon-related microglial molecular targets to reduce neuroinflammation to attenuate AD pathology.

Figure 1. Differentially expressed murine microglial interferon genes in AD.

(A) Scatter plot of interferon DEG (log2FC &gt; 0.5, FDR-adjusted P-value &lt; 0.05) by RNA-seq in N9 microglia stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 6 hours versus unstimulated control cells. (B) Scatter plot of interferon DEG (log2FC &gt; 0.5, P &lt; 0.05) by microarray in microglia isolated from the brains of 5XFAD mice versus wild-type mice (8 months old). For both scatter plots, up-regulated genes are shown in red and down-regulated genes are shown in green. (C) Venn diagram displaying overlap in interferon DEG between the datasets.

Figure 2. Gene Ontology Biological Process enrichment analysis.

Biological process (BP) analysis of the N9 (A) and mouse (B) microglial interferon DEG was performed using DAVID. Gene Ontology (GO) BP terms with a gene count ≥ 4 and FDR &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Selected GO BP terms are shown with a complete list available in supplementary tables S3 and S4.

Figure 3. Ifit3 expression network analyses.

Analyses for Ifit3 positively correlated genes (A) and predicted regulators (B). The gene constellations shown were generated in ImmGen using the “myeloid cells” reference populations option. The predicted regulators were identified using ImmGens Predicted Interferons Network tool. The vertical green line indicates the confidence threshold at 1% FDR.

Figure 4. Cxcl10 expression network analyses.

Analyses for Cxcl10 positively correlated genes (A) and predicted regulators (B). Genes constellations and predicted regulators were generated using the same tools as used for Ifit3 (Figure 3).

Figure 5. Gene-drug interactions.

Interactions between therapeutic drugs and the N9 (A) and mouse (B) microglial interferon DEG. Genes identified with drug interactions are shown and the number of drugs associated with each gene is shown above each bar. (C) Experimental validation of selected drugs targeting Cxcl10. N9 microglia were treated with methylprednisolone, zidovudine, and DMSO (control) and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 6 hours. Supernatants were collected and assayed for CXCL10 by ELISA. (D) Drug toxicity in N9 microglia treated with methylprednisolone, zidovudine, and DMSO (control) for 8 hours. Cytotoxicity was determined by LDH release in the cell culture supernatants. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. ***P &lt; 0.001, **P &lt; 0.01. ns = not significant.

Figure 6. Interferon-related cytokines and chemokines induced by LPS in microglia.

Primary microglia were stimulated with LPS (50 ng/ml) for 6 hours. N9 microglia were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 6 hours. Supernatants were collected and assayed for CXCL10 secreted by primary (A) and N9 (B) microglia. Supernatants were also assay for IFN-β secreted by primary (C) and N9 (D) microglia. Experiments were performed in duplicate. Results are from three independent experiments. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. ****P ≤ 0.0001. IFN-α was also evaluated, but was below the detection limit of the assay.
