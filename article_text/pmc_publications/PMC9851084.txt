The brain relies on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for the selective absorption of nutrients and the exclusion of other big molecules from the circulating blood. Therefore, the integrity of BBB is critical to brain health, and assessing BBB condition is of great clinical importance. BBB is often examined using exogenous tracers that can travel across the BBB, but the tracers might cause severe side effects. To avoid the use of external tracers, researchers have used magnetically labeled arterial blood as the endogenous tracer to assess the water permeability of BBB as a surrogate index of BBB. This paper reviews the three major types of Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL) based BBB water permeability assessment techniques and their applications in brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease.

pmc1. Introduction

The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) is an important component of the neurovascular unit and is formed by endothelial cells, pericyte cells, basement membrane, and the endfeet of astrocyte cells (Fig. 1). The endothelial cells form a wall for the capillaries and directly separate the blood from brain tissue. Endothelial cells are connected through tight junctions formed by highly selective proteins and only a small number of substances can pass through the junction. Water present in the blood can enter the brain through several different approaches, including diffusion, tight junction, ion channels, or co-transportation with other molecules through their corresponding carriers and receptor-mediated transportation across the membrane [1]. The functions of BBB are regulated by both astrocytes and pericytes. BBB is also responsible for clearing up neurotoxins generated by neurons during metabolic activities. Damage to BBB can subsequently limit the amount of oxygen and nutrients entering the tissues and causing energy deficits and may eventually lead to neuron dysfunction or death. Damaged BBB may lose its potential to restrict the entry of blood-borne neurotoxic substances into the brain. Meanwhile, they may lose normal functions for clearing up neurotoxins such as the beta-amyloid proteins generated inside the brain tissue [2]. A combination of these consequences may lead to neuroinflammation thereby degrading the function of neurons along with the eventual death of neurons like in aging and neurodegenerative processes [3, 4]. These chain reactions lead to the current hypothesis that aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) may initiate from the loss of BBB integrity [5–8]. In addition to aging and AD, many other neurological diseases are related to the impaired functioning of BBB [9].

The functioning of BBB can be measured with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET). Two widely used MRI approaches are dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI (DSC-MRI), both based on gadolinium-induced signal change when it crosses the BBB and enters the brain tissue [10]. One of the disadvantages of the existing techniques is that gadolinium may still be completely or partially restricted by BBB if the damages are at a very early stage or in limited places. Therefore, both DCE and DSC MRI may be insensitive to the early minor changes and subsequently insensitive to early disease detection [11]. The safety aspect of gadolinium has been a matter of concern as it may cause severe side effects such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, nausea, headache, renal dysfunction, neurotoxicity, etc [12–15]. A non-invasive alternative MRI approach is more appealing for assessing BBB in both healthy people and patients. To date, two types of non-invasive MRI-based BBB-related property assessment methods have been proposed in the literature, and both are based on arterial spin labelling (ASL).

ASL was originally designed to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the ASL perfusion MRI [16]. In ASL MRI, arterial blood water is magnetically labeled and subsequently reduces the MR signal of the tissue when it arrives at the capillary bed and gets exchanged with tissue water. For simplicity, ASL CBF quantification is often based on the Kety-Schmidt model [17], which assumes instant arterial blood water and tissue water exchange in the capillary bed. However, this assumption has been proven incorrect by various PET studies [18–20] and extra limitations induced by BBB deficits or dysfunction [21]. By separating the arterial water signal into the blood and a tissue compartment, ASL MRI can be used to estimate the MR parameters of the two compartments and the rate of water exchange between them. While the ASL MRI-based BBB assessment approach has lower SNR than the exogenous contrast agent-based techniques, it has a major advantage of being completely non-invasive and exogenous contrast free.

This review provides a summary of the three major ASL-based BBB water exchange rate assessment techniques and their applications in clinical research. In the following sections, we first introduced the theory of ASL MRI, then described the blood versus tissue T1 and or T2 decay difference-based BBB water permeability assessment method [22–24]. We then summarized the diffusion-weighted ASL MRI-based BBB water permeability mapping technique [25]. We then introduced the ASL-based global BBB water permeability measurement technique [26]. Validations and applications of these techniques are summarized in the last section.

2. ASL Perfusion MRI

ASL perfusion MRI uses radio-frequency pulses to invert the water signal of the arterial blood in a proximal place where the big arteries enter the brain. After a transit time, the electric-magnetically labeled water then flows into the capillaries and gets exchanged with the brain tissues. A regular MRI sequence is then applied to acquire an image of the brain. The Signal captured by this image is a sum of the background and the exchanged water. To remove the background signal, background suppression pulses can be applied. Since it is often difficult to completely suppress the background signal to 0, a separate image acquisition is performed using the same sequence after changing the water spin labeling positions or the phase of the labeling pulses to remove the water labeling function. The acquired corresponding image only contains the background signal because the exchanged water now has the same signal as the tissue water. By subtracting these two images, the perfusion-weighted signal which is proportional to the volume of exchanged blood (perfusion) is obtained and can finally be converted into quantitative CBF. More background information about ASL MRI can be found in another review paper in this special issue [27]

The standard CBF quantification process assumes an instant and full exchange of labeled spins into the brain tissue and leads to an improved water exchange model and the possibility of measuring water permeability across the BBB, which is inappropriate. Over the past decade, several ASL MRI-based approaches have been proposed to estimate BBB water permeability. Nearly all these methods are based on the two-compartment model which is composed of the inflowing artery, the drain vein, and the intravascular space and the extravascular space (tissue) on the two sides of the BBB. Most methods are based on signals measured at the capillary and tissue [23–25, 28–30] and can be roughly divided into two classes: the first one is based on standard ASL MRI with multiple PLDs or multiple-echoes and fits the acquired data into a two-compartment model containing the permeability parameter and the different intra and extra-vascular T1 or T2 decaying; the second one is based on diffusion gradient-based intravascular signal suppression. In the following section, an introduction has been provided about the two methods. Next, we have summarized the vein signal-based global BBB water extraction rate estimation method [26, 31].

3. Blood-tissue water T1/T2 difference-based BBB water permeability assessment using ASL MRI

Fig 2 shows the two-compartment cross-BBB water exchange model. This model was initially validated using ASL MRI by Silva et al. [32] and St. Lawrence et al, where the signal of the spins exchanging back to the capillary was ignored [33]. Zhou et al.[34] extended the Bloch equation to model the two-compartment model and used it to correct CBF measured by ASL. These studies are based on data acquired in rats or simulation data. Parkes and Tofts presented the first two-compartment model-based ASL MRI study in the human brain [29] and directly estimated PS by fitting the data acquired at multiple PLDs into the modified Bloch equations. One issue of these methods is that they rely on the blood and tissue T1 difference induced signal difference, which is often very small, thereby making it difficult to have a stable and accurate separation of the two compartments and subsequently the BBB water permeability.

Rather than directly measuring the water exchange rate of the BBB, the restricted water permeability of BBB can be alternately characterized through the T2 relaxation difference between the tissue water and blood water (T2 is higher in tissue than in blood) [23, 24, 30, 35]. The rationale is that arterial blood water will have increased T2 after it enters the extravascular space (tissue). Wells et al. first observed this phenomenon using ASL MRI [22]. They found that the apparent T2 of labeled arterial blood water increased with PLD, thereby indicating that the labeled water enters the extravascular space. The study by Wells et al 2009 reported the use of multi-TE ASL MRI for estimating the blood-tissue exchange time by fitting the multi-echo data to the bi-exponential curves [23, 35] or a model considering both T1 and T2 [30]. The multi-TE approach relies on two sequential data fitting processes: the first is to fit the mean T2 or the extravascular compartment, the intravascular and extravascular component of the perfusion-weighted signal and the second is to get the arterial transit time and the tissue transit time. The various data fitting processes can make the entire water exchange time estimation vulnerable to noise. Errors present during the first fitting step will be inevitably propagated into the second step.

4. The diffusion-weighted ASL MRI (DW-ASL)

DW-ASL is based on the two-compartment capillary/tissue water exchange model as depicted in Fig 2 [25, 28]. By separating the capillary component (the intravascular component) and the tissue component of the labeled blood water signal in the voxel, the rate of water exchange between the capillary bed and tissue can be subsequently estimated. As the water in the capillary has fast diffusion rate than that in the tissue, applying a diffusion gradient before image acquisition will change the ratio between these two components. By applying different diffusion weighting to generate different ratios between the two components, the underlying water exchange rate can be estimated by fitting the signal to an ideal equation. This technique is motivated by the Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) based perfusion estimation method [32, 36–38]. IVIM can be combined with DW-ASL to delineate the pseudo water permeability coefficient from the fraction of blood water [39].

The main problem of DW-ASL is the long scan time and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The long scan time makes it sensitive to motions and prohibitive for clinical use. Low SNR makes the fitting process and subsequently the kw estimation nonstable. The problem of long scan time was later solved using a two-stage method [28], which reduces the number of perfusion weighting to 2. Arterial transit time (ATT), the time for the labeled spins to reach the imaging place in ASL MRI is often unknown. If the post-labeling delay (PLD) time is shorter than ATT, bias will be introduced to CBF quantification and in kw estimation. To estimate ATT, a multiple PLD protocol can be used but at the cost of prolonged scan time [40–43].

Another challenge is the fitting accuracy due to the low SNR. This has been improved by using the pseudo-continuous ASL technique, background suppression, and 3D readout [44, 45]. Nevertheless, the reliability and fidelity of the voxelwise kw fitting are still a matter of concern.

5. Water Extraction with Phase-Contrast Arterial Spin Tagging (WEPCAST)

WEPCAST [26, 31] is an ASL-based method for measuring the average BBB water permeability surface product PSw. By using a long PLD and background suppression, WEPCAST detects the labeled arterial spin-caused signal change in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). Fig. 3 shows a basic model for the four components of the labeled arterial blood water involved in WEPCAST: the extracted arterial blood staying in brain tissue, the unextracted arterial blood flowing into the vein, the arterial spins re-exchanged into the bloodstream in the vein, and the tissue spins exchanged into the vein. If the last component stays the same during the control and label imaging acquisition procedures, it will be zeroed out after subtracting the label image from the control image. Therefore, the control-label signal difference in the vein will be contributed by the unextracted arterial blood water and the re-extracted arterial blood water only. Both components depend on the water extraction rate, arterial blood arrival time in the vein, M0, T1 of blood, and arterial spin labeling efficiency. The re-extracted component also depends on the blood-water partition coefficient and CBF. Assuming that T1 of blood, ASL efficiency, and the blood-water partition coefficient can be all measured separately, the water extraction rate and arterial blood arrival time can be estimated by fitting the SSS C-L signal acquired at a series of long PLDs to the theoretically described SSS ASL signal contributed by the two components. Based on the observation of the spatial distribution of the SSS C-L signal along the SSS, the multiple-PLD scan scheme can be approximately replaced by a single-PLD scan. A series of regions-of-interest (ROIs) are then drawn along the SSS, and the temporal information is recovered through the spatial locations [31]. Through measuring the water extraction rate E with WEPCAST and CBF with ASL MRI or the phase-contrast MRI-based global CBF measurement sequence [46], the permeability surface product (PS) can be obtained through PS=−ln(1−E)f. Validations of WEPCAST were conducted using different sequences, with and without hypercapnia, test-retest, and different vendor MR machine. The results showed that WEPCAST can detect the changes induced by hypercapnia. The water extraction rate detected by WEPCAST showed good test-retest stability (the intra-class correlation coefficient=0.53) and reliability across the two MR vendor machines.

DW-ASL and WEPCAST share the similarity of using arterial spin labeling to separate the vascular component and the tissue component of water but they differ dramatically in several aspects: 1) DW-ASL uses a diffusion-weighted gradient to reduce the signal contributed by the vascular component and measure their combined signal in-situ. On the contrary, WEPCAST does not saturate the vascular signal but measures the gloss signal off-site of the capillary bed and brain tissue (in the vein); 2) DW-ASL provides a voxelwise estimation of the water exchange rate but WEPCAST only provides a global estimation; 3) Due to signal saturation payable to the application of the diffusion weighting gradients and the nature of voxelwise water exchange rate estimation, DW-ASL has low SNR. On the contrary, WEPCAST does not saturate the signal. Measuring the global water extraction-induced SSS signal changes is equal to signal to average, with resultant improvement in SNR. However, relatively longer PLD used in WEPCAST may partially counteract the SNR gain; 4) Data processing in DW-ASL is relatively straightforward while WEPCAST requires manual or semi-automatic region-of-interest identification, which may introduce errors or inter-rater inconsistency. Nevertheless, both techniques share the data processing challenge caused by the low SNR. WEPCAST needs drawing ROIs and has more assumptions about several other parameters (which can be measured in principle), which may introduce errors and variability into the subsequent data fitting process.

6 Validations

Like many other imaging methods, the three major types of ASL-based BBB water permeability estimation methods lack a gold standard to validate their results. DW-ASL has been majorly compared to other BBB assessment methods or other neuroimaging modalities. Kw measured by DW-ASL has shown good test-retest stability but is correlated to ktrans measured by DCE MRI only in white matter, middle cerebral artery, and perforator territory [47]. Most validations of DW-ASL were made indirectly using data from patients with diseases such as tumors and AD. Multi-TE ASL was first validated using an animal model that has known deficits of BBB water exchange [23] and has successfully revealed the group-level BBB water exchange difference. In humans, multi-TE ASL has shown good test-retest reproducibility [24]. WEPCAST was validated using hypercapnia which is known to increase CBF but reduce water extraction rate [26]. Compared to the normocapnia condition (breathing in environmental air), hypercapnia reduced the water extraction rate measured by WEPCAST.

7 Applications of the ASL-based BBB water exchange assessment methods in Alzheimer’s Disease and Other Neurological Diseases

Quantifying BBB integrity or condition is critical to clinical evaluations of many brain diseases. Over the years, the three methods have been gradually applied to several disease populations with or without reference obtained from other neuroimaging modalities. In the initial paper on DW-ASL, Wang et al. showed that the DW-ASL measured Kw can differentiate tumors from normal tissues [25]. Fujima et al. [48] found that DW-ASL Kw was significantly higher in the progressive white matter lesions than in the non-progressive white matter lesions. Using an animal stroke model, Tiwari et al. [49] identified changes in DW-ASL Kw caused by alterations in BBB permeability in conditions of stroke. This result was confirmed by DCE-MRI and Evans blue extravasation. In [50], Gold et al. demonstrated that Kw in several brain regions is positively correlated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Amyloid-β 42 in healthy old adults. Because CSF Amyloid β 42 level is inversely related to brain Amyloid-β 42 concentration [51–53], these results can be interpreted as Kw in a few brain regions is negatively correlated with brain Amyloid depositions, thereby signifying that lower Kw is correlated with higher brain Amyloid deposition and higher risk of AD. The authors suggested that the correlation between Kw and AD pathology indicates that lower Kw in the brain is associated with worse Amyloid-β 42 clearance in the brain. This postulation should be confirmed in experiments because Kw is related to permeability of water rather than Amyloid-β 42 which is much bigger than water molecule. It is unclear for how the water exchange is related to Amyloid-β 42 clearance. Also, Kw is related to water diffusivity from blood to tissue while Amyloid-β 42 clearance is from tissue to blood, which are two opposite directions.

Using WEPCAST, Lin et al. [54] performed a comparative study by including 33 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 22 controls. There was no significant difference in global CBF between MCI and controls. Because PS=−ln(1−E)f, the PS results reported in this paper can be directly translated into the water extraction rate results by ignoring the surface area (often difficult to measure). In other words, a higher PS means a higher water extraction rate. The authors showed that MCI patients had increased permeability (increased PS or water extraction rate) to small molecules such as water but demonstrated no permeability to large molecules such as albumin. They also found that BBB permeability (water extraction rate) to water was negatively related to CSF Amyloid-β concentration, thereby signifying that higher BBB permeability measured by WEPCAST is correlated with higher brain Amyloid-β deposition. This result suggests a negative effect of high BBB permeability. On the contrary, BBB permeability to albumin was found to be related to vascular risk factors, especially hypercholesterolemia, but no relation with AD pathology was reported. They further reported that BBB permeability to small molecules (not to large molecules) was negatively related to cognitive function, which is consistent with the negative effect of high BBB permeability suggested by the pathological associations. However, these results are in direct conflict with those reported in [50] though in the latter study, normal old subjects were investigated and the two studies are based on two different techniques.

8 Conclusion

ASL has shown reported to be efficient in assessing the water extraction rate or water extraction time in BBB using different MRI techniques which are all based on the two-compartment model or its extension. The biggest challenge of this new and promising research direction is the lack of a gold standard which is critical to completely validate and compare several different methods. All based on data fitting and a few assumptions, these methods are subject to variability caused by fitting errors, data SNR (especially for those using long PLDs), and violations of the assumptions. Direct comparison of the methods is currently difficult and has not been studied in the literature. Theoretical or experimental support for establishing the link between water exchange rate or time to BBB integrity should be strengthened if the results would be claimed to be related to BBB integrity. The current ASL-based BBB assessment methods should be further improved to achieve higher SNR and reliability of the BBB-related measures.
