Internet-connected devices, including personal computers, smartphones, smartwatches, and voice assistants, have evolved into powerful multi-sensor technologies that billions of people interact with daily to connect with friends and colleagues, access and share information, purchase goods, play games, and navigate their environment. Digital phenotyping taps into the data streams captured by these devices to characterize and understand health and disease. The purpose of this article is to summarize opportunities for digital phenotyping in neurology, review studies using everyday technologies to obtain motor and cognitive information, and provide a perspective on how neurologists can embrace and accelerate progress in this emerging field.

pmcIntroduction

Digital phenotyping is defined as the characterization of an individual’s phenotype, or set of observable traits, using everyday consumer devices such as general purpose smartphones, smart watches, and personal computers[1-3]. Research in this area has been catalyzed by the ubiquity of devices with high resolution sensors and cloud connectivity, and driven by the need for accessible and objective tools to measure behavior in support of clinical care, interventional trials, and clinical research[4-13]. Digital phenotyping can be used to capture the state of an individual in a “passive” or free-living manner, collecting data in the background without asking the individual to perform specific activities. Passive phenotyping enables collection of real-life data continuously and provides a window into the individual’s daily function and how it evolves over time. “Active” phenotyping is another approach in which data from everyday devices are collected as individuals perform activities that constrain the context of the behavior (as in the bedside neurological examination) in order to elicit specific and interpretable features of disease. The studies outlined in this review demonstrate how both passive and active digital phenotyping have the potential to advance care and research in individuals with neurological disease.

Digital phenotyping is used here to refer to active and passive characterization of an individual’s observable traits using widely available consumer technologies that do not require clinician-interaction. This review focuses on motor and cognitive traits -- other important aspects of the phenotype that are partially observable using consumer technologies including autonomic function, sleep[14-16], seizures[17-19], and vision[20] are outside the scope of this review. As shown in Figure 1, digital phenotyping is related to quantitative and deep behavioral phenotyping. Quantitative phenotyping refers to efforts that transform aspects of behavior into one or more objective and continuous numeric measures, for example evaluating saccade velocity using eye position tracking equipment [21], sensation using quantitative sensory testing [22,23], or strength using hand-held dynamometry [24]. Comprehensive or deep phenotyping [25-27] typically uses a large number of descriptors to represent many aspects of the phenotype, which may or may not be quantitative. Typically, the purpose of quantitative phenotyping is to precisely measure a set of known or exploratory disease features. In contrast, deep phenotyping aims to examine the phenotype holistically, understand statistical relationships among phenotype elements, and identify sources of variation in the phenotype by modeling the generative process by which biological systems produce observable traits[28]. Digital phenotyping can contribute to the missions of both fields, as it is often quantitative and may be comprehensive. Digital phenotyping has three advantages that extend beyond what is possible with other phenotyping approaches: 1) the potential to examine the phenotype before any indication or risk of disease is known, 2) the ability to generate large and diverse datasets that may provide statistical power to discover common and rare phenotypic features and patterns, and 3) the opportunity to provide low-cost yet powerful systems to the entire population[8]. This review outlines opportunities for digital phenotyping in neurology, provides an overview of research efforts going from head to toe, and summarizes challenges and future directions in the field.

Opportunities for Digital Phenotyping in Neurology

The goals of digital phenotyping in neurology have substantial overlap with the purpose and goals of the neurological examination: to aid in diagnosis, disease monitoring, and predicting prognosis, and to assign clinical significance to findings from other data sources (e.g., imaging, electrophysiology, or laboratory data)[29]. Digital phenotyping offers the ability to expand upon the information obtained by a neurologist-administered examination. Areas of impact can be grouped into three categories: clinical care, therapeutics development, and clinical and translational research.

Clinical Goals

Digital phenotyping has the potential to impact neurological care over the course of disease, ranging from presymptomatic disease states to end-of-life care. Individuals in presymptomatic stages of neurodegenerative disease are by definition unaware that pathophysiological processes are underway and that changes in cognition and/or motor function will occur in the years ahead. Unless surveillance has been sought due to a known genetic risk factor or a family history of neurological disease, there is no clear mechanism to collect data in the presymptomatic phase that could support early diagnosis, improve understanding of the early disease process, and provide an opportunity to intervene prior to clinical onset. As digital phenotyping leverages data generated from technologies already in everyday use, there is opportunity to identify disease phenotypes before the user is under neurological care.

Quantitative phenotyping research in presymptomatic phases of autosomal dominant neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington’s disease and spinocerebellar ataxias have demonstrated that grip force[30], finger tapping[31], gait and posture[32,33], saccades[34-36], and speech[37] are informative in distinguishing presymptomatic gene carriers from controls. As discussed in later sections, similar information is accessible via everyday consumer devices. The study of presymptomatic phenotypes in fully-penetrant monogenic diseases[31,38,39] has the potential to contribute to early detection of other neurodegenerative diseases such as sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

For individuals with episodic symptomatology (e.g., transient ischemic attack, seizure, syncope), it is currently not possible to capture objective data about the first episode to assist in determination of the cause of the event and initiate preventative management. However, in these scenarios, passively collected data from sensors on a personal computer, smartphone, or smartwatch could provide multimodal information about motor function, speech, cognition, eye movements, facial expression, autonomic function, and sleep that are integrated to produce an assessment of risk for a particular condition or event. These data could be used to facilitate acute, real-time disease management and/or optimize post-event management aimed at reducing the risk of recurrent episodes. Extracting useful information from context-free data will benefit from the development of computational models that specify how neurological phenotypes give rise to signals in these data streams, and potentially from modeling approaches that automatically learn disease specific patterns in large, structured datasets which include clinical and contextual labels.

After establishing neurological care, digital phenotyping can assist with monitoring disease states, identifying neurological events (e.g., cerebrovascular events, seizures, falls), and assessing responses to an intervention (e.g., carbidopa-levodopa treatment in a Parkinson patient[40]). As digital phenotyping employs readily accessible consumer devices that do not require clinician administration, frequent measurements can be performed in the home setting with relatively low burden and cost to patients and their healthcare teams. Increased temporal resolution from repeated digital assessments or continuous passive monitoring offers two advantages: 1) the ability to capture (and potentially intervene in) acute and/or episodic neurological events and 2) the ability to more frequently or continuously track disease state, empowering patients to evaluate the effects of their behavioral interventions[41] and providing clinicians with better data to inform medication adjustment. Frequent data could allow for identification of deviations in trajectory that may signal a superimposed process that requires intervention.

There is considerable variability in disease trajectory across neurological diseases. Personalized medicine approaches that aim to predict an individual’s prognosis are important in providing information to patients and families to reduce uncertainty and help plan for the future. Current models for predicting age of disease onset or disease progression incorporate clinical, demographic, and genetic variables, which were identified from large patient cohorts[42-46]. There is opportunity for comprehensive digital phenotyping studies to identify rare and common phenotype patterns that are predictive of disease progression and enable creation of improved prognostic models.

Therapeutics Development Goals

Most primary outcome measures for interventional trials in neurology include an assessment of change in the motor or cognitive phenotype, change in behavioral function or disability, or change in the frequency of disease episodes. To achieve acceptable reliability of noisy human-performed outcome measures, assessment components are typically ordinal with relatively large differences between each scoring category. Thus, it is challenging to evaluate interventions for diseases that change slowly over time, to detect small drug effects, or to obtain evidence early in a drug development program that the intervention is having an impact on behavior or function. Evaluating efficacy of trials aimed at premanifest neurodegenerative disease is especially challenging, as current assessment tools may not be able to capture small changes in the early disease state[47,48]. Digital phenotyping tools may alleviate these challenges through more frequent, precise, and comprehensive assessments. Adapting established functional rating scales or pen-and-paper tests for self-report/self-administration on mobile devices where more frequent measurements are possible can reduce variance and increase the effect size of the test[49-52]. Using sensors to measure targeted aspects of the phenotype using continuous instead of ordinal variables enables detection of smaller disease changes over shorter intervals[53]. Collecting large scale datasets consisting of multimodal sensor data can lead to discovery of quantitative behavioral biomarkers that are more sensitive measures of disease change or contain prognostic or mechanistic information that allow for better patient stratification[54]. In combination, these advantages could make a large impact on the speed and cost of drug development efforts, reduce burden on patients, and enable evaluation of more promising therapies in parallel.

Clinical Research Goals

Behavioral phenotypes may be considered the final manifestations of neurological disease that are directly observable and are consequences of an individual’s disease mechanisms in the context of their genetics and environment. It is assumed that phenotypic heterogeneity, present even within monogenic diseases, reflects hidden and incompletely understood variability and complexity in proximal disease mechanisms, genetics, and environmental factors, but also intrinsic stochasticity in biological systems[55,56]. While genetic, environmental, and phenotypic variables are data that can be probed and measured in humans, disease processes at the molecular, cellular, and circuit levels are more challenging or currently impossible to measure in living humans. Substantial progress has been made in developing computational methods to infer unobserved variables based on the observed variables[57]. One of the prospects of digital phenotyping is to provide data that can power modeling efforts to uncover hidden phenotype structure (e.g., subgroups and subphenotypes)[58,59] to assist in the identification of new disease mechanisms[60] and understand the particular subset of mechanisms involved in any given individual[61,62].

Overview of Digital Phenotyping Research by Behavioral Category

Digital phenotyping studies have demonstrated the ability to capture a wide range of behaviors relevant to neurological disease. This section, summarized in Table 1, includes examples of these studies organized by behavioral category.

Oculomotor and Gaze

Information captured with eye tracking technologies can be grouped into three categories: oculomotor (voluntary and involuntary movement of the eyes), gaze (the location of visual fixation, which closely reflects visual attention), and pupil size. The oculomotor assessment is a key component of the bedside neurological examination and eye tracking studies in the laboratory have revealed vast information about the impact of neurologic disease on oculomotor function as well as the neural substrates underlying oculomotor control and visual attention. Oculomotor abnormalities are present in premanifest disease states[34-36] and contain information relevant to identification of conditions such as progressive supranuclear palsy[63], concussion[64], and even Alzheimer’s disease[65]. Gaze characteristics (e.g., novelty preference, fixation duration, refixations) have been shown to be informative in detecting mild cognitive impairment[66,67], and decreased visual attention to eye and mouth regions of the face distinguishes toddlers with autism from controls[68]. Advances in the spatial and temporal resolution of consumer cameras and development of sophisticated computer vision methods for accurately identifying facial landmarks including the iris and pupil center (see [69] for review), have enabled the possibility of capturing disease-relevant oculomotor and gaze behavior from ubiquitous cameras present in mobile devices and personal computers. A recent study presented stimuli on a tablet and used its built-in camera to identify facial landmarks and track head position to demonstrate that toddlers with autism orient to name less consistently and with longer delays compared to controls[70]. Studies have shown that it’s possible to capture oculomotor information, including saccade latency in healthy individuals[71] and cerebellar smooth pursuit abnormalities in individuals with ataxia[72] using the high speed camera present in some mobile phones combined with computer vision algorithms. These studies, although performed in the clinic or laboratory setting, show that it is possible to capture gaze and oculomotor information using cameras on everyday mobile devices[73,74].

Speech and Language

The evaluation of speech and language is important in the diagnosis and management of many neurological disorders. There is a growing body of work in speech-based digital biomarkers (see [75] for review), driven in part by advancements in computational methods and the availability of open source libraries for speech analysis [76-79]. Progress in analytic methods along with quality microphones in smartphones and personal computers has led to home-based digital phenotyping studies assessing speech in neurological conditions. In a longitudinal study conducted via mobile application at home in ALS patients, articulatory precision and speech rate were found to be informative for detecting bulbar dysfunction and tracking disease progression[80]. Data from the sustained phonation task administered via mobile phone applications was shown to be a useful component in quantifying disease severity in Parkinson disease[40], distinguishing Parkinson disease from controls[81], and distinguishing individuals with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder, Parkinson disease, and healthy controls[82]. In a study where standard speech tasks were administered using a mobile application in a clinic setting, accurate classification of Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy controls was achieved using features derived from the timing of words and phrases within a spoken response[83].

Cognition

Digital cognitive assessments offer the opportunity to recognize early changes in cognition, precisely monitor disease, and accelerate drug development efforts in Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias[5,9,84,85]. A large number of technologies and platforms have been developed for objective and quantitative cognitive evaluations (see [9,85-87] for reviews). Examples of digital phenotyping studies include those in which neurocognitive dysfunction is evaluated from passively collected data or self-administered digital tests or games performed using everyday technologies. Recent research has shown that mobile self-administered versions of cognitive batteries or individual tests distinguish healthy individuals from individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer’s disease, or multiple sclerosis, correlate with standard neuropsychological testing, and/or show consistent performance when comparing clinic versus home administration[88-96]. Additionally, several large scale, open source platforms have been developed to support the study of cognition in health and disease through self-administered tests performed at home (testmybrain.org[97], labinthewild.org[98], mobiletoolbox.org).

Information about cognitive function beyond traditional neuropsychological metrics (accuracy, response time, completion time) has been explored with digital cognitive tasks or games. On a digital version of the Trails Making Test Part B performed with a tablet and stylus, features including stylus pauses (number and duration), time inside the target circle, stylus lifts off the screen (number and time off screen), and time between circles were correlated with performance on standard neuropsychological tests evaluating visual working memory, inhibitory control, and switching ability[99]. Performance on a tablet-based virtual supermarket game, in which users navigate a virtual grocery store to retrieve items on their grocery list, distinguished individuals with MCI from a population of individuals with subjective memory complaints[100,101]. Interestingly, APOE4 gene carriers who have increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, took longer paths to a target location while playing a spatial navigation game[102]

Passively collected data about home computer usage demonstrated that over time, individuals with MCI spent fewer days and less time per day on the computer compared with cognitively normal adults [103]. In an analysis of computer mouse movements, individuals with MCI made fewer total mouse movements, had greater variability in duration of pauses between mouse movements, and made more curved and looped movements, suggesting that individuals with MCI made less efficient and less accurate movements than cognitively normal older adults [104]. Global Positioning System (GPS) data from a smartphone collected over a three day period demonstrated that individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s covered less territory in their natural environment, as measured by area covered and size of perimeter [105].

Arm Motor

A variety of digital phenotyping technologies have been used to characterize arm motor function in neurological diseases, including inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors that measure linear acceleration and/or angular velocity, touch screens, keyboards, computer mice, and cameras. IMU sensors worn on the wrist have been used extensively in studies of Parkinson disease and stroke[106-108]. Although the specific devices used in many of these studies are not everyday technologies and do not qualify as digital phenotyping technologies under the definition used here, very similar sensors are present in everyday smartwatches and smartphones. It has been shown in Parkinson disease that passive data from a single wrist sensor, worn continuously for ten days, can produce bradykinesia and dyskinesia scores every two minutes that are responsive to treatment with levodopa, and when aggregated across time are consistent with clinician ratings[109]. Producing motor scores at a time resolution of 2 minutes enabled creation of an objective motor fluctuation score, which evolved with disease stage and was responsive to deep brain stimulation[110]. Wrist sensor data collected during stationary assessments at home in individuals with Huntington’s disease were used to train a model to estimate the probability of chorea[111] and studies have demonstrated the utility of IMUs in smartphones and wrist devices to capture characteristics of tremor in Parkinson disease and essential tremor[81,112-118]. Passive data from wrist sensors have been shown to be useful for assessment of arm motor function in acute/subacute stroke[119-123], prediction of 3-month post-stroke disability[124], and assessment of daily arm use months to years after stroke[125-127]. Wrist sensor data has also been shown to correlate with improvement in upper extremity function during stroke recovery[128]. Although the sensors in the stroke studies were usually placed on bilateral wrists to evaluate relative activity in impaired and unimpaired limbs, it is possible that similar information can be obtained from a single sensor placed on the more affected limb.

Touch screen input data collected on mobile devices have been used to assess fine motor function in studies in Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and ataxia. During finger tapping tasks, involving single finger or alternating two finger tapping on a smartphone touchscreen, features including intertap interval and intertap time variability have been shown to be able to distinguish individuals with Parkinson disease or multiple sclerosis from controls and correlate with clinician rating scales or self-report surveys [40,81,117,129-133]. Time to completion on a touchscreen task involving tapping a sequence of randomized target locations had high test-retest reliability and correlated with clinical rating scales and other quantitative assessments in individuals with ataxia[134]. Features based on timing of keystrokes (time between the first and second key release) while typing on a smartphone keyboard also enabled accurate classification of individuals with Parkinson disease and controls[135]. An analysis of sequences of keystroke hold times, collected passively in people with Parkinson disease while typing on a laptop, was able to identify response (or lack thereof) to dopamine therapy[136]. Features extracted from continuous computer mouse trajectories and search query patterns collected passively during web search behavior enabled accurate classification of Parkinson disease and controls[137]. Analysis of computer mouse trajectories during a web-based target clicking task allowed both identification and severity measurement of individuals with ataxia and parkinsonism[138] (see Table 1 for additional detail on quantitative features).

Balance and Gait

Quantitative phenotyping of gait and balance in neurological diseases has been performed using a range of technologies including motion capture systems, gait mats, force plates, and wearable sensor systems[139,140]. Several studies have shown that inertial measurement units (IMUs) in tablets and smartphones can accurately measure balance parameters when worn on the trunk. Studies conducted in the laboratory with a tablet computer affixed to the waist demonstrate that data from accelerometers and gyroscopes enable accurate measurement of postural stability (based on center of mass acceleration metrics) that correlate well with motion capture[141] and dynamic force plate measurements[142], and distinguish individuals with Parkinson disease from controls. Accelerometry data from a single waist-worn sensor enabled accurate detection of truncal dyskinesia in individuals with Parkinson disease during activities of daily living[143]. IMUs in a mobile device affixed to the trunk enabled measurement of trunk motion (excursion from midline) which was increased in individuals with Huntington's disease compared with controls[144]. In individuals with chronic stroke, gyroscope data from a smartphone worn on the trunk during balance tasks revealed impairments that correlated with the Berg Balance Scale and separated stroke participants from controls[145]. Balance tasks have also been performed with a smartphone placed in a trouser pocket, with time series features such as mean velocity, mean acceleration, and entropy of acceleration in a particular direction informative of disease severity in Parkinson disease[40,81].

Many studies in multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Parkinson disease have investigated step count and general daily activity metrics, usually using an IMU sensor attached to the waist or ankle in the home environment (see [146] for a comprehensive review). In multiple sclerosis, it has been shown that daily activity metrics or step counts derived from an accelerometer worn at the waist: 1) correlate with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), self-report instruments, six minute walk distance, and/or oxygen cost of walking[147-152]; 2) change over time in association with functional limitations[153]; and 3) respond to a behavioral intervention[154]. Similarly, in a study of individuals with stroke, it was found that daily activity count derived from an accelerometer worn at the hip (on either the affected or unaffected side) correlated with six-minute walk distance[155]. In individuals with Parkinson disease, accelerometry data from a single waist-worn sensor enabled accurate detection of freezing of gait during walking tasks and activities of daily living performed at home[156]. In a study of individuals with Parkinson disease and older adults who were experiencing falls, Parkinson disease fallers experienced greater variability in step length, and older adult fallers had less step velocity variability compared to matched nonfallers[157]. For wrist-worn IMUs, step counts derived from a Fitbit device worn on the nondominant wrist were relatively accurate, reflective of the EDSS, and decreased more in individuals with progressive versus relapsing-remitting MS over a 4-week period[158]. Arm swing amplitude and peak angular velocity derived from bilaterally placed wrist IMUs were reduced in individuals with Parkinson disease compared with controls[159].

A few studies have obtained gait information using data from sensors in smartphones. In active duty Navy personnel exposed to repetitive low-level blasts associated with neurocognitive decline, there was slowed walking pace and increased stride time variability during a stepping-in-place task, as measured by accelerometers in a smartphone strapped to the thigh[160]. Data from a smartphone accelerometer placed in the pocket during twenty seconds of walking was associated with patient reported disability and lower extremity function in individuals with MS[132]. With a smartphone placed in a trouser pocket or belt pouch in individuals with Parkinson disease, it was possible to estimate turn speed during a walking task, and during passive monitoring at home, turn speed, sit-to-stand transitions, and ratio of walking to not-walking[81]. These metrics were significantly different in Parkinson disease patients versus controls, and all except sit-to-stand transitions were associated with the relevant Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part 3 subscore and, interestingly, could distinguish those with a subscore of 0 (i.e., no disease signs) from controls. In another study that included a walking task with a smartphone placed in a trouser pocket or pouch, general time series features extracted from the accelerometry data, such as entropy of acceleration in a particular direction, contributed to estimates of disease severity in individuals with Parkinson disease[40].

A Role for the Neurologist in Advancing Digital Phenotyping

Many of the challenges and recommendations for the future growth and adoption of digital phenotyping technologies, including data and algorithm-related challenges such as interpretability, standards, sharing, and security, have been discussed previously[161-166] and are active areas of research and development. Studies that generate large open datasets using open source platforms[162,167] will be critical for accelerating progress in digital phenotyping by allowing iterative improvement in platforms and analysis approaches, direct comparison of analysis techniques, replication of results, and increased patient and provider awareness to support adoption into consumer use, clinical practice, and clinical trials.

As the field continues to grow, the neurology community will play an important role in guiding and accelerating the development of digital phenotyping technologies to impact the care of neurological patients. An important service will be to create guidelines establishing scientific standards for the adoption of digital phenotyping technologies in clinical practice, analogous to policies put forth by the FDA (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence) and Movement Disorders Society[164] for selection of digital technologies in clinical trials. Are technologies that produce quantitative metrics that correlate with disease severity, identify response to treatment, and/or distinguish specific diseases from controls, but are based on models trained on relatively small datasets, clinically useful enough to incorporate into practice? Do digital phenotyping technologies in their current state of evolution provide actionable information or new disease insights? Answering these important questions will require new technologies to efficiently present raw, individual-level data, thereby facilitating the neurologist’s understanding of the information captured by the technology as well as how summary metrics were derived. Having the opportunity to evaluate these new data types in their raw form would facilitate an improved appreciation of the strengths and limitations of the data type and its clinical value, analogous to the neurologist’s interpretation of brain imaging or EEG time series data in the overall context of the patient. Visualizing the data alongside patient care will lead to a deeper understanding of disease phenotypes, drive the development of more informative and clinically relevant technologies, and support curation of existing digital phenotyping tools. Gaining experience with and intuition for these data through clear and concise visualizations will allow neurologists to provide informed recommendations of technologies to patients and drug developers. Determining useful ways to visualize and interact with complex data[168] is challenging and will require increased engagement between neurologists, computer scientists, and application designers.

Conclusion

There is great potential for digital phenotyping technologies to have an impact on the prevention, diagnosis, and management of neurological diseases. Wide ranging efforts have demonstrated the ability to extract motor and cognitive phenotypic information from everyday technologies using both passive and active data collection techniques. Future work will continue to move toward self-use at home, with individuals motivated by the information returned directly to them, and by engagement and feedback from their clinical teams that the data generated are useful. Acceleration toward clinical utility and widespread use will require adoption of common platforms that enable building upon prior work and the integration of datasets. Barriers to clinical entry may be reduced by an increased emphasis on data visualization, thereby enabling the neurology community to contribute extensive experience with disease phenotypes to shape the development of these technologies.
