In order to increase engagement in physical activity, it is important to determine which factors contribute to physical activity engagement in older adults. The current study examined the relative predictive ability of several potential determinants, in terms of both the concurrent level as well as longitudinal trajectories. Clinically normal adults aged 61â€“92 completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (n = 189 for cross-sectional models; n = 214 for longitudinal models). Potential determinants included age, gender, education, physical health, sensory health, mood, cardiovascular health, cognitive status, and biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD). We observed a novel finding that both concurrent physical health (p &lt; 0.001) and change in physical health (p &lt; 0.001) were significant predictors above and beyond other determinants. Concurrent mood predicted levels of physical activity (p = 0.035), particularly in females. These findings suggest that poor physical health and low mood might be important to consider as potential barriers to physical activity engagement in older adults.

Dementia and physical activity

pmcIntroduction

Engaging in regular physical activity (i.e., bodily movement that requires energy expenditure) or exercise (i.e., planned engagement in a structured program with the goal of improving fitness) is associated with benefits in cardiovascular health (Warburton et al., 2010), mood (Daley, 2008), brain structure (Colcombe et al., 2006), and cognitive health (Kramer et al., 2006). Importantly, people over the age of 65 are more likely to report physical inactivity (31.9%) compared to younger (19.3%) and middle-aged (26.2%) adults (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Amongst older adults reporting engagement in some physical activity, only 33% indicated engaging in sustained, regular physical activity (i.e., exercising five times a week for at least 30 min) as recommended by the American Heart Association (Keadle et al., 2016). Interventions geared at increasing engagement in physical activity among older adults will be particularly important to improve cognitive, brain and overall health. Hence, it is crucial to understand what contributes to engagement in physical activity among older adults and thus which factors might influence the effectiveness of these interventions.

A wide variety of factors has been examined as potential correlates of physical activity and exercise in older adults. These include demographic (e.g., age, gender, education), personal/behavioral (e.g., physical health, mental health, smoking behavior), psychological (e.g., self-efficacy, attitudes, perceived benefits and barriers), social (e.g., social norms, sports partner, social support), and physical environment (e.g., safety, walking facilities, residential neighborhood) [see Koeneman et al., 2011; van Stralen et al., 2009; Barnett et al., 2017; Lounassalo et al., 2019; Notthoff et al., 2017 for reviews]. Demographic and personal/behavioral factors are amongst the most studied in terms of cross-sectional associations with physical activity and exercise (Koeneman et al., 2011; Barnett et al., 2017; Notthoff et al., 2017). Although findings are somewhat mixed, there is some evidence that younger age, male gender, and higher education are associated with more concurrent physical activity/exercise [e.g., Dohrn et al., 2020; Hsu et al., 2012; but see Haley &amp; Andel, 2010, Pan et al., 2015; for reviews see Koeneman et al., 2011; Notthoff et al., 2017]. In terms of personal and behavioral determinants, physical health has been the most investigated factor (Notthoff et al., 2017). Higher subjective health has been consistently associated with more physical activity/exercise cross-sectionally, but findings related to the role of objective measures of physical health have been mixed (Notthoff et al., 2017).

Demographic and personal/behavioral factors have also been frequently examined as predictors of physical activity/exercise over time. This literature provides varying degrees of evidence across studies for higher education, male gender, lower depressive symptoms, higher self-rated health, and better objective physical health to be related to more favorable physical activity or exercise trajectories over time (Hsu et al., 2012; Pan et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2012; for reviews see Koeneman et al., 2011; Lounassalo et al., 2019). Furthermore, there are some indications that poor cardiovascular health (e.g., coronary heart disease) and certain risk factors for poor cardiovascular health (e.g., overweight/obesity, current smoking at baseline, healthy eating behaviors) may be associated with decreasing physical activity or persistent sedentary behavior over time (Nguyen et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2012).

There are some limitations to the extant literature. Physical health has often been studied in terms of presence or absence of a chronic health condition or number of health problems rather than more direct measures of physical functioning in cross-sectional studies. In addition, despite some studies examining the impact of different factors, there is a relative dearth of studies directly comparing the predictive ability of multiple determinants amongst older adults (Koeneman et al., 2011; Notthoff et al., 2017). Furthermore, most of the past studies comparing the impact of multiple factors used a single measure of a category, with variations across studies in the particular indicator of a category, which may have contributed to some of the mixed findings (Notthoff et al., 2017). Use of robust composites of a domain might provide more insight when directly comparing the predictive ability of these determinants amongst older adults. Lastly, there is a gap in the literature in terms of examining whether changes in the determinants contribute to physical activity/exercise engagement. For example, while concurrent physical health might be an important predictor of current physical activity/exercise engagement, declining or increasing physical health in the recent past could also influence current physical activity levels (de Souto Barreto et al., 2014). Thus, there is a need to examine whether the longitudinal trajectory of potential determinants predict physical activity levels and whether there is a differential impact of the trajectories.

It is also important to examine the associations between physical activity/exercise and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. AD pathology is primarily characterized by amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (Sunderland et al., 2003). Most of the research in this area has been framed in terms of the impact of physical activity/exercise on AD pathology. In fact, several cross-sectional studies have described that greater physical activity is associated with less amyloid burden (e.g., Law et al., 2018; Okonkwo et al., 2014). However, it is conceivable that reverse causation is an issue in these studies. For example, a longitudinal study found that people who were diagnosed with dementia had a decline in physical activity in the nine years prior to diagnosis (Sabia et al., 2017). Thus, AD pathology could impact the level of physical activity in clinically normal older adults.

The first goal of this study was to examine the relative predictive ability of multiple factors for concurrent physical activity levels in older adults. This study took advantage of an existing cohort of participants at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University. We focused on demographic and health factors previously found to be associated with physical activity in some studies, including age, gender, education, physical health, sensory health, mood, cardiovascular health, and cognitive health. These predictor variables were measured multiple times while physical activity was measured at the most recent assessment. Hence, our second goal was to examine relative predictive ability of longitudinal change in these different factors. Finally, our third goal was to examine, in addition to these factors, whether amyloid and tau burden predict physical activity levels both in terms of current degree of burden and change over time. For all three goals, we took an exploratory approach to examine which factors have the most predictive ability without specific hypotheses considering the variability in the extant literature.

Methods

Participants

Participants (aged 61 to 92 years old) were enrolled in a longitudinal study on driving and preclinical AD at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) and completed an assessment of physical activity engagement. (e.g., Bayat et al., 2021; Roe et al., 2017). The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDRÂ©) scale was used to determine absence or presence, and severity of dementia if present (Morris et al., 1993). All participants were clinically normal (CDR = 0) at baseline and at their most recent assessment. All individuals who had cross-sectional or longitudinal data for at least one of the predictors were included to maximize the sample size, hence, sample size varied based on the model (crosssectional model: n = 189; longitudinal model: n = 214). See Table 1 for sample characteristics. Participants consented to participation in accordance with Washington University Human Research Protection Office guidelines.

Procedure

Knight ADRC participants age 65 + are followed annually with clinical assessments; those 55 to 64 are followed with these assessments every 3 years. All participants have biomarker collection at baseline and every two-to-three years thereafter. As part of the driving study, participants completed annual assessments of physical health, sensory health, and mood. For the current study, the most recent available measurement of physical activity was used for all eligible participants. For cross-sectional models, measures of physical health, sensory health, and mood composite that were obtained at the same time as the physical activity measurement were examined. Assessments of cardiovascular health and cognitive status obtained within 1-year prior to physical activity measurement were included. All composites were based on the available measures for the domain. Biomarker collection within two years of the physical activity measurement was included to maximize sample size. For longitudinal models, all data collected prior to the most recent physical activity measurement was included.

Physical activity assessment

Physical activity was assessed with the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE; Washburn et al., 1993). The PASE is a self-report questionnaire designed to assess physical activity engagement in older adults over a one-week period. It consists of 12 items assessing engagement in leisure, household, and work-related activities. The overall PASE score was obtained using the approach outlined in the manual. PASE score has been shown to be reliable and valid (Washburn et al., 1993, 1999).

Demographic measures

Demographic measures consisted of age at the time of physical activity assessment, years of education, and gender.

Physical health composite

This composite was estimated from three variables. The first measure of physical health was a 10-meter walk test (Collen et al., 1990). The score for this test represented average time across three trials to walk 10 m at preferred walking speed. The 10-meter walk test score was reversed for the purposes of the composite. The second measure was seated grip strength measured with a Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer, and the score represented the average lbs of force across three trials for both left and right hands. The third measure assessed mobility by examining the range of cervical motion. The mobility score represented the average degree of cervical flexion, cervical extension, cervical left rotation, and cervical right rotation. The three measures were standardized across all available data points and averaged to create the composite. Higher score represented better physical health.

Sensory health composite

Sensory health was assessed with measures of visual acuity and hearing handicap. The visual acuity measure represented the average of near and far visual acuity scores for both eyes measured using the ETDRS-based, King-Devick app on an iPad. Hearing handicap was measured with the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE; Ventry &amp; Weinstein, 1982). HHIE is a self-report questionnaire assessing emotional and social effects of perceived hearing handicap. HHIE scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing greater handicap. The score was reversed for the purposes of the composite. The two measures were standardized across all available data points and averaged to create the composite. Higher score on the composite represented better sensory health.

Mood composite

The first measure of mood was the Profile of Mood States â€“ Short Form (POMS-SF; Curran et al., 1995). It is a 30-item questionnaire assessing positive and negative mood states. Total mood disturbance score was calculated by subtracting the positive mood score from the negative mood score. Presence of depressive symptoms was measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al., 1999). The total mood disturbance and PHQ-9 scores were standardized across all available data points and averaged to create the composite. The score was reversed so that a higher score represented better mood.

Cardiovascular health composite

This composite represented the percentage of the conditions present among the following: heart attack, afibrillation, angioplasty, pacemaker, congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and BMI above the overweight cut-off 25. The score was reversed so that a higher percentage represented better cardiovascular health.

Global cognitive status

The Clinical Dementia Rating scale â€“ Sum of Boxes score was used to estimate global cognitive status (Morris et al., 1993). The score is based on ratings in six cognitive and functional domains (memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, personal care). Although we planned to examine cognitive health as a predictor of physical activity, cognitive status was excluded from analyses due to insufficient variability in the CDR-SB scores.

AD Biomarkers

Cerebrospinal fluid (20-30mL) was acquired by lumbar puncture at 8am after an overnight fasting period, as described previously (Fagan et al., 2000). Samples were gently inverted to avoid possible gradient effects, centrifuged at low speed, and aliquoted (0.5mL) into propylene tubes before freezing at âˆ’84 Â°C. Levels of phosphorylated tau181 (ptau181) and AÎ²42 were analyzed using the Lumipulse G1200 automated assay system (Fujirebio, Malvern, PA). Higher AÎ²42 and lower ptau181 represent a smaller degree of AD pathology.

In vivo amyloid imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) was performed with Pittsburgh Compound B [11 C]PiB or florbetapir (F-AV-45) radiotracers as described previously (Mintun et al., 2006; Su et al., 2018). Data were acquired on a Siemens 962 h+ECAT PET or Biograph 40 Scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions). Amyloid burden was expressed in centiloids based on the mean standardized uptake value ratio with partial volume correction via regional spread function (Su et al., 2015, 2018, 2019). Centiloid score was examined as a continuous variable and higher centiloid values represent greater presence of amyloid pathology.

In vivo tau PET imaging was performed using 18 F-AV-1451 (previously known as T807; Chien et al., 2013) as described previously (Gordon et al., 2019). The tracer was synthesized at the Washington University School of Medicine. Data were acquired on a Biograph 40 PET/CT scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions) and data for the 80â€“100 min post-injection window were examined. Data were converted to standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) using the whole cerebellum as a reference. Tauopathy score was obtained by averaging the binding potential values from the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, interior temporal, and lateral occipital cortex regions of interest. Tauopathy score was examined as a continuous variable and higher tauopathy values represent greater presence of tau pathology.

Statistical analyses

Cross-sectional models

A series of linear regression models were conducted with physical activity as the dependent variable. Model 1 included age, education, gender, physical health, sensory health, mood, and cardiovascular health composites as predictors. Models 2â€“4 included all of the Model 1 predictors in order to examine whether the selected AD biomarkers provided unique variance. Model 2 included the CSF measures of AÎ²42 and ptau181, Model 3 incorporated PET-Amyloid and Model 4 included PET-Tau. The two PET models were examined separately to maximize the sample size for each model. In all four models, all independent and dependent variables except gender were standardized based on the mean and standard deviation of that model sample so that all variables were on the same scale.

Longitudinal models

A two-stage approach was conducted for longitudinal analyses (Welten et al., 2018). In the first step, growth curve models were run for each time-varying individual variable (i.e., except age, gender, and education). Time and intercept were entered as random and fixed effects, respectively. Fixed effects (i.e., slope coefficients) of the growth curve models were extracted and standardized. In the second step, these standardized slope coefficients were entered into a series of linear regression models as predictors following the procedure described above (i.e., Models 1â€“3). Due to the small number of longitudinal assessments of PET-Tau, only the PET-Amyloid model (Model 3) was examined.

Results

Cross-sectional models

In Model 1, the only significant predictor of concurrent physical activity was physical health (Î² = 0.30, SE = 0.09, CI (0.14, 0.45), p &lt; 0.001), with better physical health associated with greater levels of physical activity. Physical health was also a significant predictor in Model 2 (CSF biomarkers) and Model 3 (PET-Amyloid) (see Table 2; Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). In Model 3 (PET-Amyloid) and 4 (PET-Tau), mood was also a significant predictor of concurrent physical activity, with better mood associated with greater physical activity engagement (see Table 2; Fig. 1).

Post-hoc analyses examined whether each variable predicted physical activity engagement in separate models (see Supplementary Table 2). Physical health and mood remained significant predictors of physical activity levels (Î² = 0.30, SE = 0.07, CI (0.16, 0.44), p &lt; 0.001; Î² = 0.19, SE = 0.07, CI (0.04, 0.33), p = 0.010, respectively), while all other factors remained non-significant (all pâ€™s &gt; 0.167).

Longitudinal models

See Supplementary Table 1 for growth curve results. Change in physical health over time predicted physical activity in Model 1 (Î² = 0.31, SE = 0.07, CI (0.16, 0.45), p &lt; 0.001), with a greater decline in physical health associated with lower levels of physical activity. Change in physical health was also the only significant predictor of physical activity in Model 2 (CSF biomarkers) and Model 3 (PET-Amyloid). None of the longitudinal trajectories of other factors were found to be significant predictors (all pâ€™s &gt; 0.251, see Table 3; Fig. 2, and Supplementary Fig. 2).

Post-hoc analyses examined whether each variable predicted physical activity in separate models. Physical health remained the only significant predictor (Î² = 0.27, SE = 0.07, CI (0.14, 0.40), p &lt; 0.001) while all other factors remained non-significant (all pâ€™s &gt; 0.175; Supplementary Table 2).

Post-hoc analyses of the leisure domain

The same set of cross-sectional and longitudinal models were examined with the leisure domain as the dependent variable. Current physical health was a significant predictor in cross-sectional Model 1 (Î² = 0.31, SE = 0.08, CI (0.15, 0.47), p &lt; 0.001), as well as all other cross-sectional models (all pâ€™s &lt; 0.001, see Supplementary Table 3). Age was a significant predictor in cross-sectional Model 1 (Î² = 0.15, SE = 0.08, CI (0.003, 0.30), p = 0.045), cross-sectional Model 2 (CSF biomarkers; Î² = 0.28, SE = 0.10, CI (0.08, 0.47), p = 0.007) and cross-sectional Model 3 (PET-Amyloid; Î² = 0.26, SE = 0.11, CI (0.05, 0.46), p = 0.017), with increasing age associated with greater engagement in leisure physical activity, opposite from what was expected. There was also a non-significant trend for CSF AÎ²42 (Î² = 0.17, SE = 0.09, CI (âˆ’0.02, 0.35), p = 0.077) in cross-sectional Model 2.

In the longitudinal models, only change in physical health over time was a significant predictor of leisure physical activity in all three longitudinal models (see Supplementary Table 4).

When examining the predictors in separate models (see Supplementary Table 5), current physical health and current mood were significant predictor of leisure physical activity engagement cross-sectionally (Î² = 0.29, SE = 0.07, CI (0.15, 0.43), p &lt; 0.001; Î² = 0.15, SE = 0.07, CI (0.001, 0.29), p = 0.049, respectively). Change in physical health was a significant predictor of leisure physical activity engagement (Î² = 0.28, SE = 0.07, CI (0.15, 0.41), p &lt; 0.001). In addition, there was a non-significant trend for decreasing mood over time to predict lower leisure physical activity (Î² =âˆ’0.13, SE = 0.07, CI (âˆ’0.27, âˆ’0.01), p = 0.075; see Supplementary Table 4). None of the other predictors were significant in the individual cross-sectional or longitudinal models (all pâ€™s &gt; 0.110).

Post-hoc analyses of BMI

BMI was one of the predictors more consistently associated with change in physical activity engagement in prior literature in older adults (Koeneman et al., 2011). We conducted post-hoc analyses exploring whether BMI specifically was predictive of total physical activity levels in this older adult sample. BMI was not a significant predictor in the crosssectional Model 1 (Î² = âˆ’0.04, SE = 0.08, CI (âˆ’0.20, 0.12), p = 0.616) or when examined as the only predictor cross-sectionally (Î² = âˆ’0.08, SE = 0.07, CI (âˆ’0.23, 0.06), p = 0.259). Change in BMI was not significantly associated with physical activity in longitudinal Model 1 (Î² = âˆ’0.005, SE = 0.08, CI (âˆ’0.16, 0.15), p = 0.951) or in the individual longitudinal model (Î² = 0.02, SE = 0.07, CI (âˆ’0.12, 0.17), p = 0.758).

Post-hoc analyses of gender

Several prior studies suggested that determinants of physical activity engagement might differ between men and women (e.g., Koyanagi et al., 2018). Hence, we post-hoc examined the same models of total physical activity engagement separately in males and females. All of the results were the same unless noted below. The results suggested that mood was a significant predictor of physical activity engagement in Model 2 (Î² = 0.28, SE = 0.14, CI (0.002, 0.56), p = 0.049) and Model 3 in females (Î² = 0.28, SE = 0.13, CI (0.01, 0.55), p = 0.041; see Supplementary Table 6) but not in males (Î² = 0.11, SE = 0.14, CI (âˆ’0.17, 0.39), p = 0.427; (Î² = 0.21, SE = 0.17, CI (âˆ’0.13, 0.54), p = 0.220; see Supplementary Table 7). There was also a trend for mood to be a significant predictor in Model 1 and Model 4 in females (see Supplementary Table 6).

In longitudinal models, change in ptau181 was significantly associated with physical activity engagement in males (Model 2: Î² = 0.28, SE = 0.14, CI (0.01, 0.56), p = 0.043; see Supplementary Table 9), with greater accumulation of ptau181 unexpectedly associated with higher physical activity levels. This was also observed in the ptau181 individual longitudinal model (Î² = 0.28, SE = 0.13, CI (0.03, 0.), p = 0.029) that was conducted to confirm the finding.

Discussion

This study sought to determine the relative predictive ability of different determinants of physical activity engagement in older adults in terms of both concurrent levels, as well as longitudinal trajectories of those factors. Our results suggest that concurrent physical health was the most robust predictor of physical activity engagement compared to age, gender education, sensory health, cardiovascular health, and AD biomarkers. Concurrent mood was also a significant predictor of physical activity levels in the models with AD biomarkers and in the individual predictor model. Furthermore, changes in physical health over time were significantly associated with recent physical activity. A series of post-hoc analyses were conducted to potentially provide insight into the minimal effects in primary analyses. These analyses revealed that physical health was also a predictor of leisure physical activity engagement, and that concurrent mood was a significant predictor of physical activity levels particularly for females. No other consistent patterns emerged in the post-hoc analyses.

Concurrent objective physical health was a particularly robust predictor of physical activity engagement, both total levels and in the leisure domain. A prior review noted objective measures of physical health to be inconsistent predictors of physical activity across studies compared to subjective measures of health (Notthoff et al., 2017). However, the articles in that review used measures such as number of health problems or chronic health conditions as objective measures (e.g., Shimada et al., 2007). In contrast, more direct measures of physical functioning similar to ours (e.g., walking test, gait speed, mobility, body strength) are more consistently associated with physical activity/exercise cross-sectionally (for review on exercise: Liberman et al., 2017). Thus, our cross-sectional finding is consistent with potentially bidirectional effects of physical health and physical activity. Our study was able to examine change in determinants prior to measurement of physical activity as an initial step for examining causal direction. We observed consistently that prior decline in physical health over time was related to less engagement in physical activity. This finding provides some evidence that better physical health can lead to greater engagement in physical activity, in addition to the bidirectional effects.

Our finding that mood at the time of physical activity assessment was also a predictor of concurrent total physical activity aligns with a limited number of prior studies that found higher levels of psychological distress and depressive symptoms are associated with lower physical activity in older adults (e.g., Koyanagi et al., 2018; Lim &amp; Taylor, 2005). Again, it is possible that bidirectional effects are present with greater physical activity engagement leading to more positive mood as well (Pereira et al., 2014) as there is additional work showing beneficial effect of exercise on depressive symptoms in older adults (Daley, 2008). There was a non-significant trend for change in mood to be predictive of the leisure domain in post-hoc analyses (see Supplementary Table 4). While there might be some suggestion that better mood can lead to greater physical activity levels, the causal direction might be more dependent on the domain with a smaller effect compared to other factors (e.g., physical health). However, there is also a literature suggesting that positive mood is a significant predictor of both initiation and future maintenance of physical activity in older adults (van Stralen et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2015). Thus, mood might need to be considered prior to recommending or undergoing an intervention to increase physical activity engagement, as low mood might be a potential risk for low initiation and adherence. Notably, post-hoc analyses found that the association of total physical activity with concurrent mood may primarily be driven by females, which is consistent with some prior literature in terms of depressive symptoms (Koyanagi et al., 2018). Women are more likely to have mood disorders (Seney &amp; Sibille, 2014) and experience negative emotions more frequently and strongly (e.g., Deng et al., 2016). In our sample, women showed a non-significant trend towards having lower mood compared to men (p = 0.06), which might have contributed to the significant finding in women but not men.

It was surprising that none of the other factors were robust predictors of total physical activity levels either cross-sectionally or longitudinally, even when examined individually. Demographic factors are amongst the factors most extensively examined in older adults. There are some indications that mixed findings in the literature on age, gender and education may be because effects vary depending on the domain of physical activity or exercise examined (for reviews see Notthoff et al., 2017). Current results did not reveal any main effects of gender or education when examining the leisure domain separately in post-hoc analyses. There was a slight indication of domain-specificity for age effects in post-hoc analyses. Increasing age was associated with greater leisure time physical activity in three post-hoc cross-sectional models with other predictors (see Supplementary Table 2). This is generally consistent with evidence that leisure physical activity and sports/exercise may increase later in life after retirement whereas total physical activity may decrease (e.g., [Dohrn et al., 2020; Haley &amp; Andel, 2010; Koeneman et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2015; see Barnett et al., 2012 for review). It is important to highlight that our results with age were not predicted, significant positive age associations with leisure time were not consistently observed, and the negative association with total physical activity in the individual predictor model was not significant. Investigations with more fine-grained, a priori breakdown of types of physical activity and larger samples may be necessary to clarify this issue.

Some of the determinants examined here seem to be understudied, such as sensory impairments and cardiovascular health. A few studies found that lower BMI (Haley &amp; Andel, 2010; Nguyen et al., 2013) and better objectively-measured hearing (Gispen et al., 2014; Koyanagi et al., 2018) were linked to greater concurrent physical activity levels in older adults while there have been mixed findings for self-reported vision (Koyanagi et al., 2018; Lim &amp; Taylor, 2005). Qualitatively, we observed that cardiovascular health, even though not significant, was the third largest predictor in magnitude after physical health and mood. Despite baseline cardiovascular health measures predicting change in physical activity in some prior studies (e.g., BMI, smoking; Hsu et al., 2012; Nguyen et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2012), change in this determinant might be a weaker predictor of current physical activity. Overall, there is a lack of studies using comprehensive composites of cardiovascular health and sensory health. We examined BMI separately as the most researched cardiovascular factor. However, BMI was not a significant determinant of physical activity levels, suggesting that the use of composites was not necessarily hampering the ability to find significant associations between these determinants and engagement in physical activity.

In terms of AD biomarkers, there was only a non-significant trend for greater amyloid deposition as estimated in CSF to be associated with concurrent leisure physical activity relative to other predictors, but not when examined separately as the only predictor. The relative lack of crosssectional associations between AD biomarkers and physical activity engagement adds to a mixed literature, which may again relate in part to the measurement and operationalization of physical activity (for a narrative review see Frederiksen et al., 2019). In addition, change in AD biomarkers did not significantly predict physical activity levels, except for the potentially spurious finding that greater increase in CSF ptau181 over time was associated with greater physical activity levels in men in post-hoc analyses. This study indicates that greater accumulation of AD pathology might not significantly impact engagement in physical activity in clinically normal individuals, however, it remains to be studied whether this is the case in later stages of the disease as well.

Strengths of this study include repeated measures of each factor, broad coverage of most domains, and inclusion of both CSF and PET estimates of AD pathology. In addition, the values obtained for the measures in the study were generally consistent with published normative values in older adult populations (see Table 1). Finally, the use of the PASE (Washburn et al., 1993), which is a reliable and valid measure of physical activity specifically designed for older adults to incorporate activities common in this population, is a strength. Many studies in this area of research have used self-report measures with variable evidence of reliability and validity, which could lead to biased estimation of effects (Notthoff et al., 2017). There are also several limitations that should be considered. One limitation might be sample size considering that the effect sizes of the determinants were all in the small range. Second, physical activity was assessed with a self-report questionnaire that potentially introduces bias compared to more objective measures of physical activity (e.g., actigraphy), which may be more sensitive to examination of the correlates of physical activity (e.g., Dohrn et al., 2020). Third, our estimate of sensory health included an objective measure of vision and a subjective measure of hearing. It is important to consider whether objective or subjective measures of determinants represent a better predictor of physical activity (Notthoff et al., 2017).

There are several important future directions for this line of research. There is extensive variability in the literature with regards to key methodological factors. A proposed review of reviews by Dâ€™Amore and colleagues (2021) could provide valuable insight by examining whether associations between the determinants and physical activity are moderated by key characteristics (e.g., the design of the study, physical activity domain, physical activity vs. exercise, objective vs. subjective measurement). Furthermore, there is a need for a comprehensive longitudinal study incorporating dynamic changes of multiple determinants as well as repeated objectively-measured estimates of physical activity in order to examine correlated changes and lag effects. In terms of determinants, future studies should incorporate ones across demographic, personal/behavioral, psychological, social, and physical environment domains as well as personality and genetics (Bauman et al., 2012). While we created composites of domains to examine predictors of physical activity, future studies could take a latent modeling approach that allows not only examination at the robust construct level but also individual indicators to determine whether some measures may be more sensitive determinants. In addition, the potentially small effects, the breadth of measures that should be examined and the need for more sophisticated statistical modeling indicate that these future studies should include quite large sample sizes.

These results highlight the possibility that improving physical health and mood might represent potential mechanisms of increasing physical activity engagement. Older adults with lower mood or depressive symptoms were found to benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy or a mindfulness intervention aimed at improving mood (e.g., Hofmann et al., 2012; Mallya &amp; Fiocco, 2016). In addition, other factors such as loneliness and persistent pain have been associated with worse mood (Golden et al., 2009; Wood et al., 2016), hence, recommendations for addressing these factors might be beneficial. In terms of physical health, weight management and pain reduction can represent modifiable factors for maintaining physical health (e.g., Riebe et al., 2009; Weiner et al., 2006).

In addition, assessing mood and physical health could be helpful for future intervention studies aimed at increasing engagement in physical activity in older adults. These interventions might be tailored to the mood and/or physical health status of the individuals. Furthermore, studies investigating mechanisms behind physical activity behavior change should consider mood and physical health as potential avenues for facilitating behavior change. For example, both mood and physical health might impact self-efficacy, which has been shown to influence adoption and maintenance of the behavior (Marcus et al., 2000). Overall, maintaining or increasing mood and physical health in older adults might be beneficial in increasing or preventing decline in their activity levels.

In summary, concurrent physical health, as well as changes in physical health over time, were robust predictors of physical activity engagement. This result highlights the importance of considering current and past physical health when considering recommendations for engagement in physical activity. Secondly, concurrent mood was also a significant predictor of physical activity levels. This finding points to potential bidirectional effects that might hamper implementation of exercise and physical activity as a strategy to increase mood and alleviate depressive symptoms (Nystrom et al., 2015), particularly in females. Finally, these results emphasize that addressing mood and physical health might represent potential avenues for increasing engagement in physical activity. Further prospective research is critical to inform policies and interventions geared towards increasing engagement in physical activity among older adults.
