Introduction

The relationship between initial cognitive symptoms and subsequent rate of clinical decline is important in clinical care and design of dementia clinical trials.

Methods

This retrospective longitudinal, autopsy confirmed, cohort study among 2426 participants in the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center database included, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) pathology n=1187, Lewy body pathology (LBP) n=331, and mixed pathology (AD-LBP) n=904. Predominant initial cognitive symptom was assessed clinically. Linear mixed models evaluated the longitudinal outcome of Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score.

Results

Non-amnestic initial symptoms had a faster rate of decline than amnestic symptoms in all three groups. Language symptoms had a faster rate of decline in all three groups. Executive symptoms had a faster rate of decline than amnestic in AD and AD-LBP. There was a similar trend for visuospatial symptoms in AD-LBP.

Discussion

Initial cognitive symptoms, despite varied underlying pathology, are a predictor of longitudinal functional outcomes among dementias.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) are among the most common forms of dementia1. AD typically presents with early episodic memory deficits and LBD presents with prominent early executive, attention and visuospatial deficits.2, 3 While each disease has stereotypical early features, there remains a great deal of heterogeneity in the initial predominant clinical phenotype among primary AD4, LBD5, 6 and mixed dementia7.

Atypical non-amnestic AD phenotypes are increasingly clinically recognized and have been noted in the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA/AA) criteria8 and formalized in the International Working Group −2 (IWG-2) diagnostic criteria,4 and in a recent review9. Recent research has explored biomarker differences between early amnestic and non-amnestic AD variants, identifying multiple important imaging and biomarker differences in these groups in MRI,10 CSF total-tau,11 tau brain PET,12, 13 and 18F-labelled fluorodeoxyglucose PET.14 Moreover, neuropathology differences in the patterns of neurofibrillary tangle accumulation15 have been reported in non-amnestic AD variants. Differences in rate of decline among AD variants, have been explored by tracking longitudinal Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) scores with frontal and language atypical AD variants having faster rates of progression.16–18

When initial non-amnestic symptoms are clinically noted, but may not have met formal diagnostic criteria of an atypical AD variant, longer term clinical relevance is unclear. Examples of these cases include patients with initial language or word related difficulties, but not primary progressive aphasia, or initial visuospatial difficulties, but not posterior cortical atrophy.4 Recent studies among these cases have demonstrated associations between non-amnestic initial cognitive symptoms and APOE ε4 status19and with the risk of onset of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.20 However, the clinical implication of these initial non-amnestic cognitive symptoms on longitudinal clinical outcomes remains unknown and is the focus of this study.

Variability in longitudinal rate of clinical progression among participants with differing initial cognitive symptoms is potentially significant in interpreting dementia clinical trials. Clinical trials that do not account for this variability, when matching drug and placebo arms could confound the final results of the study. Based on this, we undertook a retrospective longitudinal cohort study among neuropathologically confirmed participants within the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset, which includes data from across multiple sites in the United States. We aimed to determine if participants with initial amnestic or non-amnestic cognitive symptoms, seen in AD, Lewy body pathology (LBP), and mixed pathology (AD-LBP), had differing rates of decline as determined by the Clinical Dementia Rating scale –Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB)21( a commonly used cognitive and functional outcome measure in many AD clinical trials) and MMSE.22 We hypothesized that within each pathology group, those with initial non-amnestic symptoms would have a faster rate of functional and cognitive decline on the CDR-SB than those with initial amnestic symptoms.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants and study design

This is a retrospective cross-sectional study using the NACC dataset. The dataset used here includes participant information collected from 37 past and present Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs) funded by the National Institute on Aging. Data from the Uniform Data Set (UDS) maintained by NACC between June 2005 and September 2019 were used for the present analysis. Details on data collection and data curating have been published previously.23 All contributing ADCs are required to obtain informed consent from their participants and maintain their own separate IRB review and approval from their institution prior to submitting data to NACC.

2.2 Participant assessment

Participants in the current analysis had either AD neuropathology (Thal stage≥1, Braak stages III-VI, and moderate or frequent neuritic plaques) meeting criteria for “Intermediate” or “High” AD neuropathologic change that is considered sufficient explanation for dementia per NIA/AA 2012 criteria for neuropathologic assessment of AD24 or LBP (brainstem-predominant, limbic or amygdala-predominant, neocortical, or had Lewy bodies present but the region was unspecified). The AD group had underlying AD neuropathology without co-existing Lewy body neuropathology and the LBP group had underlying Lewy body neuropathology without co-existing AD neuropathology (i.e., did not meet the criteria for neuropathologic AD noted above). The AD-LBP group had both of the above pathologies present together. The likelihood of co-existing vascular pathology for each participant by the Hachinski ischemic scale at the time of initial evaluation was also characterized25. Supplementary material notes details on formal analysis of vascular and TDP-43 pathology burden. Supplementary Figure 1 shows the subject selection flow chart.

All participants had a Clinical Dementia Rating-Global (CDR-G) scale ≤1 at initial clinical visit. The CDR-G scale assesses the current cognitive and functional status of the participant. The CDR-G ratings range from 0 (no dementia) to 3 (severe dementia)21, with a CDR-G of 1 representing the threshold of early dementia. Here, the analysis was limited to participants with CDR-G≤1 at initial visit. This helped to increase the reliability of the data regarding patient’s initial cognitive symptoms; ensuring they were reported when the cognitive symptoms are still early.

2.3 Initial cognitive symptoms and Neuropsychological tests:

For each participant, the predominant symptom that was first recognized as a decline in the subject’s cognition was determined by a clinician at their visit after interview of patient and caregiver and documented in the ‘NACCCOGF’ variable in NACC. Participants were characterized as primary amnestic (if memory was the initial symptom), executive (if the initial symptoms were executive or attention/concentration), language (if initial symptom was language) and visuospatial (if initial symptom was visuospatial) as previously published19, 20 (details in supplementary materials). Additionally when present and documented at last clinical visit, the details on the frequency of atypical AD clinical syndrome diagnosis (primary progressive aphasia, posterior cortical atrophy) is provided in the supplementary material. CDR-SB21 and MMSE22 scores were collected to characterize the degree of their baseline cognitive and functional deficits as well as progression of these deficits longitudinally over time. A core battery of neuropsychological measures was administered to all participants at each visit.26 Details on the detailed neurocognitive test panel is provided as supplementary material.

3. Statistical analysis:

Q-Q plots were generated for continuous variables to assess normality. A t-test was applied to compare normally distributed continuous variables. Mann Whitney U test was applied to compare non-normally distributed continuous variables. Chi squared test was conducted for categorical variables. Eta squared &gt;0.01 was considered a threshold effect size of significance for interpreting neurocognitive variable differences in this study.

Due to missing data in APOE ε4 carrier status (N=239) and education status (N=17), multiple imputation using fully conditional specification was performed, and 10 imputation datasets were created. Imputation datasets were based on all baseline factors included in the model, in addition to outcome measures. Linear mixed models adjusted for baseline CDR-SB, age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 status were used to evaluate longitudinal outcomes. Linear mixed effect models were fit primarily using a model that included the main effect for symptom, allowing the symptoms to have a unique starting value for the outcome. As a sensitivity analysis, models forcing a common starting value for the symptom groups were fit, to assess whether the slope differences observed primarily were related to differences at baseline. Both models included a random intercept for each patient. Models were fit for each imputation dataset and pooled according to Rubin’s rules. Results for the sensitivity analysis were similar to the separate intercept models and did not improve model fit, so they are not presented. A false discovery rate of &lt;0.05 was applied based on each parameter to control the error levels across pathology groups. Analysis was performed using SAS software (version 9.4; Cary, NC). All tests were two-tailed and performed at a significance level of 0.05.

4. Results

The study included 2426 participants (1190 with AD, 332 with LBP, and 904 with AD-LBP) with a mean (SD) interval of 5.5 (2.8) years from initial visit to autopsy. The demographics of participants in the cohort are described in Table 1.

4.1 Linear mixed models for CDR-SB total score comparing amnestic versus non-amnestic

Initial non-amnestic symptom group was consistently associated with a faster rate of decline on the CDR-SB compared to the initial amnestic symptom group across all three pathology groups. Figure 1, Table 2.

4.2 Linear mixed models for CDR-SB across individual initial cognitive symptoms

The initial executive symptom group had a faster rate of decline on the CDR-SB than initial amnestic symptom group among both AD and AD-LBP. The initial language symptom group was consistently associated across all three pathologies with a faster rate of decline compared to the initial amnestic symptom group. Initial language symptom group was also noted to have a faster rate of decline compared to the initial executive and visuospatial symptom groups in LBP. There were a smaller number of subjects with initial visuospatial symptoms, but a similar trend of a faster rate of decline compared to amnestic symptoms was noted in the AD-LBP group. Figure 2, Supplementary Table 1.

4.3 Linear mixed models for CDR individual ‘box’ scores

Initial language symptom group had a consistently faster rate of decline per year than initial amnestic symptom group among all three pathology groups across all CDR ‘box’ scores(memory, orientation, judgment, community, home and hobbies and personal care subdomains). Table 3.

Initial executive symptom group also had a faster decline in the memory, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care box scores in both AD and AD-LBP. There was also a faster decline in the orientation box score, but only among AD group. The initial visuospatial symptom group had a faster rate of decline than initial amnestic symptom group in the memory and personal care box scores among AD-LBP.

4.4 Linear mixed models for MMSE total score comparing amnestic versus non-amnestic

Initial non-amnestic symptom was consistently associated across both AD and LBP with a faster rate of decline on the MMSE compared to the initial amnestic symptom group. Figure 3. Table 4.

4.5 Linear mixed models for MMSE across individual initial cognitive symptoms

The initial executive symptom group had a faster rate of decline on the MMSE than initial amnestic symptom group in AD and a similar trend was noted for LBP. The initial language symptom group had a faster rate of decline than initial amnestic symptom group among both AD and LBP. The visuospatial symptom group had a smaller number of participants limiting analysis. Figure 4. Supplementary Table 2.

4.6 Neurocognitive profile results

Among participants with neurocognitive scores at the first visit, the comparative neuropsychology test performance profile of participants for each of the four initial cognitive symptoms were evaluated. A summary of neurocognitive results showing notable differences between the initial cognitive symptom groups is shown in Figure 5 and the comprehensive results for each pathology group is presented in Supplementary Table 3a, 3b, 3c.

Among the key results related to the four cognitive domains of interest; the initial amnestic symptom group had the lowest scores on Logical Memory delayed recall in all three pathology groups, and this differed significantly from other initial cognitive symptom groups most notably in AD. The initial language symptom group had the lowest scores on the Boston naming test and differed significantly from the other initial cognitive symptom groups in all three pathology groups. Related to executive function, the backwards digit span test had the lowest scores among executive and language initial symptom groups in ADP and ADP-LBP, while the amnestic group had the highest mean performance score. For tests of visuospatial domain, there were limited number of participants who completed the Benton line drawing test with only 7/183 patients able to successfully complete the test, however on the WAIS-R digit symbol which evaluates both visuospatial and executive domains, the visuospatial group had the lowest scores in AD and AD-LBP groups.

5. Discussion

In this neuropathologically confirmed cohort of 2426 participants, we found that, across all three pathology groups, initial non-amnestic cognitive symptoms relate to a faster rate of decline compared to initial amnestic symptoms, as measured by the CDR-SB scale. For AD and AD-LBP, the difference in annual CDR-SB slope between amnestic and non-amnestic was ~0.32 (Table 2). We can calculate that even a 10% increase in the number of non-amnestic participants in one of the arms of a MCI/ early AD dementia clinical trial, would increase the change in CDR-SB at 2 years by 0.064 points (i.e., 2 * 0.32 * 0.10) in that study arm. To put this in context, the primary end point CDR-SB change from baseline to week 78 in EMERGE and ENGAGE, the two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies of aducanumab in MCI/early AD dementia participants were −0.39 for high-dose aducanumab vs placebo (EMERGE) and 0.03 for ENGAGE27 and −0.45 at 18 months for the lecanemab phase3 trial 28. Given the relative size of CDR-SB changes in AD clinical trials, clarifying the nature of initial symptoms is an important variable in ensuring appropriately designed clinical trials. In addition to APOE ε4 status, initial amnestic or non-amnestic symptom is also likely to impact key dementia clinical trial outcomes.

Participants with underlying AD pathology (AD and mixed AD-LBP groups) who had initial executive symptoms had a faster rate of decline on the CDR-SB scale than those with initial amnestic symptoms. Participants with initial language symptoms, even when they did not meet criteria for an aphasic syndrome, had a faster rate of decline on the CDR-SB functional scale compared to those with initial amnestic symptoms across all three neuropathology groups. Given the current results, initial cognitive symptoms even when they do not meet atypical AD variant criteria are of clinical significance.

As cognitive symptoms localize to different regional brain networks29, it is likely that early cognitive symptoms in amnestic or non-amnestic domains could reflect underlying anatomically selective vulnerability in the corresponding specific brain region, despite the full conglomeration of atypical AD variant clinical symptoms not being present. This could potentially account for the similarities in clinical trajectories among participants in the current study with initial language and executive symptoms with those noted in the frontal18 and language17 variants of atypical AD, in addition to the similarities in clinical trajectory among amnestic and non-amnestic groups across the different underlying neuropathologies evaluated.

Notably, given that CDR-SB is an operationalized measure of cognitive and functional ability and not limited to language domain alone, it is striking that participants with language symptoms still had a faster decline in the CDR-SB across all three pathology groups. CDR subdomain analysis also supports the functional impact of initial language symptoms, such as was seen in participants with initial language symptoms having a faster rate of decline across all CDR ‘box’ scores (judgment, memory, orientation, community, home and hobbies and personal care subdomains) compared to those with amnestic symptoms. This may be a result of language’s proposed importance in supporting other cognitive domains including executive function.30

Participants with initial language symptoms also had a consistently faster rate of worsening on the MMSE compared to amnestic symptoms in both AD and LBP. Previous reports have noted a faster rate of progression on the MMSE in the hippocampal sparing AD subtype compared to the limbic predominant AD subtype.16 MRI studies have also noted that the most severe cortical atrophy was observed in the hippocampal-sparing AD, and the least severe in limbic-predominant AD.31 The larger cortical atrophy noted in hippocampal sparing AD subtype, and related tau burden distribution,32 may explain the more extensive AD regional brain involvement and subsequently a faster rate of decline in this group. As these previously published neuropathology subtypes are not defined formally by formal atypical AD criteria,8, 4 it is possible they share a similar clinical phenotype to that noted in the current study.

A faster rate of progression among language symptoms, given a higher CDR-SB score at baseline could also indicate regression to the mean, where the scores converge to a common level over time. It is also possible that despite initial amnestic symptoms, if the ability to observe, interact, and make decisions, involving aspects of visuospatial, language, and executive functioning is relatively better maintained, everyday functioning could be arguably maintained longer with a resulting slower rate of progression. The CDR-SB slope difference between executive and amnestic initial symptoms was not significant in LBP, unlike AD or AD-LBP (Supplementary Table 1). One possible reason could be that given the prominent early executive, attention and visuospatial deficits in Lewy body dementia syndrome, there could be some degree of overlap of these early domain changes even among participants with LBP amnestic presentation. This was noted in the LBP neurocognitive scores where the initial amnestic symptom group was not significantly different from initial executive symptom group on the backwards digit span and WAIS-digit symbol test scores, unlike AD and AD-LBP (Figure 5). Additionally, it is possible that given that the progression of neuropathology across different brain regions is often different in AD33, LBP34. There is a tendency for concomitant AD to obscure the typical clinical findings of LBD in mixed dementias35, with AD and AD-LBP sharing similar cognitive trajectories. Moreover, there could also be differences in the degree to which additional cognitive domains are affected after an initial amnestic presentation, as each neuropathology (AD or LBP) progresses. It is also noted that as MMSE evaluation often needs supplementation with more detailed testing to characterize changes in the domains of language, praxis and executive functions in the MCI stage36 , it could account for the differences between CDR-SB and MMSE slopes noted in our models. Future longitudinal Tau PET neuroimaging studies could provide avenues to test these possibilities, however this finding is still of significance in interpreting longitudinal data on the CDR-SB scale among dementia cohorts.

Limitations and strengths

The use of initial cognitive symptoms is limited by the clinical subjectivity of documentation by the clinician as it is based on patient and/or family history and not on formal neuropsychological testing or atypical AD diagnostic criteria. There could be further potential biases based on variance in clinical practices across clinical providers with differing expertise across sites. Despite their subjectivity, the format of evaluation is similar to many clinical trials and our robust results among a large number of autopsy-confirmed participants suggest clinical relevance of these measures.

Given the difference of an average of five years between age of onset and first visit, the participants were likely in MCI or early dementia given their meeting criteria of CDR-Global ≤1. The use of the CDR-G score also has its limitations, as some domains (e.g., behavior) are not well captured by the standard CDR-G and participants could be much further along in the disease course, which limits the accuracy of their history regarding their initial cognitive symptoms. Despite the large size of the initial NACC cohort, sub-stratification by initial cognitive symptoms also reduces the size of some subgroups. The sample size for non-amnestic groups is considerably smaller, particularly in LBP. This limits our analyses for some domains like the visuospatial. Severe co-existing vascular pathology was minimal and was rigorously reported, as noted in the supplementary methods, therefore was less likely to account for variability in clinical trajectories.

Another issue is missing data, which was addressed by multiple imputation using fully conditional specification by creating multiple imputation data sets. Additionally, less than 5% of the cohort was ‘non-white’ as documented in the NACC database. Given the strengths and biases of this NACC cohort (see supplementary materials), it is likely the current results are generalizable to other prospective research cohorts including clinical trials.

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that initial non-amnestic symptoms herald a more rapid cognitive and functional decline compared to initial amnestic symptoms, across multiple different underlying neuropathologic changes. These results hold importance in both clinical trial design and individual patient management among AD and LBD patients.

Systematic review:

A literature review was conducted using PubMed. Published research has so far not evaluated the impact of the nature of initial cognitive symptoms on future rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or mixed dementia (MD). Prior studies evaluating longitudinal clinical progression among atypical AD variants have been cited.

Interpretation:

Our results indicate that initial non-amnestic symptoms herald a more rapid cognitive and functional decline compared to initial amnestic symptoms in AD, DLB and MD. These results hold importance in both clinical trial design and individual patient management among dementia patients.

Future directions:

Our findings warrant future studies that replicate these results in other longitudinal dementia cohorts and clinical trial outcome scales. These findings also warrant consideration in interpreting longitudinal outcomes using CDR-SB and MMSE scales in dementia clinical trials.

Initial non-amnestic symptoms had a faster rate of longitudinal cognitive and functional decline on the CDR-SB scores than amnestic symptoms among Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body pathology and mixed neuropathology.

Given the relative size of CDR-SB changes in Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials, clarifying the nature of initial symptoms could be an important variable in ensuring appropriately designed clinical trials.
