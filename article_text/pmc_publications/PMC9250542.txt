Objectives:

To explore the heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) complexes in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and assess the relative risks of converting to dementia or dying.

Design:

Latent class analysis using 7,971 participants with MCI.

Setting:

Participants in the Uniform Data Set (UDS) from 39 NIH Alzheimer’s Disease Centers.

Participants:

Persons with a diagnosis of MCI at initial visit from each center and with either a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 22 or greater or an equivalent education-adjusted Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 16 or greater.

Measurements:

Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) administered at initial visit.

Results:

In addition to a subgroup with mild or no NPS (relative frequency, 50%), three empirically-based subgroups of NPS were identified: (1) an “affect” or “negative mood” subgroup (27%) with depression, anxiety, apathy, nighttime disturbance, and change in appetite; (2) a “hyperactive” subgroup (14%) with agitation, irritability, and disinhibition; and (4) a “psychotic with additional severe NPS” subgroup (9%) with the highest risk of delusions and hallucinations, as well as highest risk of all other NPS. Each of these three subgroups had significantly higher risk of converting to dementia than the “mild NPS” class, with the “psychotic with additional severe NPS” subgroup possessing a 64% greater risk. The subgroups did not differ in their risks of death without dementia.

Conclusions:

Our findings of three NPS subgroups in MCI characterized by affect, hyperactive, or psychotic features are largely consistent with a previous 3-factor model of NPS found in a demented population. The consistency of these findings across studies and samples, coupled with our results on the associated risks of converting to dementia, suggests that the NPS structure is robust and warrants further consideration in classification models of MCI.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) including disturbances of mood, behavior, and perception are common early features of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Although NPS were once thought to be restricted to persons with late stage dementia, they are now appreciated as a non-cognitive prodrome that can occur even in the absence of cognitive impairment. NPS are associated with an increased risk for dementia including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in MCI patients, as well as an earlier rate of institutionalization and mortality.1–5 In addition, associations between depression, anxiety, apathy, and irritability and elevated cerebral amyloid deposition have been reported in persons with MCI.6,7 In recognition of the importance of NPS as both an early neurodegenerative marker and a risk factor for future decline, research diagnostic criteria for mild behavioral impairment were proposed by the International Society to Advance Alzheimer’s Research and Treatment (ISTAART).8 These criteria require changes in behavior or personality beginning at age 50 or older and include one or more of the following: decreased motivation, affective/emotional dysregulation, impulse dyscontrol, social inappropriateness, and abnormal perception or thought content. NPS cause tremendous caregiver burden, with one study finding symptoms associated with a 3.5 higher level of burden in care partners of persons with either MCI or in those with normal cognition but subjective cognitive decline.9

While NPS are established risk factors for dementia, a challenge is to identify phenotypes that pose the greatest risk and the time frame for this transition. In previous work, we analyzed data of 1,655 research participants with MCI from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set.10 Informants completed the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) to assess behavioral changes.11 Cross-sectional neuropsychological, functional, and neuropsychiatric variables were entered into a latent class model, and a subgroup was identified with functional &amp; neuropsychiatric impairments (15%) but with no objective cognitive impairment. This subgroup was at least 3.7 times as likely as the ‘minimally impaired’ subgroup to have probable cerebrovascular disease. We subsequently found that this MCI subgroup was more likely than a ‘minimally impaired’ subgroup to exhibit a faster decline in global cognitive status, faster conversion to possible/probable AD, worse survival, and greater associated cardiovascular disease. At autopsy, this group was at a higher risk of a “pure” form of Alzheimer’s disease pathology or a “mixed” pathology consisting of both Alzheimer’s and cerebrovascular diseases.12 These prior studies highlight the heterogeneity of MCI beyond cognitive functioning alone, and the value of incorporating neuropsychiatric features to understand differences in trajectories and etiology.

Previous studies seeking to separate NPS into distinct clusters or latent factors in cognitively impaired individuals focused almost exclusively on people who had already progressed to full-fledged dementia rather than those in the earlier disease stage of MCI. These studies, of varying sample size, reported either two (negative/oppositional, anxiety/restlessness)13, three (mood, psychotic, frontal)14, or four (hyperactivity, affect, psychosis, apathy/vegetative symptoms)15 latent factors of NPS in dementia. In a confirmatory factor analysis, Liew sought to identify which one of the above dementia-based models of NPS provided the best empirical fit in an MCI sample and concluded that the three-factor model was preferred.16 In one of the few studies seeking to develop an original model of NPS clusters at a neurodegenerative disease stage earlier than dementia, Donovan and colleagues used a relatively small, mixed sample of older adults including participants with either MCI, clinically normal cognition, or subjective cognitive concerns (SCC) but no objective impairment, and found two latent factors (affective, psychotic).17

To the best of our knowledge, prior studies have not sought to develop a model of neuropsychiatric symptom complexes exclusively in MCI. Since the neuropsychiatric symptom substructure most likely changes during the course of neurodegeneration, the composition of NPS clusters in MCI might be different from the composition manifested in either full-fledged dementia or at an earlier preclinical stage of SCC. We thus examined NPS latent classes in a large national sample of individuals diagnosed with MCI at the time that the latent classes were empirically derived. Unlike our prior research10,12 which only partially incorporated information about neuropsychiatric features since a count of the number of symptoms on the NPI-Q was used, the present study included a more fine-grained analysis of symptom complexes by considering the contribution of combined symptom patterns.

In the current study, we employed latent class analysis of specific neuropsychiatric symptoms in a large sample of 7,971 MCI patients enrolled in the Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs), to establish neuropsychiatric subtypes that might be informative in MCI and their associations with the rate of disease progression or death.

Methods

Participants

Archival data used in this research are from the Uniform Data Set (UDS), a standardized assessment protocol maintained by the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center.18 Variables included neurocognitive, neuropsychiatric, medical, and health history information used for tracking the longitudinal course of neurodegenerative diseases.19 Participant written consent was obtained using forms approved by the institutional review boards at each ADC. Inclusion criteria for the current study required that participants had a diagnosis of MCI at initial visit from the clinicians at each center. Criteria used by all of the ADCs for diagnosis of MCI followed the guidelines set forth by an Expert Panel.20 These included: 1) the person is not normal or demented; 2) there is evidence of cognitive decline by objective measurement over time and/or subjective report by self and/or informant coupled with objective evidence; and 3) activities of daily living are intact and instrumental activities of daily living are intact or minimally impaired. Other inclusion criteria for the current study were non-missing information on the NPI-Q and years of education, and either a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)21 score of 22 or greater or an equivalent22 education-adjusted Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)23 score of 16 or greater. The analyses reported in this paper used data from 39 ADCs collected between June 2005 to December 2019 from 7,971 participants with MCI.

Measures

Neuropsychiatric features were evaluated using the NPI-Q,11 an informant-based rating of 12 behaviors including delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, apathy/indifference, elation/euphoria, anxiety, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behavior, nighttime behaviors, and appetite/eating. Each neuropsychiatric feature is scored as either absent or present if it occurred in the last month. The NPI-Q has been validated as a tool for the detection of NPS in patients with dementia, including AD, and has been widely used in clinical trials and studies. Higher total scores, indicative of greater psychiatric disturbance, predict conversion from MCI to dementia.24

Overall cognitive status was determined, prior to July 2015, via the MMSE21 and after July 2015, via the MoCA.23 Both instruments have items that assess memory, orientation, attention, executive functioning, visuoconstructional ability, and language.

Participants had follow-up assessments on an approximately annual basis, and the time from initial visit to conversion of dementia as well as time to death was recorded.

Statistical Analysis

Previous investigations13–17 of the structure of NPS in the cognitively impaired typically have relied on factor analysis,25 which assumes that the underlying latent variables are normally distributed. By contrast, we conducted latent class analysis (LCA), which conceptualizes the NPS structure in terms of discrete, mutually exclusive subgroups and generates the probabilities of an individual belonging to each possible latent class.26 The NPI-Q variables (each scored 1=present, 0=absent) were entered into the LCA model. Information was unavailable on 3 to 51 cases per NPI-Q variable. Missing-value cases were retained on the assumption of missing at random, i.e., the missingness mechanism was assumed to be independent of the participant’s missing variable scores.26 Model parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood using Latent GOLD 5.1 software.27 We objectively selected the number of latent classes by minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), a popular model selection criterion in LCA.25

To relate the NPS latent classes with either the rate of conversion to dementia or rate of death without dementia, we conducted proportional hazards regression analysis for the subdistribution of a competing risk27, based on the time (in years) from initial visit until either onset of dementia or death, whichever occurred first. Predictors in the proportional hazards regression model included the NPS latent class assignments and, to adjust for possible confounding, the following baseline characteristics: age (in decades, centered at age 70), sex, race (coded as black or non-black), years of education, MCI cognitive subtype (amnestic single-domain, amnestic multi-domain, non-amnestic single domain, non-amnestic multi-domain), history of cognitive impairment in first-degree relatives, number of APOE e4 alleles (or an indicator that APOE genotype was missing in 2,463 participants), smoking (in decades, 0=non-smoker), current alcohol abuse, currently lives alone, BMI (categorized using CDC guidelines: &lt; 18.5, underweight; 18.5 to &lt; 25, normal weight; 25 to &lt;30, overweight; ≥ 30, obese), AD Center, and the 7-point Composite Cardiovascular &amp; Metabolomic Conditions (CMC) scale (sum of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and stroke based on informant report, with higher scores indicating a greater number of vascular comorbidities).29 To take into account the uncertainties, or “fuzziness,” of the latent class assignments, we conducted proportional hazards regression analysis with multiple imputation, where we generated augmented datasets with imputed latent class memberships that were assigned proportionally to the LCA-based posterior membership probabilities.30 The resulting estimated hazard ratios, and their standard errors, were obtained using customary methods for multiple imputation; in particular, the standard errors took into account both within-imputation variance and between-imputation variance.31

Results

Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1. We fitted LCA models with each NPS variable rated as present or absent and with up to 5 latent classes. The 4-class model was selected as the best model due to lowest BIC value. Detailed results of the 4-class solution are shown in Figure 1. The four classes, listed from largest to smallest, had the following clinical characteristics: a “mild NPS” group (relative frequency, 50%) with comparatively few symptoms;

an “affect” or “negative mood” group (27%) with depression, anxiety, apathy, nighttime disturbance, and change in appetite;

a “hyperactive” group (14%) with agitation, irritability, and disinhibition; and

a “psychotic with additional severe NPS” group (9%) with the highest risk of delusions and hallucinations, as well as highest risk of all other NPS.

A conditional bootstrap likelihood ratio test,27 which examined the null hypothesis that the NPS structure consisted of four classes ordered strictly by severity, indicated that the NPS structure was not a unidimensional construct with different severity levels but instead was truly multidimensional (likelihood ratio chi-square = 48.70, bootstrapped p &lt; 0.001).

The mean follow-up time in the cohort was 2.8 years (range, 0 to 13.9 years). We examined the relationship between the four NPS latent classes and time to either conversion to dementia or death, whichever occurred first (Figure 2). Using proportional hazards regression with multiple imputation of latent class assignments and adjustment for baseline characteristics, we found that Classes 2–4 had significantly higher risk of converting to dementia than Class 1 (the “mild NPS” group) (Wald chi-square = 50.47, df =3, p &lt; 0.001), with Class 4 (“psychotic with additional severe NPS”) possessing the highest risk -- a 64% greater risk of progressing to dementia than the “mild NPS” group (Table 2). The NPS latent classes did not differ in their risks of death prior to onset of dementia (Wald chi-square = 1.25, df = 3, p = 0.74; data not shown).

Discussion

Our findings demonstrate the heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric presentations in persons with MCI, and the associations of these different presentations with progression to dementia. We identified four classes of NPS characterized by either mild or no symptoms, or consisting of primarily mood, hyperactivity, or psychotic features. The results indicated that these four classes of NPS did not represent merely different severity levels of a unidimensional construct but instead were truly multidimensional. Persons in the latter class who had psychotic symptoms including delusions and hallucinations along with other non-psychotic NPS symptoms had the greatest likelihood of converting to dementia. Unlike previous studies of NPS latent structure that incorporated samples already exhibiting dementia13–15 or that included a mixture of persons with subjective cognitive complaints, MCI, or who were cognitively normal17, we focused exclusively on an MCI population in order to identify subtypes in persons who were currently in a transition stage. Moreover, we used the different statistical methodology of latent class analysis rather than the factor analytic approach used in prior studies. Despite these differences in samples and methodology, our findings are largely consistent with a previous 3-factor model of NPS found in a demented population which identified NPS subgroups characterized as either mood, psychotic, or frontal.14 Moreover, similar to Liew,16 we found that an NPS subgroup possessing both psychotic symptoms and other NPS was at highest risk of progressing to dementia.

A limitation of the UDS dataset we used is that it is not community based, but rather consists of individuals who are motivated to participate in research. Moreover, neuropsychiatric symptoms were reported by informants rather than being based on direct participant examination. The shortened scale (NPI-Q) used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms lacks features of the original Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) including an interview format and ratings of frequency of symptoms, both of which could have provided more in-depth characterization. It may be that some participants were being treated for their neuropsychiatric symptoms, thus complicating assessments of the hazard ratios associated with progression. Although medication information is collected in the UDS, it is not a reliable indicator of presence or treatment of psychiatric symptoms, since patients might not have sought treatment, especially if symptoms had been present for only a month, or they could be taking a medication (e.g., Cymbalta) for pain management or another cause other than mood. In addition, the UDS dataset in the current study lacked racial diversity, as 80% of the sample was White, with only 15% African American/Black and 3% Asian representation. Therefore, the extent to which these findings generalize to other racial groups is unknown. Moreover, the UDS is a highly educated sample and our findings might not be generalizable to populations with lower education.

Recognition of the high frequency and diagnostic value of behavioral symptoms in MCI is incorporated in the ISTAART research criteria for mild behavioral impairment.8 The diagnosis of MBI requires that symptoms be present for a minimum of six months. Since the NPI-Q asks about symptoms in the past 4 weeks, transient vs. longstanding symptomatology are undifferentiated, and thus not all participants in our sample likely met criteria for MBI. Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap in three subtypes identified in our participants involving affect or negative mood, hyperactivity, and psychotic features with additional severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, and three of the five subtypes included in the ISTAART definition including affective dysregulation, impulse dyscontrol, and abnormal perception or thought content. The 4th MBI domain of social inappropriateness (e.g., lack of empathy, loss of insight) is not assessed on the NPI-Q, and MBI criteria separate decreased motivation (e.g. apathy) into a 5th domain, whereas we combined it with the affect or negative mood group.

Neuropsychiatric features traditionally have been considered a prodrome of neurodegenerative disorders such as frontotemporal dementia or Parkinson’s disease. In vivo evidence from some studies, however, indicates that they are also associated with the neuropathological cascade of amyloidosis and tauopathy in Alzheimer’s disease.6,7,32,33 Bensamoun and colleagues6 examined associations between NPI symptoms and amyloid deposition detected via position emission tomography in a mixed group of healthy controls, MCI, and AD participants. Analyses in the MCI subgroup indicated significant correlations between greater global and frontal amyloid deposition and increased anxiety. Krell-Roesch and colleagues,7 also using positron emission tomography, found that MCI participants classified as amyloid positive had the greatest risk for neuropsychiatric symptoms measured via the NPI-Q, after controlling for age, education, and apolipoprotein e4 status, compared to an amyloid negative MCI group and cognitively unimpaired participants with amyloid positivity. This was true for participants with or without psychotic symptoms. Higher values of cerebrospinal fluid levels of tau, phosphorylated tau181, and the ratio of tau/Aβ42 have been associated with greater increases in neuropsychiatric symptoms at a one year follow-up of cognitively normal older adults.33 Other studies, however, have not found associations between symptoms such as depression and AD pathology (amyloid and/or tau), leaving the replicability of such relationships unclear.34, 35

In conclusion, our findings and the results of other studies13–17 suggest the value of considering neuropsychiatric symptoms in addition to cognitive features in classification models of MCI. In previous studies,10,12 we found that a MCI subgroup with both neuropsychiatric and functional features was more likely to have probable cerebrovascular disease. In addition, brain autopsies confirmed the presence of a mixed pathology consisting of both Alzheimer’s and vascular diseases. In the current study, the self-report of vascular comorbidities was relatively low (out of 7 possible conditions, the mean endorsed number of conditions was 1.6) and we also did not have neuropathological confirmation of the etiology of MCI. Future research is needed to further understand the mechanisms contributing to the presence of NPS and their role in disease progression.

Highlights

What is the primary question addressed by this study?

The purpose of this study was to examine neuropsychiatric symptom complexes in a population with mild cognitive impairment and assess whether these complexes were associated with more rapid progression to dementia or death without dementia.

What is the main finding of this study?

In addition to a subgroup with mild or no neuropsychiatric symptoms, three subgroups were identified based on mood, hyperactive, or psychotic symptoms, and these three subgroups were at higher risk of dementia.

What is the meaning of the finding?

Our results suggest that the structure of neuropsychiatric symptoms warrants further consideration in classification models of mild cognitive impairment to better predict the risk of disease progression.
