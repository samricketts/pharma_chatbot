Introduction:

The purpose of this study was to determine if simple clinical judgements of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on imaging are associated with measurable cognitive impacts in otherwise cognitively normal older adults, if neuropsychological measures can predict those with WMH, and the frequency of low cognitive scores in those with WMH.

Methods:

Forty-four individuals judged as cognitively normal despite moderate to extensive WMH were compared with 50 individuals matched on age (mean of 83), education (college educated), and gender (predominantly female). Data was obtained from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center database.

Results:

The group with at least moderate WMH had lower scores on Trail Making Test A, verbal fluency, and digit span. A component score derived from these measures was a significant predictor of the presence of WMH, though only correctly classified 68% of participants.

Discussion:

Even in individuals free from other suspected conditions, clinically judged moderate to extensive WMH was associated with cognitive weaknesses for processing speed, working memory, and executive functioning. This shows that a relatively simple judgment of WMH burden is meaningfully associated with worse cognition. Implications and future directions for are discussed.

Introduction

White Matter Hyperintensities: Etiology and Epidemiology

White matter hyperintensitivies (WMH; also sometimes referred to leukokariosis) refer to areas of high signal intensity found in the white matter on brain CT or MRI (Wiggins et al., 2018). WMH as identified by imaging are extremely common in older adults, found in as many as 15% to 65% of cases presenting for imaging (Vipin et al., 2018; Wiggins et al., 2018). WMH can be present in many disease processes (Atri, 2016). However, in the elderly at autopsy, they are most often found to reflect areas of axonal degeneration and demyelination (Wardlaw, Valdés Hernández, &amp; Muñoz-Maniega, 2015) though the precise etiology of these findings has long been debated (Jing Lin, Dilong Wang, Linfang Lan, &amp; Yuhua Fan, 2017; Söderlund, Nyberg, Adolfsson, Nilsson, &amp; Launer, 2003). Recent studies suggest WMH may represent a complex interplay of cerebral blood flow autoregulation, venous collagenosis, hypoxic-ischemic changes and blood-brain barrier breakdown (Jing Lin et al., 2017; Marek, Horyniecki, Frączek, &amp; Kluczewska, 2018). Hypoxia-ischemia is a direct result from small vessel disease from stiffening of arteries, accumulation of atherosclerotic plaques, and amyloid plaque build-up which all can result in gliosis (Marek et al., 2018). The loss of blood-brain barrier is the result of endothelial dysfunction, causing damage via the immunoglobulin-G (IgG), complement cascade activation, and fibrinogen deposition which results in toxic effects on the nerve cells (Marek et al., 2018).

Impact of WMH on Cognition in Older Adults

Given the high prevalence of WMH in older adults, many studies have sought to evaluate their clinical impact. Among the largest of these studies is the Leukoaraiosis and Disability (LADIS) Study, which aimed to evaluate the role of white matter changes as an independent prognostic marker for the transition to disability in initially non-disabled patients 65-84 years of age (Pantoni, Fierini, &amp; Poggesi, 2015). LADIS demonstrated that severe white matter changes more than doubled the risk of transition from an independent to dependent living after 3 years of follow-up (Pantoni et al., 2015). Additionally, evidence from the LADIS study points towards the role of white matter changes in cognitive decline and worsened motor performance (Inzitari et al., 2007; Pantoni et al., 2015). Depressive symptoms and gait decline in the elderly have also been linked with cerebral small vessel disease and low white matter integrity (Pinter et al., 2018; Rosano et al., 2016; Rosso et al., 2017; van der Holst, H. M. et al., 2018; van Uden, Ingeborg W. M. et al., 2015).

In terms of specific cognitive domains, several studies have found a measurable impact of WMH on cognitive functions including information processing speed (Arvanitakis et al., 2016; Lange et al., 2017), executive functioning (Soriano-Raya et al., 2012), and working memory (Arvanitakis et al., 2016; Soriano-Raya et al., 2012). These latter findings are thought to reflect the interruption of inter and intrahemispheric communication by disruption of the long white matter pathways. This disruption in turn leads to cognitive and motor disability, as well as functional declines. However, the cognitive impact of WMH is a matter of some debate, with some studies finding variable or weak relationships with cognition (Lange et al., 2017; Söderlund et al., 2003) and others suggesting there is only an appreciable effect with extensive disease (Benson et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2015). Thus, while WMH seem likely to be related to cognitive status in older adults, precise domains and the magnitude of this effect remain unclear. Furthermore, the interaction with potential comorbidities, such as comorbid Alzheimer’s is frequently not addressed in these studies where it is unclear what conditions were ruled out before including participants in the study.

Research findings versus Clinical Realities

There also exists a gap between an ever-expanding literature on the cognitive impact of WMH in older adults and clinical practice. Increasingly, WMH studies utilize sophisticated computerized analysis of imaging to draw brain behaviour relationships from large epidemiological studies (Dadar et al., 2018; Harper, L., Barkhof, Scheltens, Schott, &amp; Fox, 2014; Price et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2011). While contributing significantly to our understanding of brain function and structure, in clinical practice such advanced quantitative imaging methodologies are not routinely available. This makes comparisons of individual cases to the extant literature challenging. Visual rating scales such as Junque Scale of Leukoaraiosis or Cardiovascular Health Study Scale for WMH are widely available (Harper, Lorna et al., 2016; Junqué et al., 1990; Kuller et al., 2004), but have been criticized for variable reliability amongst raters (Mäntylä et al., 1997) and for inconsistency of the rating scales across a number of demographics such as age and diagnosis (Rhodius-Meester et al., 2017). Furthermore, the ability of these clinical measures to be associated with common neuropsychological instruments is relatively unexplored.

A second gap exists between the measures utilized in these studies and the more comprehensive neuropsychological batteries utilized in clinical practice. While epidemiological or research studies may employ global mental status screens (Dadar et al., 2018; Sunwoo et al., 2014) or a few measures of attention and executive functioning (Dadar et al., 2018; Price et al., 2012; Rosano et al., 2016), neuropsychologists in practice are attempting to relate observed cognitive profiles on extensive batteries sampling a broad range of cognitive functions, using demographically adjusted norms in many cases. To this end, relatively limited work has been published to evaluate the impact of WMH on the more extensive cognitive batteries employed in the clinic. Knowledge of the broader cognitive profile of WMH burden, especially in the absence of confounding conditions, may help clinicians to more readily distinguish between the impact of incidentally noted WMH and other conditions that are being considered when performing differential diagnosis of an individual case.

Purposes of the current study

In light of the above, the purposes of the current study are to: Determine if neuropsychological performances can reliably differentiate between those with and without moderate to extensive WMH. Specifically, we hypothesized that the presence of moderate to extensive WMH as judged by clinician review of images would be associated with weaker scores on processing speed and executive function measures, with less noticeable impacts on naming and memory scores.

Describe the clinical impact of these differences by both effect size measures and number of scores that would be clinically considered low by practicing neuropsychologists.

Materials and Methods

Study Sample and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Data from the current study were derived from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) central data repository (https://www.alz.washington.edu/NONMEMBER/QUERY/datareqnew.html). Informed consent was obtained from participants at data collection; all current analyses were performed on deidentified data made available to researchers by the NACC. Procedures at individual sites were conducted in compliance with appropriate laws, guidelines, and institutional review. Data from 35 Alzheimer’s Disease Centers were evaluated for participants meeting our inclusion criteria. The data request included all individuals who completed a MoCA and the UDS 3.0 battery on their initial visit from March 2015 until the current data request in February 2018.

To define the current sample, we started by selecting individuals who were categorized as normal control participants at their initial clinical visit. (N=2182). The decision to categorize participants as a normal control participant was based review by study clinicians of all available clinical information for each participant as outlined in the Uniform Data Set 3.0 (see Besser et al, 2018 for a full description of methodology and variables for the Uniform Data Set 3.0). Briefly, this included a thorough history from the participant and when possible collateral reports, neurological exam focused on evaluating for features of atypical movement disorders or other focal findings, neuropsychological testing, and when available, MRI review (see below). This information was reviewed by formal consensus or clinical expert committees (93.6% of cases) or a single clinical expert (6.4%) to classify a participant as either being in the normal cognition group (the focus of the current paper) or to have a diagnosis such as mild cognitive impairment or various forms of dementia or mild cognitive impairment. The presence of psychiatric diagnoses was not an exclusion factor for classification as cognitively normal, though common diagnoses such as depression and anxiety were noted in only 5-6% of the sample. Though neuropsychological evaluation scores were included in overall evaluation of a participant’s clinical status, no rigid cut scores for inclusion were utilized at study sites. From the group of individuals classified as normal control participants, we excluded individuals missing neuropsychological data and a primary language other than English, bringing the number of participants to 1899.

From these 1899 participants, the next inclusion criteria for the current studywas the presence of an MRI evaluated by a clinician. These were available in a total of 592 participants: 549 with no significant WMH and 44 with significant WMH. Because of the relatively few individuals with significant WMH in the normal cognition group relative to those with no or mild WMH, we selected from the 549 individuals with no WMH on imaging a 50 person group matched to the WMH group based on age and education status resulting in the current sample. Demographic and descriptive information for these samples is found in Table 1.

Measures

Imaging Ratings:

At NACC sites, clinicians rate MRI images according to the Cardiovascular Health Study Scale WMH measure (Bryan et al., 1994) which is truncated into none (CHS scores 0-4), moderate (CHS Score 5-6) and extensive (CHS Score 7-8) rating. Using this three-level rating, we collapsed the study participants into a no WMH group and a moderate to extensive hyperintensity group given the relatively few members with ratings of extensive WMH burden. (Bryan et al., 1994; Kuller et al., 2004). Because the NACC data is collected at sites across the country, scanners, protocols, and methodology vary across sites.

Neuropsychological Measures;

All subjects completed the Uniform Data Set 3.0 (UDS 3.0) neuropsychological battery. The development of the UDS 3.0 neuropsychological battery has been described in depth elsewhere (Weintraub et al., 2018) and contains a number of tests commonly employed in clinical settings as well as tasks familiar to clinicians. Verbal episodic memory is assessed with the Craft Story memory task, which requires participants to recall a short story (44 total points possible) in an immediate and delayed fashion (Craft et al., 1996). Visuoconstruction and visual recall are assessed by the Benson figure copy and recall task (Possin, Laluz, Alcantar, Miller, &amp; Kramer, 2011), which is akin to a modified and simplified version of the Rey figure recall (Rey, 1941). Confrontation naming is assessed by the Multilingual Naming Test, a 32-item naming test (Ivanova, Salmon, &amp; Gollan, 2013). A non-proprietary version of digit span forwards and backwards is included. The trail making test, parts A &amp; B (Partington &amp; Leiter, 1949), semantic fluency for animals and vegetables, and phonemic verbal fluency for the letters F &amp; L round out the battery (Weintraub et al., 2018).

For the current study, we present both raw score performances as well as demographic (age, education, gender) corrected scores using previously published normative data (Weintraub et al., 2018). We further evaluated the number of task performances at least 1 standard deviation below the demographically corrected means as impaired to compare the frequency of impairments on each cognitive test. By definition, individuals in the sample were rated by clinicians as cognitively normal, but this did not preclude the presence of occasional low scores. We chose to evaluate the frequency of low scores at around one standard deviation below the mean to determine if any pattern of relative lower performances could be observed.

Statistical Analyses

For the primary analysis, neuropsychological variables were compared with one tailed (WMH &lt; no WMH group) t-tests. Evaluation of variable parameters suggested some non-normal distribution but no substantial inequality of variances. As the t-test is relatively robust to minor violations of normality, we report t-tests and effect sizes for raw and demographically adjusted z-scores. The decision was made to focus on raw score performances, and we submitted p values from the 13 t-tests findings to a false discovery rate analysis (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995) with a 10% false discovery rate chosen to help identify predictors for subsequent logistic regression. We evaluated these variables for intercorrelations which may produce multi-collinearity when used in logistic regression analysis, and used principal components analysis to extract factor scores for use in subsequent regression. We also compared the frequency of low scores with chi square tests.

Results

Demographic and clinical data for the sample is found in Table 1. There were more women present in the WMH group, though the groups were well matched on age, education and race. Individuals with white matter hyperintensities were more likely to report a history of hypertension (54.5% vs. 32%), have reported a TIA (18.2% vs. 2%) and more likely to show imaging evidence of a lacunar infarct relative to the non WMH groups (13.6% versus 0.0%).

Raw (Table 2) and demographically corrected scores (Table 3) from the UDS were analysed for differences between the no and moderate to severe WMH group. Consistent with our hypotheses, raw score differences were observed on semantic fluency for animals, phonemic fluency, trail making part A, and digits forwards and backwards, with trends (p &lt; 0.1) observed for figure copy, trail making B, and vegetable fluency to be weaker in the WMH group. False discovery rate analysis revealed that performances on animal and phonemic fluency, trailmaking A, and digit span differences were below the 10% false discovery point. The effect sizes for raw score differences were considered small to medium (trail making A, semantic and phonemic fluency, digits forwards) and medium for digit span backwards. After adjusting for demographic factors, phonemic fluency and digit backwards remained significantly different between the groups, with small to medium effect size (Table 3).

Conceptually there was a distinct possibility that verbal fluencies, digit span trials, and trails A would be highly intercorrelated leading to multi-collinearity as predictors in logistic regression. Indeed, Pearson correlations among these variables revealed statistically significant correlations amongst all the variables, which ranged from r=−.251 to r=.525. The one exception was the lack of statistically significant relationship between digits backwards and phonemic fluency (r= .185, p=.081). Given the likelihood of multi-collinearity with these as predictors, we submitted these five cognitive scores to principal components analysis. This analysis revealed one primary factor (Eigenvalue= 2.165), which explained 43.3% of the variance. Component loadings were all around .4 for each of the variables. Component scores were extracted and subsequently utilized in the logistic regression.

To explore if the component extracted could reliably separate the two groups, a logistic regression equation was created utilizing group membership as the dependent variable and the factor score as the predictor. The model was statistically significant (χ2= 10.28, p=.0013) and explained 14.4% of the variance (Nagelkerke R2) in WMH group membership. The odds ratio for the component score was .60 (90% confidence interval of .45 to .79), with the value less than 1 suggesting with higher scores (better cognitive performance) the chances of having WMH decrease. The model predicted group membership with sensitivity of 65.12%, specificity of 72.3%, positive predictive value of 68.29%, and negative predictive value of 69.39%. Overall, the model correctly classified 68.89% of participants.

The number of low scores (defined by a performance −1.0z when adjusting for demographic factors) were not statistically different between the groups when compared with chi-square. As this was a cognitively normal sample by definition, where low scores may have removed individuals from this group membership, we repeated the analyses with a more conservative definition of a cognitive weakness (−.5z). Still, the proportion of individuals demonstrating these low scores did not significantly differ between groups.

Discussion

In the current study, we evaluated the impact of WMH on a carefully selected group of older individuals free from clinically diagnosed neurodegenerative disorders or any significant cognitive impairment to determine whether clinically judged white matter hyperintensities would still meaningfully impact cognition. Our results suggested that commonly used instruments, particularly Trail making A, phonemic and semantic fluency, and digit span differ with small to medium effect sizes between individuals with and without moderate to extensive WMH. Demographic adjustments attenuated these relationships, but for phonemic fluency and digits backwards the findings held. Importantly, effects were not observed for measures of episodic memory or confrontation naming, nor did a less detailed measure of global cognitive status (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) differ between these groups.

These tasks all demonstrated a shared component of variance, likely a hybrid of attention, working memory, and processing speed. This component was a statistically significant predictor of the presence of moderate to extensive WMH even in this highly-selected sample. However, overall classification rates were modest using this factor, achieving a sensitivity of 65% and specificity of 72%, with an overall hit rate of about 69%.

These findings suggest that commonly used neuropsychological measures, particularly those with a speeded or working memory component, are affected by WMH even in the absence of other clinically diagnosed conditions. This adds to findings presented previously (Junqué et al., 1990; Libon et al., 2008; Price et al., 2012; Wiggins et al., 2018) and suggest that speed of information processing, attention, working memory, and executive functions are relatively sensitive to disruption in white matter pathways by WMH. However, the effect sizes are modest, classification rates are marginal, and these findings in isolation do not typically result in clinically significant impairments, defined as more scores at or worse than −1.0 Z or −.5Z cut scores below demographically matched controls, at least in this highly-selected sample.

An additional implication from this finding is that even clinically judged “normal” older adults may have WMH that cause them to differ cognitively from peers without WMH. This raises a point about how we determine who belongs in normative samples. Our findings suggest that MRI findings of white matter disease may add to the heterogeneity of cognitive scores in otherwise clinically normal individuals. Future work using a robust normative framework is necessary to determine if removing individuals with white matter hyperintensities significantly alters normative judgments.

For researchers, these findings suggest caution when utilizing global cognitive screening instruments such as the MoCA in studies which aim to judge the impact of white matter disease on cognition. Such measures, though designed to capture a range of cognitive abilities including executive functions, may lack sensitivity to subtle cognitive difficulties due to WMH in this high functioning group.

In terms of clinical practice implications, the current results that even in the absence of more sophisticated quantitative imaging measurements, clinically judged white matter hyperintensities can be meaningfully related to cognition. However, in clinical practice neuropsychologists frequently evaluate abnormality at the level of the individual relative to normative data, it is important to note that we did not detect more low scores (−1.0 Z) or even minimally weak scores (−.5Z) in individuals with WMH relative to controls. Thus, while differences are observed at the group level, the impact of WMH on the level of the individual remains difficult to detect. This finding is further supported by the overall limited classification accuracy of a model using 5 cognitive tests to predict group membership. Further research will be necessary to determine if other tools can be designed to detect these changes more readily.

Limitations of this study include the fact that cognitive data was used to define the clinical construct of “cognitively normal.” Thus, we were evaluating a highly-selected group of individuals who by definition had significant cognitive variability excluded. That we still found measurable effects even in this restricted sample suggests the robustness of these findings. A subgroup of individuals also demonstrated lacunar infarcts, and the sample size too small to determine the relative contribution of these findings versus the white matter disease on cognition. MRI ratings were not assessed for intra/inter rater reliability as well, which warrants further evaluation to ensure this rating scheme is a useful clinical tool. The groups were slightly different in gender distribution, though findings generally persisted even after controlling for demographic factors including gender. Self-reported cardiovascular history was collected, as opposed to chart review which may be more accurate. Furthermore, other important vascular risk factors may be missing from these forms. Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease were not available, so it is possible some participants had presymptomatic neurodegenerative illnesses despite the extensive clinical evaluation. Future work can build on this study by further expanding and validating clinical tools for neuropsychologists to judge imaging in their practices, and further work in mixed clinical samples to help determine the relative contribution of white matter findings to neuropsychological measures.
