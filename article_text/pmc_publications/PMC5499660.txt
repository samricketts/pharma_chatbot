Autophagy and lysosomal function are important for protein homeostasis and their dysfunction have been associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Increased immunoreactivities of an important lysosomal protease, cathepsin D (Cat D), are evident in amyloid plaques and neurons in patients with AD. The current study tests the hypothesis that deleting one allele of the cathepsin D gene (Ctsd) impacts cerebral β-amyloidosis in APPsw/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mice. Despite a significant 38% decrease of Cat D level in APP/PS1/Ctsd+/− compared to APP/PS1/Ctsd+/+ mice, no changes in steady state levels and deposition of Aβ were found in the brain. There were also no differences in APP processing, the levels of two other Aβ-degrading proteases, the levels of autophagy related protein, such as LAMP2, P62, LC3-I, LC3-II, and Beclin-1, or the markers of neuroinflammation, observed between the APP/PS1/Ctsd+/+ and APP/PS1/Ctsd+/− mice. Our findings demonstrate that in wild-type mice, Cat D protein levels are either in excess or redundant with other factors in the brain, and at least one allele of Ctsd is dispensable for cerebral β-amyloidosis and autophagy in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.

Graphical Abstract

Previous studies in vitro have suggested that cathepsin D (Cat D) may play an important role in β-amyloidosis and autophagy-related processes in the brain. Using a mouse model in which one allele of the Cat D gene was deleted, we found that Cat D haplodeficiency had no impact on the level and deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, which co-overexpress amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) with the Swedish double mutation and presenilin 1 (PS1) with deletion of exon 9. We further showed that Cat D haplodeficiency did not affect APP processing, the levels of other Aβ-degrading proteases such as insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) and neprilysin (NEP), the levels of autophagy-related proteins, or the markers of neuroinflammation. Our findings demonstrate that in wild type mice, cathepsin D protein levels are either in excess or redundant with other factors in the brain, and at least one allele of Cat D gene is dispensable for cerebral β-amyloidosis and autophagy in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.

Background

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) as senile plaques, formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed primarily of phosphorylated tau, and large-scale cortical neuronal loss leading to dementia (1). Mounting evidence suggests that the autophagy-lysosome system is critical for the clearance of the misfolded proteins, and dysregulation of autophagy-lysosome system may be involved in the formation of amyloid plaques and tau aggregates which occurs in AD (2–11).

Lysosomes play a major role in recycling damaged proteins and intracellular organelles through macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy. Such degradative functions critically depend on the cathepsin proteases (12–15). Cathepsin D (Cat D) is a major lysosomal aspartic protease (16), synthesized as a prepropeptide (~53 kDa); with the signal peptide cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum (~48 kDa), and further cleaved and activated in the lysosomes (~33 and ~15 kDa) (17). Cat D is expressed widely in the mammalian brains (18), and is up-regulated in affected brain regions in AD; this up-regulation is accompanied by autophagic vesicle accumulation (19–30). In humans, Cat D deficiency causes congenital neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (31;32). Cathepsin D gene (Ctsd) knockout mice die around postnatal day 26, with lethality caused by both systemic and nervous system defects including intestinal necrosis, seizures, neurodegeneration, and accumulation of protein aggregates (33–40).

Expression of a dominant negative Cat D in SH-SY5Y cells led to decreased Cat D activities in these cells with accumulation of endogenous α-synuclein (41). Partial loss of Cat D activity in Cat D haplodeficient SH-SY5Y cells resulted in a decrease of lysosomal function and increased cell-to-cell transmission of α-synuclein aggregates (42). Haplodeficiency of Ctsd resulted in mania-related behavior and stress-induced depression (43), and a compensatory increase of striatal dopamine, while dopamine and metabolites were depleted to similar levels between Ctsd+/+ and Ctsd+/− mice in response to sub-chronic exposure to neurotoxin MPTP (44).

In AD patients, increased Cat D in amyloid plaques and neurons were found, and it functions as a highly active endopeptidase (19–26). Polymorphisms in the Cat D-encoding gene CTSD have been associated with AD (45–47). Potential mechanistic involvement of Cat D as the β- or γ-secretase in the amyloidogenic processing of APP has also been suggested (48–50).

Whether a decrease of this enzyme could affect Aβ production or clearance was unclear (51;52). To address this question, we crossed APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice (53), a well-established mouse model of AD, with Ctsd heterozygous knockout (Ctsd+/−) mice (37), and analyzed Aβ deposition and levels of autophagy proteins at 6 months of age.

Methods

Animals

APP/PS1 double transgenic mice (B6C3-Tg(APPswe, PSEN1dE9) 85Dbo/J; stock number 004462) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). These mice co-overexpress amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) with the Swedish double mutation (APPsw) and presenilin 1 (PS1) with deletion of exon 9 under the control of mouse prion promoter and breed like a single transgenic mouse line (53). Ctsd+/− heterozygous knockout mice were in C57BL/6 background. APP/PS1 mice were crossed with Ctsd+/− mice to generate APP/PS1/Ctsd+/− and APP/PS1/Ctsd+/+ littermate controls. Genotyping of the mice was performed with gene-specific primers by PCR analysis of DNA extracts from tail biopsies. For this study, these mice were euthanized at 6 months of age for analysis of AD-related pathology. Mice of both sexes were used in this study. Age and sex-matched APP/PS1/Ctsd+/− and APP/PS1/Ctsd+/+ mice were analyzed. Littermates were used whenever possible. Experimentalists were blinded to the genotypes of the mice during the investigation to minimize potential bias. For each genotype, 8 to 9 mice (balanced sexes) were analyzed. Based on our published work with APP/PS1 mice (54)(55) and power analysis (SigmaPlot13.0, Systat Software, San Jose, CA), this experimental design allowed us to detect a difference of 25% between the two groups with 90% power at alpha = 0.05. All animal procedures were prospectively reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Minnesota. All efforts were made to minimize pain and distress.

Tissue Isolation and Preparation

Ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally injected, and anesthesia was confirmed by the complete depression of palpebral and pedal reflexes. After blood was collected by cardiac puncture in the presence of anticoagulant heparin, cardiac perfusion with ice-cold PBS was performed, the brains dissected, with the left hemisphere fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histological analysis, and the right hemisphere without cerebellum and brain stem snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for biochemical analysis.

Brain Aβ ELISA and immunoblot analysis

We prepared brain homogenates as described previously (54). Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels in carbonate soluble and insoluble (guanidine soluble) fractions were measured using commercial ELISA kits (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. For western blot analysis, aliquots of brain homogenate were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) membranes. Primary antibodies against the carboxyl terminus of APP (CT695; Invitrogen), Cat D (sc-6486, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IDE (insulin-degrading enzyme) (PC730; EMD Biosciences/Millipore, Billerica, MA), neprilysin (sc-9149; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IBA-1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1) (Wako, Richmond, VA), GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) (Millipore), Beclin (sc-11427, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2a (LAMP2a) (Abcam, 37024), autophagic adapter protein sequestosome/p62 (Abnova, H00008878-M02), microtubule-associated protein I or II light chain 3 (LC3-I or LC3-II) (Sigma, L8918) were used, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and signals developed by using the ECL plus Western Blotting System (GE Healthcare). The blots were then stripped and reprobed with mouse anti-actin antibody (MAB1501R, Millipore and Sigma, A5441) or mouse anti-tubulin antibody (T5168; Sigma) as loading controls. Immunoreactive bands were then quantified by Image J software.

Immunohistochemical analysis and quantification of Aβ deposition

We performed immunohistochemical analysis as described (55). The left hemispheres fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were sectioned at 50 μm using a vibratome (Leica Microsystems Inc), sections were stored at 4°C in PBS with 0.01% sodium azide before subjected to free-floating immunostaining with primary antibody 6E10 (Covance) using the ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) to detect Aβ deposition. A histomorphometry system (Image-Pro Plus, Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD) was used to quantify immunoreactivity of Aβ in the cortex and hippocampus.

Statistical analysis

Data are represented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Comparison between the two different genotype groups was performed by the Student’s t-test, with p &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Results

Decreased Cat D levels in APP/PS1/Ctsd+/− mice compared to APP/PS1/Ctsd+/+ mice

Breeding of APP/PS1 mice with Ctsd+/− mice produced mice that carry the APP/PS1 double transgenes and heterozygous deletion of the Ctsd gene. To verify the haplodeficiency of Ctsd gene results in decreased protein levels of Cat D in the brain, we performed western blot analyses in lysates of the mouse cortex at 6 months of age. As expected, the protein levels of Cat D, including the inactive precursor proenzyme (53 kDa), intermediate proenzyme (48 kDa), and non-covalently associated two-chain form (C-terminal 33-kDa heavy chain and N-terminal 15-kDa light chain), were decreased significantly by 38% in APP/PS1/Ctsd+/− mice compared with that in APP/PS1/Ctsd+/+ littermate controls (Figure 1).

Ctsd haplodeficiency does not alter steady state levels and deposition of Aβ in brains of APP/PS1 mice

To assess the effect of haplodeficient Ctsd on amyloid plaque load in APP/PS1 mice, we performed a quantitative histologic analysis of amyloid plaques after staining with human Aβ antibody (6E10). No significant differences in amyloid burden were found between the two groups of mice in both hippocampal and cortical regions (Figure 2). Consistent with these findings, there was no difference in the levels of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 between the two groups, which was analyzed by ELISA and quantified both in the carbonate-soluble and -insoluble (guanidine-soluble) fractions in brain lysates (Figure 3).

Ctsd haplodeficiency does not affect APP processing in brains of APP/PS1 mice

To determine whether Ctsd deficiency might alter APP expression or processing, we determined the steady-state levels of full-length APP (flAPP) and carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs) by immunoblot analyses. The results indicated that the level of APP was unaltered by decreasing the levels of Cat D (Figure 4). Furthermore, CTFα and CTFβ of APP, produced by α- and β-secretase cleavages, respectively, and the ratios of CTFα to CTFβ or the ratios of flAPP to CTFs also remained unchanged (Figure 4), indicating that Ctsd haplodeficiency does not affect APP processing.

Ctsd haplodeficiency does not influence the levels of two other Aβ-degrading proteases or the markers of neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice

As the net level of Aβ is controlled by the balance between APP processing/Aβ production and Aβ clearance, we determined whether Ctsd haplodeficiency influence the levels of other Aβ-degradation proteases in the brain. Two well-characterized Aβ-degrading proteases, insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) and neprilysin (NEP) (51;52), were examined by immunoblot analysis. The results showed that the levels of IDE and NEP were not different between APP/PS1/Ctsd+/+ and APP/PS1/Ctsd+/− mice (Figure 5), indicating that Ctsd haplodeficiency does not influence the level of these two Aβ-degradation proteases. Furthermore, we measured the markers of neuroinflammation, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for activated astrocytes and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1) (IBA-1) for activated microglia. The results showed that there were no significant differences in the levels of GFAP and IBA-1 between APP/PS1/Ctsd+/+ and APP/PS1/Ctsd+/− mice (Figure 5), indicating that Ctsd haplodeficiency does not affect the extent of neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice.

Ctsd haplodeficiency does not change autophagy related protein levels in APP/PS1 mice

To determine whether Ctsd haplodeficiency affects the levels of autophagy proteins, we performed immunoblot analyses of LAMP2, P62, Beclin, LC3-I, and LC3-II in brain homogenates from APP/PS1/Ctsd+/− mice and APP/PS1/Ctsd+/+ littermate controls. No significant differences were found between the two groups for these proteins (Figure 6), indicating that Ctsd haplodeficiency had no obvious effect on autophagy in the brain of APP/PS1 mice.

Discussion

Autophagy-lysosomal function is important for clearance of protein aggregates in cells. Our results showed that Ctsd haplodeficiency did not affect Aβ levels and deposition, APP processing, the levels of two other Aβ-degrading proteases, neuroinflammation, or autophagy in the brain of 6-months old APP/PS1 mice, indicating that either Cat D is in excess or redundant with other factors for these functions.

The initial suggestion of Cat D in serving β or γ-secretase activities used aspartyl protease inhibitor difluoro ketone peptidomimetic (56). Purified Cat D has also been shown to hydrolyze Aβ between amino acid Phe19 and Phe20 (49), potentially as Aβ-degrading enzyme. The involvement of Cat D in APP processing have been challenged by the study that Ctsd+/+ and Ctsd−/− primary hippocampal neurons infected with recombinant Semliki Forest Virus expressing APPswe (K595N and M596L) and APPv642I mutation exhibited similar APP secretory processing, production of C-terminal fragments, and secretion of Aβ, contradicting a potential role of Cat D in serving as an α-, β- or γ-secretase (57). Nonetheless, Cat D has been found to be decreased in monocytes derived from patients with AD, which exhibited decreased ability to degrade Aβ in vitro (58). Inhibition of Cat D or RNAi-mediated knockdown of Cat D in THP-1 cells also decreased their abilities to clear amyloid plaques from APP/PS1 mouse brain sections (58). Limitations of these studies include using cell cultures rather than directly observing APP metabolism and Aβ burden in vivo. Our study demonstrated that in APP/PS1 mouse brain at 6 months of age, Cat D protein levels are directly correlated with gene dosage, i.e. Ctsd heterozygosity results in ~38% decrease of Cat D protein level (Figure 1). Our results show for the first time that the levels of flAPP, CTFa, CTFβ, which are regulated by secretases, were not changed significantly in Cat D deficient APP/PS1 mice. In addition, we showed that Ctsd haplodeficiency does not influence the level of two other well-established Aβ degrading proteases, IDE and NEP, in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in the markers of neuroinflammation (GFAP and IBA-1) between APP/PS1/Ctsd+/+ and APP/PS1/Ctsd+/− mice. As glial activation is associated with the deposition of Aβ in APP/PS1 mice, the lack of changes in neuroinflammation is consistent with no change in Aβ levels and plaque load in these mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that at least one allele of Ctsd is dispensible for amyloid production and degradation, as well as Aβ-associated neuroinflammation, in the APP/PS1 mouse model in vivo.

Genetic inactivation of lysosomal Cat B (Ctsb−/−) has been shown to increase Aβ1-42, worsen AD-related pathologies in J20 hAPP mice and lentiviral delivery of Ctsb into hippocampus of J20 hAPP mice alleviates pathology (59). There is a possibility that Cat B is more important than Cat D in attenuating AD-related pathology. However further studies fully inhibiting Cat D activity rather than decreasing its level by 38%, and comparing Cat D and Cat B function in the same AD model will be necessary to compare and contrast the relative contribution of Cat D versus Cat B in APP/Aβ metabolism and AD pathogenesis.

A number of studies have demonstrated an increase of Cat D in AD patient brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (19–28), while a decrease in monocytes and fibroblasts (58;60). It was unclear whether Cat D in the brain or in non-brain organs/tissue plays a detrimental, protective or bystander role in AD pathogenesis. Future studies that compare and contrast decreasing Cat D levels specifically in the central nervous system versus in monocytes and/or fibroblasts may help resolving this issue. Furthermore, specific upregulation of Cat D levels in the central nervous system versus in monocytes and/or fibroblasts may also reveal whether more Cat D is detrimental or protective in AD pathogenesis. Analyzing whether Cat D loss of function or gain of function impacts AD pathogenesis in ApoE related, tau related or diabetes related models may also provide important information in disease mechanism-specific function of Cat D.
