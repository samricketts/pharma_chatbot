Introduction:

Older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) often face burdensome end-of-life care transfers. Advanced practice clinicians (APCs)—which include nurse practitioners and physician assistants—increasingly provide primary care to this population. To fill current gaps in the literature, we measured the association between APC involvement in end-of-life care versus hospice utilization and hospitalization for older adults with ADRD.

Methods:

Using Medicare data, we identified nursing home- (N=517,490) and community-dwelling (N=322,461) beneficiaries with ADRD who died between 2016–2018. We employed propensity score-weighted regression methods to examine the association between different levels of APC care during their final nine months of life, versus hospice utilization and hospitalization during their final month.

Results:

For both nursing home- and community-dwelling beneficiaries, higher APC care involvement associated with lower hospitalization rates and higher hospice rates.

Discussion:

APCs are an important group of providers delivering end-of-life primary care to individuals with ADRD.

pmc1 | BACKGROUND

Older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) often face burdensome care transfers at the end of their lives, such as hospitalization and intensive care unit admission.1–3 Such transfers may be of minimal clinical benefit for individuals with ADRD4 and can add unnecessary stress for both patients and caregivers.5 Better care coordination, access to palliative care and hospice, early recognition and treatment of acute illness, and advance care planning can help preempt unnecessary hospitalizations and improve comfort.6–8 However, chronic shortages of geriatricians and other primary care physicians with the skills and capacity to provide such care9 present barriers to quality end-of-life care for persons with ADRD.

In both nursing home and community settings, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, collectively known as advanced practice clinicians (APCs), provide an increasing proportion of primary care for older adults.10–12 APCs perform a range of services including preventative care and chronic disease management, acute illness treatment, care coordination, and palliative care.13–15 Care by APCs has been associated with lower acute care utilization for older adults in both nursing homes and the community;16–19 better pain management;20 higher family/resident satisfaction;13,21 and lower feeding tube use in nursing homes.13,21,22 However, there are several limitations of the existing literature on APC care delivery. First, in the nursing home literature, nearly all studies on APC care are in the context of a specific managed care plan or clinical care models16,23,24—studies on the overall fee-for-service Medicare population are limited. Second, many nursing home studies have used a facility-level measure of any APC employment as the exposure, rather than patient-level measures capturing the intensity of APC care received.16 Third, to date, no studies have examined APC care at the end-of-life.

This study represents the first comprehensive, national examination of the role of APCs in end-of-life care for individuals with ADRD enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare. We examined whether higher APC involvement in the last months of life was associated with two end-of-life outcomes: hospitalization within 30 days of death and hospice enrollment at time of death, among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with ADRD residing in nursing homes and the community during their final nine months of life. Hospitalization within 30 days of death is a marker of poor-quality end-of-life care, while hospice utilization signals carefully-planned and comfortable end-of-life care. We hypothesized that higher APC involvement would be associated with lower hospital utilization and higher hospice use at the end-of-life.

2 | METHODS

2.1 | Data sources

We used 100% 2016–2018 Medicare claims and beneficiary enrollment data linked with administrative nursing home data and geographic-level socioeconomic data. The Master Beneficiary Summary File includes enrollment information, demographic data, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse flags that allow for identification of ADRD and other chronic conditions. We used the Minimum Data Set 3.0—a clinical assessment tool used in skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes25—to identify nursing home care. We then linked claims and assessment data using the Residential History File (RHF) algorithm,26 which generates a per-person chronological timeline of healthcare utilization across settings. The RHF allows us to identify individuals residing in the community versus nursing homes during the last year of life. We used Medicare Part A inpatient and hospice claims to identify hospital and hospice use. We used Part B Carrier claims, which include dates of service, provider information, and visit type, to classify primary care utilization.

We obtained nursing home characteristics from LTCFocus27 and area-level characteristics from the Area Health Resources File.28 LTCFocus aggregates data from the Minimum Data Set and the Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reports to produce facility-level measures of ownership, size, staffing, deficiencies, payer-mix, and quality.27 The Area Health Resources File includes measures on local market characteristics including zip code-level health maintenance organization (HMO) share, county-level numbers of beds within skilled nursing facilities, and county-level numbers of home health agencies.28

2.2 | Study timeline and sample

Our study period was the final nine months of life. We used the first eight months as the ‘baseline period’ to identify residential location, baseline patient characteristics, and exposure to APCs. We used the last month of life to measure outcomes.

The sample included Medicare beneficiaries who died between 2016 and 2018 and were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare during the last year of life. We included decedents if they had a Chronic Conditions Warehouse incident flag for “Alzheimer’s Disease, Related Disorders, or Senile Dementia” prior to the start of the eight-month baseline period. This flag captures individuals with at least one inpatient/skilled nursing facility/home health agency claim or one hospital outpatient/carrier claim with ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes submitted across healthcare settings in the prior three years for Alzheimer’s, vascular, frontotemporal, or Parkinson’s disease dementias; as well as other less common forms and unspecified types of dementia.29 Prior validation studies assessing the performance of this algorithm to identify clinically-diagnosed dementia cases have estimated its sensitivity between 0.51 and 0.85, and its specificity between 0.77 and 0.92.30–32

2.3 | Nursing home and community cohorts

We classified decedents into two cohorts: nursing home and community. The nursing home cohort consisted of beneficiaries who stayed in a nursing home for the duration of the baseline period (excluding hospitalizations) with zero days spent in the community. The community cohort consisted of beneficiaries who were present in the community for the duration of the baseline period (excluding hospitalizations) with zero days spent in nursing homes. Beneficiaries who transitioned between community and nursing homes were not included in the current analysis.

2.4 | Outcomes

The two main outcomes were (1) hospitalization in the last 30 days of life and (2) hospice enrollment at time of death. We measured three aspects of hospitalization: any hospitalization (including inpatient stays, observation stays, or emergency department visits) within the final 30 days of life as a binary variable; the number of emergency department visits within the final 30 days of life, and the number of inpatient admissions within the final 30 days of life. We identified hospice enrollment with an active hospice claim at the time of death.

2.5 | Advanced practice clinician involvement

Our primary specification for APC involvement was a three-level categorical measure indicating the proportion of primary care visits delivered by APCs during the eight-month baseline period: minimal (less than 10% of visits provided by APCs); moderate (10–50% of visits); and extensive (more than 50% of visits). We created this measure using 100% of evaluation and management claims from the baseline period that had specialty codes from nurse practitioners (50), physician assistants (97); and generalist physicians (general practice (01), family practice (08), internal medicine (11), osteopathic medicine (12), geriatric medicine (38), and preventative medicine (84))18 and assigning beneficiaries to minimal, moderate, or extensive APC involvement. For the community cohort, we limited to claims encounters with Berenson-Eggers Type of Service (BETOS) codes for new (M1A) and established (M1B) office visits; or home (M4A) visits. For the nursing home cohort, we restricted to claims encounters with BETOS codes for nursing home (M4B) visits.

We developed this three-category measure of APC involvement by modifying prior claims-based approaches for primary care provider assignment used in the literature16,33 to be more applicable to the end-of-life period and care provided in nursing homes. Nursing home regulations require that an attending physician be designated as the primary care provider of record, so an APC could never be the sole provider in that setting. In addition, there are often multiple providers involved during the end-of-life period so we chose the three-category approach to allow for a more nuanced assessment of the APC role. The ‘extensive’ category represents beneficiaries who received the majority (&gt;50%) of their primary care visits from APCs, the ‘minimal’ category represents those who received no or only a few isolated visits from APCs (&lt;10% of visits), and the ‘moderate’ category represents those falling between those thresholds.

To further unpack the relationship between receiving care from APCs and the volume of primary care received on end-of-life outcomes, we performed a robustness check using a composite three-category measure, consisting of both volume and proportion of visits by APCs. We defined the composite measure as follows: Low volume: Less than eight primary care visits (i.e. less than one visit per month, on average) from APCs or physicians during the 8-month baseline period, regardless of APC involvement

High volume / low APC involvement: Eight or more primary care visits (i.e. one or more visits per month, on average) during the baseline period AND less than 50% of visits from APCs (majority provided by physicians)

High volume / high APC involvement: Eight or more primary care visits during the baseline period AND greater than or equal to 50% of visits from APC (majority provided by APCs)

We constructed this alternative treatment variable to test the robustness of the result obtained from our analyses using our APC involvement treatment variable. Because we found that APC involvement is positively correlated with the number of primary care claims during our baseline period, we wanted to understand whether APC involvement within the same high-volume strata made a difference in our outcomes.

2.7 | Covariates

For analyses of both cohorts, we controlled for beneficiary demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), dual-eligibility, years since initial ADRD diagnosis, 27 chronic conditions, an overall count of chronic conditions, baseline health care utilization (days spent inpatient, with home health services, and on hospice during the 8-month baseline period), and rural residence. A detailed list of all the covariates that we used for each model can be found on Appendix Table A1. We also controlled for zip code-level Social Deprivation Index (a summary measure of social risk factors correlated with healthcare outcomes and access by Butler et al. (2013),34 zip code-level share of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, and the county-level number of nursing home beds and home health agencies.

For the nursing home cohort, in addition to the covariates listed above, we controlled for nursing home-level characteristics including total beds, number of admissions, percent of residents with Medicaid as their primary insurance, profit status, and nurse staffing measures. We provide the complete list of covariates for each cohort in Appendix Table A1.

2.8 | Statistical analysis

The main challenge of estimating the effect of APC involvement on end-of-life outcomes is that decedents with different levels of APC involvement can be systematically different. The two types of selection issues that we need to address are: (1) the role of an individual’s underlying health status, and (2) the role of the individual’s residential location as the availability of APCs varies across geographic regions and across facilities for nursing homes. To address both of these issues in our models we (1) included individuals’ demographic characteristics, dual-eligibility, comorbid chronic conditions, and healthcare use during the baseline period (see Appendix Table A1); and (2) included rurality, availability of different types of healthcare providers within each residential county, residential zip-code characteristics (e.g. social deprivation and dual eligibility rates) that are known to affect access and quality of care, and state fixed effects to capture variation in regional health policy.

Using the above stated control variables, we applied a propensity score weighting approach suitable for multi-category treatment known as inverse probability weighting with regression adjustment (IPWRA). We report the detailed steps of this inverse probability weighting approach derived from Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)35 in Appendix Table A2. To briefly summarize the matching approach, we estimate the propensity scores using a multinomial logit model of three treatment categories onto our control variables (reported in Appendix Table A1), calculate the inverse probability weights, and estimate the model of each outcome onto the APC involvement categories using our weights. IPWRA allows us to weight our observations by the inverse predicted probability of them being in each treatment category after accounting for observable covariates.

Assuming that there are no major unobservable patterns affecting the treatment and the outcome, we claim that the IPWRA results get us closer to the truth than an unadjusted outcome mean comparison. While we cannot empirically demonstrate the assumption of no major unobservable patterns, we can provide an indirect test of the common support assumption needed for a causal interpretation35 by examining the distribution of the predicted probabilities of treatment assignment to each treatment level, by each treatment level, for our APC involvement model specification and our volume-based robustness checks. We provide the results of these tests in Figures A1 – A12 of the Appendix. To address potential selection issues involving geographic variation in APC involvement, we also estimated our models including zip code fixed effects.

3 | RESULTS

Out of the 517,490 community-dwelling decedents with ADRD, 308,654 (59.6%) received minimal APC care (&lt;10% of primary care visits); 109,563 (21.2%) received moderate APC care (10–50% of visits); and 99,273 (19.2%) received extensive APC care (&gt;50% of visits) (see Table 1). Across APC involvement categories, while decedents were similar in terms of age at death, sex, race, and number of chronic conditions, they were different across most of our covariates (see Table 1).

Out of the 322,461 nursing home decedents, 111,608 (34.6%) received minimal APC care, 81,442 (25.3%) received moderate APC care, and 129,411 (40.1%) received extensive APC care (see Table 2). Across APC involvement categories, while decedents were similar in terms of age, sex, race, number of years with ADRD, number of chronic conditions, nurse staffing, nursing home profit status, and overall nursing home star ratings, they were markedly different across most of our covariates (see Table 2). For our volume-based robustness checks, we present descriptive statistics in Appendix Tables A3 and A4. We similarly find differences in individual covariates across treatment categories for both cohorts. The marked differences in covariates across treatment groups, for each model specification, inspired our use of IPWRA.

We present our IPWRA results for our main APC involvement analyses in Table 3 and for our volume-based robustness analyses in Table 4. Overall, we find higher APC involvement associated with more favorable outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD during their final nine months of life.

For the community cohort, the percentage of decedents with any hospitalization during the final month of life for those with minimal APC involvement was 58.6%. Relative to those with minimal APC involvement, having moderate APC involvement associated with a 1.0 percentage point decrease [1.3%, −0.7%] in the adjusted probability of being hospitalized during the final month of their life. Having extensive APC involvement was associated with a 2.6 percentage point [−2.9%, −2.3%] decrease in the adjusted probability of being hospitalized during the final month of life. We also show in Table 3 results for counts of ER visits and hospitalizations during the final of month of life to exhibit the relationship between APC involvement and care volume outcomes during the final month of life. All hospital visit outcome rates were consistently lower for extensive APC involvement compared to the other two groups. In terms of being enrolled in hospice at death, the percentage for those with minimal APC involvement was 57.8%. Relative to those with minimal APC involvement, having moderate APC involvement associated with a 1.4 percentage point increase [1.1%, 1.8%] in the adjusted probability of death while enrolled in hospice. Having extensive APC involvement associated with a 1.8 percentage point increase [1.4%, 2.1%] in the adjusted probability of death while enrolled in hospice.

For our nursing home cohort results (presented in Table 3), we find that 33.8 percent of decedents with minimal APC involvement experienced at least one hospital visit during the final month of life. Having moderate APC involvement associated with a 2.2 percentage points decrease [−2.9%, −2.3%] in the adjusted probability of a hospital visit during the final month of their life and having extensive APC involvement associated with a 3.0 percentage points decrease [−3.4%, −2.7%] in the adjusted probability of hospitalization during the final month of life. Similar to the community cohort results, the counts of inpatient stays and ER visits were negatively associated with APC involvement. Regarding end-of-life hospice use, 53.4% of the decedents with minimal APC involvement were enrolled in hospice at death. Having moderate APC involvement associated with a 1.3 percentage point increase [0.9%, 1.8%] in the probability of being enrolled in hospice at death, while having extensive APC involvement associated with a 2.2 percentage increase [1.8%, 2.7%] in the adjusted probability of being enrolled in hospice at death.

Table 4 exhibits the results of our volume-based robustness checks and shows that even when assessing those with at least one primary care visit per month during their baseline period, those with more APC involvement (50% of their claims or more being generated by APCs) showed more favorable end-of-life outcomes than those with less APC involvement. While we still cannot make any causal conclusions based on our results, our findings signal a protective association between APC involvement and end-of-life outcomes.

As an additional check, we performed zip-code fixed effects analyses and share the results in Appendix Tables A5 and A6. While we found the same directionality of all coefficients from our main propensity score-based regression model, the magnitudes of the treatment effects were slightly smaller.

4 | DISCUSSION

This study represents the first comprehensive, national examination of the role of APCs in end-of-life care for individuals with ADRD who are enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare. We found that decedents with greater APC involvement in their care who resided in the community or a nursing home had fewer hospitalizations in the last month of life, and were more likely to be enrolled in hospice at death. Previous studies examining the association of receiving the majority of care from nurse practitioners compared to receiving the majority of care from physicians among Medicare beneficiaries residing in the community have generally found comparable clinical outcomes,19,36 lower ER visits and hospital admissions,18,19 and lower costs.19,37 One study reported improved clinical outcomes associated with receiving nurse practitioner care compared to physician care for vulnerable individuals who were disabled and dually eligible with Medicaid,36 while another reported that beneficiaries receiving the majority of their care from nurse practitioners compared to physicians were more likely to be frail and have complex clinical needs.38 While these studies did not specifically focus on older adults living with ADRD, they support the results of our study in that care from APCs may be advantageous for vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries.

The last months of life are a critical time for individuals with ADRD and their caregivers, requiring comprehensive care management and support to minimize burdensome care transfers such as recurrent hospitalizations or ER visits. Much of what we know about the care individuals living with ADRD receive at end-of-life comes from nursing home literature.1,3,39–41 However, an increasing proportion of this population is remaining in the community until death,42 a setting in which far less is known regarding the type of end-of-life services people receive.43 Understanding the contributions of different providers to the care received by individuals living with ADRD at end-of-life can inform strategic provider-patient assignments and optimal team configurations for both the community and nursing home settings.

While this study does not examine mechanisms for the observed association of APC care and favorable end-of-life outcomes, the favorable relationship is plausible for numerous reasons. Prior literature has found evidence of differences in practice styles between APCs and physicians:44,45 patients who received care from APCs had longer patient visits and received more educational services.46 Nurse practitioners are trained to practice in a framework of inter-professional collaboration and patient-centered holistic nursing care,47 including leading difficult conversations across the life continuum.48 Increasingly, physician assistants have been taking on roles in palliative care, and continuing education opportunities are available for them to gain specialized palliative care knowledge.49 Future research should identify the specific mechanisms driving these favorable outcomes. Furthermore, given the growing role of APCs in palliative care, healthcare leaders should invest in training for the growing number of APCs who care for patients nearing the end-of-life.

There are several limitations to our study. First, we conducted a cross-sectional study where we can only measure associations rather than a causal relationship between APC care and end-of-life outcomes. Second, though we adjusted for covariate imbalances between minimal, moderate, and extensive APC care via IPWRA, there are likely other confounders not observed in our data that are correlated with both APC care and end-of-life outcomes. Third, we faced limitations in our identification of ADRD with claims data. The CMS Chronic Conditions Warehouse ADRD algorithm is not perfect and with a sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.89 will identify some individuals with false-positive and false-negative dementia cases.30 Fourth, our study design required separating the treatment (1–8 months) and outcome (the final month) periods; we were unable to examine APC care in the last month of life, where interventions may be more intensive. Thus, if APCs provide a protective effect to more invasive procedures, our results provide a conservative estimate of APC care. Finally, our ability to measure APC involvement was limited by incident-to-billing, where some services provided by APCs are billed under the collaborating physician’s national provider identification number instead of their own. This means that we are likely underestimating the association of APC care and end-of-life outcomes.

Despite these limitations, our study is the first to provide a rigorous evaluation of the association between APC care involvement and end-of-life outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD. We found that higher levels of APC involvement were associated with favorable end-of-life outcomes. There seems to be protective factors of APC involvement in the care of Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD in both nursing homes and the community.

Overlap tests

The figures below provide indirect evidence of the common support assumption. We plotted the predicted probabilities (propensity scores) that each individual will be in each treatment level by treatment level. We use multinomial logistic regression and generate the predicted probabilities based on the coefficients we derived from the model. We see that all predicted probabilities are bounded by 0 and 1 as required by the common support assumption.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Systematic review: There have been several studies examining the association between care provision by Advanced Practice Clinicians (APCs) and overall healthcare utilization. Two studies focused on the Medicare population found that Medicare beneficiaries who had APCs involved in their care had lower acute care utilization. However, neither paper had an end-of-life nor ADRD focus.

Interpretation: We expected higher APC involvement in end-of-life to be associated with more favorable end-of-life outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD.

Future directions: Our results will inform workforce planning and care delivery strategies for individuals living with ADRD. In particular, our findings will allow stakeholders to better understand the implications of increasing or decreasing the use of APCs in end-of-life care.

HIGHLIGHTS

For both nursing home- and community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD, adjusted hospitalization rates were lower and hospice rates were higher for individuals with higher proportions of APC care involvement during their final nine months of life.

Associations between APC care involvement and both adjusted hospitalization rates and adjusted hospice rates persisted when accounting for primary care visit volume.
