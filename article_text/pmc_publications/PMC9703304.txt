Amyloidogenesis of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is intimately related to pathological neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease. Here we investigated the membrane damage activity of Aβ40 and its derivatives that contain mutation at the N-terminal charged residues using a membrane leakage assay. A model 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) phospholipid vesicle encapsulating the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein was used in the study. Our results show that the mutations of the N-terminal charged residues of Aβ40 significantly affect the peptide-induced membrane leakage. The results suggest that favorable electrostatic interactions of the N-terminal charged residues and phosphatidylcholine membrane surface are crucial in Aβ-mediated membrane permeation. The flexible and charge-rich N-terminal region may play a critical role in directing Aβ self-association on the membrane surface and in anchoring and stabilizing the peptide aggregates inserted in phospholipid membrane, which are closely related with membrane disruption activity of Aβ. The results provide new mechanistic insight into the Aβ-mediated membrane damage process, which may be critical for understanding the mechanism of Aβ neurotoxicity in Alzheimer’s disease.

Graphical Abstract


pmcINTRODUCTION

The aggregation and amyloid fibril formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides have been recognized for decades to be closely associated with early synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).1–2 Aβ peptides are produced through sequential cleavage of a transmembrane protein, amyloid precursor protein (APP), by β- and γ-secretases. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanism of Aβ neurotoxicity in AD still remains mysterious. Extensive studies suggest that interactions of Aβ peptides with lipid membranes of neuronal cells, and the subsequent Aβ induced cellular membrane damage might be responsible for Aβ cytotoxicity in AD.3–7 Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms of Aβ-mediated membrane disruption may be essential for unraveling the origin of Aβ aggregate toxicity.

The deleterious effect of Aβ on membrane structural integrity could be caused by Aβ induced membrane poration followed by nonspecific membrane leakage,8 specific ionic transport through ion channels formed by Aβ oligomers that would destabilize ionic homeostasis,9–10 or the membrane disruption as a consequence of mechanical pressure induced by fibril growth at the surface of the membrane.11 Despite these plausible mechanisms, the crucial interactions that drive membrane damage by Aβ remains elusive. Upon self-association on a membrane, the central hydrophobic core (L17-A21) and the hydrophobic C-terminal region of Aβ are implicated to be embedded in the lipid bilayer to interact favorably with alkyl groups of lipids.12–13 In contrast, the hydrophilic and charge-rich N-terminal region (D1-K16) that is reported to be disordered in oligomers and mature fibrils,14–16 is found to remain flexible and solvent-exposed in the oligomeric structures formed in a membrane-mimicking environment.13 Recent emerging studies, however, suggest that this conformationally dynamic region has a substantial influence on the properties of Aβ self-assembly.17–19 The N-terminal region of Aβ can influence the rate of the amyloid formation, and contribute to the enhanced stability of the amyloid fibrils.18 Recent simulation studies also indicate the importance of the contact in the N-terminal region in the formation of Aβ dimers.19 The N-terminal region has also been reported to play a crucial role in dimerization of Aβ peptide in a membrane environment.20 In general, electrostatic and nonpolar interactions are crucial noncovalent forces in protein–membrane binding and interactions.21–23 Ege et al. reported that the electrostatic interactions play an important role in determining the insertion of Aβ into model lipid monolayers by considering the peptide as a large ion.24 We recently reported that, specifically, the N-terminal charge-rich region plays a critical role in directing the adsorption of Aβ40 on a membrane bilayer, and mediating the rigidity and viscoelasticity properties of the bound peptide at the membrane interface.25 To provide mechanistic insight into Aβ-induced membrane damage process, in this work we study the roles of the N-terminal charged residues in Aβ-mediated membrane disruption.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

Synthesis of Aβ40 peptide and the mutants.

The Aβ40 peptide and the mutants were synthesized on a PS3 automated peptide synthesizer (Protein Technologies Inc., Woburn, MA) using a standard Fmoc protocol. The crude peptide was purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C18 reversed-phase column, and verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. The purity of the Aβ40 peptide and the mutants was determined to be ≥ 94% by HPLC analysis.

Preparation of monomerized peptide solution.

The Aβ40 peptide and the mutants were monomerized before being used, as described previously.26 In brief, lyophilized peptide powder was dissolved in an aqueous NaOH solution (2 mM). The pH of the solution was adjusted to 11 by adding 100 mM NaOH solution. The solution was sonicated for 1 h in an ice-water bath, and then filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore) and kept on ice before use. The concentration of the monomeric stock peptide solution was determined by the tyrosine UV absorbance at 280 nm (ε = 1,280 M−1cm−1).

Preparation of preformed peptide oligomers and amyloid fibrils.

An Aβ40 monomer solution of 10 μM was first prepared in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH = 7.4) by diluting the monomeric stock peptide solution with a concentration of approximately 300 μM. The Aβ40 oligomer samples were prepared using a similar protocol reported previously.27 In brief, the 10 μM Aβ40 solution was incubated on a rocker plate at 37 °C in an incubator for 2 or 4 h for preparing oligomers. The preformed Aβ40 amyloid fibril samples were prepared by incubating the 10 μM Aβ40 solution on a rocker plate at 37 °C in an incubator for 16 h.

Preparation of carboxyfluorescein encapsulating DPPC vesicles.

The carboxyfluorescein encapsulating DPPC large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared using a membrane extrusion method. DPPC powder was dissolved in chloroform with a concentration of 5 mg/mL. An appropriate amount of the solution was dispensed into a glass scintillation vial, and the organic solvent was evaporated overnight under vacuum to ensure removal of any residual chloroform. The sample was then hydrated by adding pH 7.4 Tris buffer (10 mM Tris) containing 50 mM carboxyfluorescein, and then vortexed vigorously and sonicated for 30 min. The DPPC LUVs were prepared by downsizing the vesicles using membrane extrusion (0.1 μm pore size). Extrusion was repeated to allow 21 passes through the membrane to ensure sample homogeneity. Unencapsulated carboxyfluorescein dye was removed by passing the DPPC and carboxyfluorescein mixture solution through a size exclusion gel filtration column (Sephadex G-50, 5 mm × 100 mm), pre-equilibrated with isoosmotic pH 7.4 Tris buffer (10 mM Tris). The final concentration of DPPC lipid in the DPPC vesicle sample was determined using the Stewart assay.28

Fluorescence measurement of carboxyfluorescein leakage.

300 μL of carboxyfluorescein encapsulating DPPC vesicles containing 50 μM DPPC lipid in pH 7.4 Tris buffer was loaded into a disposable fluorescence cuvette. The baseline fluorescence with an excitation wavelength of 493 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm was recorded for 3 min with 20 s interval. Appropriate amounts of peptide stock solution were then added to the DPPC vesicle solution, and the fluorescence intensity was recorded for 7 min. After that, 1μL Triton X-100 was added to fully lyse the DPPC vesicles and release all carboxyfluorescein dye achieving maximum fluorescence intensity. Runs were repeated 3 times with independent preparations of DPPC vesicles.

The leakage of the carboxyfluorescein dye in the course of the experiment was calculated using the equation below: Fractionofdyereleased=(It−I0)/(I100−I0)

where It is the fluorescence emission intensity of the sample, I0 is the emission intensity in the absence of peptide (baseline control), and I100 is the maximum emission intensity obtained after adding Triton X-100, a detergent which was used as a positive control to lead to 100% leakage.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement.

Aliquots consisting of either 10 μM Aβ40 monomers, 2 h oligomers, 4 h oligomers, or amyloid fibrils were co-incubated with carboxyfluorescein encapsulating DPPC vesicles containing 50 μM DPPC lipid for 5 min. The 20 μL mixture solution was adsorbed onto the surface of freshly cleaved mica (8 × 8 mm) for 5 min at room temperature. The liquid was wicked off using filter paper. Salts and unbound materials were removed by washing with 20 μL Milli-Q water for three times. The samples were dried overnight and AFM images were acquired in tapping mode using an Asylum Research MFP 3D AFM system with MikroMasch NSC15/Al BS cantilevers.

DLS Measurements.

Size measurements of the DPPC vesicles were performed using a model Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments, UK). The vesicle sample solution of 200 uL was added in a disposable ZEN-2000 optical cuvette, and the measurement was performed with triplicate repeats back to back.

Calculation of the charge and hydrophobicity properties of the peptides.

the pI values and the overall net charge of the peptides at pH 7.4 were calculated using the online peptide calculator, https://pepcalc.com. The calculator has access to parameters for the unnatural amino acid norleucine (Nle). In the calculation of pH and pI for Aβ40-M2, Lys was used in place of ornithine (Orn). The grand average of hydropathy (GRAVY) indices for the peptides was calculated using the online calculator, http://www.gravy-calculator.de. For the calculation of GRAVY indices for mutant peptides containing Orn or Nle, Lys and Ile were used in their places, respectively.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The membrane damage activity of the monomerized wild type Aβ40 peptide was first studied using a dye leakage assay. Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid in mammalian membranes. It accounts for approximately 50% of total cellular phospholipids and is one of the main compositions in brain cell membranes.29 The 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) lipid was used to prepare lipid vesicles in this study. Although the lipid vesicle composed of DPPC lipid only is not capable to mimic the sophisticated structural characteristics of cellular membranes, it provides a simple model for evaluating specific crucial interactions in the process of membrane-peptide interactions and peptide-mediated membrane damage. The DPPC vesicle with a diameter of ~100 nm (Figure S1) measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) was prepared to encapsulate 50 mM self-quenching fluorescent dye 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein in pH 7.4 Tris buffer. As shown in Figure 1, the lipid vesicle composed of 50 μM DPPC remains stable over the period of the experiment, indicated by the negligible leakage of carboxyfluorescein dye encapsulated in the liposome. The addition of 1 μM monomerized Aβ40 peptide leads to the quick release of the dye, reaching 14% leakage after 7 min. This indicates the damage to the vesicle structure caused by the peptide. Sciacca et al. recently reported that the addition of Aβ40 causes the leakage of the carboxyfluorescein dye encapsulated in model LUVs composed of total lipid brain extract with slow kinetics of several hours.30 On the other hand, the Aβ40-induced ion-channel-like pores can form in just several min.30 A fast pore formation by an Aβ25-35 fragment peptide with a time constant of less than 2 min was also observed in a POPC/POPG/cholesterol model liposome.31 Our results suggest that the presence of Aβ40 rapidly disrupts the integrity of the DPPC vesicles, either by forming large pores allowing the release of carboxyfluorescein, or possibly rupturing the structure of the vesicles completely. The subsequent addition of triton X-100 fully lyses the liposome and releases the encapsulated dye to reach the maximum fluorescence intensity (Figure 1). The addition of higher concentrations of Aβ40 peptide results in a more significant membrane leakage (Figure 1 and inset). For instance, the addition of 20 μM Aβ40 peptide causes a 60% leakage of the membrane with a remarkably faster rate. The results show that Aβ40 can break the DPPC vesicle effectively in a concentration-dependent manner. Membrane disruption by amyloidogenic proteins is proposed to go through a two-step process, with the initial formation of charge-selective pores of oligomers followed by nonspecific fragmentation of the lipid membrane during amyloid fibril formation.32–33 The fast leaking kinetics of the DPPC LUV observed suggest that the small oligomers of Aβ, rather than the mature amyloids, might be the major species accounting for the membrane permeation in this study. It has been reported that oligomerization of Aβ can happen quickly without a noticeable lag time in Aβ aggregation kinetics.26, 34–35

The DPPC vesicle disruption activities of the preformed Aβ40 oligomers and fibrils (Figure S2) were also examined. The addition of the Aβ40 oligomers prepared by incubating Aβ40 monomer at 37 °C for 2 h (refer to as early oligomer species) leads to ~13% leakage of the dye quickly, and the leakage gradually increases to ~23% after 7 min (Figure 2A). A fast membrane leakage of ~11% is also observed after the addition of the Aβ40 oligomers prepared by incubating Aβ40 monomer for 4 h (refer to as late oligomer species) (Figure 2A). The final percentage of membrane leakage caused by these oligomeric species, nonetheless, is lower than that with the initially monomeric samples (Figure 2A, 2B). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of the preformed Aβ40 oligomers shows the formation of spherical oligomeric structures of ~200–400 nm diameter (Figure S2). The membrane leakage results indicate that the small oligomeric species formed quickly in the initially monomeric peptide samples, e.g., dimers, trimers, tetramers, may have a stronger ability to disrupt the DPPC lipid membrane than that of the large spherical oligomers. The addition of the preformed fibril species prepared by incubating Aβ40 monomers at 37 °C for 16 h exhibits the lowest membrane leakage activity and slow membrane damage kinetics (Fig 2A, 2B). Together, these results are consistent with the lower neurotoxicity of Aβ amyloid fibrils than that of the oligomers.36–39 The imaging of DPPC vesicles without or in the presence of different Aβ40 species was also acquired using AFM. As shown in Figure 2C, the DPPC vesicles with a diameter of approximately 87 nm (Figure S3) were observed in AFM imaging. The diameter of the DPPC vesicles measured by AFM is slightly smaller than the hydrodynamic diameter measured by DLS (Figure S1). In the presence of additional Aβ40 monomers, a small number of clumps with a diameter of ~200–500 nm were observed (Figure 2D). Similar clumps were also found in the samples with additional Aβ40 oligomers or fibrils (Figure 2). These clumps may represent the aggregated Aβ40 as the morphology is comparable to that of the preformed Aβ40 oligomers (Figure S2). It may also be possible that these clumps may be formed by the re-accumulation of free lipids after rupture of the DPPC vesicles, or due to the formation of the aggregates that comprise both Aβ peptide and disordered lipids. The size change of the lipid vesicles after adding different Aβ40 species was also monitored by DLS. The addition of Aβ40 monomers, oligomers, and fibrils all resulted in the increase of the particle size (Figure S4A). This may be due to the presence of the Aβ40 aggregates (Figure S4B), or the formation of the lipid aggregates or the aggregates of lipid-peptide complexes.

Next, to investigate the mechanistic impact of the N-terminal hydrophilic region of Aβ on membrane disruption activity, we studied the effects of a series of Aβ40 analogs containing N-terminal residue mutations (Figure 3) on DPPC vesicle leakage. Mutation of the N-terminal charged residues alters the overall charge properties of the peptide (Figure 3B). For instance, the mutation of Glu11 with Gln (Aβ40-M1) eliminates the negative charge of the side chain at neutral pH. As shown in Figure 4A, this mutation significantly impairs the membrane disruption ability of the peptide. The leakage of the membrane in the presence of Aβ40-M1 is reduced to approximately 20% (Figure 4), only about half of that of the wild type Aβ40 (~38% leakage). Previously, we reported that the favorable attractive electrostatic interactions between Glu11 and the amine groups on the surface of a POPC bilayer play a crucial role in directing the adsorption of Aβ on the lipid bilayer.25 POPC and DPPC both contain a zwitterionic head group composed of a positively charged quaternary amine and a negatively charged phosphate. The amine group of DPPC in the lipid vesicle structure is likely more exposed to solvent while the phosphate residue is more buried in the inner layer of the membrane surface, making the amine group more accessible to interacting with molecules close to membrane surface via electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the tilt angle of DPPC lipid acyl chains in unilamellar vesicles is smaller than that in monolayers and bilayers,40–42 indicating a more tight packing of lipid molecules in DPPC LUVs. The tight packing of the acyl chains may also accommodate the charged amine group to be extended into the aqueous solution. Our results here demonstrate that the Glu11 residue is also critical in mediating Aβ-induced membrane damage. It is plausible that the favorable electrostatic interactions between Glu11 and the amine groups at the membrane surface may strongly favor the insertion of small oligomers into the membrane, leading to membrane leakage. The substitution of the Glu11 residue with Gln eliminates the favorable electrostatic interactions between the residue and the amine groups on the surface of the membrane, leading to the drastic decrease of the ability of membrane destruction. The substitution of Glu11 with an unnatural amino acid ornithine (Orn) residue, which contains a positively charged side chain at pH 7.4, may also interfere with the interplay between the residue and the choline head group at the membrane surface, accounting for the low membrane leakage caused by Aβ40-M2 (Figure 4).

The impact of the mutation of another negatively charged N-terminal residue Asp7 on membrane damage was also examined. As shown in Figure 4, the elimination of the negative charge on the side chain of Asp7 by mutating to Asn (Aβ40-M3) does not affect the peptide-mediated vesicle leakage significantly. This suggests that the Asp7 residue is not actively involved in critical membrane–peptide interactions that render Aβ-induced membrane breakage. The result is also in accord with our previous findings that the D7N mutation of Aβ40 shows a weak influence on the deposition rate of the peptide on a model POPC bilayer.25 As Asp7 is closer to the N-terminus, the high dynamic conformational characteristics of the residue may in part be responsible for its weak impact on peptide adsorption affinity on the membrane and the subsequent membrane damage. Besides, it has been reported that Aβ peptide can partially fold with fluctuating residual structures both in aqueous solution and after binding to lipid bilayers.43–45 This may put Asp7 in a position less accessible for interacting with the membrane. Together, these results elucidate the importance of the crucial N-terminal charged residues and their specific positions in Aβ-induced disruption of phospholipid membranes.

To further evaluate the roles of the positively charged N-terminal residues in membrane disruption by Aβ, the membrane leakage activity of Aβ40-M5, in which the positively charged Lys16 is mutated to Glu, was tested. The Lys16 residue has been indicated as one of the crucial amino acids in anchoring the peptide onto the phospholipid membrane.12, 46 As shown in Figure 5, the presence of Aβ40-M5 (5 μM) causes approximately 45% DPPC membrane leakage. This value is notably higher than that of the wild type Aβ40 (~38%). In comparison to Lys, Glu at this position may form favorable electrostatic interactions with the positively charged choline group on the DPPC vesicle surface, thus contributing to a stronger membrane disruption ability of Aβ40-M5. As illustrated in a proposed schematic model shown in Figure 6, together, our results imply the important roles of the hydrophilic N-terminal region in the early interplay of the peptide and membrane, and the peptide assembly-induced damage of membrane integrity that leads to leakage of the model lipid vesicle. Although intrinsically disordered, this flexible and charge-rich region may form transient and dynamic electrostatic interactions with the membrane surface, directing peptide adsorption on the membrane and regulating the intermolecular interactions of Aβ and subsequent self-assembly on the membrane surface. Importantly, the electrostatic-driven interactions of the N-terminal region and membrane surface may also aid membrane insertion of the aggregated peptide species and assist in anchoring and stabilizing the aggregates with the hydrophobic regions embedded in the interior of the membrane, although the N-terminal charge-rich region remains solvent-exposed. The hydrophilic properties of this region, therefore, may strongly influence the packing topology and structural morphology of Aβ oligomers, and determine the orientation of the aggregates inserted in the membrane, which may be key factors in the membrane damage mechanism of Aβ.47–48 In amyloidogenic protein-induced membrane disruption, small oligomers can form ion-channel-like pores, or cause membrane fragmentation by extracting lipids from the membrane through a detergent-like effect.49–52 The N-terminal region of Aβ may be actively involved in interactions with membranes in these membrane damage models.

Interestingly, when Lys16 is mutated to a neutral and hydrophobic unnatural amino acid norleucine (Nle) residue (Aβ40-M4), the mutant-induced DPPC membrane leakage is ~29%, lower than that of the wild type analogue (Aβ40-M4 vs. Aβ40 in Figure 5). It is worth noting that Lys16 is close to the central hydrophobic core “LVFFA” region, and replacing Lys16 with Nle significantly increases the hydrophobicity of the peptide (Figure 3B). The enhanced hydrophobicity likely impedes the interactions of the peptide with the hydrophilic membrane surface. Mutation of Arg5 to an oppositely charged Glu (Aβ40-M7) also leads to a stronger membrane damage activity in comparison to that of the wild type peptide (Figure 5), similar to what observed in the K16E mutation (Aβ40-M5). Likewise, mutation of the Arg5 residue to Nle also dramatically reduces the membrane leakage activity of the mutant Aβ40-M6. This is in agreement with the results of Aβ40-M4, indicating the remarkable impact of the hydrophobic characteristics of the crucial N-terminal local region in mediating the membrane disruption activity of Aβ peptide. Most recently, Sciacca et al. reported that intrinsically disordered proteins, e.g., amylin, Aβ, and α-synuclein may form chaperons with free lipids in an aqueous solution mainly through hydrophobic interactions.53 The formation of the lipid-protein complex can remarkably facilitate the insertion of the peptide into the membrane.53 Because DPPC has a CMC value of 0.46 nM 54, the formation of a lipid-peptide complex, in this case, might not be significant due to the low concentration of free DPPC lipids in the aqueous solution. Future similar studies using model vesicles of lipids with higher CMC values will provide insight into the roles of the N-terminal region of Aβ in this hypothesized “lipid-chaperone” mechanism during membrane insertion and disruption.

In the measurement of membrane leakage of Aβ40 and the mutants in this study, the fresh monomeric peptides were prepared and used immediately. It is likely therefore that the large oligomers and amyloid fibrils of the peptides would not be the major species during the short period of the membrane leakage measurement. However, considering the fast oligomerization rate of Aβ peptide,34–35 it is conceivable that the small oligomers may form and coexist with the monomers during the process of membrane leakage study. It has been indicated that the N-terminal region of Aβ still remains flexible and solvent-exposed in the small oligomers (e.g., tetramer, octamer).13 It is therefore probable that the dynamic N-terminal charged region in the small oligomers may also be crucial in the interactions of these oligomers and the membrane surface. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the mutations at the N-terminal charged residues of Aβ may affect the kinetics of Aβ oligomerization and the oligomer structures which could further influence the membrane permeation capabilities of the peptide. The potential structural changes of the early small oligomers caused by these mutations still remain difficult to be clarified at the molecular level. On the other hand, the duration of the lag phase of the peptide aggregation kinetics, the lag time, may be applied as a parameter indicative of the rate of the formation of the oligomeric nuclei during the aggregation. Intriguingly, our results show that there is no significant correlation between the lag time value obtained from the aggregation kinetics of Aβ40 and the mutants reported previously25 and the membrane damage activity of the peptides studied here. Instead, the N-terminal mutation-induced adsorption rate change of the peptides on the membrane surface reported previously25 correlates intimately with the mutation-induced membrane leakage change observed in this study. A faster adsorption rate of the peptide on the phosphatidylcholine membrane surface is generally associated with a stronger peptide-induced membrane leakage. Together, these results implicate that the membrane adsorption capacity and membrane leakage activity of Aβ may be closely correlated and are both substantially influenced by the N-terminal charge properties of the peptide. Future studies of the impact of the mutations of the N-terminal charged residues on the oligomerization characteristics of Aβ will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic role of the N-terminal charge-rich region in Aβ-mediated membrane damage.

CONCLUSION

In summary, we have investigated the impact of the N-terminal hydrophilic region of Aβ40 on the membrane damage activity of the peptide. Our results demonstrate that favorable electrostatic interactions of the crucial N-terminal charged residues and phosphatidylcholine membrane surface are important in the process of Aβ-induced membrane integrity damage. This disordered region with highly dynamic and plastic characteristics may play a critical role in directing Aβ self-association on the membrane surface and in anchoring and stabilizing the peptide aggregates inserted in phospholipid membrane, which are closely related with membrane permeation and disruption activities of Aβ. Inhibition of the interactions of the N-terminal region and membrane surface may be a useful strategy for developing therapeutic treatments to ameliorate Aβ toxicity.
