Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders pathologically defined by aggregated forms of tau protein in the brain. While synaptic degradation is a well-established feature of tau-induced neurotoxicity, the underlying mechanisms of how pathogenic forms of tau drive synaptic dysfunction are incompletely understood. Synaptic function and subsequent memory consolidation are dependent upon synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to adjust their structure and strength in response to changes in activity. The activity regulated cytoskeleton associated protein ARC acts in the nucleus and at postsynaptic densities to regulate various forms of synaptic plasticity. ARC harbors a retrovirus-like Gag domain that facilitates ARC multimerization and capsid formation. Trans-synaptic transfer of RNA-containing ARC capsids is required for synaptic plasticity. While ARC is elevated in brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and genetic variants in ARC increase susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease, mechanistic insight into the role of ARC in Alzheimer’s disease is lacking. Using a Drosophila model of tauopathy, we find that pathogenic tau significantly increases multimeric species of the protein encoded by the Drosophila homolog of ARC, Arc1, in the adult fly brain. We find that Arc1 is elevated within nuclei and the neuropil of tau transgenic Drosophila, but does not localize to synaptic vesicles or presynaptic terminals. Lastly, we find that genetic manipulation of Arc1 modifies tau-induced neurotoxicity, suggesting that tau-induced Arc1 elevation mediates neurodegeneration. Taken together, our results suggest that ARC elevation in human Alzheimer’s disease is a consequence of tau pathology and is a causal factor contributing to neuronal death.


pmcIntroduction

Synaptic dysfunction is an early feature of tau-mediated neurodegeneration (Selkoe, 2002) that strongly correlates with progressive cognitive decline (DeKosky and Scheff, 1990). The molecular mechanisms underlying tau-induced synaptic dysfunction are incompletely understood. Learning, memory retention, and cognition are dependent upon synaptic function. In order for synapses to function properly, they must maintain homeostasis by adjusting their strength and structure in response to changes in neuronal activity, otherwise known as “synaptic plasticity.” Synaptic plasticity requires dynamic changes in gene expression, protein translation, and recycling of neurotransmitter receptors through the processes of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) (MF and RC, 1994). While the molecular mechanisms governing synaptic plasticity are incompletely understood, many of the dynamic changes in synaptic structure and strength that regulate cognition and memory are known to be mediated by proteins encoded by immediate-early genes including the activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated gene ARC (Okuno, 2011).

Knockout of the mouse homolog of ARC, Arc, impairs long-term, but not short term, memory formation (Plath et al., 2006), suggesting that Arc is required for synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. ARC mRNA is expressed at low levels under basal conditions (Steward et al., 1998), but is rapidly transcribed in response to stimuli, including but not limited to learning (Montag-Sallaz and Montag, 2003; Ploski et al., 2008), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Ying et al., 2002), LTP (Guzowski et al., 2000; Rodríguez et al., 2005), and LTD (Waung et al., 2008; Yilmaz-Rastoder et al., 2011). Within neurons, ARC protein can be detected in postsynaptic densities, nuclei, and presynaptic active zones. ARC mRNA is trafficked from the nucleus to activated postsynaptic densities (Moga et al. 2004; Dynes and Steward, 2012) via microtubule-assisted transport (Fujimoto et al., 2004) and filamentous actin-mediated docking (Zhang and Bramham, 2020). After arriving at the postsynaptic density, ARC mRNA is either locally translated or degraded through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Giorgi et al., 2007; Farris et al., 2014). At the postsynaptic density, ARC protein interacts with components of clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery to regulate endocytosis of AMPA receptors (Wu et al., 2011) and filamentous actin binding partners to regulate dendritic spine density and morphology (Peebles et al., 2010; Newpher et al., 2018). Within the nucleus, ARC interacts with Tip60 (Wee et al., 2014), β spectrin (Bloomer et al., 2007), and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies at the periphery of constitutive heterochromatin to modulate transcriptional activation (Korb et al., 2013).

While ARC has a multitude of functions in synaptic plasticity that have been well-studied, ARC also contains amino acid sequences encoding a retrovirus/retrotransposon-derived Group specific antigen (Gag) domain (Campillos et al., 2006). This domain allows ARC monomers to form a virus-like capsid that encapsulates RNA and transfers this RNA across the synapse within extracellular vesicles (Ashley et al., 2018; Pastuzyn et al., 2018). Experiments focusing on the Drosophila neuromuscular junction suggest that synaptic plasticity is dependent upon transsynaptic trafficking of Arc1 capsids, as inhibiting capsid transfer between neurons disrupts synaptic bouton formation (Ashley et al., 2018).

Two key pieces of data point toward a potential role of ARC in human Alzheimer’s disease. First, single nucleotide polymorphisms within the 3’ UTR of ARC are associated with increased susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease (Landgren et al., 2012; Bi et al., 2018). Second, ARC protein is elevated in the medial frontal cortex of patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared to age-matched controls (Wu et al., 2011). In mice, tau knockout prevents stroke-induced elevation of Arc and consequent deficits, suggesting that stroke-induced elevation of Arc is mediated by tau (Bi et al., 2017). Despite these potential links between tau, ARC, and Alzheimer’s disease, studies in rTg4510 tau transgenic mice report overall decreased expression of Arc mRNA in the brain at 11–12 months of age (Fox et al., 2011), and no relationship between tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and differential Arc expression (Rudinskiy et al., 2014). The relationship between Alzheimer’s disease, tau, and ARC is thus an outstanding question in the field.

The ARC gene is transcriptionally activated in response to stimuli, and resulting transcripts are rapidly degraded by NMD (Giorgi et al., 2007). NMD is thought to regulate synaptic plasticity, as it controls the transient expression of ARC and other immediate early genes in activated synapses (Farris et al., 2014). We have recently found that transcripts of Arc1 are significantly elevated in brains of Drosophila models of tauopathy as a consequence of failed NMD (Zuniga et al., 2022). In the current study, we find that multimeric Arc1 species are elevated in heads of adult tau transgenic Drosophila, suggestive of increased Arc1 capsid formation. We find that Arc1 protein is elevated in nuclei and in neuropil in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila compared to controls, but does not localize to synaptic vesicles or presynaptic terminals. In a series of genetic experiments, we find that experimentally manipulating Arc1 expression or function causally mediates tau-induced neurotoxicity. Taken together, our studies suggest that tau-induced Arc1 overexpression drives Arc1 multimerization, nuclear localization, and neurodegeneration in the Drosophila brain.

Experimental Procedures

Drosophila genetics

Drosophila crosses and aging were performed at 25°C with a 12-hour light/dark cycle and 60% relative humidity. Drosophila diet was based on standard Bloomington preparation. Full genotypes are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Locomotor Activity Assay

Flies were collected in fresh vials on the day of eclosion and were transferred without anesthesia to fresh vials on days 3, 5, 7, and 9. The flies were aged to 10 days and the locomotor assay was performed in the afternoon to account for circadian rhythms. Flies were tapped to the bottom of the vial, and then the vial was laid horizontally over a 1 cm2 grid. The number of centimeters the fly traversed in 30 s was counted four times per fly, and 18 flies of each genotype were assayed (Frost et al., 2014).

TUNEL

4 μm slices of Drosophila heads fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin were utilized for TUNEL staining (TdT FragEl). Secondary detection was performed with DAB. TUNEL-positive neurons were counted throughout the entire brain using bright-field microscopy.

Western Blotting

Frozen Drosophila heads were homogenized in 15 μl Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and analyzed by 4–20% SDS–PAGE. Equal loading was assessed by Ponceau S staining. After blocking membranes in PBS plus 0.05% Tween and 2% milk, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate. Full scans of western blots are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. Antibody concentrations and sources are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Immunofluorescence

Drosophila brains were dissected in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes. After blocking for 30 minutes with 2% milk in 0.03% TritonX in PBS, brains were incubated in primary antibody in 2% milk overnight at 4 C. After washing with 0.3% Triton in PBS, brains were incubated with Alexa488- or Alexa555-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were washed again and incubated with DAPI for 2 min to stain nuclei. Brains were visualized by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 780 NLO with Examiner), and ImageJ was used for analysis. All images shown are a single slice.

Rough Eye

The Drosophila rough eye was scored using light microscopy. The rater was blinded, and semi-quantitatively assessed the eye for roughness on a 1–5 scale (1 being least severe, 5 being most severe). For representative fly eye images, adult flies were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol solutions, critical point dried, sputter coated, and examined with a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM 6610LV).

Results

Multimeric Arc1 species are increased in brains of adult tau transgenic Drosophila

Having previously found that Arc1 RNA is elevated in the brains of Drosophila models of tauopathy as a result of failed NMD (Zuniga et al., 2022), we first asked if Arc1 RNA is effectively translated into protein in heads of tau transgenic Drosophila. We utilized a Drosophila model of tauopathy that features pan-neuronal expression of tauR406W (Wittmann et al., 2001), a mutant form of human tau that is associated with a familial form of frontotemporal dementia (Hutton et al., 1998) (referred hereafter as “tau transgenic Drosophila” for simplicity). Tau transgenic Drosophila exhibit age-associated neuronal death, decreased locomotor activity, and shortened lifespan (Wittmann et al., 2001; Frost et al., 2014). Additionally, tau transgenic Drosophila recapitulate disease features of human tauopathies, including but not limited to tau hyperphosphorylation (Steinhilb et al., 2007) and synaptic dysfunction (Merlo et al., 2014). Our analyses were performed at day 10 of adulthood, an age at which this model harbors a moderate level of neurodegeneration that precedes an exponential decline in survival (Frost et al., 2016).

We first validated the Arc1 antibody (Ashley et al., 2018) in Drosophila with pan-neuronal genetic overexpression of Arc1 (Arc1OE). In addition to the expected increase in monomeric Arc1 protein levels in heads of Drosophila overexpressing Arc1 (Fig. 1A), we observed increased levels of high molecular weight Arc1 species in Arc1OE flies, consistent with the resistance of Arc1 capsids to heat-based denaturation (Pastuzyn et al., 2018). Indeed, we find that both monomeric (Fig. 1B) and multimeric (Fig. 1C) Arc1 species are significantly elevated in the context of pan-neuronal Arc1 overexpression. Consistent with tau-induced Arc1 elevation at the transcript level (Zuniga et al., 2022), we also observe an increase in Arc1 protein in total head lysates of tau transgenic Drosophila compared to controls (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, quantification of Arc1 protein indicates that monomeric levels of Arc1 are equivalent between control and tau transgenic Drosophila (Fig. 1E), but that multimeric Arc1 species are elevated in the context of tauopathy (Fig. 1F).

Elevation of Arc1 in phospho-tau positive neurons of the Drosophila brain

Having established that multimeric Arc1 species are elevated in heads of tau transgenic Drosophila, we next visualized Arc1 protein directly in the Drosophila brain. Consistent with our Western-blotting based analysis, we find that overall levels of Arc1 protein are increased in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila compared to control based on immunofluorescence (Fig. 2A, B). We next determined if neurons with elevated levels of Arc1 also contain disease-associated tau species. In disease states, microtubule-bound tau becomes aberrantly phosphorylated and detaches from microtubules (Orr et al., 2017). Aberrantly phosphorylated species of tau protein are associated with synaptic dysfunction, synaptic loss, and neurodegeneration (Wittmann et al., 2001; Yoshiyama et al., 2007; Rocher et al., 2010). We subjected Drosophila brains to immunofluorescence-based detection of aberrantly phosphorylated tau (phospho-tau) species using the AT8 antibody, which recognizes tau phosphorylation at serine 202 and threonine 205 (Biernat et al., 1992), and Arc1 (Fig. 2C). We find a significant correlation between elevation of Arc1 and presence of phospho-tau in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila (Fig. 2D).

Arc1 is elevated in nuclei and neuropil of the adult tau transgenic Drosophila brain

As Arc1 functions within the nucleus and at synapses (Chowdhury et al., 2006; Bloomer et al., 2007), we next determined the localization of Arc1 enrichment in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila. Based on immunofluorescence, Arc1 appears to be enriched within nuclei of tau transgenic Drosophila (Fig. 3A). Indeed, three-dimensional confocal imaging of Arc1 and DAPI in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila indicates that Arc1 is present within nuclei (Fig. 3B, Supplemental Movie 1). We next quantified Arc1 levels in DAPI-positive nuclei of the Drosophila brain, and find that nuclear Arc1 is significantly elevated in transgenic Drosophila compared to controls (Fig. 3C).

Taking a similar approach, we next focused on Arc1 within the neuropil of control and tau transgenic Drosophila, a region of high synaptic density. We find that overall levels of Arc1 are elevated in the neuropil of tau transgenic Drosophila compared to control (Fig. 3D). To determine if Arc1 is present within synaptic vesicles of tau transgenic Drosophila, we co-stained brains with antibodies detecting Arc1 and synaptotagmin. Surprisingly, we do not observe colocalization of Arc1 and synaptotagmin in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila (Fig. 3E) despite enrichment and punctate appearance of Arc1 within the neuropil. Similarly, we do not observe colocalization of Arc1 with cysteine string protein (CSP), which labels the presynaptic active zone (Fig. 3F).

Genetic manipulation of Arc1 modifies tau-induced neurotoxicity

Having demonstrated that multimeric Arc1 species are elevated in heads of tau transgenic Drosophila and that Arc1 accumulates in the nucleus and neuropil of this model, we next asked if Arc1 elevation causally mediates tau-induced neurotoxicity using a series of Arc1-variable Drosophila genotypes. We began by quantifying monomeric and multimeric Arc1 species in tau transgenic Drosophila in the context of pan-neuronal Arc1 overexpression, a heterozygous Arc1 loss-of-function allele (Arc1esm113), and pan-neuronal Arc1 knockdown (Fig. 4A). We find that Arc1 overexpression significant elevates monomeric Arc1 levels, while loss of Arc1 function and Arc1 RNAi significantly reduce monomeric Arc1 in total head lysates of tau transgenic Drosophila compared to tau expressed alone (Fig. 4B). While Arc1 overexpression significantly increases multimeric Arc1 species in tau transgenic Drosophila, neither loss of Arc1 function nor RNAi-mediated Arc1 reduction significantly reduce multimeric Arc1 species compared to tau expressed alone (Fig. 4C).

We next utilized several well-established assays to quantify tau-induced neurotoxicity in the context of Arc1 genetic manipulation. We first determined the effect of each Arc1 variable genotype on the tau-induced rough eye phenotype. While neither Arc1OE nor Arc1esm113 alters eye roughness compared to tau alone, we find that Arc1RNAi significantly reduces the tau-induced rough eye (Fig. 4D). At day ten of adulthood, tau transgenic Drosophila have approximately 50% reduced locomotor activity compared to control flies (Frost et al., 2014). While further elevation of Arc1 does not exacerbate the tau-induced locomotor deficit, we find that both loss of Arc1 function and Arc1 knockdown suppress the tau-induced locomotor deficit of tau transgenic Drosophila (Fig. 4E). To next determine the extent of tau-induced neurodegeneration in response to Arc1 genetic manipulation in the brain directly, we quantified overall cell death using Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL), which detects apoptosis-induced DNA double-strand breaks. We find that heterozygous loss of Arc1 function and pan-neuronal Arc1 knockdown significantly suppress tau-induced neurodegeneration. Again, we do not detect an effect of further elevating Arc1 levels in tau transgenic Drosophila (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these data suggest that reduction of Arc1 function in tau transgenic Drosophila suppresses tau-induced death of photoreceptor neurons, enhances overall organismal fitness, and decreases neurodegeneration in the Drosophila brain.

Discussion

We have identified tau-induced Arc1 overexpression as a novel mediator of neurodegeneration in Drosophila. We find increased levels of high molecular weight forms of Arc1 in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila, suggesting that Arc1 capsid formation is increased in the context of tauopathy. We also observe that Arc1 is enriched within nuclei and neuropil of tau transgenic Drosophila brains but does not localize to synaptic vesicles. Using several established readouts of neurotoxicity, we find that Arc1 dysregulation causally mediates tau-induced neurodegeneration.

In contrast to the human Alzheimer’s disease brain and our current findings in tau transgenic Drosophila, previous rigorously-performed studies in rTg4510 tau transgenic mice report downregulation of Arc transcripts in the brain at 11 months (Rudinskiy et al., 2014). Neurodegeneration and tau pathology are accelerated within rTg4510 mice such that significant neuronal loss can be detected in the hippocampus as early as 5.5 months (Ramsden et al., 2005; SantaCruz et al., 2005). As our analyses of Arc1 in tau transgenic Drosophila at day 10 of adulthood reflects a rather early timepoint along the course of neurodegeneration in this particular model, we speculate that the discrepancy between rTg4510 mice and tau transgenic Drosophila may result from analyses at different disease stages. Alternatively, it is now known that Fgf14, Vipr2, Ptprn2, Wdr60, and Esyt2 are disrupted in the rTg4510 model due to insertion of the human MAPT transgene, and that disruption of these genes contribute to neurodegeneration (Gamache et al., 2019). It is also of course possible that our conflicting results simply reflect differences in the vertebrate versus invertebrate systems, although elevation of ARC in human Alzheimer’s disease (Wu et al., 2011) argues against this scenario.

Mechanistic insights into the biology underlying tau-induced Arc1 elevation come from our previous investigations into the effects of tau on NMD (Zuniga et al., 2022), a cellular surveillance mechanism that was originally found to degrade error-containing RNAs (Losson and Lacroute, 1979). In addition to targeting error-containing RNAs, NMD is now known to regulate the steady state transcript levels of immediate early and activity-dependent genes, including ARC (Lykke-Andersen and Jensen, 2015). As a posttranscriptional regulator of Arc1, studies in Drosophila indicated that NMD is critical for transient control over increased Arc1 protein levels in response to external stimuli (Farris et al., 2014). While NMD is fine-tuned to efficiently regulate immediate early and activity-dependent genes, previous studies report that depletion of NMD factors increases transcript levels of 5–10% of “normal” mRNAs (Lelivelt and Culbertson, 1999; He et al., 2003; Mendell et al., 2004; Ge and Porse, 2014). In the context of tauopathy, we find that the tau-induced increase in Arc1 mRNA is a result of failed Arc1 clearance via NMD (Zuniga et al., 2022). As we reported an overall blunting of NMD in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila, it will be of interest in the future to investigate the full scope of NMD targets that may influence synaptic plasticity in the context of tauopathy.

The capsid-encoding Gag domain of Arc protein is structurally similar to the Gag domain of exogenous retroviruses and endogenous retroviruses, a class of retrotransposons that are thought to have derived from viral infections over the course of evolution (Grandi and Tramontano, 2018). In rats, the Arc viral-like Gag domain facilitates the assembly of Arc into highly stable virus-like capsids (Pastuzyn et al., 2018) that are resistant to heat-based denaturation (Pastuzyn et al., 2018). In Drosophila, formation of Arc1 capsids and subsequent transfer of Arc1 mRNA-containing capsids across synapses is proposed to mediate communication at the neuromuscular junction (Ashley et al., 2018). We have previously analyzed retrotransposon transcript levels in RNA sequencing data from postmortem human brains with Alzheimer’s disease or progressive supranuclear palsy, a “primary” tauopathy. This study revealed a significant upregulation of several human endogenous retroviruses in the disease context (Sun et al., 2018). While human endogenous retroviruses are thought to act cell autonomously due to lack of the envelope (env) domain that facilitates cell to cell transfer, Gag protein and RNA encoded by the Drosophila copia endogenous retrovirus are enriched in S2 cell-derived extracellular vesicles (Ashley et al., 2018). These findings suggest that endogenous retroviruses could commandeer RNA transport mechanisms between cells. While it is known that mammalian Arc and Drosophila Arc1 capsids package their own mRNA in a manner consistent with other retrovirus-derived Gag proteins (Ashley et al., 2018; Pastuzyn et al., 2018), it is not currently known whether Arc capsids effectively encapsulate non-Arc RNAs. Our study lays the groundwork for future studies investigating Arc1 capsid formation, the contents of such capsids, the consequences of Arc1-mediated RNA transfer between neurons in the context of tauopathy, and their relevance to mammalian tauopathy.

We find that Arc1 is elevated in the nucleus of tau transgenic Drosophila compared to controls. While the current study does not investigate consequences of nuclear Arc1 accumulation, previous studies in mice implicate nuclear Arc as an epigenetic regulator of long term synaptic scaling (Wee et al., 2014). Upon induction by novel environmental exposure, Arc undergoes time-dependent trafficking from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (Korb et al., 2013). We speculate that the time-dependent trafficking of Arc1 to the nucleus, in addition to tau-induced increase in Arc1 expression and translation as a consequence of defective NMD, results in nuclear Arc1 accumulation. In the nucleus, Arc is reported to downregulate GluA1 transcription by increasing the abundance of PML bodies, which points toward a persistent downscaling of neurotransmitter receptor strength (Korb et al., 2013). In addition, nuclear accumulation of Arc1 in tau transgenic Drosophila could lead to an increase in H4K12 acetylation through the interaction between Arc1 and Tip60 (Wee et al., 2014). This Arc-mediated learning-induced chromatin modification is associated with increased transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and other immediate early genes that are known to contribute to Alzheimer’s disease pathology (Plagg et al., 2015).

While our genetic approaches to determine if tau-induced increase in Arc1 mediates neurotoxicity collectively suggest a causal role for Arc1 in tau-mediated neurodegeneration, we do observe differences in the effects of Arc1 variable genotypes on neurotoxicity. Minor differences between the effects of pan-neuronal Arc1 knockdown versus Arc1 heterozygous loss-of-function on tau neurotoxicity are not unexpected. The Arc1esm113 allele is the result of imprecise excision of a P-element located between the Arc1 and Arc2 genes that results in a partial deletion of the 5’ Arc1 coding region (Mattaliano et al., 2007). Partial deletion of the Arc1 5’ UTR may affect how the mRNA is recognized by ribosomes and therefore alter protein translation. As a heterozygous allele, Arc1esm113 is present in the whole body and is not restricted to neurons like Arc1RNAi. Surprisingly, while both Arc1esm113 and Arc1RNAi suppress tau-induced locomotor deficits and TUNEL-based quantification of neurodegeneration, we do not observe an effect of Arc1 overexpression in tau transgenic Drosophila. As non-physiological overexpression of proteins often results in the formation of insoluble aggregates of the protein being over-expressed, we speculate that the very high extent of Arc1 overexpression in this model causes the formation of insoluble, non-toxic Arc1 aggregates. It is also possible that the degree of Arc1 overexpression in tau transgenic Drosophila has already overwhelmed the cell’s capacity to assemble bona fide functional Arc1 capsids, or that fully formed Arc1 capsids have exceeded a functional saturation point.

In future studies, it will be important to determine whether Arc1 forms bona fide capsids in Drosophila models of tauopathy and in higher organisms, what types of RNAs and/or proteins such capsids contain, and if a tau-induced increase in Arc1 capsids affects inter-neuronal communication. In addition, our study opens the door to new investigations into the consequences of nuclear Arc accumulation in tauopathy, particularly into the role of Arc as an epigenetic regulator. Overall, our work presents new insights into how retroviruses integrated into the host genome are co-opted by endogenous genes and can negatively impact cellular function as a consequence of pathogenic tau.
