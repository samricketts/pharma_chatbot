Importance:

Community-dwelling older adults with dementia have a high prevalence of psychotropic and opioid use. In these patients, central nervous system (CNS)-active polypharmacy may increase the risk for impaired cognition, fall-related injury, and death.

Objective:

To determine the extent of CNS-active polypharmacy among community-dwelling older adults with dementia in the U.S.

Design/Setting/Participants:

Cross-sectional analysis of all community-dwelling older adults with dementia in traditional Medicare from 2015 to 2017, as identified by ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes (N=1,159,968). Medication exposure was estimated using prescription fills from October 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018.

Exposure:

Part D coverage during the observation year (January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018).

Main Outcomes:

Prevalence of CNS-active polypharmacy in 2018, defined as possessing ≥3 medications for &gt;30 consecutive days from the following classes: antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics, and opioids. Among those who met the criterion for polypharmacy, duration of exposure, number of distinct medications and classes prescribed, common class combinations, and the most commonly used CNS-active medications were also determined.

Results:

The study included 1,159,968 older adults with dementia (median [quartile 1 (Q1), quartile 3 (Q3)] age, 83.0 [Q1, Q3; 77.0, 88.6] years; 65.2% female), of whom 13.9% (N=161,412) met the criterion for CNS-active polypharmacy (32,139,610 polypharmacy days of exposure). Those with CNS-active polypharmacy had a median age of 79.4 years (Q1, Q3; 74.0, 85.5); 71.2% were female. Among those who met the criterion for CNS-active polypharmacy, the median number of polypharmacy days was 193 (Q1, Q3; 88, 315). 57.8% were exposed for over 180 days and 6.8% for 365 days; 29.4% were exposed to ≥5 medications; 5.2% to ≥5 medication classes. Ninety-two percent of polypharmacy days included an antidepressant, 47.1% an antipsychotic, and 40.7% a benzodiazepine. The most common class combination included an antidepressant, antiepileptic, and antipsychotic (12.9% of polypharmacy days). Gabapentin was the most common medication, contributing to 33.0% of polypharmacy days.

Conclusions and Relevance:

In this cross-sectional analysis of Medicare claims data, 13.9% of older adults with dementia in 2018 filled prescriptions consistent with CNS-active polypharmacy. The lack of information on prescribing indications limits judgements about clinical appropriateness of medication combinations for individual patients.


INTRODUCTION

The number of persons with dementia (PWD) in the U.S. is projected to grow to 50 million people by 2050,1 but the U.S. health care system is poorly equipped to deal with these patients and their complex medical and psychosocial needs.2 While memory impairment is the cardinal feature of dementia, behavioral and psychological symptoms (e.g., apathy, delusions, agitation) are common during all stages of illness and cause significant caregiver distress.3,4 Despite limited high-quality evidence of efficacy for pharmacological treatment,5 clinicians regularly prescribe psychotropic medications to community-dwelling PWD6 in rates that far exceed use in the general older adult population.7

Central nervous system (CNS)-active polypharmacy—combinations of multiple psychotropic and/or opioid medications—has increased among older adults overall.8 The potential for such prescribing may be particularly high among PWD as medications accumulate in response to pervasive but transient behavioral symptoms. The American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria advise against such polypharmacy given its association with increased fall risk.9 These medications may also cause impaired cognition,10 cardiac conduction abnormalities,11 and respiratory suppression and death when involving opioids.12 Given the high degree of comorbid medical illness and frailty among PWD, associated risks from drug-drug and drug-disease interactions may be even greater than in older adults overall, while PWD may have difficulty articulating side effects they are experiencing.

The limited data on CNS-active polypharmacy among PWD are from Europe and do not include antiepileptic medications or opioids, thereby significantly underestimating the true extent of exposure to such combinations.13–15 In light of pervasive psychotropic and opioid prescribing to PWD in the U.S.6 as well as the extent of CNS-active polypharmacy among older adults overall,8 this analysis sought to determine its prevalence among older adults with dementia living in the community, including duration of exposure, medication class combinations, and commonly prescribed individual medications.

METHODS

Cohort identification

The study population began with Medicare beneficiaries with continuous traditional fee-for-service (FFS; i.e., Parts A and B and no Medicare Advantage) coverage from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. The Michigan Medicine Institutional Review Board approved this study; informed consent was waived for this observational data analysis.

The cohort was limited to those with at least one ICD-9-CM or ICD-10 dementia diagnosis (Table S1) from a health care encounter that occurred from 2015 to 2017 using the inpatient (Medicare Provider Analysis and Review [MedPAR]) and outpatient (Carrier and Outpatient) files; three years were used for cohort identification to achieve greater sensitivity (0.80).16

The outcome observation year was calendar year 2018. Because of requiring three years of Medicare coverage in order to identify dementia, cohort members were ≥68 years of age at the start of observation. To limit analysis to community-dwelling beneficiaries, those who were long-stay nursing home residents (i.e., &gt;100 days in long-term care17) in 2017 or 2018 were excluded. To be included in the final study cohort, beneficiaries with dementia were required to have Part D prescription drug coverage on January 1, 2018. The study cohort was followed until the earliest of the censoring events (death, loss of FFS or enrollment in Medicare Advantage, loss of Part D coverage) or the end of the observation year (December 31, 2018). The study flow chart is presented in Figure 1.

Polypharmacy assessment and outcomes

The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence of CNS-active polypharmacy in 2018. This was defined, based on the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria, as &gt;30 consecutive days with concurrent exposure to ≥3 medications from the following six classes: antidepressants; antipsychotics; antiepileptics; benzodiazepines; nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics (i.e.,“Z-drugs”); and opioids.9 The 2019 criteria were used rather than those from 2015, which did not include antiepileptics. Medications within each class were identified using the American Hospital Formulary Service (Table S2).

Exposure was determined using CNS-active medication fills between October 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018 (i.e., the observation year plus three preceding months). Daily possessions of each medication was determined using fill date and days’ supply, with early fills (i.e., October 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017) included to account for exposure from medications filled before the observation year began. CNS-active polypharmacy was considered present when a beneficiary simultaneously possessed ≥3 CNS-active medications for &gt;30 consecutive days during the observation year. Following the Beers Criteria definition, the medications did not have to be from different classes (e.g., &gt;30 consecutive days of exposure to three antidepressants or to two antipsychotics and a benzodiazepine would both meet the polypharmacy definition).

The cohort was split into four mutually exclusive groups based on possession of CNS-active medication during the observation year: 1) no supply; 2) supply of any CNS-active medication(s) for 1–30 consecutive days; 3) &gt;30 consecutive days without ≥3 concurrent medications; and 4) those who met criteria for a polypharmacy episode (i.e., &gt;30 consecutive days with ≥3 concurrent medications). An episode of CNS polypharmacy continued as long as ≥3 CNS-active medications were present, even if constituent medications changed.

These polypharmacy days formed the basis of analysis. In addition to determining the overall prevalence, additional outcomes included: the total number of polypharmacy days; the number of distinct medications and distinct classes prescribed; the most common combinations of CNS-active medication classes; and the most-prescribed individual medications that contributed to polypharmacy.

Statistical analysis

For descriptive purposes, baseline characteristics for the cohort overall and by CNS-active medication group were determined using demographic and clinical data derived from the 2017 Master Beneficiary Summary File, MedPAR, Carrier, and Outpatient files. Race/ethnicity was included in the analysis given racial disparities in CNS-active prescribing.7 It was identified using the Research Triangle Institute race code variable available in the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File, which was developed combining Social Security Administration data and beneficiary name and validated against beneficiary self-report in the Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers Survey.18 Clinical characteristics included dementia type, overall comorbidity defined using the Elixhauser comorbidity index, and specific diagnoses potentially associated with CNS-active medication use, including mental health, insomnia, pain, and seizure diagnoses. Characteristics across CNS-active medication groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables (e.g., age) and Chi-square tests for categorical variables (e.g., depression).

Among those with CNS-active polypharmacy, days during observation that were part of a polypharmacy episode(s) were identified by summing days from polypharmacy episodes for each person until the censoring event or end of the observation year, whichever came first.

To exclude the possibility that findings were related to medication use during end-of-life care, a sensitivity analysis was completed examining primary outcomes with the cohort limited to those who survived through 2018.

This analysis was primarily descriptive and should be interpreted as exploratory. Limited statistical comparisons were completed to compare demographic and clinical characteristics across the four CNS-active polypharmacy exposure groups. Alpha was set at 0.05 and tests were two-sided. When reporting percentages related to CNS-active medication use (e.g., percent of polypharmacy days involving at least one antidepressant), confidence intervals are not presented because the interval is not evident when reported to one significant figure after the decimal point. Data processing and analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Figures were created using R version 3.6.3 and the ggplot2 package.

RESULTS

We identified 1,159,968 older adults with dementia; their median age was 83.0 (Q1, Q3; 77.0, 88.6) years; 65.2% were female. In the cohort, 28.4% received no CNS-active medication in 2018; 11.6% possessed CNS-active medication(s) for ≤30 consecutive days; 46.1% possessed CNS-active medication(s) for &gt;30 days but did not experience a CNS-active polypharmacy episode (i.e., &gt;30 consecutive days of overlap of ≥3 medications; Table 1). CNS-active polypharmacy occurred in 13.9% (N=161,412), yielding a total of 32,139,610 person-days of exposure to such polypharmacy (“polypharmacy days”).

Characteristics of those who met the criterion for CNS-active polypharmacy

Relative to the other CNS-active exposure groups, those exposed to polypharmacy were significantly younger (median, 79.4 [Q1, Q3; 74.0, 85.5] vs. 84.7 [Q1, Q3; 78.8, 89.9] years in the no exposure group, p&lt;0.001), with larger percentages of non-Hispanic white (e.g., 86.2% vs. 76.7% [no exposure], p&lt;0.001) and low-income beneficiaries (e.g., 36.2% vs. 25.9% [no exposure], p&lt;0.001). Those exposed to polypharmacy had a higher burden of medical comorbidity overall (median number of Elixhauser comorbidities, 5 [Q1, Q3; 3, 7] vs. 3 [Q1, Q3; 1, 5] [no exposure], p&lt;0.001]). In addition, with the exception of cancer and cancer-related pain, those exposed to polypharmacy had a significantly higher prevalence of all individual clinical characteristics of interest, including non-cancer pain, insomnia, psychiatric diagnoses, and seizure disorders (p&lt;0.001 for all).

CNS-active polypharmacy: Days, medications, and classes

Of those who met the criterion for polypharmacy, the median number of polypharmacy days was 193 (Q1, Q3; 88, 315). 57.8% were exposed for greater than 180 days; 6.8% were exposed for the entire year (Table 2). Of all polypharmacy days, combinations with three CNS-active medications accounted for 55.3% of polypharmacy days, four medications for 29.8%, and five or more medications for 14.9%, corresponding to 35.5%, 35.1%, and 29.4% of exposed persons, respectively. Combinations of medications from a single medication class accounted for 2.7% of polypharmacy days and 1.8% of persons; combinations of three classes, 48.3% of polypharmacy days and 45.5% of persons; five or more classes, 2.0% of days and 5.2% of persons.

CNS-active polypharmacy: Most common combinations and medications

Of the medication classes contributing to CNS-active polypharmacy, antidepressants accounted for 92.0% of polypharmacy days, followed by antiepileptics (62.1%), antipsychotics (47.1%), benzodiazepines (40.7%), opioids (32.3%), and Z-drugs (6.0%; Table 3). For polypharmacy combinations including the 5 non-antidepressant classes, antidepressants were the most commonly co-prescribed class. An opioid was co-prescribed with an antiepileptic, an antipsychotic, a benzodiazepine, or another opioid for 19.8%, 9.1%, 13.1%, and 5.1% of polypharmacy days, respectively.

The most common CNS-polypharmacy class combination included at least one antidepressant, antiepileptic, and antipsychotic, accounting for 12.9% of polypharmacy days (Figure S1). Among the most frequent class combinations, 17 included an antidepressant and 12 an antiepileptic. Antipsychotics and benzodiazepines were each part of 10 of the most frequent 20 combinations; opioids were part of 9 of the top 20. An opioid was prescribed with at least one CNS-depressant in 8 of the 20 most frequent combinations: specifically, with an antiepileptic in 5, a benzodiazepine in 5, and an antipsychotic in 4.

Gabapentin was the individual medication that accounted for the largest percentage of polypharmacy days (33.0%; Table 3); gabapentin accounted for 53.2% of all antiepileptic polypharmacy days. The next most-prescribed medications were trazodone (26.0%) and quetiapine (24.4%). The remaining medications among the top ten spots were antidepressants (mirtazapine [19.9%], sertraline [18.7%], escitalopram [14.7%], and duloxetine [14.5%]) and benzodiazepines (lorazepam [12.9%], clonazepam [12.0%], and alprazolam [12.0%]). Hydrocodone (11.5%) and tramadol (9.2%) were the most common opioids.

Sensitivity analysis

The prevalence of CNS-active polypharmacy among those who did not die during the 2018 observation year (N=977,818) was slightly higher (14.6%) than among the primary cohort. Of those who met the criterion for polypharmacy in the sensitivity cohort, the median number of polypharmacy days was 214 (Q1, Q3; 94, 326). 57.7% were exposed for greater than 180 days and 7.7% were exposed for the entire year (Table S3). Of all polypharmacy days, combinations with three CNS-active medications accounted for 55.2%, four medications for 29.8%, and five or more medications for 15.0%. 2.7% of polypharmacy days occurred with patients prescribed three medications from a single CNS-active class; 48.1% of polypharmacy days were accounted for by three classes.

DISCUSSION

In this large national Medicare sample of all community-dwelling older adults with dementia who also had Part D prescription drug coverage, 13.9% were exposed to CNS-active polypharmacy in 2018, defined as possession of three or more medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics, and opioids) for more than 30 consecutive days. 57.8% of those prescribed such a regimen were exposed for &gt;180 days and 6.8% for a full year. Antidepressants were the most common constituent medication class, while the most common medications contributing to polypharmacy included an antiepileptic (gabapentin), an antidepressant (trazodone), and an antipsychotic (quetiapine).

To our knowledge, there are not prior studies among non-institutionalized adults with dementia in the U.S. with which to compare these results. Two analyses among older adults overall not limited to those with dementia found that less than 1.5% took three or more CNS-active medications. These analyses included opioid medications but not antiepileptics;8,19 international studies of polypharmacy have included neither. In international studies specifically among adults with dementia, the prevalence of psychotropic polypharmacy ranged from 13.8% to 50% across studies that employed varying definitions of polypharmacy (i.e., 2 vs. 3 medications with different overlap criteria) and included long-term care.13–15,20–22 While this analysis excluded those in federally regulated long-term care, Medicare beneficiaries in community assisted living settings were not excluded because there is not a reliable way to identify them from Medicare claims; they may be overrepresented among those exposed to polypharmacy.23

This analysis used a relatively conservative definition of polypharmacy that required more than 30 days of overlap of at least three medications. A 30-day supply of a CNS-active medication that was either meant for short-term use or discontinued due to side effects would not contribute to polypharmacy—to do so, that medication (and at least two others) would have required refills to cross the &gt;30-day polypharmacy threshold, suggesting ongoing therapy. Had a more conservative threshold been used, there would have still been a significant burden of polypharmacy: 77.7% of the polypharmacy sample was exposed for more than three months (&gt;90 days). In addition to relatively long periods, the number of medications frequently exceeded the Beers threshold: 35.1% of those exposed to polypharmacy received four medications; 29.4%, five or more.

Antidepressants were the most common constituent medication class, consistent with their place as the psychotropic class most commonly prescribed both to older adults overall and those with dementia.6,7 There is minimal high-quality evidence to support the efficacy of antidepressants to treat depression in dementia.24 They may be prescribed for a variety of other indications based on varying levels of evidence: for example, agitation, a use supported by the CitAD trial,11 or apathy, which resembles depression and is distressing to family but does not benefit from antidepressants.25,26 Additional potential indications are pain or insomnia, diagnoses that were higher among those experiencing polypharmacy. Trazodone and mirtazapine—the top two antidepressants that contributed to polypharmacy days—are both commonly prescribed off-label for insomnia.27,28

As with antidepressants, other medications that contributed to polypharmacy may have been prescribed for multiple indications, including gabapentin and quetiapine, among the top individual medications. While gabapentin is captured by the Beers CNS-active schema as an antiepileptic—and seizure disorders were more common among those exposed to polypharmacy—the majority of its use has been found to be for off-label psychiatric or pain disorders.29 Similarly, while quetiapine is an antipsychotic, it is frequently prescribed off-label for anxiety or insomnia.30

With the exception of cancer and related pain, the prevalence of all other clinical conditions including insomnia, mental disorders, and non-cancer pain was higher among those with CNS-active polypharmacy. However, it is not possible to directly link the medications prescribed to their multiple potential indications. The burden of psychiatric diagnoses in the polypharmacy cohort does not reflect the prevalence of mental illness shown by epidemiological studies of mental illness in community-dwelling older adults,31 which suggests clinicians may be using diagnoses to reflect behavioral and psychological symptoms of the dementia rather than that the codes reflect pre-existing mental illness unrelated to the dementia.

There are several specific risks related to CNS-active polypharmacy and the constituent medications, beginning with the risk of respiratory suppression and death from combinations of opioids and CNS depressants or “opioid potentiators”, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and gabapentinoids, which are subject to a black-box warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.32 In this analysis, 41% of opioid polypharmacy days included a benzodiazepine, while 28% included an antipsychotic. Second, several antipsychotics and citalopram cause QT interval prolongation, which increases risk for cardiac arrhythmia.11,33 Third is fall-related injury, which is associated with many CNS-active medications, both individually and in combination:19,34,35 The increased risk of fall associated with CNS-active polypharmacy is the reason it was added to the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria as potentially inappropriate.36 Fourth, many of these medications adversely affect cognition, an undesired side effect in those who have received a dementia diagnosis, which is generally used in clinical practice to indicate the presence of significant declines in cognition and function. Among older adults with dementia in the CATIE-AD trial, patients who received an antipsychotic experienced a decline on the Mini Mental State Exam that was nearly 2.5 points (on a 30 point scale) larger than those treated with placebo over 36 weeks of treatment.37 Benzodiazepines also impair cognition, with more pronounced effects among older patients.38 In the CitAD study of citalopram for agitation in dementia, those receiving citalopram experienced worsening of cognition relative to those on placebo.29 In addition to class-specific effects, additional burden of CNS-active polypharmacy overall has been associated with additional cognitive decline.10

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, possession of prescription medication claims may overestimate actual exposure to polypharmacy if prescriptions are being filled but not actually taken, or if only used on an as-needed basis. Second, without knowing the indication for the medications or examining the range of prescribed dosages, it is not possible to assess the appropriateness of the particular combinations used. Third, the specific harms associated with CNS-active polypharmacy in this cohort were not examined. Fourth, in order to limit the cohort to those with dementia, the analysis was limited to those with traditional fee-for-service Medicare and further to those with Part D, which limits generalizability to all older adults. Fifth, cohort identification relied on a dementia diagnosis in Medicare claims data, which may mean some individuals with dementia ended up excluded, whereas others identified did not have the illness; however, 3 years of data were used to maximize sensitivity of the algorithm to identify those with dementia.16 Sixth, these data did not provide information on dementia severity.

CONCLUSIONS

In this cross-sectional analysis of Medicare claims data, 13.9% of older adults with dementia in 2018 filled prescriptions consistent with CNS-active polypharmacy. The lack of information on prescribing indications limits judgements about clinical appropriateness of medication combinations for individual patients.

CNS, central nervous system-active

a Continuous fee for-service 2015–2017 means that a given beneficiary had continuous Parts A and B and no Part C coverage from January of 2015 to December of 2017. Part A is hospital insurance that primarily covers inpatient and skilled nursing services. Part B is medical insurance that covers physician and outpatient services. Part C refers to Medicare Advantage, where beneficiaries choose to enroll in a private health plan that delivers Medicare-covered Part A and Part B benefits. “Fee-for-service” (or “traditional Medicare”) refers to those Medicare beneficiaries not enrolled in Part C.

b The Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file contains billing records (i.e., claims) for inpatient care encounters (acute and skilled nursing). Outpatient encounters are captured in the Carrier file (claims from non-institutional providers such as doctors) and Outpatient file (claims for outpatient services from institutional providers, some of whom may also provide hospital services through Part A coverage).

c Part D is Medicare’s prescription drug insurance; enrollment in Part D is optional.

d A sensitivity analysis removing 182,150 who died during 2018 was also conducted. In this analysis, among the 977,818 survivors, 142,602 experienced central nervous system-active polypharmacy, resulting in a total of 29,888,544 polypharmacy days.

a Race/ethnicity was classified using the Research Triangle Institute race variable. 4,855 (0.4%) of the overall cohort was missing race; percentages are reported after excluding those with missing race.

b Low-income subsidy status was considered present if a given beneficiary was eligible for or enrolled in the Part D low-income subsidy for at least one month during the observation period.

c Rurality was derived using beneficiary zip code and Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes. Urban areas comprise urban core and suburban areas; rural areas comprise large town, small town, and isolated rural areas. 666 (0.1%) of the overall cohort was missing rurality; percentages here are reported after excluding those with missing rurality.

d Dementia subtype was considered “Unspecified” if they received no other dementia diagnosis. The other dementia subtypes were not mutually exclusive.

e A comorbidity was considered present if a diagnosis indicating the given condition was present from on least one inpatient or ≥2 outpatient encounters on two separate days during 2017. Diagnosis codes for each comorbidity are in Table S1.

f The Elixhauser comorbidity score measures patient disease burden based on administrative data. Ranging from 0–30, a score of 4 indicates the presence of 4 comorbidities based on claims data.

a CNS-active polypharmacy defined as &gt;30 consecutive days with concurrent exposure to ≥3 medications from the following six classes: antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics, and opioids.

b To compute the percentage of persons that took a given number of CNS medications or classes during 2018, each person was assigned to a category based on the maximum number of overlapping medications or classes during a polypharmacy episode; the percentages sum to 100.

c Medications are assigned to a class using the American Hospital Formulary Service, which may not reflect the prescribing indication (e.g., quetiapine is captured as an antipsychotic even though it may be prescribed for insomnia or anxiety).

a The overall column presents the percentage of CNS-active polypharmacy days accounted for by each of the 6 constituent medication classes listed in the “Class” column. Subsequent columns present the percentage of CNS-active polypharmacy days that involve both the column and row medication classes (e.g., where antidepressants and antiepileptics meet, the percentage represents the percentage of CNS-active polypharmacy days involving both an antidepressant and antiepileptic). For cells where the row and column class are the same (e.g., antidepressants), the percentage represents the percentage of CNS-active polypharmacy days involving ≥2 medications from that class. Medications are assigned to a class using the American Hospital Formulary Service, which may not reflect the prescribing indication (e.g., quetiapine is captured as an antipsychotic even though it may be prescribed for insomnia or anxiety).

KEY POINTS

Question:

What is the prevalence of polypharmacy with central nervous system-active (CNS-active) medications among community-dwelling older adults with dementia in the United States?

Findings:

In this cross-sectional analysis of 1,159,968 older adults with dementia with traditional Medicare and prescription coverage in 2018, 13.9% were prescribed CNS-active polypharmacy, defined as overlapping prescription fills for 3 or more medications from the following drug classes: antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics, and opioids.

Meaning:

In 2018, 13.9% of older adults with dementia in the US had filled prescriptions consistent with CNS-active polypharmacy.

Conflict of Interest Disclosures: The authors have none to disclose.
