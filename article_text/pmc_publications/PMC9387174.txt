pmc1. Introduction

White matter lesions can be detected using MRI using T1 (hypointense) and T2/FLAIR (hyperintense) weighted imaging or a combination of multiple sequences. These white matter signal abnormalities (WMSA) increase in prevalence as individuals age (de Leeuw et al., 2001) and more so in Alzheimer’s disease (Lindemer et al., 2017a; Lindemer et al., 2015) are associated with cognitive dysfunction (Debette et al., 2007) and an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)(Birdsill et al., 2014; Mortamais et al., 2013). Prior work has shown that the presence of WMSA contribute to and modulate the clinical presentation of AD, with cognitive dysfunction being apparent at lower levels of amyloid and/or tau pathology when lesions are present suggesting that their presence may accelerate disease progression.(Birdsill et al., 2014; Debette et al., 2010; Lindemer et al., 2017b; Prins and Scheltens, 2015). While the underlying pathology of WMSA are still not fully understood, they are considered to be a proxy for vascular associated brain tissue damage (Brickman et al., 2015; Erten-Lyons et al., 2013; Gattringer et al., 2017; Kandel et al., 2016; Provenzano et al., 2013; Zhao and Gong, 2015). Imaging and post-mortem studies suggest that the link between WMSA, AD pathology and other dementias is different between brain areas (Desmarais et al., 2021; Garnier-Crussard et al., 2021; McAleese et al., 2021; McAleese et al., 2017; Rizvi et al., 2021; Van Etten et al., 2021). Prior studies have demonstrated that white matter lesions are associated with white matter alterations as measured with diffusion tensor imaging, an index of vascular health, in aging and AD (O’Sullivan et al., 2004) (Jacobs et al., 2013; Leritz et al., 2014; O’Sullivan et al., 2001; Riphagen et al., 2018; Vernooij et al., 2009). In addition, several studies reported a negative association between cortical grey matter volume and the burden of WMSA (Appelman et al., 2009; Capizzano, 2004; Godin et al., 2009; Knopman et al., 2015). Likewise, WMSA load has been linked to alterations in cortical thickness (Rizvi et al., 2018; Tuladhar et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2006). WMSA have been shown to be particularly associated with typical-AD and Limbic predominant AD-subtypes (Cedres et al., 2020; Ferreira et al., 2018). However, to what extent the topography of cortical thinning associated with AD may be explained by WMSA remains unclear.

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the spatial overlap between cortical regions showing associations with WMSA and spatial patterns of thinning due to AD (Belathur Suresh et al., 2018; Dickerson et al., 2009). To do so, we examined associations between WMSA and thickness in cognitively unimpaired amyloid negative older adults and compared spatial patterns to the canonical spatial patterns of AD cortical thinning derived from group comparisons of amyloid positive AD to amyloid negative cognitively unimpaired individuals from the neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) in age and sex matched groups.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Dataset

Data used in this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The main goal of the ADNI is to test whether magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and AD. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.

We used the structural brain MRI scans from the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-2) dataset (adni.loni.usc.edu). Informed consent was obtained from all participants in this study.

2.2 Participants

A total of 403 participants (267 controls (CN) and 136 participants with an Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis (AD) according to the ADNI criteria (subjective memory concern, abnormal memory function on education adjusted Logical memory II subscale of the Wechsler memory scale, MMSE between 20–26, CDR 0.5 or 1 and the NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD (McKhann et al., 2011)) were considered for this study. In addition to these criteria, we used biomarker information to exclude individuals with atypical patterns of AD pathology that might complicate the interpretation of results. Specifically, we chose participants with an AD diagnosis that where amyloid positive based on a Florbetapir (AV45) cutoff of 1.11 SUVR using the whole cerebellum as reference region and had a CDR &gt;=1, and CN that were AV45 negative and a CDR=0. Control participants were selected for Florbetapir (AV45) levels below cutoff to minimize any AD pathology contributions of WMSA associations with cortical thickness. To ensure that co-variates that are related to age are balanced between groups, and the age difference between CN and AD groups did not drive effects, Optimal full matching was performed using the MatchIt package (Ho et al., 2011) in R, which calls functions from the Optmatch package (Hansen and Klopfer, 2006). Full matching is optimal with regards to minimizing a weighted average of the estimated distance measure between each treated subject and each control subject within each subclass.

2.3. Biomarker assessment

18F-AV-45 Florbetapir positron emission tomography measures were used to quantify levels of neocortical Aβ. The duration of positron emission tomography imaging was 20 minutes and started 50 minutes after injection of tracer fluid. The neocortical standardized uptake value ratio is the mean uptake in an aggregate of the frontal lobe, cingulate cortex, lateral parietal, and lateral temporal regions relative to mean uptake in the whole cerebellum, including white and gray matter. Further processing of positron emission tomography images occurred as is described in a previous report (Landau et al., 2012). Participants were characterized as Aβ-positive if they exceeded the cutoff value of 1.11 standardized uptake value ratio, as previously determined in ADNI cohorts (Landau et al., 2012). For all the analyses mapped to the cortical surface all variables were used as a continuous rather than a dichotomized measure.

2.4. MRI acquisition.

Standard 3T baseline T1-weighted images were included from the ADNI data set. More detailed descriptions of the acquisition parameters are described elsewhere (Jack Jr. et al., 2008). Structural T1-weighted gradient echo pulse sequence data with dimensions of 170*256*256 mm with a voxel resolution of 1.2*1*1 mm were acquired in sagittal orientation with a repetition time of 2300 ms, echo time of 2.95 ms, flip angle of 9° and slice thickness of 1.2 mm. T2 FLAIR 175*256*256 voxel resolution of 0.9*0.9*5 with a repetition time of 9000 ms, echo time of 90 ms, flip angle 150° and 5mm slice thickness.

2.5 Surface based cortical thickness analysis

The FreeSurfer image analysis suite version 5.3.0 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) was employed to process the MRI data and compute cortical thickness measurements. The technical details of cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation performed with the Freesurfer are described in prior publications (Fischl et al., 2004a; Fischl et al., 2004b). All images were visually checked after processing and if necessary, edited for errors in automatic skull stripping or estimation of the gray/white matter boundaries before reprocessing.

Cortical thickness measures were mapped on both the white matter border for easier orientation or on the inflated surface of each participant’s reconstructed brain to allow visualization across the surface without interference from cortical folding. Maps were smoothed using a circularly symmetric Gaussian kernel with a full width half maximum (FWHM) of 20mm or 10mm and averaged across participants using a non-rigid high-dimensional spherical averaging method to align cortical folding patterns. This procedure provided accurate matching of morphologically homologous cortical locations among participants based on each individual’s anatomy while minimizing metric distortion. This results in a mean measure of cortical thickness at each point on the reconstructed surface.

2.4 WMSA methods

This study uses the white matter hyperintensity volumes available through the ADNI database, calculated from fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and combining this with T1-weighted images using a Bayesian segmentation method described elsewhere (Fletcher et al., 2012), we will refer to these values as white matter signal abnormalities (WMSA) as it uses both T1 (hypo-intensities) and Flair (hyperintensity) data. This WSMA measurement approach is based on a Bayesian approach to segmentation of high-resolution 3D T1 and FLAIR sequences. In brief, non-brain structures are excluded from the 3D T1 images using an automated atlas-based method. The FLAIR image is transformed to the 3D T1 image using the FLIRT method from the FSL toolbox. Estimation of WMSA is then performed using a modified Bayesian probability structure based WMSA map created from approximately 700 individuals with semi-automatic detection of WMSA followed by manual editing. Likelihood estimates of the native image are calculated through histogram. segmentation and thresholding. Further description can be found in the ADNI reference documentation “Four Tissue Segmentation in ADNI II” (DeCarli. et al., 2013).

The WMSA volume was expressed as a proportion of intracranial volume relative to the average sample IVC ((WMSA/ICV) * 1346 mean IVC of total sample), with 1 unit added before log-transformation to create an approximately normal distribution for the analyses.

2.5 Statistical analyses

All further analyses were done in R version 3.5.1 (http://www.R-project.org.). Demographics are reported in means and standard deviations and groups were compared using Welch two-sample t-test for continuous variables and chi-square for dichotomous variables. Cortical thickness analyses were done using generalized linear models, figures 1 and 2 are not cluster corrected to show the full statistical effect, while figure 3 shows the same data with cluster correction and a smaller smoothing kernel of 10 mm FWHM.

3 Results

3.1 Demographics

In total 403 participants from the ADNI data base were used in this analysis. After selecting for AD with AV45 positivity and CDR&gt;0 vs Controls AV45 neg and CDR=0 a total of 300 participants remained. After matching for age and sex 238 participants remained (119 CN ,119AD). After matching AD participants (73.76, SD =8.22) were not significantly older than CN (73.53, SD =6.59), (t=0.2, df=227, p=0.807). The sex distribution between the study groups (53.8% vs 56.6% males, (χ2=0.07, df=1, p=0.8) was not different. Education level of the CN group was higher (17.2, SD =2.46) compared to the AD group (15.7, SD=2.54) (t=−5, df=235, p&lt;0.001). The percentage of APOE4 carriers was 79.3 % in the AD group and 18.5 % in the control group (χ2=91, df=2, p&lt;0.001) (see Table 1). Compared to the reported prevalence of 13.39 for North America (CI up to 17) (Ward et al., 2012) the sample is enriched for homozygous APOE4 in the AD group. The percentage heterozygote APOE4 carriers are in line with reported prevalence for North America. After matching for Age and Sex average and distributions where well matched, while very minor changes in APOE4 distribution were introduced (see table 1). There is no interaction effect of APOE4 by diagnosis on WMSA load (homozygote df=229, p= 0.39, heterozygote df=229, p=0.62). The ADNI population and our sample are predominantly white non-Hispanic (see table 1 for breakdown).

3.2 Cortical thickness measurement

Figure 1 shows the surface maps of group differences in cortical thickness between the amyloid- CN and amyloid+ AD matched for age and sex. Surface maps of the cortical thickness differences between CN and AD show reduced cortical thickness in AD in several regions including entorhinal cortex, precuneus cortex, superior frontal cortex, pars opercularis, supramarginal gyrus, caudal middle frontal gyrus, lateral occipital cortex (Fig 1. top row) as described in several previous publications (Dickerson et al., 2009; Salat, 2011). When WMSA volume is included in the AD vs CN group differences analysis as a nuisance covariate, differences are greatly reduced to the point where much of the canonical pattern of AD has disappeared with the exception of the parahippocampal, entorhinal region and the cuneus/precuneus (Fig 1. 2nd row).

In a subgroup analysis on AD and CN looking at the effect of WMSA on cortical thickness the pattern is shown in figure 1 (subgroups 3rd row). For CN, WMSA has a significant negative effect on cortical thickness in frontal areas (superior frontal, rostral middle frontal, anterior cingulate, medial and lateral orbitofrontal) as well as showing a relation with WMSA in the temporal pole parts of the superior and middle temporal, supra marginal and inferior parietal regions-several regions overlapping traditional AD regions. For the AD subgroup, effects were found in the insula and superior temporal region, parahippocampal, entorhinal and part of the lingual, notably a positive effect (thickening) on the superior parietal and precuneus was observed-these patterns seem to be complementary to the control patterns in overlap of the full AD effect.

When the CN and AD subgroups are projected back on the group difference map these associations with WSMA have a high overlap with the regions where AD has a lower cortical thickness than CN participants (figure 2). In addition, figure 3 shows the subgroups using a smaller smoothing kernel of 10mm FWHM and cluster correction and placed in the approximate locations that showed consistent regional thinning in AD in multiple samples (Dickerson et al., 2009) coinciding with the temporal pole, entorhinal, fusiform and parahippocampal gyrus.

4. Discussion

The current results suggest a reinterpretation of the canonical patterns of cortical thinning in patients with AD that have been described in several prior publications and are typically considered linked to classical AD neuropathology. Controlling group difference for WMSA greatly reduces the effect, showing a widespread effect of vascular pathology in the pattern of AD. Furthermore, subgroup analyses suggest a potential temporal pattern with WMSA contributing to cortical thinning in many typical AD regions in individuals when cognitively intact and amyloid negative, while effect of WMSA on cortical thickness is seen in AD groups in medial temporal and temporal pole areas. Although commonly comorbid, vascular pathology is not a pathology defining feature of AD and is not included in many models of primary AD pathophysiology (in fact, vascular damage can be considered an exclusionary factor for a diagnosis of AD). It may therefore be surprising that there is such a strong link between these measures. Importantly, the controls used in the subgroup analysis were amyloid negative, minimizing the potential for AD pathology to be a substantial contributor to the lesion/thickness associations. Thus, these data provide evidence for a reinterpretation of this assumption of pathologic independence.

WMSA are found in both aging and disease, and have been related to cortical thinning, hippocampal volume loss, postmortem tau pathology, as well as worse cognitive performance (Birdsill et al., 2014; Eckerström et al., 2011; McAleese et al., 2015; Rizvi et al., 2018). Other studies have investigated the relation between WMSA and cortical thickness (Jacobs et al., 2014; Seo et al., 2012; Tuladhar et al., 2015) as well as WMSA and Age, but have not previously directly examined the impact of WMSA on AD related thinning and overlap in spatial patterns. The exact role of vascular pathology in AD is currently a topic of debate (Jack et al., 2013; Jagust et al., 2019; Sweeney et al., 2019). The ATN model (Jack et al., 2018) does consider it co-morbidity and independent from AD (but not necessarily from Alzheimer clinical syndrome) but allows for a vascular component to be added. This work expands upon the work of Villeneuve and colleagues that showed similar patterns (but not the parahippocampal region) of cortical thinning in a smaller sample and came to the conclusion that Aβ interacts with vascular risk to enhance cortical thinning in posterior brain regions that are particularly vulnerable to AD (Villeneuve et al., 2014) and Bakkour (Bakkour et al., 2013) comparing a smaller sample of AD with controls. Analyses of the effect of amyloid on cortical thickness showed that the addition of AV45 as a covariate did not appreciably change the presented patterns. We chose not to regress out the effects of age but to match the distributions of equal sized and balanced groups in both age and sex. This ensures that the effect is not driven by group differences in age or sex but does not eliminate the accrual of WMSA over time.

Vascular pathology has long been considered a comorbidity or even fundamental part of AD, and interventions aimed at reducing vascular risk have yielded hope giving results (SPRINT MIND Investigators for the SPRINT Research Group, 2019). Increased WMSA burden has been shown to be associated with typical-AD and Limbic predominant AD-subtypes (Cedres et al., 2020; Ferreira et al., 2018) but less so in minimal atrophy AD suggesting a differential relationship in dementia subtypes. We found a relation of WMSA with CT in frontal regions considered more related to vascular involvement. Importantly we found a significant effect of WMSA in the CN group in many regions typically associated with AD, while in the AD group, the parahippocampal, entorhinal, fusiform and temporal areas are affected by WMSA burden.

As this is cross sectional data, nothing definitive can be stated about the sequence of events. However, we posit, as it is improbable that AD has a protective effect against cortical thickness loss associated with WMSA, it stands to reason that the cortical loss in in a significant part of the canonical pattern of AD has taken place in the time preceding disease onset. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the loss of cortical thickness in the CN group due to WMSA is reversible. We hypothesize that WMSA load associated with cortical thickness in the AD groups is added to the existing damage (and is focused on Alzheimer typical parahippocampal and precuneus regions) and shares variance with AD pathology. The regionally-specific WMSA may be an important pathological component of AD development (Lindemer et al., 2017a). The regions shown in the AD maps are mostly congruent with the non-scaling regions with double blood supply in previous work in our group (Lindemer et al., 2017b) (lateral temporal, lateral orbitofrontal, cuneus, entorhinal and parahippocampal). These regions might be more resistant to WMSA effects and this could explain why they are part of the pattern in the AD group. Together this suggest that accounting for WSMA is important to understand how much of the cortical thickness (and in all probability neural loss) is linked to vascular factors when looking at dementias. While WMSA in different localities might have different underlying pathology, it is possible the co-localization of vascular pathology and AD pathology can interact and amplify via its associated inflammation responses that can have effects beyond the direct vicinity of cerebrovascular damage and negatively affect brain health.

The prevention of damage due to vascular risk factors starting in midlife therefore seems to have merit to retain cortex in the areas at risk in AD.

The use of the large ADNI dataset enabled us to retain adequately sized groups after matching, comparing favorably to previous studies. Careful matching helps in understanding these patterns without controlling for age causing loss of shared variance. Tau pathology is generally linked to cortical thickness(Xia et al., 2017), however the amount of missing data in the CSF p-tau data did not allow for effective matching in this sample.

These results might not generalize to all populations. The ADNI study excludes participants with a Hachinski score of 5 and up, omitting participants with a high likelihood of vascular dementia at baseline. However, counter to what is often stated in literature ADNI does not by design exclude participants with (serious) vascular pathology or high vascular risk. While the white matter hyperintensity burden in ADNI is lower compared to other cohort studies (Ramirez et al., 2016), there is sufficient variability in WMSA within the sample.

The ADNI dataset is not a balanced racially diverse sample. Our subset comprises of predominantly (92.86%) white -of which only 5.46% identify as Hispanic-, 0.42 % Native American/Alaskan, 2.94% Asian, 2.52% Black participant which limits. While this does not affect our findings, it does limit the generalizability and hamper our ability to understand the aging and disease processes in more ethnically diverse groups.

Interventions aimed at preventing cortical loss by addressing risk factors for white matter damage in an early could benefit brain health and help preserve cognition in AD and other dementias as well as in aging in general.

5. Conclusions

WSMA are an important factor to consider when investigating patterns of cortical thinning in the context of Alzheimer’s disease. A substantial amount of the canonical AD pattern is associated with WMSA load and takes place in both cognitively normal as well as AD participants.
