Here we discuss findings made using Drosophila into Alzheimer Disease (AD) risk and progression. Recent studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying glia-mediated neuroprotection in AD. First, we discuss a novel mechanism of glial lipid droplet formation that occurs in response to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neurons. The data suggest that disruptions to this process contributes to AD-risk. We further discuss novel mechanistic insights into glia-mediated Aβ42-clearance made using the fly. Last, we highlight work that provides evidence that the aberrant accumulation of ROS in AD may not just be a consequence of disease but contribute to disease progression as well. Cumulatively, the discussed studies highlight recent, relevant discoveries in AD made using Drosophila.


pmcIntroduction

Neurodegenerative diseases are a diverse set of disorders resulting from progressive neuron loss. While many diseases have unique features, commonalities are also observed, including oxidative stress [1,2]. Of interest, Alzheimer disease is the most common cause of dementia and results from the age-related loss of cortical neurons [3]. Pathologically, AD is defined by the accumulation of Aβ-plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Aβ-plaques are primarily composed of Aβ42 peptides produced from sequential cleavages of Amyloid precursor protein (APP) by secretases. While Aβ-plaques tend to form extracellularly, NFT are predominantly found within neurons. NFT are composed of hyper-phosphorylated Tau (pTau), a microtubule associated protein. In AD, evidence supports that pTau accumulates after Aβ-plaques, making AD a secondary tauopathy [3]. Primary tauopathies also exist that are defined by pTau accumulations in neurons and glia [4]. These diseases are associated with neurodegeneration independent of significant Aβ-plaques. Currently, there are no effective preventions or treatments for AD, highlighting that an increased understanding of mechanisms that drive disease is needed.

Oxidative stress is likely a key feature of AD and continues to be of interest [1,2,5]. Oxidative stress is caused by the excess upregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). While low levels of ROS are normal and may be beneficial [6,7], aberrantly high ROS levels induce neurodegeneration by oxidizing and damaging lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Notably, whether oxidative stress is a cause or consequence of AD is currently unclear. In general, one source of excess ROS in the brain is dysfunctional or damaged mitochondria. In AD models, robust expression of Aβ42 and Tau can disrupt mitochondria and induce ROS, see [1,5]. However, ROS accumulations in AD may not depend on Aβ and pTau accumulations in human disease. The brain expresses multiple antioxidants to help maintain ROS levels and these endogenous antioxidants naturally become downregulated with age [2]. Importantly, there are significant depletions of specific antioxidants in AD, including glutathione [8] and vitamin E [9]. This suggests a contribution of ROS to disease progression. In fact, altered glutathione metabolism and ROS-induced bi-products have recently been described as potential early disease biomarkers [1,5,10]. Further, patients with pre-clinical AD and mild cognitive impairment show elevated peroxidated (O2−-) lipids prior to severe dementia compared to age-matched, non-demented individuals [11,12]. It is also interesting that individuals that live at high altitudes (associated with lower atmospheric O2) were reported to be at reduced AD-risk [13] and diseases that promote ROS production (e.g. diabetes) are thought to increase AD-risk [14].

While most research to date has focused on the impact of disease on neurons alone, including studies on mitochondria and ROS in AD, the contribution of glia to disease has become of interest. Recent studies have begun to uncover the neuroprotective functions of glia in AD and have argued that disrupting glia activity can contribute to neurodegeneration through non-cell autonomous mechanisms [15], including topics discussed herein on the resolution of neuronal ROS and clearance of Aβ42-peptides by glia. Notably, recent technological advances in the model system, Drosophila melanogaster, have propelled its use as an in vivo tool for studying interactions between multiple cell-types [16]. For example, the advent of several, independent binary expression systems (e.g. GAL4/UAS, LexA/LexAOP) allows for genetic manipulations in multiple cell types simultaneously with relative ease. Drosophila is a genetically malleable, simple system that has proven to be a valuable tool in neurodegenerative disease research, see [17-19]. Of note, many cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate neurodegeneration, including oxidative stress, are conserved between mammals and the fruit fly.

Here we discuss recent fly studies that have highlighted neuroprotective mechanisms mediated by glia, including lipid droplet formation in response to neuronal ROS and Aβ-clearance. Recent work in Drosophila has highlighted that ROS may be a critical contributor to AD-risk and progression. Overall, the discussed studies suggest that ROS accumulations is not just a consequence of disease but may also contribute to disease.

Connections between AD risk factors and the resolution of peroxidated lipids in the brain

An important AD disease modifier is apolipoprotein E (APOE) which encodes a secreted, lipid-shuttling protein highly expressed in the brain [3]. The ε4 allele of APOE (APOE4) is the most common known genetic risk factor for AD. Further, the ε2 allele (APOE2) seems neuroprotective against AD. While patients carrying the AD risk allele, APOE4, may have higher amounts of O2−-lipids than individuals carrying other APOE alleles [20], the role of APOE in the brain and how this may relate to early ROS accumulations in AD patients [11,12] was unclear until recently. Our lab reported a novel, non-cell autonomous mechanism underling APOE4-associated AD risk using Drosophila [21,22]. Liu and colleagues found that elevating ROS in neurons causes the production of toxic O2−-lipids in the adult fly retina [21] (Fig. 1A-C). These O2−-lipids are transferred to glia where they form lipid droplets (LD). LD typically involve a phospholipid monolayer surrounding neutral lipids (e.g. triacyglycerides, cholesterol) [23]. O2−-lipid production in neurons involves ROS-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and subsequent activation and phosphorylation of a transcription factor that regulates lipid biosynthesis, Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) (Fig. 1D). Liu and colleagues further showed that glial LD formation was dependent on the expression of fatty acid transporters, such as Fatp1 [22], findings recently supported in a separate study [24]. The expression of monocarboxylate transporters in both neurons and glia was similarly important in this pathway [21]. In addition, a transcription regulator, SPEN (an RNA-binding protein), was shown to modulate glial LD formation and protect against paraquat toxicity by others [25]. Notably, Liu and colleagues further found that glial LD formation is neuroprotective against O2−-lipids which damage cells [21]. Reductions in glial LD formation and the concomitant amelioration of ROS-induced neurodegeneration was shown in multiple ways. This included the genetic manipulation of O2−-lipid production in neurons and the treatment of flies under ROS-associated duress with potent antioxidants. Antioxidants included Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1; genetically upregulated) and N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA; orally administered). Evidence also suggested that this is not an infallible system as glia can be overrun with O2−-lipids in severe ROS scenarios, leaving neurons vulnerable again. It is also notable that upregulating glial LD formation in the absence of ROS was not toxic. Connecting this process to AD, Liu and colleagues reported that the transfer of O2−-lipids between neurons and glia is dependent on apolipoproteins [22]. Interestingly, when the AD-risk allele APOE4 is expressed in flies lacking the endogenous APOD/E homologue, GLaz, the transfer of O2−-lipids was disrupted and neurodegeneration was promoted (Fig. 2) [22]. In contrast, expression of the AD-protective APOE2 promoted this transcellular lipid transfer. Since this discovery, complementary work has shown APOE to be involved in astrocyte LD formation in mouse derived neuron:glia co-cultures [26], demonstrating that the process of glial LD formation in response to neuronal ROS and the connection to AD is conserved in vertebrates. Overall, these findings reveal a novel role of APOE in disease and demonstrate that APOE4 can potentially confer disease risk by perturbing this critical, neuroprotective process.

Additional AD-risk genes may also be involved in glial LD formation as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) continue to identify lipid-associated genes as potential risk factors [27-31]. Further, NDUFAF6, which encodes an ADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase that is important for the assembly of mitochondrial complex I, was recently described as an AD risk factor [27-29]. Loss of this gene in fly neurons indeed leads to elevated levels of ROS and LD accumulation in glia [21]. This suggests that NDUFAF6 loss may confer AD-risk through perturbations in glial LD formation in response to neuronal ROS. In addition to NDUFAF6, a recent study described connections between Aβ42-induced toxicity and the AD-risk variant found in Phospholipase D3 (PLD3) using Drosophila [32,33]. Phospholipases hydrolyze phospholipids into fatty acids and have been implicated in LD metabolism in non-brain tissues [34]. Notably, brains from Pld3 knockout mice have increased LD numbers [35]. Building upon this data in the context of AD, Demirev and colleagues expressed Aβ42arc (aggregate-prone Aβ42 that carries the ‘arctic’ mutation of APP: p.E693G) in neurons of flies and found that PLD3:p. V232M associated with AD was less capable at rescuing Aβ42arc-toxicity than wild-type PLD3 (PLD3WT) using multiple assays, including lifespans, negative geotaxis, memory, and morphology-based assays (assays described in [17-19]) [32]. PLD3WT rescued the Aβ42arc-toxicity by normalizing antioxidant phospholipid levels but PLD3:p. V232M was significantly less effective in this process. To better understand how PLD3:p.V232M may alter PLD3 activity, the authors used neuron-like, cultured cells (SH-SY5Y) and found that PLD3:p.V232M was less glycosylated than PLD3WT. Demirev and colleagues further found that lysosome function was disrupted by PLD3:p. V232M in cultured HeLa cells. As LD require lysosomes for degradation [23], they hypothesized that this related to disruptions in LD processing and could explain the accumulation of LD in Pld3 null mice [35]. While further study into potential connections between PLD3, ROS, and glial LD formation is needed, this work highlights an additional AD-risk gene that may perturb LD metabolism like APOE4 and NDUFAF6.

Mechanistic insights into the role of glia in Aβ42 clearance in Drosophila

Glia seem critical for protecting against AD and accumulating literature has shown that they have multiple neuroprotective functions. In addition to their role in resolving elevated neuronal ROS discussed above [21,36], glia have also been implicated in the clearance of extracellular Aβ42 [37]. Of interest, recent investigations have used Drosophila to highlight the mechanism underlying Aβ42-clearance by glia. It was recently reported that downregulating the Relish transcription factor (fly NF-KB; mediates immune response) [38] and downregulating the glial hedgehog signaling pathway [39] were neuroprotective against Aβ42-neurotoxicity. Expanding upon the data on Relish, another study demonstrated that this effect involves the downstream Relish target, draper (drpr; the orthologue to human MEGF10) [40]. Draper is a glial receptor that mediates phagocytosis and debris clearance during nerve injury [41]. Ray and colleagues found that drpr also modulated Aβ42-aggregate number in fly brains and toxicity as measured by lifespans, vacuole formation in the brain, and negative geotaxis assays [40]. This effect was dosage dependent as mutating drpr increased Aβ42-phenotypes and upregulating drpr reduced Aβ42-phenotypes. Further, neuronal expression of Aβ42arc in flies induced drpr upregulation and increased expression of drpr targets, including the transcription factor AP-1 (composed of c-Jun and Fos) by day 10. Overall, this work provides a needed mechanistic insight as to how glia may reduce Aβ42-plaque formation to combat AD. It is anticipated that effectively clearing extracellular Aβ42-peptides will reduce neuronal oxidative stress caused by Aβ42-toxicity during disease progression and protect against neurodegeneration, discussed below.

Recent studies into glutathione and ROS in the progression of Aβ42-toxicity in flies

It is interesting to note that before neurodegenerative features are observed in Aβ42-expressing flies, these animals show changes in mitochondrial morphology and are more sensitive to ROS compared to age-matched control animals (ages 1-2d) [42,43]. Notably, multiple fly studies have shown glia to be more resistant to Aβ42-induced toxicity than neurons [44,45] except when extremely high Aβ42 expression is induced [37]. Shedding light on these observations, Stapper and Jahn further highlighted a role of the antioxidant, glutathione, in Aβ42-expressing flies [36]. Glutathione cycles between its reduced form, GSH, and an oxidized form, GSSG, and this transition can be measured in flies with a genetically encoded sensor, redox-sensitive Grx1-GFP-2 [46]. Stapper and Jahn expressed this sensor in neurons or glia using the GAL4/UAS system and independently expressed secreted Aβ42arc from neurons with the LexA/LexAOP system [36]. Interestingly, they found that there was a disruption to GSH redox balance in neurons but not glia of Aβ42-expressing flies. This imbalance became progressively worse as animals were aged from 3d to 12d and correlated with an accumulation in insoluble Aβ42 in fly brains. Consistent with the hypothesis that ROS promotes Aβ42-toxicity in disease and that this effect is not specific to the fly, O2−-lipid production in AD mouse and monkey models precede Aβ-plaque formation [47-49]. Suggesting that GSH may combat mitochondrial disruptions in neurons of young Aβ42-flies [42,43], a separate study showed that glutathione S-transferase (GST; fly Gfzf), a glutathione binding protein that promotes GSH formation, was critical for maintaining mitochondrial dynamics in fly wing axons and primary rodent neurons [50]. Overall, these data support that an imbalance to redox mechanisms in neurons is an early feature of Aβ42-toxicity. In fact, a separate study found that expression of a plant-derived alternative oxidase, AOX, in Aβ42arc-flies significantly extended their lifespan while reducing ROS [51], suggesting that correcting redox imbalance may be beneficial in early disease. While more study is needed in flies [36], recent complementary findings using human cultured cells, primary mouse neurons and APP/PS1-mice have shown that reducing ROS can protect against Aβ42-toxicity in mammalian models as well [51-53]. In summary, these data suggest that ROS upregulation, potentially through glutathione depletion, is an early event in AD progression.

Recent evidence from Drosophila that ROS may promote tauopathy progression

As mentioned, AD is defined by the presence of both Aβ-plaques and NFT. Showing ROS accumulation may be an early event that is critical for disease progression in Tau-flies, like Aβ42-expressing flies (discussed above), Lohr and colleagues recently found that expressing Tau in fly neurons causes animals to have a biotin deficiency [54]. Biotin is a vitamin B important for multiple metabolic processes [55]. Supporting that biotin deficiency seen in their Tau-flies contributes to disease progression, Lohr and colleagues revealed that biotin is critical for mitochondria maintenance in fly and iPSC-derived neurons and that its loss induces oxidative stress [54]. Further, loss of Biotinidase (Btnd), an enzyme that produces free biotin from biocytin, significantly enhanced TauR406W-toxicity as shown using multiple approaches and assays (caspase activation, negative geotaxis and vacuole formation). This suggests a direct contribution of mitochondrial disruption to Tau-toxicity. In addition to this work, two recent studies have shown that feeding Tau-flies antioxidants can reduce Tau-induced neurotoxicity. Cowan and colleagues fed Tau-flies the fat soluble antioxidant, vitamin E [56]. This reduced motor deficits in larvae and adults but did not alter pTau levels, suggesting a mechanism prior to NFT formation. In addition to vitamin E, feeding Tau-expressing flies the antioxidant α-lipoic acid (ALA) may also reduce Tau-toxicity with concomitant reductions in O2−-lipid levels in neurons and an increase in GSH levels [57]. Supporting that this is not specific to flies, there is growing evidence that antioxidants can combat Tau-toxicity in mammalian models and AD [9,58-60]. While more studies are needed into the mechanism(s) underlying the benefits of antioxidants in tauopathies, overall these studies highlight the potentially important contribution of ROS to Tau-associated disease progression.

Concluding remarks

The administration of antioxidants remain a potential therapy-of-interest in AD while previous clinical trials have had mixed results [61,62]. These inconclusive trials are potentially due to the inclusion of patients who were at varying disease stages. As mentioned above, ROS-accumulations may be an early feature of disease while Aβ42- and Tau-toxicity likely exacerbate ROS levels by damaging mitochondria [1,5]. Overall, it is tempting to hypothesize that a feedback loop may exist during disease progression where individuals susceptible to ROS, such as APOE4 carriers, are at higher risk for AD as they cannot resolve ROS as efficiently. Once disease onset occurs, Aβ42- and Tau-accumulations may accelerate this increase in ROS levels and promote the rapid disease progression seen in AD patients.

Topic selection

An unbiased analysis of articles was performed using PubMed to identify recent (&lt;5y) manuscripts on AD that used Drosophila, search terms: Drosophila, Aβ42, Tau, APP, APOE, Alzheimer’s. Articles related to ROS and mitochondria were most abundant. A discussion on glial mediated Aβ42-clearance was added as important mechanistic insight on this topic have been recently made using Drosophila.

The fly retina is composed of multiple, well organized ommatidia. (B) Diagram of lipid droplet (LD) formation in glia of the ommatidium when ROS is elevated in the neurons. (C) Representative images from studies showing glial LD formation in response to neuronal ROS in the fly retina. ROS was induced genetically by expressing an RNAi targeting the mitochondrial complex I subunit, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 42 (ND-42), in neurons [21]. Retinas from 1-2d animals were dissected and stained with a dye, BODIPY, which only fluoresces in the presence of neutral lipids. (D) Liu and colleagues investigated the pathway involved in glial LD formation during ROS and defined a number of key players [21,22]. Red indicates components that were directly investigated. Black indicates components of the pathway that need further study in this specific context while supportive data exists in other tissues/situations. Monocarbaxylates were shown indirectly to be involved as the loss of lactate dehydrogenases, which convert lactate to pyruvate for energy production, in both neurons and glia reduced LD formation. Loss of pyruvate dehydrogenases, which convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for entrance into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, in neurons but not glia also disrupted glial LD formation.

Figure 2: APOE status corresponds to ROS-induce glial lipid droplet formation and neurodegeneration.

Studies have shown that APOE is critical for glial LD formation when ROS is elevated in neurons using flies and mice [22,26]. The expression of the AD-protective allele, APOE2, in mutant flies that lacked the endogenous apolipoprotein, Glial Lazarillo (GLaz), demonstrated that this allele could continue to function in the pathway as LD formed at robust numbers and promoted neuron survival in conditions of elevated ROS (symbolized as blue, healthy neuron) [22]. In contrast, expression of the AD-risk allele, APOE4, in GLaz mutant flies shows almost a complete loss of LD formation, indicating that this allele was less functional in this pathway. The loss of glial LD formation was associated with increased neurodegeneration due to ROS (symbolized as red, unhealthy neuron). Overall, this highlights a novel mechanism underlying how APOE4 may confer risk in patients while connecting seemingly independent features of AD, lipid dysregulation and ROS.

**Using Drosophila, the authors demonstrate a novel mechanism by which glia can protect neurons from ROS that involves the transfer of peroxidated lipids from neurons to glia and subsequent formation of glial lipid droplets. Investigations further defined multiple components of this pathway and demonstrated that the pathway is conserved in a mouse model for Leigh syndrome. This is the first thorough characterization of glial lipid droplets, their function in the brain, and their importance in preventing neurodegeneration due to ROS.

**The authors use Drosophila to demonstrate that the transfer of lipids from neurons to glia during neuronal oxidative stress is dependent on apolipoproteins. Importantly, they show for the first time that this process may be critical in Alzheimer’s disease investigating the different alleles of the APOE disease modifier. The APOE4 AD-risk allele was less capable at shuttling peroxidated lipids from neurons to glia for resolution, leaving the neurons susceptible to neurodegeneration and demonstrating that disruptions to glial LD formation may be an important early event in AD.

**Using a primary neuron:astrocyte co-culture model derived from rodents, the authors demonstrate that hyperactive neurons produce excess fatty acids and that these lipids are transferred from neurons to glia where they form lipid droplets. Importantly, this process required the AD gene APOE. This study complements previous work in Drosophila while using a mammalian model, provide additional mechanistic insight into the process of glial LD formation in response to neuronal ROS, and further tie glial LD formation to AD progression.

*The authors performed a notably wide-scale genome-wide association study on &gt;94,000 patients with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease with the goal of defining novel AD-risk loci. They found that many of the loci identified encompass genes that are involved in lipid metabolism, immune responses typically mediated by glia, and Tau/APP interacting proteins. This work defines novel genes for further investigation and highlights a critical role of glia and lipid dysregulation in brain tissue of AD patients.

*The authors identified the endogenous antioxidant, glutathione, for a role in axon mitochondrial dynamics in an unbiased forward genetic screen in Drosophila. The further investigate the function of glutathione in mitochondria fussion in mammalian neurons, finding that its role in this process is conserved. This highlights a previously unknown function of glutathione which may be critical in multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

*The authors use cultured neurons and APP/PS1 mice to show that Aβ42-induced toxicity can be suppressed by the early administration of a drug, mdivi-1, designed to inhibit mitochondrial fragmentation by targeting Drp1. In mice, mdivi-1 was protective against neurodegenerative phenotypes, reduced ROS levels with concomitant reductions in peroxidated lipid levels, and reduced the production of Aβ-plaques. Further highlighting mdivi-1 as a potential AD therapy, the authors did not observe any notable, adverse effects of drug administration in their AD mice.
