INTRODUCTION:

Among persons with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), intrusion errors on subscales that measure proactive semantic interference may be among the earliest behavioral markers of elevated Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain pathology. While there has been considerable cross-sectional work in the area, it is presently unknown whether semantic intrusion errors are predictive of progression of cognitive impairment in aMCI or PreMCI (not cognitively normal but not meeting full criteria for MCI).

METHODS:

This study examined the extent to which the percentage of semantic intrusion errors (PIE) based on total responses on a novel cognitive stress test, the LASSI-L, could predict clinical/cognitive outcomes over an average 26 month period in older adults initially diagnosed with aMCI, PreMCI and normal cognition.

RESULTS:

On the LASSI-L subscale sensitive to proactive semantic interference, a PIE cut-point of 44% intrusion errors distinguished between those at-risk individuals with PreMCI who progressed to MCI over time compared to individuals with PreMCI who reverted to normal on longitudinal follow-up. Importantly, PIE was able to accurately predict 83.3% of aMCI individuals who later progressed to dementia.

DISCUSSION:

These preliminary findings indicate that PIE on LASSI-L subscales that measure proactive semantic interference may be a useful predictor of clinical progression overtime in at-risk older adults.

Introduction

The ability to clinically characterize individuals who may be “at-risk” for neurodegenerative conditions during the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) state or earlier when they present with more subtle cognitive difficulties is critical with the aging of the population [1]. It is becoming increasingly clear that innovative pharmacological treatment approaches will be most effective if administered during the earliest stages of brain disease before the occurrence of widespread multi-system degeneration [2]. Diagnostic aids like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and amyloid β (Aβ) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) generally remain unavailable for use in everyday clinical practice. Moreover, high costs and reluctance to undergo a lumbar puncture to access cerebrospinal fluid to analyze Aβ deposition limits the early and accurate diagnosis of AD [3]. Clinicians commonly diagnose patients with probable Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related disorders in a clinical setting by examining their physical health, medical history, and the administration of traditional neurocognitive assessments. Thus, the “gold standard” to detect cognitive change early and monitor disease progression continues to be the evaluation of cognitive abilities [2, 4].

The challenge confronted by both clinical researchers and clinicians is that traditional cognitive assessment paradigms such as delayed recall and rate of forgetting are ill-suited to identify the subtle changes in cognition that manifest during the preclinical stages of AD and early MCI [1, 2, 4]. Although the earliest cognitive manifestations of AD have not been fully characterized, there are specific cognitive vulnerabilities that have been found to be highly implicated in early AD, such as increased semantic interference or increased intrusion errors on word list learning tasks [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

Most traditional memory tests assess performance during optimal examination conditions, which leads to increased use of individualized learning strategies that might account for considerable performance variability [2]. This shortcoming has led to the creation of cognitive stress paradigms that provide semantic cues at both acquisition and retrieval in which participants must learn competing lists of target words belonging to identical semantic categories.

Recent findings have suggested that these “cognitive stress tests” may be sensitive to detecting early cognitive changes present in both preclinical [12, 13] and prodromal AD [9]. For instance, the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI) has been highly associated with increased total and regional Aβ load in neuropsychologically normal community-dwelling elders [13], as well as volumetric loss and cortical thinning among those with early amnestic MCI (aMCI) [14, 15]. This subscale has also successfully differentiated between aMCI and PreMCI patients with suspected AD from cognitively unimpaired elderly controls (CN) [16]. Further, semantic intrusion errors on tests sensitive to proactive interference (PSI) or frPSI has differentiated aMCI patients who are amyloid positive from aMCI patients who are amyloid negative [2, 9] as well as middle-age asymptomatic offspring of a parent with late-onset AD [17].

In previous investigations, we identified older adults with PreMCI (individuals that were not cognitively normal but did not meet formal criteria for aMCI). An individual was identified as PreMCI if one of two conditions were met: 1) normal clinical examination with a global Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) [18] of 0 and memory deficits on objective neuropsychological testing or 2) abnormal clinical evaluation with a Global CDR of 0.5 but normal neuropsychological test results. Both PreMCI groups had a considerably greater risk of progressing to a formal diagnosis of MCI or dementia compared to healthy, cognitively normal participants [19]. To our knowledge, there have been no longitudinal studies that have examined the association between semantic intrusion errors and the longitudinal progression of PreMCI to a formal diagnosis of MCI or, conversely, a return to a cognitively normal state over time. Further, the association between semantic intrusion errors and the progression to dementia among those with aMCI has not been examined.

The prognostic implication of these semantic intrusions related to cognitive change over time could have potentially important clinical and research implications in the transition of PreMCI and aMCI to more severely impaired states.

Methods

We recruited 116 older adults who participated in either the 1Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), Clinical Core at Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, Florida, or as part of an RO1 study on cognitive aging funded by the National Institute of Health (Dr. Loewenstein, Principal Investigator) at the University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine. Both studies are longitudinal investigations using identical assessment methods and diagnostic criteria, including annual clinical and neuropsychological evaluations.

Participants were recruited through outreach events, public announcements, or referrals to participate in the study. Demographic information for participants is depicted in Table 1. The neuropsychological assessment batteries used for diagnostic purposes were identical, as is the clinician-administered standard clinical assessment protocol, including the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) [18] and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [20]. These measures are described in the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below.

As part of the testing protocol, all participants were administered the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales for Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L), which was not used for diagnostic classification to avoid potential circularity. Diagnostic groups were classified using the following criteria:

Stable Cognitively Normal (CN)

Participants were classified as stable CN if the following criteria were met: a) no subjective cognitive complaints made by the participant and/or a collateral informant; b) no evidence by clinical evaluation, history of memory, or other cognitive decline after interviewing the participant and the informant; c) Global CDR scale score of 0; d) all memory tests [e.g., Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Revised (HVLT-R) [21], delayed paragraph recall from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set (NACC UDS) [22]] and non-memory measures [e.g., Category Fluency [23], Trails A and B [24], WAIS-IV Block Design subtest [25]] were no less than 1.0 SD below normal limits for age, education, and language group. All participants classified as Stable CN had to meet the criteria for CN at baseline and final follow-up.

aMCI Who Progressed to Dementia

Participants who met criteria for aMCI: a) fulfilled Petersen’s criteria [26] for MCI, b) had subjective cognitive complaints reported by the participant and/or collateral informant, c) had a Global CDR scale score of 0.5; d) impaired delayed recall (i.e., 1.5 SD or greater, below normal limits for age, education, and language group for either the HVLT-R or delayed paragraph recall from the NACC UDS. All participants in this subgroup met all criteria for aMCI at baseline and progressed to a dementia diagnosis at or before their last follow up evaluation. The criteria for dementia used in both studies was a Global CDR of 1.0 or greater, indicating functional deficits, and neuropsychological performance on memory tests that were 2.0 SD or greater, below normal limits for age, education, and language group.

PreMCI

A diagnosis of aMCI is typically made following the clinical judgment of cognitive decline confirmed by neuropsychological tests [26]. There is increasing recognition, however, that certain individuals do not meet formal criteria for aMCI yet cannot be classified as cognitively normal, as seen in systems such as NACC where an individual can be classified as “Impaired not MCI” [27].

Participants with PreMCI were divided into two subtypes previously described by Loewenstein and colleagues [19] as being at greater risk for progression to a formal MCI state or dementia: 1) PreMCI Clinical and 2) PreMCI Neuropsychological.

PreMCI Clinical

PreMCI Clinical cases included individuals who were judged to have sufficient impairment on the CDR demonstrated by a global score of 0.5 (which would place them in the MCI category). However, they had neuropsychological test scores within the normal range (i.e., all memory and non-memory neuropsychological test scores were less than 1.0 SD below normal limits for age, education, and language group, as would be expected of the CN group.

PreMCI Neuropsychological

PreMCI Neuropsychological cases included individuals with whom the experienced clinician did not judge to have evidence of clinically significant decline after the clinical assessment protocol was administered. Those classified as PreMCI Neuropsychological had a Global CDR of 0 but scored 1.5 SD or more below normal limits for age, education, and language group on memory tests, as is expected of the aMCI group.

Progression or Reversion of PreMCI participants

Individuals with PreMCI were determined to have progressed to aMCI if they had not met the criteria described for aMCI at their follow-up evaluation (n = 22). Of these 22 individuals, 12 were originally PreMCI Clinical and 10 were originally PreMCI Neuropsychological.

Individuals with PreMCI were determined to have reverted to CN status if they met the CN group’s criteria at their follow-up evaluation (n = 25). This group of PreMCI individuals consisted of 10 PreMCI Clinical cases and 15 PreMCI Neuropsychological cases.

The above classifications resulted in four groups: 1) Stable CN, 2) PreMCI Progressors who progressed to a formal diagnosis of aMCI, 3) PreMCI Non-Progressors, who remained PreMCI, or reverted to a diagnosis of CN, 4) aMCI Progressors, who progressed to dementia during follow-up. These four progression groups are depicted in Figure 1.

LASSI-L

This cognitive stress test represents a novel paradigm that employs controlled learning and cued recall to maximize the storage of a list of target words representing three semantic categories [28]. Participants are tested in their preferred language (English versus Spanish). The LASSI-L has been shown to be culturally fair in either language [29].

During LASSI-L administration, the examinee is instructed to remember a list of 15 common words: fruits, musical instruments, or articles of clothing (five words per category). There are two presentations of the first list. The first presentation is followed by a free recall and a cued recall trial. The second presentation is followed by a cued recall trial only. The cued recall after the second presentation is a measure of maximum storage capacity (Trial A2). A unique aspect of this paradigm is the presentation of a second competing list of words presented in the same manner as the first list. Immediately following the second cued recall trial of List A, List B is presented. The second list has different words but shares the identical semantic categories, which elicits a considerable amount of proactive semantic interference (PSI) (measured on Trial B1). Unlike other memory measurement paradigms, the re-administration and subsequent recall of this second list of words measures an individual’s ability to recover from the effects of PSI (Trial B2).

In this study, we employed a ratio that accounts for intrusion errors as a percentage of total responses on two indices that have been shown to be highly sensitive to cognitive impairment. The ratio is denoted as follows: Total Intrusion Errors/ (Total Intrusion Errors + Total Correct Responses) for LASSI-L Cued B1 (a measure of susceptibility to PSI) and LASSI-L Cued B2 recall (a measure of recovery from PSI).

Statistical Analyses

We employed a series of one-way analyses of variance and covariance for interval level variables for the initial comparisons between groups with different patterns of cognitive decline or recovery (e.g., progression to MCI or dementia, reversion to normal cognition). Chi-square analyses were used to analyze the categorical variables.

ROC analyses were employed using Youden’s criteria, which revealed sensitivity, specificity, and an area under the ROC curve to determine optimal cut-points for Cued B1 and Cued B2 that successfully distinguished Stable CN from aMCI participants that had progressed to dementia.

We then used these cut-points for the different diagnostic groups constituted based on baseline diagnosis and final diagnostic outcome. For these contrasts, we conducted Chi-square analyses at p&lt;.05. Individual contrasts between specific groups (e.g., PreMCI who progressed to MCI versus PreMCI who reversed to CN) were also examined using chi-square analyses, employing Yate’s Correction for Discontinuity.

Results

As depicted in Table 1, Stable CN participants were younger (70.6 years; SD = 6.9) than the PreMCI Progressors (77.1 years; SD 6.9) and the aMCI Progressors (76.2 years; SD = 6.9). As expected, the aMCI Progressors had lower average MMSE scores than the other three groups (who had equivalent MMSE scores). There were no group differences in terms of sex or ethnicity. The average follow-up interval between study groups was 26.5 months, and there were no differences between groups when it comes to average follow-up.

As depicted in Table 1, aMCI Progressors had the highest PIE ratio on the LASSI-L Cued B1 and Cued B2 trials. Stable CN participants had a lower PIE ratio, relative to the aMCI Progressors, but did not differ from PreMCI Non-Progressors.

Derivation of ROC Curves

We derived the optimal cut-point that distinguished our Stable CN group and aMCI Progressors using ROC analyses. As indicated in Table 2, there was a robust area explained under the ROC curve (.905; p&lt;.001). Using Youden’s criteria, a cut-point of.44 (PIE ratio on Cued B1) yielded a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 86.3% [See Figure 1]. For the PIE ratio on Cued B2, the area explained under the ROC curve was similarly robust (.919; p&lt;.001). Using Youden’s criteria, a cut-point of.24 (PIE ratio for Cued B2) yielded a sensitivity of 88.9% and specificity of 86.3%.

We subsequently employed cut-offs determined by ROC analyses on Cued B1 to determine the extent to which the derived PIE ratios could differentiate among the four diagnostic groups. As presented in Table 3, a Cued B1 PIE ratio cut-off of.44 classified as impaired, 13.7% of Stable CN, 12.0% of PreMCI Non-Progressors, 45.5% of PreMCI Progressors to aMCI, and 83.3% of aMCI Progressors to dementia [X2 (df = 3) = 37.05; p&lt;.001]. Employing a Cued B2 PIE cut-off of.24, classified as impaired 15.7% of Stable CN, 16.0% of PreMCI Non-Progressors, 40.9 % of PreMCI Progressors to aMCI, and 88.9 % of aMCI Progressors to dementia [X2 (df = 3) = 36.83; p&lt;.001].

As indicated in Table 5, post-hoc Chi-square analysis of PIE between PreMCI Progressors and PreMCI Non-Progressors was statistically significant [X2 (df = 1) = 4.98; p = .026]. In contrast, the PIE ratio of.24 on Cued B2 did not differentiate the PreMCI Progressors to MCI versus the PreMCI Non-Progressors in their final evaluation time point [X2 (df = 1) = 2.49; p = .115].

Discussion

There is a growing body of evidence that vulnerability to proactive interference or failure to recover from proactive interference is related to volumetric loss, amyloid deposition, and the loss of functional connectivity among individuals with MCI and preclinical AD [2, 7, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17].

The current investigation is unique in that it represents the first attempt to determine the extent to which the percentage of semantic intrusion errors on tests sensitive to proactive interference at baseline is related to patterns of cognitive outcome over time among at-risk older adults. The study’s strengths include cognitive groups that were carefully formulated using formalized clinical and neuropsychological criteria [9, 18] at both baseline and longitudinal follow-up. In addition to aMCI subjects at baseline, we included different subgroups of older adults diagnosed with PreMCI, a state that has been shown to be associated with increased longitudinal risk for progression to a formal diagnosis of MCI or dementia. [19]. To avoid any circularity in the argument, the LASSI-L was not employed in diagnostic classification.

The present results indicated that baseline intrusion error rates on Cued B1 and Cued B2 recall on the LASSI-L could differentiate stable cognitive normal from aMCI progressors to dementia over 26.5 months with areas under the ROC curve exceeding.90 with high levels of sensitivity and specificity. A particularly striking finding was that PreMCI Progressors to MCI were almost four times as likely to have an intrusion error rate of.44 or greater on Cued B1 recall (susceptible to proactive semantic interference) at baseline as opposed to PreMCI Non-Progressors. No such differences were observed between the PreMCI groups on Cued B2 recall (susceptible to frPSI). This finding indicates that baseline intrusions that occur in the context of proactive interference could distinguish between persons with PreMCI who progress from those who had PreMCI but did not progress.

The practical implication of these results is that an effective threshold could be established for the percentage of intrusion errors that can differentiate those individuals with PreMCI who progressed to a formal MCI state or dementia versus those persons with PreMCI who reverted to normal cognition overtime. Notably, a high percentage of intrusion errors related to proactive interference and the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference at baseline were also identified in the vast majority of aMCI to dementia upon longitudinal follow-up. This is consistent with recent findings that word list intrusions and qualitative errors on the Rey Auditory Learning Test in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort were considerably more effective than total correct responses in predicting progression to dementia among CN individuals [10]. In previous work, we have found that susceptibility to proactive semantic interference constitutes a longitudinal risk factor of progression of aMCI to dementia, although intrusion errors were not specifically examined [30]. We have also previously found that proactive semantic interference intrusion errors are related to levels of amyloid load in older adults with aMCI [9].

The LASSI-L paradigm has been referred to as a “cognitive stress test” due to the use of specific competing semantic categories designed to elicit semantic interference and provide more opportunities for intrusion errors to occur, relative to standard list learning tasks, allowing for comprehensive analyses of intrusion responses. Semantic intrusions on the LASSI-L account for 85% more of all intrusion errors making it unique from other testing paradigms [2, 31]. The current investigation demonstrates that high baseline levels of proactive semantic interference intrusion errors were related to different outcomes in PreMCI and aMCI participants. This indicates that a certain threshold of such intrusions may have prognostic utility in predicting cognitive progression over an average period of over 26 months.

Post-hoc tests revealed that among those diagnosed as PreMCI Clinical versus PreMCI Neuropsychological, the percentage of proactive interference semantic intrusion errors was equally effective in predicting progression to MCI or reversion to CN. This is not surprising in that our previous work shows that both types of PreMCI have similar patterns and rates of progression to a formal diagnosis of MCI [19]. In additional post-hoc analyses, we found no evidence in this study that Hispanic ethnicity, age, or sex influenced the obtained results, consistent with our recent findings [29] and demonstrating that the LASSI-L is equally effective diagnostically among Hispanics and non-Hispanics.

Limitations of the current findings were modest sample sizes and a lack of neuroimaging to determine how proactive interference intrusion errors tracked with amyloid deposition and volumetric loss. Thus, our findings need to be confirmed with studies including larger sample sizes with extended follow-up periods, as we are aware that PreMCI and early MCI states may show different patterns over a longer follow-up period. Longitudinal neuroimaging measures would also provide useful information regarding how proactive semantic interference intrusion errors map on to biological changes within the brain over time.

There is increasing interest in determining whether semantic intrusion errors result from incomplete storage and consolidation of information reflecting deficits in inhibitory systems [32] or source memory [2]. Nonetheless, it has become clear that semantic intrusions have clinical diagnostic and prognostic potential and should be the subject of further research.
