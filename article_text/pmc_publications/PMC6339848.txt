Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze acetyl group removal from histone proteins, leading to altered chromatin structure and gene expression. HDAC2 is highly expressed in adult brain, and HDAC2 levels are elevated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain. We previously reported that neuron-specific splice isoforms of Endophilin-B1 (Endo-B1), promote neuronal survival, but are reduced in human AD brain and mouse models of AD and stroke. Here we demonstrate that HDAC2 suppresses Endo-B1 expression. HDAC2 knockdown or knockout enhances expression of Endo-B1. Conversely, HDAC2 overexpression decreases Endo-B1 expression. We also demonstrate that neurons exposed to Aβ increase HDAC2 and reduce histone H3 acetylation while HDAC2 knockdown prevents Aβ induced loss of histone H3 acetylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase-3 activation and neuronal death. The protective effect of HDAC2 knockdown was abrogated by Endo-B1 shRNA and in Endo-B1-null neurons, suggesting that HDAC2-induced neurotoxicity is mediated through suppression of Endo-B1. HDAC2 overexpression also modulates neuronal expression of mitofusin2 (Mfn2) and mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), recapitulating the pattern of change observed in AD. HDAC2 knockout mice demonstrate reduced injury in the middle cerebral artery occlusion with reperfusion (MCAO/R) model of cerebral ischemia demonstrating enhanced neuronal survival, minimized loss of Endo-B1 and normalized expression of Mfn2. These findings support the hypothesis that HDAC2 represses Endo-B1, sensitizing neurons to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in stroke and AD.


Introduction

Alterations in histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity are associated with neurological disease and injury. HDAC-mediated deacetylation of histone proteins promotes chromatin condensation and gene repression. HDAC inhibition mitigates a broad range of experimental neuropathological phenotypes associated with neurodegenerative diseases, traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke (8, 24, 30). However, the precise mechanism by which HDAC inhibition mediates neuroprotection is not well delineated.

HDAC2 is highly expressed in adult brain (25) and its expression is elevated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (15) and AD mouse models (5, 14–16). Using HDAC2-null and HDAC2-overexpressing mice, recent studies revealed that HDAC2 negatively impacts associative learning and synaptic plasticity through epigenetic repression of genes involved in synaptic structure and function (17, 28). Thus, in AD increased HDAC2 may lead to epigenetic change in gene expression that underlie cognitive impairment. We, and others have reported that increased HDAC2 is observed in ischemia/reperfusion injury and HDAC2 deficiency is neuroprotective in this setting (4, 23). However, it remains unclear how elevated HDAC2 compromises mitochondrial function, metabolism and neuronal viability.

Endophilin-B1 (Endo-B1, Gene name: SH3GLB1), initially characterized as a bax-interacting protein (7, 20, 34, 35), is a multi-functional protein implicated in regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, autophagy and apoptosis (7, 20, 34, 35). We recently reported that neuron specific splice isoforms of Endo-B1 (Endo-B1b and Endo-B1c) displays pro-survival properties in neurons (38). The neuron-specific isoforms promote maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, which likely underlies their neuroprotective potency (38). We further showed that Endo-B1b/c expression is down regulated in the ischemic penumbra in a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model while Endo-B1-null mice develop larger regions of infarction (38). Neuron-specific Endo-B1b/c isoforms are also selectively reduced in brain tissue from AD patients, in brain tissue from an AD mouse model and in β-amyloid (Aβ)-treated cultured neurons (37). These findings suggest that Aβ toxicity or ischemia/reperfusion injury may suppress expression of Endo-B1b/c. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the suppression of Endo-B1b/c expression occurs are not known.

In the present study we demonstrate that HDAC2 suppresses Endo-B1b/c expression and enhances the sensitivity of neurons to Aβ toxicity and MCAO/R. HDAC2 knockdown in cultured neurons restores Endo-B1b/c protein levels and protects against Aβ-induced mitochondrial damage, caspase activation and neuronal cell death. HDAC2 genetic deficiency also blocks the loss of Endo-B1b/c and enhances neuronal survival in an MCAO/R model of stroke. Conversely, HDAC2 overexpression suppresses Endo-B1 expression and enhances caspase-3 activation in cultured neurons. These findings, along with HDAC2-mediated changes in mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins, suggest that HDAC2-mediated regulation of Endo-B1b/c and mitochondrial dynamics in response to Aβ toxicity and ischemic insult sensitizes neurons to stress-induced damage. Data reported here also implicate HDAC2 as a mediator of gene expression change that alters mitochondrial dynamics and apoptotic signaling in AD and cerebral ischemia.

Materials and Methods

Human Tissue

Cortical tissue (inferior parietal lobule) from autopsies of neuropathologically confirmed AD and control patients was obtained from the University of Washington Alzheimer’s disease Research Center brain tissue repository. A total of 20 samples (7 males and 13 females) were used. The mean age was 85.5, and post-mortem interval was less than 11 hours in all cases and less than 7 hours in all but 4 cases with the mean interval being 4.7 hours. Each case underwent comprehensive neuropathological examination according to NIA-Reagan Criteria (19), which incorporate Braak staging for neurofibrillary tangle distribution (6) and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s disease (CERAD) criteria for neuritic plaque density (27). According to these criteria, there is a high likelihood that a patient’s dementia is due to AD when neuropathological examination reveals high cortical Braak stage (V-VI) combined with frequent CERAD neuritic plaques. In our study, all AD cases (Braak V-VI) also had frequent CERAD neuritic plaques while controls (Braak I-II) had CERAD absent to sparse scores. Sampling was performed with appropriate consent and with institutional review board approval.

Animals

C57BL/6 mice were obtained from The Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Endo-B1 deficient mice (34) were obtained from Dr. Hong-Gang Wang (Penn State College of Medicine) and Endo-B1−/− animals were generated as previously described (38). HDAC2-deficient mice lacking exons 5 and 6 on an FVB x C57BL/6 background (Hdac2tm1.2Rdp/J, stock number 012640) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Heterozygotes were mated and the offspring genotyped as described (17) to obtain HDAC2+/+, HDAC2+/− and HDAC2−/− animals for experiments. The University of Washington institutional animal care committee approved all animal experiments.

Plasmid construction and lentivirus production

Production of DNA constructs and lentivirus for EGFP (36), control shRNA (36), and human Endo-B1c (38) and verification of their efficacy have been described. Endo-B1 shRNA pLKO.1 plasmids (MISSION shRNA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and one sequence (CCGGCCTACTTAGAACTTCTCAATTCTCGAGAATTGAGAAGTTCTAAGTAGGTTTTTG) verified for its efficiency (see Fig. 3A) was replaced with EGFP cDNA in place of the puromycin-resistant gene before lentiviral packaging. The mouse HDAC2 gene (NCBI Reference Sequence NP_032255.2) synthesized as a 1.5 kb gBlocks fragment was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). NheI and XmaI sites were inserted at the ends of the gene to cut out the gene and clone it into our pSico-CMV-NheI-hBif1-XmaI-FLAG expression vector. A mouse HDAC2 shRNA sequence (TRCN0000039397) was obtained from the RNAi Consortium at the Broad Institute and the targeting sequence was cloned into pLKO.1 plasmid described above using synthetic oligos. All of the PCR-cloned sequences in these vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Neuronal culture and mitochondrial membrane potential

Postnatal cortical neurons from newborn pups (within 24 hours of birth) of C57BL/6, Endo-B1 knockout, HDAC2 wild type or HDAC2 knockout mice were prepared (39) and maintained (37) as previously described. One day after plating, cultures were infected with lentivirus at 5 MOI, unless otherwise indicated, for 3 days before treatment with 10 μM Aβ25–35 peptide or inactive control Aβ35–25 peptide (Bachem, Torrence, CA; trifluoroacetate salt solubilized in water) for 24 hr. Neuronal viability was assessed morphologically as we previously described (39). In brief, the percent neuronal death was determined by counting cells in two marked regions of interest (1 mm2) before and after each intervention at established time points. Viable neurons have a smooth membrane and extend neurites two times the length of the soma. The ratio of viable neurons counted at the start and end of an experiment was used to determine the percent neuronal loss. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using the JC-1 dye as previously described (38).

Immunoblotting

To prepare protein lysates, cultured neurons were directly scraped into lysis buffer, while frozen brain tissue was pulverized on dry ice and then sonicated, in SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8). Protein samples (10–30 μg) were separated under denaturing conditions using 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and electroblotted onto PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad), followed by 30 min fixation with 0.4% paraformaldehyde. Membranes were blocked in a blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.05% thimerosal in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibody in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.05% thimerosal and 0.2% NaN3. After washing in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000; GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) diluted in the blocking buffer. After rinses with PBST, membranes were developed with SuperSignal West Pico (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) or Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare). Films were scanned and band intensity was digitized and quantified using NIH Image J software and normalized against β-actin values followed by further normalization, when necessary, against relevant control conditions. Previously probed membranes were treated with 0.2% NaN3 in the blocking buffer to inactivate horseradish peroxidase activity or with fresh Tris-Cl buffer (62.5 mM, pH 6.8) containing 2% SDS and 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol (65°C, 25 min, twice) to strip off antibodies. Primary antibodies reagent sources were: anti-endophilin B1 (clone 30A882.1.1, 1:1000) from Imgenex (San Diego, CA), anti-HDAC2 (clone HDAC2–62, 1:5000) and anti-β-actin (clone AC-15, 1:2500) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), anti-activated caspase-3 (1:2000; #9661) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), anti-endophilin B2 (SH3GLB2 antibody: 1:1500; #15897–1-AP) and anti-Mff (1:2000; #17090–1-AP) from Proteintech (Rosemont, IL), anti-acetyl-histone H3 (1:2000; #06–599) from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA), anti-Mfn1 (H-65, 1:1000) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX), anti-Mfn2 (1:2000; #ab124773) from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), and anti-Drp1 (clone 8/DLP1, 1:1000) from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA).

Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model of stroke

Male HDAC2+/+, HDAC2+/− and HDAC2−/− mice (25–30 g; approx. 12–16 weeks old) were subjected to MCAO/R with 45 minute occlusion as we previously described (4). Successful occlusion and reperfusion was confirmed using a Laser Doppler Perfusion Monitor (Moor Instruments). Brains were removed 48 hours post reperfusion. Nine 1 mm slices were made for 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining to measure infarct volume (12). From a separate cohort of animals cortical tissue in the penumbra dorsal to the infarct was dissected using TTC-stained adjacent slices as a reference, and kept frozen until analysis.

Statistics

Student’s t-tests, one-way and two-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc multiple comparison analyses were used where applicable. All the results are presented as mean ± standard error. Results were considered statistically significant when p ≤ 0.05 using Prism Software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).

Results

HDAC2 regulates Endo-B1 levels in primary cultured neurons

We previous demonstrated (37) that neuroprotective Endo-B1b/c protein was selectively decreased in human AD cortex specifically pathologically affected brain regions. We also observed that reduced Endo-B1b/c protein in the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mouse model of AD. These findings suggest that loss of the neuroprotective functions of Endo-B1b/c may influence AD pathology, but the mechanism by which Endo-B1b/c expression is lost in AD or AD models was not understood. Since HDAC2 expression is increased in AD (5, 14–16), we sought to determine if HDAC2 activity leads to epigenetic modulation of Endo-B1.

To determine if HDAC2 impacts Endo-B1 expression we employed a lentiviral vector expressing shRNA directed against HDAC2. We observed that shRNA mediated knockdown of HDAC2 in cultured cortical neurons significantly increased all isoforms of Endo-B1 including neuron specific Endo-B1b/c (which run as a single band on Western blots, Fig. 1A and B). HDAC2 shRNA had no impact on the expression of another Endophilin-B family member, Endophilin-B2, demonstrating a specific effect on Endo-B1 (Fig. 1C). Knockdown of another class I HDAC, HDAC3, had no effect on Endo-B1 expression (data not shown). Neurons cultured from HDAC2 knockout (HDAC2KO) also demonstrate elevated Endo-B1b/c expression with little change seen with Endo-B1a (Fig. 1D and E). Cortical brain lysates from HDAC2KO mice also demonstrated increased Endo-B1b/c (Fig. 1F). Since HDAC2 knockout specifically down regulates expression of Endo-B1b/c isoforms, it is possible that deletion of HDAC2 may result in compensatory gene expression changes that restore Endo-B1a expression while neuron-specific Endo-B1b/c isoforms are reduced.

Lentiviral induction of HDAC2 overexpression in cultured cortical neurons resulted in a significant reduction in both Endo-B1b/c and Endo-B1a protein, accompanied by enhanced apoptotic activation (activated caspase-3) (Fig. 2). These findings demonstrate that up- and down-regulation of HDAC2 reciprocally modulate neuronal expression of neuroprotective Endo-B1b/c. Additionally, we observed that acute changes in HDAC2 activity cause comparable up- or down-regulation between Endo-B1a and Endo-B1b/c whereas chronic loss of HDAC2 specifically increases the expression of Endo-B1b/c.

HDAC2 knockdown blocks Aβ-induced cell death while restoring Endo-B1b/c expression in primary cultured neurons

Increased HDAC2 expression has been observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (5, 14, 15, 17) and experimentally linked to synaptic loss and cognitive dysfunction secondary to repressed expression of genes coding for a variety of synaptic proteins (15, 17). However, additional biological responses associated with increased neuronal HDAC2 have not been characterized. We sought to determine if HDAC2 is directly involved in Aβ–induced neuronal death. The use of the Aβ in cell biology experiments can be complicated by the propensity of the peptide to self-aggregate. To create a more stable reagent to study Aβ toxicity in vitro, a smaller peptide Aβ25–35 has been utilized (1, 21). We previously reported that Aβ25–35 treatment induced neuronal caspase-3 activation that was attenuated by Endo-B1c overexpression (37). We replicated these findings using full-length oligomerized Aβ1–42 (Fig. 3A), thereby rationalizing the use of Aβ25–35 to emulate Aβ toxicity in subsequent experiments.

Treatment with Aβ25–35 resulted in significant activation of caspase-3 and neuronal cell death (Fig. 3B and C). Aβ25–35 treatment of cultured neurons also significantly increased HDAC2 protein and decreased levels of N-terminally acetylated histone H3 (Fig. 3D and E). Infection with lentivirus expressing shRNA against HDAC2 prior to Aβ25–35 treatment strongly mitigated Aβ25–35 toxicity and histone deacetylation (Fig. 3B, C and E). Aβ25–35-induced caspase-3 activation was also substantially suppressed in HDAC2KO neurons (Fig. 3F). These findings suggest that increased HDAC2 activity contributes to Aβ toxicity and potentially AD pathogenesis.

Since Aβ suppresses Endo-B1b/c expression (37) and HDAC2 is required for neuronal apoptosis secondary to Aβ treatment, we hypothesized that Aβ–induced suppression of Endo-B1b/c expression requires HDAC2. We employed HDAC2 KO neurons to determine if HDAC2 is required for the reduction of neuronal Endo-B1 induced by Aβ. As expected, Endo-B1b/c is reduced in wild-type neurons following Aβ25–35 treatment but not in HDAC2 knockdown neurons (Fig. 4A and 4B). Additionally, HDAC2 knockdown was unable to confer neuroprotection from Aβ toxicity when Endo-B1 was simultaneously knocked down (Fig. 4C) demonstrating that the neuroprotective action of HDAC2 knockdown involves Endo-B1. Similarly, in Endo-B1-null neurons HDAC2 shRNA treatment minimally attenuated Aβ25–35-induced neuronal death (Fig. 4D). These findings suggest that HDAC2 mediates Aβ toxicity, at least in part, by repressing Endo-B1b/c expression.

HDAC2 knockdown prevents Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction

We previously demonstrated that Aβ toxicity suppresses Endo-B1b/c expression and that restoring its expression prevents Aβ-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (37). Since HDAC2 suppresses Endo-B1b/c expression while mediating Aβ toxicity (see Fig. 4), it prompted us to determine if HDAC2 also influences Aβ-induced changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Consistent with the observation that HDAC2 knockdown sustained Endo-B1b/c expression and cell viability despite Aβ25–35 treatment (Fig. 4), HDAC2 knockdown also maintained mitochondrial membrane potential, as measured by JC-1 fluorescence, in the presence of Aβ25–35 (Fig. 5A). These findings collectively suggest that HDAC2 suppression of Endo-B1b/c mediates a decline in mitochondrial function caused by Aβ toxicity. We have previously reported that Endo-B1b/c promotes mitochondrial elongation (38), providing a rationale to examine changes in other mitochondrial fission/fusion proteins that might also underlie HDAC2-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction in Aβ toxicity.

HDAC2 overexpression reduced mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) levels, without influencing a closely related homolog, Mfn1 (Fig. 5B and C). This is consistent with a prior observation that Mfn2, but not Mfn1, regulates mitochondrial length in cultured mouse neurons (36). Conversely, mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) protein, a receptor for the fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), was significantly increased with little change in Drp1 (Fig. 5B and C). Thus, HDAC2 overexpression suppresses mitochondrial fusion/elongation factors (Mfn2 and Endo-B1b/c) and increases one fission protein (Mff), suggesting that HDAC2 mediates Aβ toxicity, in part through increased mitochondrial fission.

HDAC2-regulated fission/fusion proteins are altered in human AD

To further validate the importance of the HDAC2-mediated repression of Endo-B1 (Fig. 2) and modulation of other key mitochondrial fission/fusion proteins (Fig. 5), we sought to determine if these proteins are also altered in AD patient brain. In addition to decreased expression of Endo-B1b/c we have previously reported (37), we observed that that Mfn2 was decreased by 58%, while Mff was elevated 145% in samples from AD patients (Braak V-VI) compared to age-matched control samples (Braak I-II) (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the up regulation of HDAC2 observed in AD likely leads to altered expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial length including Endo-B1b/c, Mfn2 and Mff. The functional convergence of these proteins onto mitochondrial dynamics could result in excessive mitochondrial fission, thus compromising mitochondrial bioenergetic function in AD.

HDAC2 deficiency confers resistance to cerebral ischemia

Based upon our in vitro findings demonstrating a negative impact of HDAC2 on neuronal viability, we sought to determine if HDAC2 promotes neuronal damage after injury in vivo. To address this question, male HDAC2+/+, HDAC2+/− and HDAC2−/− mice were subjected to 45 minute MCAO/R. Infarct volume 48 hours after reperfusion was significantly reduced in HDAC2−/− mice compared to HDAC2+/− and HDAC2+/+ mice (Fig. 7A). To determine if expression of Endo-B1b/c and Mfn2 expression were differentially impacted by MCAO/R in HDAC2KO mice, Western blot was performed on ipsilateral penumbra tissue. Both Endo-B1b/c and Mfn2 were significantly reduced by MCAO/R (compared to contralateral cortex) in HDAC2+/+ mice, but displayed little change in HDAC2-/- mice (Fig. 7B, C and D). Taken together, these findings suggest that ischemia/reperfusion injury leads to HDAC2-dependent cellular damage and suppression of at least two regulators of mitochondrial function, Endo-B1b/c and Mfn2.

Discussion

Endo-B1b/c are novel neuron-specific splice isoforms of Endo-B1 with pro-survival function in neurons (38). We recently reported that expression of neuroprotective Endo-B1 isoforms is selectively decreased in AD brain and that Endo-B1 deficiency exacerbated the phenotype of an AD mouse model (37). Since HDAC2 expression is elevated in AD brain (5, 14–16), we sought to determine if HDAC2 is part of a regulatory pathway that suppresses Endo-B1 in response to Aβ toxicity. Here, we report that HDAC2 overexpression in cultured neurons suppresses Endo-B1 expression while enhancing caspase-3 activation and cell death. Conversely, HDAC2 knockdown protects against Aβ-induced mitochondrial damage, caspase activation and cell death while restoring Endo-B1b/c expression. The protective effect of HDAC2 knockdown is greatly diminished by Endo-B1 shRNA and in Endo-B1-null neurons. HDAC2 overexpression also alters expression of mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins, recapitulating changes observed in AD patient brain. The HDAC2KO condition also suppressed stroke-induced infarct formation and the associated loss of Endo-B1b/c, indicating that HDAC2 functions to suppress Endo-B1 expression in vivo. These findings implicate HDAC2 as an important regulator of protein expression in neurodegeneration and brain injury by suppressing expression of Endo-B1.

HDAC2 regulates Endo-B1 expression and Aβ toxicity

Accumulation of Aβ is a hallmark of AD neuropathology and the presence of toxic Aβ has recently been associated with elevated HDAC2 expression and activity (5, 14–16). In these studies, the functional consequence of HDAC2 activation was linked with suppression of genes involved in memory and synaptic plasticity (5, 14, 15), suggesting one HDAC2-dependent molecular mechanism that leads to synapse loss and cognitive impairment. The present study suggests that HDAC2 may cast a broader regulatory net by impacting mitochondrial function and neuronal viability. We identify one such gene, Endo-B1, for which the neuron-specific isoforms are selectively decreased in AD (37). It remains to be determined whether HDAC2 regulates Endo-B1b/c levels through transcriptional repression as demonstrated for the regulation of synaptic proteins by HDAC2 (15, 40). Our experiments demonstrate that HDAC2 knockdown in cultured neurons increases levels of mRNA for both neuron-specific (Endo-B1b and Endo-B1c) and ubiquitously expressed (Endo-B1a) isoforms. Although the amplitude of change in expression was modest, the findings are consistent with results at the protein level for HDAC2 knockdown (Fig. 1B), overexpression (Fig. 2) and ischemia (4, 38). In contrast to acutely induced HDAC2 knockdown, chronic deletion of HDAC2 resulted in isoform-specific increases in Endo-B1b/c levels with little change in Endo-B1a (Fig. 1E and F). We suspect that the neuron-specific isoforms of Endo-B1 are differentially regulated relative to the ubiquitously expressed Endo-B1a isoform in response to prolonged up- or down-regulation of HDAC2.

We observed that both HDAC2 overexpression and Aβ-induced up regulation influence neuronal viability. This is consistent with our concurrent finding that HDAC2 negatively regulates Endo-B1 expression, since neuron-specific Endo-B1 isoforms promote neuronal survival and mitochondrial integrity (37, 38). We conclude that HDAC2 compromises neuronal viability by repressing Endo-B1 expression. In support of this, we observed that HDAC2 knockdown and Endo-B1c overexpression attenuated Aβ-induced mitochondrial depolarization to the same extent (unpublished observation), suggesting that HDAC2-mediated suppression of neuroprotective Endo-B1 isoforms is a key upstream event in Aβ-induced alteration of mitochondrial function and cell death signaling.

HDAC2 influences expression of mitochondrial regulators in AD

Endo-B1b/c promote mitochondrial elongation in neurons (38). This prompted us to ask if HDAC2 modulates the expression of proteins involved in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. In response to overexpression of HDAC2 in cultured neurons and in AD brain, we observed a significant reduction in Mfn2 and an increase in Mff, a mitochondrial receptor for Drp1. The decline in Mfn2 but not Mfn1 is consistent with our previous findings demonstrating that Mfn2, but not Mfn1, is required for normal mitochondrial morphology and viability in cultured cortical neurons (36). Importantly, Mfn2 was also decreased in the cerebral cortex of AD patients, suggesting that this regulatory pathway is not an artifact of neurons in culture and is consistent with elevated HDAC2 expression in human AD (15). The observed reduction in Endo-B1 and Mfn2, in addition to increased Mff expression is expected to promote mitochondrial fragmentation. We have observed that HDAC2 knockdown prevents mitochondrial fragmentation caused by Aβ treatment (data not shown).

HDAC2-mediated repression of Mfn2 may have additional implications for mitochondrial integrity and neuronal biology in the context of AD. AD is associated with abnormalities in an array of cellular functions linked with mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAM) (3). MAM represents a subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that directly interacts with mitochondria. Recent studies demonstrate that cells derived from AD patients have a significant increase in MAM with concomitant elevation in MAM-associated activities (3). Gamma-secretase activity, which is involved in processing the amyloid precursor protein to form Aβ peptides, is one such activity enriched in the MAM (2). Mfn2 has recently been shown to antagonize tethering between the MAM and the outer mitochondrial membrane (10). Increased MAM formation due to reduced Mfn2 expression is potentially toxic via increased ER–mitochondrial communication with subsequent abnormalities in cellular metabolism and bioenergetics. The presenilin 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2) proteins, whose mutations are causally linked to familial AD, are also enriched in MAMs (2, 29, 31). Importantly, PS2 increases ER-mitochondria tethering by counteracting the negative impact of Mfn2 on tethering (11, 42). Thus, the combined genetic (PS2 mutation) and epigenetic (Mfn2 suppression via HDAC2) changes could accentuate AD pathogenesis by enhancing abnormal levels of communication between ER and mitochondria via MAM tethering. The reduced Mfn2-PS2 interaction may also directly impact MAM-associated activities, especially the gamma-secretase activity that includes PS2 as a catalytic component increasing Aβ production known to occur in MAM (31).

The role of HDAC2 in brain injury

The beneficial effects of HDAC inhibitors in animal models of cerebral ischemia have suggested adverse implications for HDAC activity in stroke (9, 13, 32). Pharmacological HDAC inhibitors are not specific to individual HDACs, making it difficult to define the contributions made by individual HDACs. In the present study we demonstrated using an MCAO/R model of stroke that HDAC2 deficiency confers significant protection from infarction, supporting the idea that ischemia-induced reduction of Endo-B1 in the penumbra (38), is mediated by HDAC2. Recently, HDAC2 deficiency was reported to be neuroprotective in a photothrombotic model of focal brain ischemia (23). In this model HDAC2 up regulation was observed 5–7 days post-stroke and experimental HDAC2 suppression improved stroke outcome only when applied during that time window. Thus, HDAC2 may worsen stroke outcome in multiple different phases of post-stroke recovery although the disparity could also be due to differences between the transient (MCAO/R) vs. permanent (photothrombotic) focal cerebral ischemia models producing distinct time courses of developing excitotoxicity (41).

Excitotoxicity is a common factor in models of brain injury including traumatic and epileptic insults. These paradigms also show HDAC2 up regulation and benefit from the application of HDAC inhibitors (13, 18, 33). Excitotoxicity may be mediated through HDAC2-dependent epigenetic changes impinging on mitochondria, which play a major role in dictating cellular susceptibility to excitotoxicity. We observed a significant ischemia-induced reduction in Mfn2 in wild-type mice, consistent with previous studies (22, 26), but no significant decline in HDAC2-KO animals (Fig. 7D). Reduced Mfn2 expression contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction associated with excitotoxicity (26). The present study suggests that HDAC2 influences ischemic damage by suppressing expression of at least two mitochondria associated neuroprotective proteins, Endo-B1 and Mfn2.

Conclusions

In summary, results reported here in conjunction with previous reports (5, 14–16) collectively support the hypothesis that HDAC2 plays a pivotal role in promoting neuronal degeneration in brain disease and injury. The present findings further extend our understanding of HDAC2’s mechanism of action by demonstrating that mitochondrial function and neuronal viability can be compromised by HDAC2-dependent modulation of proteins that regulate mitochondrial dynamics and neuronal survival. Specifically, HDAC2-dependent suppression of Endo-B1 could predispose neurons to increased vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease and other types of brain injury and disease.

Figure 1. HDAC2 regulates Endo-B1 expression.

A) HDAC2 knockdown increases Endo-B1 protein levels. Postnatal cortical neurons were infected with lentivirus (10 MOI) expressing shRNA directed against HDAC2 or scrambled control shRNA with no known target for 3 days. Endo-B1 expression was analyzed by Western blot along with corroborating the efficacy of HDAC2 shRNA. Blots are shown for a single experiment comparing a set of paired samples (control vs. HDAC2 shRNA) run on a gel (the vertical line represents irrelevant lanes that were cut off) and are representative of 7 independent experiments. B) The levels of the Endo-B1a and Endo-B1b/c bands in HDAC2 shRNA-treated neurons relative to control shRNA-treated neurons were determined for individual blots, as represented in A, by densitometry. After normalization to actin, HDAC2 shRNA-induced changes are presented as averaged “HDAC2 shRNA/control shRNA” ratios (%). **: p&lt;0.001, ***: p&lt;0.01 relative to control shRNA (N = 7). C) HDAC2 knockdown does not elevate Endophilin B2 levels in neurons. Wild-type neurons were infected with control shRNA or HDAC2 shRNA (10 MOI) for 3 days. Extracts were probed for Endophilin B2 (SH3GLB2), and the band intensity was normalized to actin (N = 3). D) Endo-B1b/c protein is elevated in HDAC2KO (−/−) neurons relative to wild-type (+/+) neurons in culture as analyzed by Western blot. Blots are shown for a single experiment comparing a set of paired samples (−/− vs. +/+) run on a gel (the vertical line represents irrelevant lanes that were cut off) and representative of 3 independent experiments. E) The levels of the Endo-B1a and Endo-B1b/c bands in wild-type and HDAC2KO neurons in culture were determined for individual blots, as represented in D, by densitometry. After normalization to actin, the results are presented as averaged “HDAC2KO/HDAC2 wild-type” ratios (%). ***: p&lt;0.01 relative to wild-type neurons (N = 3). F) Endo-B1b/c protein levels in cortex are elevated in HDAC2KO mice. Cortical tissue from 3-month-old wild-type and HDAC2KO animals was dissected out from a 2 mm coronal brain slice at the level of the bregma and protein lysates were assessed for Endo-B1b/c and Endo-B-1a expression by Western blot. The results are presented as averaged “HDAC2KO/ wild-type” ratios (%). ***: p&lt;0.001 relative to wild-type animals (N = 6 animals).

Figure 2. HDAC2 overexpression reduces Endo-B1 levels and promotes caspase-3 activation.

A) Protein extracts from HDAC2KO cortical neurons infected with lentivirus expressing EGFP (5 MOI) or with increasing doses of HDAC2-expressing lentivirus as indicated for 4 days were probed for active caspase-3, Endo-B1, HDAC2 and actin. B) Densitometric quantification of Western blots demonstrates that HDAC2 overexpression significantly suppresses Endo-B1, both “a” and “b/c” isoforms, and increases active caspase-3. The results are presented as averaged ratios of HDAC2 relative to EGFP overexpression. ***: p&lt;0.001 vs. EGFP control (N=3).

Figure 3. HDAC2 deficiency protects primary cortical neurons from Aβ-induced cell death.

A) Oligomerized Aβ1–42 peptide (10 μM) induces caspase-3 activation, which is suppressed by Endo-B1c overexpression, but exacerbated by Endo-B1 knockdown. Protein extracts, obtained 24 hr after Aβ1–42 treatment, from cultured cortical neurons that were infected as indicated were analyzed for activated caspase-3 and actin by Western blot. Representative of N = 2. B) HDAC2 shRNA reduces caspase-3 activation induced by Aβ25–35. Neurons were infected as indicated for three days and treated with Aβ25–35 (toxic) or Aβ35–25 (control) for 24 hrs. The level of active caspase-3 was analyzed by Western blot. *: p &lt; 0.001 compared to Aβ35–25/control shRNA (N = 3). N.S.: Not significantly different from Aβ35–25/control shRNA (N = 3). C) HDAC2 shRNA suppresses Aβ25–35-induced neuronal death. Dead and viable neurons were counted based on morphology (see methods) in cultures infected and treated as indicated. Data represent the percent change in neuronal death at 24 hours after treatment with Aβ25–35 with or without preceding HDAC2 knockdown relative to treatment with control shRNA followed by the control Aβ35–25 peptide. ***: p &lt; 0.001 compared to Aβ25–35 plus control shRNA (N = 3). D) Neurotoxic Aβ25–35 elevates HDAC2 protein expression in cultured cortical neurons compared to Aβ35–25 (control). Aβ-induced changes in HDAC2 levels are presented as % changes relative to non-treated control. *: p&lt;0.05 (N = 4). E) HDAC2 shRNA prevents Aβ25–35-induced reduction in histone H3 acetylation. Neurons were treated as in (B) and assayed for N-terminally acetylated histone H3 and actin expression by Western blot. Aβ-induced changes in acetylated histone H3 levels are presented as % changes relative to non-treated control. *: p&lt;0.05, N.S.: not significant (N = 3). F) HDAC2KO cortical neurons show reduced levels of caspase-3 activation compared with wild-type neurons when treated with Aβ25–35 for 24 hr. The blots are representative of 3 independent experiments.

Figure 4. HDAC2 mediates Aβ toxicity via Endo-B1.

A) Wild type postnatal cortical neurons infected with lentivirus expressing either control or HDAC2 shRNA and treated with Aβ25–35 (toxic) or Aβ35–25 (control) peptide were processed for Endo-B1 and actin expression by Western blot. B) Expression levels are presented as average fold changes by normalizing to Aβ25–35/control shRNA (set at 1.0) in individual experiments after normalization to actin. Aβ25–35 significantly reduced Endo-B1b/c levels, which was prevented by HDAC2 shRNA pretreatment. *: p&lt;0.05, N.S.: not significant (N = 4). C) Wild-type neurons were infected with lentivirus expressing control, HDAC2 and/or Endo-B1 shRNA and treated with Aβ25–35 or control Aβ35–25 peptide. Dead neurons were counted 24 hr after treatment. Data represents the percent change in neuronal death relative to control shRNA infected cultures treated with Aβ35–25. *: p&lt;0.05, N.S.: not significant (N = 3). D) Endo-B1 knockout neurons infected with HDAC2 shRNA expressing lentivirus are substantially less protected from Aβ25–35-induced death compared to WT neurons (shown in B). Endo-B1 knockout neurons were infected with shRNA lentivirus as indicated and then treated with Aβ25–35. Data represents the percent change in neuronal death relative to control shRNA-infected cultures treated with Aβ35–25. *: p&lt;0.05 (N = 3).

Figure 5. Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is mediated by HDAC2.

A) HDAC2 knockdown mitigates Aβ-induced mitochondrial depolarization as revealed by JC-1 fluorescence. Wild-type cortical neurons were infected for shRNA expression as indicated and treated with Aβ25–35 or the control peptide Aβ35–25 for 24 hours and then labeled with the JC-1 dye. Higher red/[green + red] fluorescence indicates greater mitochondrial membrane potential. EGFP fluorescence, used as an infection marker for the control and HDAC2 shRNA virus, was very weak relative to JC-1 green fluorescence and was therefore judged as negligible. The data are represented as the percentage of red relative to total (red + green) fluorescence intensity. *: p&lt;0.01, N.S.; not significant. (N = 3). B) HDAC2-induced changes in the expression of mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins. The same blot used in Fig. 2A containing protein extracts from HDAC2KO cortical neurons infected with lentivirus expressing EGFP (5 MOI) or increasing MOI of HDAC2 lentivirus as indicated was additionally probed for Mfn1, Mfn2, Drp1 and Mff. C) Densitometric quantification of Western blots including the representative blot shown in B) performed for the infection condition of EGFP and 5 MOI HDAC2 lentivirus. Both Mff bands seen in the blot (marked by the bracket in B), which reflect alternatively spliced variants, were included for the quantification of Mff. Significant changes were detected for Mfn2 and Mff (*: p &lt; 0.05, **: p&lt;0.001 vs. EGFP control). No significant change was detected for Mfn1 or Drp1. (N = 3).

Figure 6. Mfn2 and Mff expression are altered in cortical tissue from AD cases.

Representative Western blot analysis of protein extracted from the inferior parietal lobule cerebral cortex of patients at Braak V–VI stages (AD) compared to age-matched control, Braak I-II patients (control). Expression levels after normalization to actin levels demonstrate statistically significant reduction of Mfn2 and elevation of Mff in AD cases compared to age matched controls. *: p&lt;0.01 (N = 10 patients per group).

Figure 7. HDAC2 modulates the response to ischemic injury.

A) HDAC2KO (−/−) mice show reduced sensitivity to ischemic injury in the MCAO/R model. Infarct volume was determined by TTC staining after 45 min MCAO followed by 48 hour reperfusion. *: p&lt;0.05 (N = 7–9 animals per condition). B-D) Ischemia-induced suppression of Endo-B1b/c and Mfn2 is not observed in HDAC2KO mice. Penumbra (ipsilateral) and corresponding uninjured (contralateral) tissue from animals subjected to MCAO/R as in A) was dissected out and protein expression was assessed by Western blot for Endo-B1, Mfn2 and actin. Expression levels are shown after normalization to actin levels. Significant reduction in Endo-B1b/c (C) and Mfn2 (D) ipsilateral to MCAO/R relative to the contralateral side was detected in wild-type (WT) animals, but not in HDAC2KO mice. **: p&lt;0.01 (N = 3 animals per condition).
