Objectives:

The short form or s-allele variant of the serotonin transporter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), as compared with the long form or l-allele variant, has been associated with the presence of cognitive dysfunction, and particularly memory impairment in older adults. This body of cross-sectional work has culminated in the hypothesis that presence of the s-allele predicts greater memory decline in older adults (1). Yet, to date, there are no longitudinal studies which have investigated this issue.

Methods/Design:

Here we examine 109 community-dwelling older adults (mean and SD of age = 70.7±8.7 years) who underwent blood draw for genotyping, cognitive, and psychological testing at baseline, 12-month, and 24-month follow-up.

Results:

Multilevel modeling found that s-allele carriers (ss or ls) performed worse than ll homozygotes at baseline on delayed verbal recall. Yet, s-allele carriers’ memory performance was stable over the two-year follow-up period, while l-allele homozygotes experienced significant memory decline. l-allele homozygote status was associated with both increased cortisol and decreased memory over time, resulting in attenuated verbal memory performance differences compared to s-allele carriers with age.

Conclusions:

Overall, our findings do not support the hypothesis that presence of the 5-HTTLPR s-allele is a marker for memory decline in older adults.

Introduction

The serotonin transporter’s primary function is to remove serotonin from the synapse within neurons of the brain. A complex polymorphism located in the 5-HTTLPR, serotonin transporter gene affects the transcription rate, with the short (s) allele acting less efficiently relative to longer (1) alleles (2). Studies have implicated this polymorphism to impact the development and maintenance of neural systems managing complex emotional and cognitive processing (3, 4). Investigations into the mechanism of action behind these associations have implicated a reciprocal relationship between serotonin and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with serotonin acting to modulate the HPA axis function and vice versa (5).

In older adults, studies have primarily focused on cross-sectional data examining mood and cognitive performance by serotonin transporter genotype status. Research suggests that serotonin interacts with the cholinergic system to impact memory and attention (6). The serotonin transporter s-allele has been found to relate to cognitive performance in general (7), as well as interacting with depression and anxiety symptoms, resulting in poorer global cognitive function (8, 9). However, findings have been mixed – with some studies showing no link between 5-HTTLPR allele status and cognitive functioning in older adults (10). Further, there is some evidence that gender may moderate the relationship between 5-HTTLPR status and memory (11). Previous research from our group demonstrated that presence of the s-allele was associated with higher waking cortisol and lower delayed recall in older adults, with reduced hippocampal volume among s-allele carriers with higher waking cortisol (12). Meta-analyses have further revealed that s-allele status is associated with increased stress sensitivity (13, 14), and increased cortisol reactivity (12, 15).

Most recently, Smith et al. (1) found late-life serotonin depletion in individuals with mild neurocognitive impairment (MCI). These findings suggest that in individuals who already have less efficient serotonin regulation by virtue of their s-allele status, late-life serotonin depletion could exacerbate the cognitive difficulties already present, contributing to cognitive decline, progression to MCI, and perhaps even dementia. Yet, the effects of 5-HTTLPR genotype status over time have rarely been examined. One longitudinal study in older adults found that s-allele carriers experienced a steeper increase in depressive symptoms, as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale, over the course of 7 ½ years than non-carriers (16). However, to date no longitudinal studies have examined the relationship between serotonin transporter polymorphism, cortisol, and cognitive performance in older adults over time. Here, in a two-year, longitudinal investigation of 109 older adults, we hypothesized that there would be longitudinal increases in levels of waking and diurnal cortisol, with a dose dependent associated decline in memory performance in s-allele carriers relative to l-allele homozygotes.

Materials and Methods

Participants

Participants included 109 community-dwelling older adults over age 50 (67 females, 42 males) recruited for a study on stress and cognitive functioning. Recruitment was conducted through advertisements and contacts at local senior centers. All participants provided informed consent per Stanford University IRB guidelines. The initial evaluation included demographics, self-reported current and past medical status, the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR. Participants were excluded if they had an MMSE score &lt;26, a diagnosis of dementia, or an Axis I disorder (within the past two years). Participants were also excluded if they were currently using any systemic corticosteroids, psychotropic medication, short-acting anxiolytics, sedative hypnotics, medications with significant cholinergic or anticholinergic side effects, or any FDA-approved medications for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Demographic information for the whole sample and by 5-HTTLPR genotype status are presented in Table 1.

Materials and Procedure

Participants completed comprehensive cognitive and psychiatric assessments at baseline, 12-month, and 24-month follow up as described elsewhere (12). Our measure of delayed verbal recall was the delayed component, Trial 7, of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (17). Salivary cortisol measurements included waking cortisol (collected by participants in their home immediately upon waking; averaged across two days of collection), as well as 30 minutes later, at 1200h, 1700h, and 2100h. A log-transformed regression calculated diurnal slope using the average of each cortisol collection time point from two days of collection. Further details including details on the genotyping method can be found in O’Hara et al., 2007.

Analysis

Groups were compared at baseline on demographic, clinical, and cortisol variables to determine whether significant differences existed using Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables and a Pearson chi-square test for sex. Trajectories of change over time were estimated through multilevel modeling (18), an approach that tolerates observations missing at random, a common issue in longitudinal studies. Restricted maximum likelihood was used for estimation. An unstructured covariance matrix was specified for all models, and random effects were included in all models. Specifically, random intercepts and slopes for subjects (i.e., models that permitted intercepts and slopes to vary for each participant) were used. Demographic and mood variables were included as covariates in growth models if there were significant differences between groups at baseline. Two separate models were tested: an unconditional growth model (with a fixed effect of time) was used to examine change over time across all participants, and a conditional growth model to examine whether trajectories of change in delayed verbal recall, waking cortisol, and diurnal slope differed depending on 5-HTTLPR status. For the latter model, fixed effects of time, group (5-HTTLPR status), and the group x time interaction were included in the model. 5-HTTLPR status was treated as an ordinal variable in order to conserve power, and time was treated as a continuous variable. Nonlinear (i.e., quadratic) effects of time were considered as well. Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom were used in all growth models, as they have superior power to normal-theory based standard errors when sample sizes are small and when there are unbalanced groups (19). All analyses were conducted using Stata 14.0 (20). Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.

Results

Baseline Characteristics.

One hundred and nine participants contributed data in at least two data collection points (baseline, 12 months, and 24 months later) for the variables of interest (RAVLT Delayed Recall and waking cortisol) and were included in the analyses. There were 89 (82%) participants with complete data for all collection points; 6% had baseline and 24-month data but skipped their 12-month assessment, and 13% had baseline and 12-month data (“dropouts”). There were no differences between participants who dropped out and those who did not on the RAVLT, cortisol measures, age, education, gender, or HTTLPR status (all ps ≥ .211). Of participants in the study sample, 28 (26.5%) were ll homozygotes, 58 (53.2%) were ls heterozygotes, and 23 (21.1%) were ss homozygotes (Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium Test p = .49). 5-HTTLPR genotype status was treated as an ordinal variable; coded as 0, 1, 2 for the number of s-alleles, and was centered at the median (21). Mean age of participants was 70.7±8.7 years (range 53–100), and most participants had a college education (M = 16.17, SD = 2.46 years). Most participants were female (n = 67; 61.4%). There were no significant differences among the 5-HTTLPR groups (ss, ls, ll) at baseline in terms of demographic variables. However, performance on the RAVLT delayed recall task at baseline was significantly different according to genotype (see Table 1). Specifically, Post-hoc Mann-Whitney U tests among the groups revealed a significant difference (z = 2.84, p = .01), with ll homozygotes performing better on delayed recall than ss homozygotes at baseline (r = .34). Further, waking and diurnal cortisol levels were significantly different according to genotype, with elevated levels of waking cortisol and increased diurnal slope associated with s-allele carriers in a dose dependent fashion, as previously reported in O’Hara et al., 2007.

Growth Models.

Bayesian information criteria (BIC) indicated that nonlinear models of change over time did not improve model fit; therefore, all models treated time as linear. Results from each of the growth models are in Table 2. Random intercepts and slopes were significant across all measures (all ps &lt; .001), indicating that there was significant variability in baseline scores and in rates of change among participants. The unconditional growth model indicated that, within the whole sample, participants showed decline in delayed recall over time (RAVLT Delayed Recall). The conditional growth models analyzed whether trajectories over time differed by 5-HTTLPR status. This model revealed a significant main effect of 5-HTTLPR status on Delayed Recall (t [107.02] = −2.63, p = .01), meaning that as the number of s-alleles increased, there was lower performance on Delayed Recall; this also indicates that as the number of s-alleles decreased, there was higher performance on Delayed Recall. There was a significant 5-HTTLPR x time interaction (t [102.87] = 2.43, p = .02; see Figure 1). The positive coefficient suggests that as the number of s-alleles increase, there is a greater increase in words recalled over time; another way to interpret this is that as the number of s-alleles decrease, there is a greater decrease in words recalled over time. This is best understood by probing the interaction term and examining the rate of change over time for ll, ls, and ss carriers, respectively.

Post-hoc examination of the slopes indicated that ll homozygotes observed more rapid decline in delayed recall over time (−0.84 words per 12 months, p &lt; .001), ls heterozygotes exhibited less decline (−.34 words per 12 months, p = .01), and, ss homozygotes did not show any change in delayed recall over time (0.15 words per 12 months, p = .54). At 24 months, there were no significant differences among all three genotype groups. As shown in Table 2, there was a significant difference in rates of change between ll and ss homozygotes (d = −.48)(22), which remained significant after Bonferroni correction.

In terms of the effects of 5-HTTLPR status on cortisol, we observed no significant main effect of 5-HTTLPR status and change in waking cortisol over time. There was a main effect of 5-HTTLPR status on change in diurnal slope over time (b = −.02, p = .03). Specifically, ll homozygotes exhibited a steeper diurnal slope over time (b = −.02, p = .02), indicating greater levels of cortisol. Thus, the present results reveal that ll homozygotes exhibit increased diurnal cortisol and decreased delayed verbal recall performance over time. s-allele homozygotes did not exhibit any changes in waking or diurnal cortisol over time (see Figure 2). Additional growth models in which cortisol was treated as a time-varying covariate were included, as well as the 5-HTTLPR x cortisol interaction, to determine whether differential associations exist between cortisol and delayed recall due to 5-HTTLPR status. Time-varying covariates were median centered prior to analysis. Waking cortisol was not associated with delayed recall, nor was there a differential association of waking cortisol on delayed recall between groups (t [214.52] = .31, p = .76). This was true of diurnal slope as well (t [208.28] = .12, p = .91). With these added predictors in the model, the interaction between time and 5-HTTLPR status remained significant (t [99.16] = 2.41, p = .02). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine whether our pattern of findings was influenced by regression to the mean. We conducted additional conditional growth models in which we adjusted for the subject’s (median-centered) baseline value. Patterns of findings were the same, as there was still a significant group x time interaction for RAVLT (b = .52, p = .029) and diurnal slope (b = .01, p = .133), but not for waking cortisol (b = −.15, p = .133). This suggests that findings were not significantly impacted by regression to the mean. Finally, we conducted another sensitivity analysis to examine whether gender influenced our pattern of findings. There was no gender x HTTLPR x time interaction for delayed recall or for the cortisol measures.

Exploratory Analysis.

We next examined whether the effects of 5-HTTLPR status and annual rate of change in diurnal slope were associated with annual change in RAVLT delayed recall performance (see Table 3). This was done via an ordinary least squares multiple regression model. In this model, change over time in RAVLT delayed recall served as the dependent variable, while change over time in diurnal slope, 5-HTTLPR status, and their interaction served as independent variables. Change scores for RAVLT delayed recall and diurnal slope were derived from the aforementioned unconditional growth models, where each individual participant had their own rate of change for diurnal slope and RAVLT delayed recall (based on predicted values, calculated as predicted 12-month value minus the predicted baseline value). We ran an additional regression in which we adjusted for age, education, and gender as well. Results revealed that as the number of s-alleles increase, there is less decline in RAVLT delayed recall performance (β = .23, p = .02), as seen in the growth models. Further, as education increases, there is less decline in delayed memory performance (β = −.22, p = .02). Change in diurnal slope, however, was not associated with change in RAVLT delayed recall (β = −.05, p = .62).

Discussion

Our findings suggest that previously observed effects of 5-HTTLPR genotype status on memory in older adults (12) may attenuate over time, and that the 5-HTTLPR short allele status does not predict cognitive decline in older adults. s-allele carriers exhibited stable memory performance over a two-year, follow-up period, while those homozygous for the l-allele demonstrated decline in memory performance. While s-allele carriers exhibited poorer delayed verbal memory performance relative to l-allele homozygotes at baseline, at 24 months post-baseline, the allele groups were indistinguishable in terms of their delayed verbal memory performance. Further, those with the ll genotype exhibited an increased diurnal slope in cortisol over time despite no significant change in waking cortisol in any of the genotype groups. No interactive effect of ll-allele homozygote status and change in cortisol diurnal slope and memory was observed, suggesting these effects of ll-allele status are independent of each other.

Although these findings run counter to our hypothesis that s-allele status would be associated with increases over time in levels of waking and diurnal cortisol with an associated decline in memory performance relative to l-allele homozygotes, the present results also offer a potential explanation for why findings on the relationship between 5-HTTLPR status and a range of cognitive and affective outcomes have been so mixed (e.g., 23, 24). If the effects of 5-HTTLPR status in interaction with physiological measures of stress, e.g. cortisol levels, attenuate over time as seen in the present study, then the genetic vulnerability of 5-HTTLPR status is likely more complex than previously thought. Most notably, it suggests that any potential for disadvantaged memory performance or decline in s-allele carriers may attenuate over time in older adults, potentially decreasing the value of the s-allele as a marker of cognitive decline and dementia. However, it is also possible that the s-allele homozygotes had already experienced their decline and that the s-allele is a marker of early cognitive decline, with their l-allele counterparts catching up later in life.

It is also possible that lifetime exposure to lower levels of serotonin in the s-allele homozygous group results in compensatory brain activation and behaviors across the lifespan that prepare them to more effectively cope with later-life depletion in serotonin (25). Alternatively, it is possible they do not experience late-life serotonin depletion to the same extent as l-allele homozygotes. Further research needs to examine whether serotonin depletion varies by 5-HTTLPR genotype in later life. This is particularly important given that late-life serotonin depletion has been found in individuals with mild neurocognitive impairment (26, 1). As such, the range of ages captured by longitudinal studies of genetic predictors of cognitive decline may be critical. For example, gene expression likely changes with age, impacting the relationship of any genetic marker to brain and cognition in older adults, contingent on the age they are when these associations are examined (27). Our finding of the s-allele having no impact on change of cognition over time is in line with longitudinal studies of twins showing that heritability of changes in cognitive functioning are low, whereas heritability of cognitive performance at a given age is high (28, 29). Future longer, longitudinal studies that cover a broader age range in later life are needed to better understand the complex relationships among 5-HTTLPR genotype status, age, and their relationship to physiological measures of stress and memory performance.

The present study is not without limitations. The smaller sample sizes of the individual genotype groups may have reduced the power to detect a significant interaction of the ll genotype group and cortisol on memory performance. Further, a longer follow-up period or duration may have allowed us to see if the l-allele carriers continue to decline in terms of their memory performance, to a level below that of the s-allele carriers.

Overall, our findings suggest that l-allele homozygote status is associated with increased cortisol and decreased memory over time, resulting in attenuated verbal memory performance differences compared to s-allele carriers with age. These findings do not support the hypothesis that presence of the 5-HTTLPR s-allele is a marker for memory decline in older adults.

Values indicate change in total words recalled or cortisol based on the number of increasing s alleles. A positive coefficient of 5-HTTLPR indicates that as the number of s-alleles increase, so does the outcome variable; a negative coefficient indicates that as the number of s-alleles increase, the outcome variable decreases. A positive interaction coefficient between 5-HTTLPR status and time indicates that, as the number of s-alleles increase, that the outcome variable increases over time; conversely, a negative interaction coefficient indicates that as the number of s-alleles increase, the outcome variable decreases over time.
