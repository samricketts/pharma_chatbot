Objectives:

A priority health outcome for patients, families, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is a patient’s ability to return home and remain in the community without adverse events following discharge from post-acute care services. Successful discharge to community (DTC) is defined as being discharged to the community and not experiencing a readmission or death within 30 days of discharge. The objective of this study was to determine the association between patient factors and successful DTC after home health for individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).

Design:

This retrospective study derived data from 100% national CMS data files from October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017.

Settings and Participants:

Criteria from the Home Health Quality Reporting program were used to identify a cohort of 790,439 Medicare home health beneficiaries, 143,164 (18.0%) with ADRD.

Measures:

Successful DTC rates with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each patient characteristic. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of successful DTC after home health, by ADRD diagnosis, mobility, self-care, caregiver support, and medication management, adjusted for patient demographics and clinical characteristics.

Results:

Overall, 79.4% of beneficiaries had a successful DTC. Beneficiaries with ADRD had a significantly lower odds of successful DTC than those without ADRD (RR=0.947, 95% CI=0.944–0.950). This association remained significant after adjustment for caregiver support, assistance with medications, independence in mobility, and level of self-care. Greater need for caregiver support, greater need for assistance with medications, greater dependence in mobility, and greater self-care dependence were all associated with decreased risk of successful DTC.

Conclusions and Implications:

Older adults with ADRD receiving home health had decreased RR of successful DTC. To have a successful DTC, older adults with ADRD need sufficient support from care givers and independence in functioning.

Brief Summary:

Retrospective cohort study of Medicare data showed that the presence of dementia and limitations in self-care and mobility are important risk factors for an unsuccessful discharge to community.

Long-term health outcomes have been targeted as a key area for improvement within the United States healthcare system.1 A priority health outcome for patients, families, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is a patient’s ability to return home and remain in the community without adverse events following discharge from post-acute care services.2–5 Post-acute care includes skilled nursing and rehabilitation care provided in skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and home health care. In a prospective, multi-center cohort study of 209 older adult patients, over 90% identified a primary goal of remaining in their own home.4 For individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), who are at a heightened risk of negative outcomes during care transitions and who function best in familiar settings, this goal is even more critical.6–8

The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation (IMPACT) Act of 2014 mandated the implementation of specific quality measures, including the successful discharge to community (DTC) measure.2,9 Successful DTC is defined by CMS as being discharged to the community and not experiencing a readmission or death within 30 days of discharge. CMS began publicly reporting and linking payment to performance on the successful DTC measure in home health in 2019.1

Home health is used by more Medicare beneficiaries than any other post-acute care setting, servicing approximately 3.1 million beneficiaries at a cost of over $17 million in 2017.10 Approximately thirty percent of home health patients have an ADRD diagnosis. 6,11,12 The structure of home health is well-suited to meet the post-acute care needs of people with ADRD as it provides a familiar environment and routine. 6–8 Factors that influence successful DTC after home health care have been relatively underexamined.2,13 Home health clinicians and agencies are ideally positioned to impact a patient’s post-discharge outcomes through the services they provide during home health. Home health agencies should implement measures to facilitate successful DTC by optimizing care delivery, discharge planning, and care transitions, but they need more information to guide these decisions. Currently, there are no home health strategies in place to improve successful DTC that are tailored to people with ADRD.

For individuals with ADRD, care transitions can trigger an exacerbation of ADRD symptoms as well as progression of the disease.6,11,14,15 With each subsequent care transition, the likelihood of a positive outcome deteriorates and declines in function, secondary infections, and hospitalizations become more frequent.6,11,14,15 Individuals with ADRD are known to function best in familiar settings, which are associated with improved health outcomes and decreased episodes of behavioral and psychological symptoms.8,16 Because individuals with ADRD incur three times the healthcare costs of those without ADRD,17–19 avenues that reduce such costs and improve care are particularly important.

Functional status, including mobility and self-care tasks, has been shown to be a key factor associated with post-acute care outcomes.20–22 For individuals with ADRD, caregiver support and medication management are additional factors that are often considered in relation to health outcomes.21,23,24 The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of ADRD, mobility, self-care tasks, caregiver support, and medication management with successful DTC after home health. Our findings will help guide home health clinicians and agencies in implementing strategies to improve outcomes for individuals with ADRD.

METHODS

Data Sources

Data were derived from the following 100% national CMS administrative and clinical assessment data files from October 1, 2016 through September 31, 2017: Home Health Base file, Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS), Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR), and Beneficiary Summary files. The Home Health Base file was used to identify the cohort and to confirm the start and end dates of care. Data from the OASIS file were used to create summary measures for mobility, self-care, caregiver support, medication management, and cognition. Validity varies item-by-item on the OASIS, with functional items having the strongest validity and more moderate validity reported for cognition and other domains.25 The MedPAR file was used to identify patients with an International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification Codes, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code for dementia (see Dementia diagnosis) and readmissions. The Beneficiary Summary file was used to verify Medicare Fee-for-Service enrollment and to obtain sociodemographic information. This study was approved by our university’s institutional review board (#13–0549). A Data Use Agreement was reviewed and approved by CMS.

Patient Cohort

Criteria from the Home Health Quality Reporting Program (HHQRP) specification models were used to identify our cohort from 2,781,878 Medicare beneficiaries admitted to home health during the study period (Figure 1).26,27 Consistent with HHQRP specification models, we excluded individuals for the following reasons: (1) admitted to home health more than 30 days after discharge from an acute or psychiatric hospitalization; (2) under the age of 66 years; (3) transferred between home health agencies; (4) non-continuous Medicare Fee-for-Service coverage for 12 months prior to the index hospitalization and 31 days after the hospital discharge; (5) discharged from the acute care hospitalization against medical advice; (6) missing items of interest in OASIS; (7) having excluded discharge status (hospice, federal hospitals, law enforcement, etc.); and (8) hospital stay was for non-surgical treatment of cancer.

Dementia diagnosis

Beneficiaries with dementia were identified using 19 ICD-10 codes included in the Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse algorithm for Alzheimer’s disease, related disorders, or senile dementia (Supplemental Table 1).28,29 Beneficiaries with one or more of these ICD-10 codes for dementia in Medicare Part A, home health, skilled nursing, or inpatient rehabilitation claims in the year prior to hospitalization were classified as having ADRD.

Outcome

The outcome of interest was successful DTC after discharge from home health. Successful DTC is defined by the CMS Home Health Quality Reporting Program2 as being discharged to home/self-care with or without services, with or without a planned readmission. We used the patient discharge status code variable in the Home Health Fee-for-Service claims file to identify discharge status. During the 31-day period after discharge from home health, unplanned readmissions were identified using the Rehospitalization during the first 30-days of Home Health 30 measure and death was identified based on date of death from Medicare Beneficiary Summary File.

Primary Predictors

Our primary predictors included summary scores for mobility, self-care, and caregiver support. A detailed description of the OASIS items used to derive these summary scores has been published.31 A fourth primary predictor was a variable for the patient’s current ability to manage oral medications.

Mobility and self-care.

The OASIS includes three items for mobility and seven items for self-care (Supplemental Table 2). As shown in Supplemental Table 2, the rating scales for these items vary. For example, transfer to/from the bed to chair (mobility) is rated as 0 (independent) to 5 (totally dependent), whereas bathing (self-care) is rated as 0 (independent) to 7 (totally dependent). Consequently, we created summary scores that accounted for the different number of response categories.31,32 First, we first divided the recorded score by the highest possible score for each item and multiplied by 100. This resulted in scores for the three mobility items and seven self-care items ranging from 0 (independent) to 100 (dependent). The average of the mobility and self-care scores were then calculated and categorized into quartiles.

Caregiver support.

The OASIS includes a section on care management that assesses the ability and willingness of a family member, friend, or privately paid caregiver to assist with supervision, activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, medication administration, medical procedures/treatments, equipment management, and advocacy/facilitation (Supplemental Table 2). We condensed the six-category scale into the following four categories: (1) patient does not need assistance; (2) caregiver provides assistance; (3) caregiver needs training; and (4) caregiver is not available, is unlikely to provide assistance, or it is not known if the caregiver will give assistance. The seven items of caregiver support were summed to obtain a total score of 7–28 points, which was then categorized into quartiles.

Medication Management.

The OASIS includes a variable on the patient’s current ability to prepare and take all oral medications safely and reliably, which includes taking the correct dosage at the required times. The OASIS specifies that injections or IVs are not considered. Patients are rated on a four-point scale: Independent (0 points), Needs assistance with dosage or making a medication schedule (1 point), Needs reminders to take medication at correct times (2 points), and Medication must be administered by another person (3 points). A value of NA indicates that the patient has no prescribed oral medications.

Covariates

Sociodemographic characteristics included age, sex, race/ethnicity, Medicare original entitlement, and dual eligibility status. Healthcare utilization characteristics included receipt of dialysis during hospitalization, length of index hospitalization, days in the intensive care unit/critical care unit (ICU/CCU), and the number of hospitalizations in the previous year.

Data Analysis

For each patient characteristic, we calculated successful DTC rates, with the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used multilevel logistic regression to study the relationship of ADRD, mobility, self-care, caregiver support, and medication management with successful DTC after home health, adjusting for patient demographics and clinical characteristics. Risk Ratios were calculated by adjusting the odds ratios as described by Zhang and Yu.33 A second level random effect was used to account for the clustering of patients within home health agencies. We examined the association between each domain and successful DTC with and without the other domains, as additional risk adjustors and to assess for multicollinearity. All data analysis was performed using SAS software version 9.4.34

RESULTS

The final cohort consisted of 790,439 Medicare beneficiaries, 143,164 (18.0%) of whom had ADRD. Within the sample, 41% were 81 years of age or older, 60% were female, and 84% were Caucasian (Table 1). The overall successful DTC rate was 79.4%. Successful DTC rates were moderately lower for dual eligible patients (72%), those with 5 or more days in the hospital (71–75%) or ICU/CCU usage (73%), and those who were Black (73%). Successful DTC rates were substantially lower in individuals whose Medicare entitlement was due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or Disability/ESRD (62%), those receiving dialysis (59%), and those with two or more acute hospitalizations in the past year (50–68%). Individuals with ADRD had a 10% lower successful DTC rate (71%) than those without ADRD (81%). Observed successful DTC rates decreased as the level of independence decreased across all mobility, self-care, caregiver-support, and medication assistance domains, with the greatest decreases in the fourth quartiles of mobility (72%) and self-care (72%).

Across the five domains, status at admission to home health was associated with successful DTC (Table 2). After adjustment for patients’ sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, the relative risk (RR) of successful DTC for individuals with ADRD was .947 (95% CI, .944-.950) compared to those without ADRD. Adjusting for caregiver support, medication assistance, mobility and self-care improved the RR of successful DTC (Table 2), but those with ADRD continued to show lower RR of successful DTC than those without ADRD.

After adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics as well as for ADRD status, caregiver support, and medication management, individuals in the fourth quartile (most dependent) of mobility had a .910 (95% CI, .905-.915) RR of successful DTC as compared to .897 (95%CI, .893-.902) for individuals in the first quartile (most independent). Mobility and self-care scores were included in separate models because of multicollinearity between the two domains.

After adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as for mobility, self-care, and medication management, individuals in the fourth quartile (most dependent) of caregiver support, had a .984 (95% CI, .980-.988) RR of successful DTC, compared to .989 (95% CI, .985-.993) for those in the first quartile (most independent) of caregiver support. After adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as for mobility, self-care, and caregiver support, individuals in the fourth category (most dependent) of caregiver support had a .925 (95% CI, .908-.941) RR of successful DTC respectively as compared to .941 (95% CI, .925-.957) for those the first quartile (most independent) of caregiver support.

The five most common reasons for unsuccessful DTC for people both with and without ADRD were (1) Readmission during home health, (2) Unplanned readmission after discharge from home health, (3) Died during or after, (4) Transfer to another home health agency, and (5) Still a patient/no further claims (Table 3). The order and percentages of the reasons varied between those with and without ADRD. The primary reason for unsuccessful DTC for individuals with ADRD was readmission during home health care, followed by unplanned readmission after discharge from home health and mortality. For individuals without ADRD, the primary reasons for unsuccessful DTC were unplanned readmission, followed by readmission during home health, and transfer to other home health agency. Those with ADRD had a 3% greater rate of unsuccessful DTC because of readmission during home health and a 2% greater rate of mortality.

DISCUSSION

The ability to return home and remain in the community after a hospitalization and subsequent post-acute care stay is an important goal for older adults, especially for those living with ADRD. This analysis investigated the association between ADRD diagnosis and successful community discharge among nearly 800,000 Medicare beneficiaries discharged from home health. We observed that 71.2% of beneficiaries with ADRD had a successful community discharge following a home health stay compared with 81.2% of beneficiaries without ADRD. Additionally, ADRD was associated with a significantly lower rate of successful DTC after adjustment for caregiver support, assistance with medications, and level of independence in mobility and self-care.

In our analysis, the three most common reasons for an unsuccessful DTC for beneficiaries with ADRD were readmission during home health care, having an unplanned hospital readmission after discharge from home health care, and mortality. Older adults with ADRD often have many comorbid medical conditions that can increase the risk of a hospitalization.35–37 Older adults with ADRD have difficulty communicating their care needs which can disrupt early detection and treatment of comorbid conditions, including those known to increase risk of readmission.38 Prior studies have identified cognitive limitations and ADRD diagnoses as risk factors for readmission during and after home health care.39,40 Additionally, older adults with ADRD are a high-risk population for falls and other poor outcomes that can lead to a hospitalization.41

Adequate caregiver support is important to older adults living at home in the community.42,43 Living alone has been associated with rehospitalizations for older adults receiving home health.44,45 Approximately 25% of beneficiaries in our sample scored between 19 and 28 points on our measure of caregiver assistance. This is equivalent to a caregiver needing training or a caregiver not being available, unlikely to give assistance, or it is not known if the caregiver will give assistance on all seven of the social support items. The relatively high percentage of beneficiaries who may have insufficient caregiver support is especially concerning, because nearly 50% of beneficiaries were documented as being unable to take oral medications unless given by another person. Beneficiaries in the highest (fourth) quartile of caregiver assistance who were also unable to take oral medications without the help of another person had significantly lower risk of successful DTC. Unmet caregiver needs has been associated with an increased likelihood of hospital readmission during a home health stay in older adults with ADRD.31 Caregiver training is a component of home health care services. Implementation of robust caregiver training programs tailored to the care needs of older adults with ADRD, including medication management, has the potential to improve successful DTC rates for this patient population.

Poor mobility and self-care were the strongest risk factors for an unsuccessful DTC. Home health physical therapy interventions have been shown to be effective in improving mobility and self-care for the general population and for individuals with ADRD.7,46–48 However, individuals with ADRD require longer durations, the involvement of multiple disciplines, and greater numbers of visits to impact outcomes such as readmissions.49 Prioritization of evidence-based mobility and self-care interventions coupled with robust episodes of care has the potential to improve rates of successful discharge to community after home health for people with ADRD.

Finally, the primary reasons for unsuccessful DTC for individuals with ADRD (readmission during home health and unplanned readmission after discharge from home health) in this study indicated a care transition and removal from a familiar environment. Care transitions have been shown to increase the behavioral and psychological symptoms of ADRD and can lead to disease progression,7 while familiar settings have been shown to result in the most favorable outcomes for individuals with ADRD.8,38 Improving successful DTC rates for individuals with ADRD has the potential to positively impact their function and quality of life.

LIMITATIONS

Our study has limitations. Our definition of ADRD was based only on an ICD-10 diagnosis. This approach has been shown to have poor sensitivity for detecting ADRD.50 Additionally, by dichotomizing ADRD diagnosis, we are not able to distinguish across the stages of dementia. We limited the assessment of medication management to the OASIS item addressing oral medication only; management of other forms of medication such as injections was not considered. Finally, our measurements of medication management, function, self-care, and caregiver support were based on home health admission data. Changes in these factors across the episode of care were not considered but may impact the likelihood of successful discharge to community.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

Older adults with ADRD are less likely than those without ADRD to have a successful DTC after home health. Common reasons for an unsuccessful DTC in this population include hospital readmission and mortality. We found that limitations in self-care and mobility are important risk factors for an unsuccessful DTC. Ensuring that an older adult has sufficient caregiver support from family and that the family caregiver has been briefed on the types of care required may help increase the rates of successful DTC.
