The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a unique vascular structure that serves as a molecular transport gateway for the maintenance of brain homeostasis. Chronic disruption or breakdown of the BBB reportedly leads to neurodegenerative diseases. Nonetheless, research on human BBB pathophysiology and drug development remain highly dependent on studies using inherently different animals. Moreover, more studies have shown that animal models are not appropriate in modeling Alzheimer’s disease (AD), underlining the importance of in vitro models of the human BBB with physiological relevance. In this review, we highlight recent advances in human BBB-on-a-chip technologies and discuss their potential for pathogenesis studies and drug prescreening for AD treatment.

1. Introduction

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a brain vascular border across which cellular or molecular transport is highly regulated through the brain-specific vascular endothelium supported by pericytes and astrocytic end-feet (Figure 1A). This tight barrier function precludes the non-selective transport of large (&gt;400Da) molecules from the circulating blood to the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system (CNS). This important role of the BBB in protecting the CNS and maintaining the homeostasis, however, hampers effective delivery of therapeutics for neurological disorders. This difficulty forces researchers to develop drugs capable of leveraging the receptors[1] (e.g., transferrin receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor, and insulin receptor) highly expressed on the apical side of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) to effectively deliver drugs to the brain via receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) (Figure 1B). These studies underscore the importance of human brain-specific platforms that would allow drug developers to circumvent unnecessary testing using animal models before moving forward to clinical trials. Recent advances in the development of in vitro human BBB models have shown great potential to mimic human BBB pathophysiology for advanced drug testing.

Disrupted BBB function is reportedly linked to pathological cues leading to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). With aging, impaired clearance of beta-amyloid (Aβ) may disrupt the BBB gradually or BBB breakdown may impair the clearance of Aβ, either of which ultimately leads to AD. The lack of knowledge on this cause-and-effect relationship originates in part from the difficulty in using animal models or conventional in vitro experiments to conduct mechanistic studies on Aβ-induced BBB dysfunction as well as to test drug candidates for improved Aβ clearance. This notion has been demonstrated by the repeated failure of clinical trials using Aβ antibodies to enhance clearance in AD patients. The disappointing outcomes of these studies have again questioned the role of amyloidosis in AD pathogenesis. Nonetheless, scientists believe that amelioration of the amyloidosis may at least delay AD with a combinatorial potential to stop AD and thus AD treatment research remain interested in the reduction of this abnormal protein aggregation, in particular, by the clearance mechanisms through the BBB and glymphatic system. Later in the review, we highlight human BBB-on-a-chip approaches for the studies on Aβ-induced AD pathology and Aβ clearance mechanisms.

Existing in vitro studies for AD drug development use neurons and glial cells to study Aβ aggregation or clearance. For in vivo studies, transgenic mouse models with accelerated Aβ plaque accumulation are commonly used, but these models remain insufficient in demonstrating the pathogenic relation between BBB impairment and AD. Throughout this decade, a number of in vitro BBB platforms have been developed, expanding preceding conventional 2D models (e.g., Transwell) into 3D microfluidic ones. Early conventional BBB models have consisted of a BMEC monolayer on a tissue culture plate or a multicellular culture system on a transwell plate, but these models reportedly fail to recapitulate the key physiology of the BBB (e.g., shear stress, 3D perivascular structure). In this report, we review the recent progress in human BBB-on-a-chip technologies and discuss the role in the development of human in vitro AD models.

2. Blood-brain barrier impairment in Alzheimer’s disease

AD is the most common type of age-related dementia, with an annually increasing number of patients. The cause and pathogenic mechanism of AD remain unknown, but most AD patients demonstrate Aβ aggregation and neurofibrillary tangles (i.e., tau phosphorylation). These abnormal features cause pro-inflammatory activation of astrocytes and microglia , leading to neuroinflammation and peripheral neuron loss in more severe cases[2]. Since AD pathogenesis is reportedly an irreversible process, it is essential to understand the initial cascades which occur prior to neuronal death to reveal the early biomarkers for diagnosis. Although it is still controversial whether this pathogenesis is a cause or consequence of AD, one hypothesis for the early pathogenic cascade is the contribution of vascular pathology associated with age-related BBB impairment. There is evidence that blood-derived molecules such as albumin or IgG[3] and elevated levels of prothrombin[4] have been detected in postmortem AD brains, indicating blood leakage. In addition, higher BBB permeability has been observed in AD brains[5] and aged brains[6] using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recent data-driven analysis using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database showed that cognitive decline is predictable from initial late-onset stages of AD, as biomarkers related to vascular dysfunction increased before the increase of standard AD markers[7]. In this section, we summarize the relationship of BBB impairment with AD pathogenesis (Figure 2).

2.1. Disturbed molecular transport across the endothelial layer at BBB

At BBB, tight junction proteins such as occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1 are highly expressed in BMECs, contributing to the maintenance of the high barrier integrity. In AD, Aβ has apoptotic and pro-inflammatory effects on the endothelium (e.g., in case of cerebral amyloid angiopathy CAA[8]), leading to decreased expression of the tight junction protein and thus higher BBB permeability. Moreover, molecular transport across the BBB is disrupted due to dysfunction of several transmembrane proteins in AD brain. For example, GLUT1, a transmembrane protein of BMECs for glucose transport, was observed to be deficient in AD pathology[9], as well as in the early brain vascular dysfunction[10]. In addition, the efflux pathway of receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT), the major clearance mechanism across the BBB[11], requires a specific receptor on the abluminal surface of the endothelium to transport Aβ to the luminal sides.

Among RMT receptors, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) bind to Aβ. LRP1 is mainly distributed at the abluminal side of BMECs and interacts with the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)/Aβ complex to initiate active transcytosis[11–12] in mouse models[13]. ApoE2 and ApoE3 are known to primarily interact with LRP1 to accelerate Aβ clearance, while the role of ApoE4, despite the binding to VLDLR (very low-density lipoprotein receptor), remains negative for the clearance[14]. Followed by endothelial uptake of Aβ, phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) mediates the guidance of the intracellular vesicles to the luminal side into the blood (exocytosis)[15]. AD development causes this LRP1-mediated clearance mechanism to be disrupted with accumulated Aβ known to degrade or reduce LRP1[12–13, 16].

P-gp, also known as ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1), is an ATP-dependent transporter expressed on the apical and basal sides of the BMECs. P-gp expression is also negatively correlated with the amount of Aβ in the brain parenchyma. Several animal studies have shown that P-gp deficiency inhibits Aβ clearance[17] and that Aβ deposition suppresses P-gp expression and aggravates AD pathogenesis[18]. Furthermore, a knockout mouse model study revealed that P-gp acts in concert with LRP1 for Aβ transport across the BBB[19].

In contrast, RAGE is mainly located on the luminal surface of BMECs and mediates the influx of circulating Aβ into the brain, which would aggravate AD pathogenesis[20]. RAGE is up-regulated in BMECs under an Aβ-rich condition[8b] and also highly expressed in all BBB cells, especially in the postmortem AD brain[21].

2.2. Pericyte dysfunction

The role of pericytes have reportedly been important in BBB to keep the brain homeostasis against AD[22]. Loss of pericytes is known to accelerate Aβ deposition and tau pathology both in an AD mouse model[23] and in AD patients[24]. One physiological change in AD patients includes an increased soluble PDGFRβ level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a potential biomarker of pericyte injury[25], as their growth and survival reportedly depend on PDGF-BB secreted from BMECs in PDGFRβ signaling cascades[26]. Pericytes also display a phagocytic activity contributing to one Aβ clearance mechanism, where pericytes internalize Aβ via the LRP1-ApoE interaction for lysosomal degradation[27]. This mechanism is also ApoE-isoform dependent, as ApoE3 has been positively correlated with Aβ clearance, while ApoE4 has been shown to play the opposite role[27]. ApoE4 is also known to induce pericyte loss by inducing a pro-inflammatory response when compared to ApoE3[28]. In postmortem AD brains, other receptors such as the class B scavenger receptor (i.e., CD36) had a positive correlation with vascular pericyte loss and cognitive deficiency[29], confirming the importance of healthy pericytes to prevent AD.

2.3. Astrocyte dysfunction

Astrocytes surround brain capillaries through their end-feet processes by which astrocytes interact with endothelial cells and neurons to establish neurovascular coupling[30]. Astrocytes contribute to the BBB integrity through the up-regulation of Caludin-5 and Occludin[31] and the secretion of astrocytic laminin[32]. Among the proteins expressed on the astrocyte end-feet, aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is often reported to indicate the polarization and establish the BBB structure[33]. While they generally facilitates water transport between cells to maintain cellular homeostasis, on astrocyte end-feet of the BBB, AQP4 reportedly participates in Aβ clearance[34]; the deletion of AQP4 in AD mice accelerated Aβ accumulation[35]. AD patients typically display an elevated level of total AQP4, but importantly has a reduced perivascular localization of AQP4, designating the correct polarization of AQP4 as a key factor in AD pathogenesis[36]. Supporting this result, a mouse model has shown that Aβ aggregation in the perivascular space induces depolarization and relocation of AQP4 to its non-end-feet membrane, such as neuropil-surrounding plaques[37]. Importantly, increased oxidative and nitrosative stress was observed in the early AD cascades of both mouse and human models[38], underlying the role of astrocyte dysfunction in AD pathogenesis.

3. Recent advances in human BBB-on-a-chip

Modeling the human BBB in vitro has been difficult due to the structural and physiological complexity. A most simple yet widely used in vitro BBB model use an endothelial monolayer on a double-layer tissue culture plate called Transwell co-cultured with 2D perivascular cells with no direct contact but chemical communication for studying molecular exchange across the BBB. Recent efforts to make on-chip BBB models have demonstrated more physiologically relevant BBB environment with 3D perivascular configurations. In this section, we discuss the recent advances in human BBB-on-a-chip technologies for better modeling the human BBB.

3.1. Advance in the chip structure

To model the BBB structure like other tissue barriers, at least two separated spaces are necessary: the one for the vascular region and the other for the parenchymal area. The simple and common BBB model widely used is a Transwell-based multi-space device composed of an endothelial monolayer atop an apical chamber with 2D cultured pericytes and astrocytes in a basolateral chamber. The porous membrane mimics the basement membrane (i.e., basal lamina) for the endothelial cells to attach while allowing for porous routes through which BBB cells can communicate. Compared to previous endothelial mono-culture systems that rely on the tight junction for the barrier permeability, the Transwell-based co-culture system including BMECs, pericytes, and astrocytes have shown the enhanced integrity and function of BBB. This easy-to-use Transwell system has been widely used or is being used for BBB studies and drug screening.

However, with the long-believed fact that the vascular endothelium must be cultured under fluid flow in vitro to have the intact phenotype, this Transwell system prepared with tri-culture capability remains too simple to mimic the complex BBB physiology, such as capillary blood flow and physical cell-to-cell contact of 3D perivascular cell culture configuration. Microfluidic BBB-on-a-chip system has been differentiated from Transwell by getting the endothelium prepared with shear stress to mimic the unidirectional laminar flow along the capillaries. Recent developments of human BBB-on-a-chip models have successfully demonstrated the superior capability of recapitulating the structure and physiology of the human BBB with shear stress (Figure 3A) and also direct interactions of BBB cells in 3D perivascular environments (Figure 3B) or as a spontaneously formed vascular structure (Figure 3C), providing better opportunities of studying molecular transport and nanoparticle distribution under more physiologically and pathologically relevant conditions (Table 1).

One simple configuration of this system is to subject flow onto BMECs to form a 2D endothelial layer and perivascular layer on each side of a porous membrane (Figure 3A). This system with flow has demonstrated increased integrity of the endothelial layer with a higher trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) compared to Transwell-based model system (with no flow)[39]. This configuration has been used to observe BBB response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, or BBB disruption under a neuroinflammatory condition, and the transmigration of leukocytes across the BBB[40]. A further developed version of this design used a tubular structure around the rectangular channel walls in a vascular channel, which may have tighter barrier function due to the importance of the endothelial luminal structure in vascular modeling[41]. However, this would be simply artificial because the BBB forms with a microscale vessel and larger vessels need SMCs for stability. Moreover, the BMECs in the vascular channel may become heterogeneous as those cultured on the wall are under different conditions from those on the membrane close to other perivascular cells at the BBB. This platform was used for testing drug delivery through BBB transcytosis (Figure 4A)[42].

Another study utilized a smart integration of these platforms with different brain cells to reveal the metabolic coupling of BBB cells with neurons to identify the transport, efficacy, mechanism of action, and toxicity of the drugs (Figure 4B)[43]. Designed as a multi-organ structure, the device was composed of two side BBB chips: the bottom being a vascular lumen channel with BMECs, and the top being a 2D channel with pericytes and astrocytes, which mimic perivascular influx and efflux, respectively. A center brain chip had neurons and astrocytes, which were affected by the imported molecules from the modeled CSF of the BBB chip to examine the metabolic interplay between the brain cells[43]. In addition, another group used induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain cells (including BBB cells and neurons) cultured on the same chip for a personalized BBB chip system to detect inter-individual variability[44]. Moreover, a group has suggested a real-scale BBB model, composed of 3D-printed microporous microtubes[45]. A two-photon lithography approach enabled the highly reproducible and accurate modeling to mimic the brain capillaries, followed by BBB formation with BMEC and astrocyte monolayers on the inner layer and outer layer, respectively[45].

Meanwhile, there have been critical reports that discuss the importance of astrocyte pathophysiology in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD[46] and that astrocytes cultured in 2D in vitro become activated and reactive. To create a more physiological BBB system able to model healthy and diseased astrocytes, our group has recently developed a human BBB-on-a-chip system with astrocytes cultured in 3D hydrogel filled in the basolateral channel, as well as with vascular endothelium cultured under a physiologically relevant shear stress (Figure 3B, 4C)[47]. Differentiating from the previous BBB system with 2D astrocytic culture, this system enabled astrocytic end-feet process in 3D and polarization with aquaporin4 (APQ4) expression, resulting in reduced astrocytic reactivity (e.g., lower expression of lipocalin2, reactive astrocyte marker[48]). This more physiologically accurate environment of the BBB allowed us to verify receptor-mediated transcytosis of nanoparticles in a mechanistic fashion and evaluate the distribution of nanoparticles precisely in qualitative and quantitative manners[47].

Another study applied this 2D endothelial monolayer model with 3D perivascular astrocytic culture to show the tumor metastatic process across the BBB[49]. This BBB-on-a-chip allowed to discover the difference between the brain-seeking cells and non-brain-seeking cells by measuring their morphology, extravasation speed, and interaction with endothelium [49].

Taking advantage of a number of approaches constructing 3D microvessel structures, researchers have utilized the spontaneous tubulogenic property of endothelial cells in hydrogels to form capillary network models (Figure 3C). One representative model is to use a fibrin gel as a basal hydrogel to form an autonomous microvessel network with higher integrity and molecule receptor expression in the presence of pericytes and astrocytes[50]. This model has successfully fostered a higher BBB integrity with spontaneous physical intercellular contact than a monoculture model (Figure 4D)[51], enabling the studies of receptor-mediated transcytosis of brain-targeting drugs[50] and ApoE4-mediated accumulation of Aβ[52]. Despite the more realistic microvessel complexity of this model than the compartmentalized models discussed above, it remains to be further developed how to precisely sample fluids separately from the luminal and abluminal sides, uniformly apply shear stress along the microvessels, and better reproduce the complex microvessel network.

3.2. Advance in the cell source

Human iPSCs reprogrammed from adult somatic cells are expected to provide unlimited cell source and become differentiated to specific cell types. More importantly, iPSCs provide patient-specific or disease-specific conditions that reflect on the donor’s genetic information. Development of patient-specific BBB disease models able to incorporate AD patient-derived iPS-BMECs, iPS-astrocytes, iPS-pericytes, and iPS-neurons in one single chip would be an ultimate goal of the current efforts in this technology. Recent reports on successful protocol developments of iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells and neural cells have encouraged BBB model developers to adapt iPSC-derived cells instead of immortalized cell lines or primary cells that have shown relatively higher permeability when cultured in vitro[53] than in vivo and have lost their phenotype from repeated passages. This section highlights the most widely used iPSC differentiation methods applied to BBB studies.

Although pericytes and astrocytes play a highly important role in establishing the BBB, BMECs remain the most prominent exhibitor of characteristic BBB features. The most widely used iPSC-derived BMEC (iPSC-BMEC) differentiation protocol consists of two steps: 6-day endothelial induction followed by 2-day BMEC specification[54]. The BMEC properties are verified by the TEER value, tight junction protein expression, and endothelial transporter activities[54a, 54b]. The maximum TEER value of the iPSC-BMECs was 222 ± 51 Ω·cm2 in a monoculture, 899 ± 132 Ω·cm2 when co-cultured with HEK cells, and 1450 ± 140 Ω·cm2 when co-cultured with rat astrocytes[54a]. In comparison, immortalized human BMECs[55] and primary human BMECs[56] exhibit a maximum TEER value of 199 ± 5 Ω·cm2 and 339 ± 107 Ω·cm2, respectively. Furthermore, the TEER value of iPSC-BMECs when co-cultured with iPSC-derived pericytes, iPSC-derived astrocytes, and neural stem cell-derived neurons was surprisingly increased to 2,500 ~ 5,000 Ω·cm2[57], which is similar to that of the natural human BBB (8,000 Ω·cm2) per ion permeability coefficients[58]. Interestingly, iPSC-BMECs differentiated under a hypoxic condition (5% O2) exhibited an elevation of characteristic properties of BMECs (e.g. endothelial markers, TEER value, ABC and SLC transporter expression) by up to 5 times when compared to cells cultured under a normoxic (20% O2) condition in vitro[42].

For iPSC-derived brain pericytes (iPSC-BPs), widely used brain pericyte differentiation protocols begins with the generation of neural crest stem cells for differentiation into mural cells expressing pericyte markers[59]. The pericytic phenotype of iPSC-BPs are determined to be similar with that of primary brain vascular pericytes. Using RNA-sequencing, the gene expression profile of iPSC-BPs has been confirmed to resemble human primary brain pericytes through the protein expression of the key pericyte markers[59]. In addition, iPSC-BPs have been shown to self-assemble onto endothelial cells to form vascular cords when integrated into a Transwell-based BBB model with iPSC-BMECs and astrocytes[59].

To prepare iPSC-ASs, the standard protocol includes a spheroidal culture method, using undifferentiated spheroids to induce astrosphere formation, to finally harvest fully-differentiated single astrocytes under a 2D culture[60]. This method allows users to save their time, as the astrosphere, an intermediate stage of this protocol, could be passaged itself for further usage[60]. To confirm their phenotype, iPSC-ASs were co-cultured with BMECs and iPSC-derived neurons in a 3:1 ratio between astrocytes and neurons in a transwell platform to demonstrate synergistic effects between supporting BBB cells. This 3:1 ratio in the BBB model has demonstrated similar BBB properties with primary rat astrocytes in terms of permeability and molecular transport[60]. Although iPSC-BMECs were confirmed to display more accurate physiology than immortalized or primary BMECs, it is hard to review from the existing research that the phenotypes of iPSC-BPs or iPSC-ASs were more physiologically accurate than those of conventionally used primary cells, considering their supportive roles. Since the development of iPSC-BPs or iPSC-ASs is still in its initial step, more specific investigations on their phenotype are needed.

Reconstruction of a patient-specific diseased BBB model is one of the biggest advantages of using iPSC-derived BBB cells, which was impossible using primary cells. For example, transwell-based models of iPSC-BMECs monolayers from childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy patients[61] and monocarboxylate transporter 8-deficient patients[62] have shown more severe signs of BBB disruption than wild-type controls. Similarly, iPSC-BMECs monolayers from patients with age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease (HD) have shown higher permeability and lower efflux transport than wild-type controls[63].

Moreover, iPSCs have proven extremely useful when applied to BBB-on-a-chip devices. A microfluidic model using iPSC-BMECs obtained from HD patients, when co-cultured with primary brain vascular pericytes and astrocytes, has allowed for more advanced observation of BBB permeability, BBB transcytosis, and neuroinflammatory responses of patient-derived iPSCs[44]. More specifically, iPSCs isolated from patients with different ApoE isoform genotypes have enabled the construction of a 3D vasculogenic BBB model that utilizes iPSC-BMECs, iPSC-BPs, and iPSC-ASs to observe AD pathogenesis, including Aβ behaviors[52].

Despite the advantages of iPSC-derived BBB cells to recapitulate the human BBB, the protocols in general remain to be further improved for standard manufacturing. The current differentiation process is laborious and tedious with the multi-step, highly sensitive culture procedure, leading to heterogeneous production. For example, immaturity of differentiated cells procures a non-reactive state in vitro[64]. Also, iPSCs have been shown to have traces of epigenetic memory from the source of somatic cells that they originate from, leading to heterogeneity from batch-to-batch biases. In addition, each iPSC-derived BBB cells need to be further verified at more aspects. A recent report warned that iPSC-BMECs express some epithelial markers as well as key endothelial markers[65]. Nonetheless, iPSC-based microfluidic BBB-on-a-chips would become a most promising model of brain pathophysiological studies and disease modeling pipelines in the future.

4. Human BBB-on-a-chip for AD research

Typical microfluidic approaches have been used to identify AD biomarkers[66] and study potential pathogenic mechanisms of AD[67]. Since numerous mechanistic studies still focus on Aβ, most of the AD research using microfluidic devices have introduced Aβ deposition to represent AD brain. Aβ can either be directly introduced into the perivascular area or be secreted from AD neurons such as neurons with APP-mutation. A direct introduction of commercial Aβ is expected to enable the accurate quantification of Aβ accumulation around and Aβ clearance from the BBB. Application of AD neurons to this approach may better represent a pathophysiological condition, while limiting the reproducibility due to the donor-dependent variation. Although it is still a bit early to highlight a number of studies, recent advances in human BBB-on-a-chip technologies are enabling more significant studies on the causal effect of BBB disruption and breakdown in AD pathogenesis and on how to leverage the BBB to treat AD. In this section, we review and highlight a selection of BBB-on-a-chips for AD research (Table 2).

One human BBB-on-a-chip model used a tubular polymeric scaffold with a 2-mm diameter to model a 3D vessel structure[68], where BMECs, smooth muscle cells, and astrocytes form a tight barrier for 4 weeks (Figure 5A)[68]. Aβ40 and Aβ42 was treated on the surrounding tissue chamber composed of fibrin with astrocytes that represents the abluminal side of the BBB in order to mimic a condition of AD that may induce Aβ fibrillization or efflux across the BBB[68]. The model was used to probe the effects of ApoE2 and circulatory HDL to suppress Aβ aggregation[68]. Another BBB-on-a-chip model was built with a lumen structure lined by hBMECs with a 3D neuronal culture (Figure 5B)[69], where APP gene-mutated neurons were introduced to induce robust Aβ plaque formation[69], while excluding pericytes or astrocytes. This model allowed for the measurement of BBB permeability using dextran and quantification of tight junction proteins, confirming that APP gene-mutated neurons increase BBB permeability by Aβ plaque deposition in the vasculature[69]. In addition, a 3D vasculogenic model composed of iPSC-derived BMECs, pericytes, and astrocytes in a Matrigel-based hydrogel was designed to make an in vitro AD model with Aβ introduced into the neuronal cell conditioned medium (Figure 5C)[52]. Use of iPSCs with different ApoE genotypes (e.g. ApoE3/3, ApoE3/4, ApoE4/4) in this model confirmed that BBB cells with the ApoE4/4 genotype exacerbate Aβ aggregation more than the others like shown in clinical results of AD pathogenesis[52].

Given the role of neuroinflammation and BBB disruption in AD pathogenesis, BBB-on-a-chip technologies have been applied to observe AD neuroinflammatory responses. For example, the inflammatory BBB disruption has been evaluated by inducing inflammation with TNF-α, IL-1β, MCP1,2, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) introduction using simple endothelial microfluidics devices[40b, 44]. In addition, treatment of TNF-α along the luminal flow direction in a 3D patterned cylindrical collagen tube structures with pericytes and astrocytes resulted in a better replication of the natural endothelial cytokine release profile compared to that of the Transwell model, as well as compared to the same model without pericytes and astrocytes[70]. Moreover, after the treatment of pro-inflammatory cytokines on these tubular structures, it was possible to examine the inflammatory BBB disruption followed by T cell extravasation and interstitial migration (Figure 5D)[40a]. This approach using 3D patterning of cylindrical collagen tube structure can be further applied in the role of T cells in AD, as interesting mechanistic studies of the relationship reported recently[71].

More importantly, there have been studies on molecular transport mechanisms of BBB-specific transmembrane proteins thanks to the key roles of the BBB in drug delivery into the brain and in natural protein efflux out of the brain like Aβ clearance through RMT efflux[72]. Our recent studies have shown that our BBB-on-a-chip model are useful for studies of RMT pathways. In one example, we used our microfluidic device consisting of a 2D endothelial monolayer with a 3D perivascular channel to obtain higher gene expression of tight junction proteins, solute carrier family proteins (including GLUT1), and RMT transporter proteins (including P-gp, LRP1, and AGER) compared to the same model without pericytes and astrocytes. These proteins are all essential for creating the structure and transcytosis mechanisms of the BBB in AD[47]. In a more advanced 3D environment for perivascular cells of our BBB-on-a-chip, astrocytes have expressed higher maturation and reactivity, especially through the exhibition of AQP4 polarization at the astrocyte end-feet[47], which has been known to play a role in Aβ clearance[34]. Moreover, when we delivered HDL-mimetic nanoparticles, which are also proposed to contribute to Aβ clearance from the brain[73], they crossed the BBB through the RMT pathway more successfully (Figure 5E)[47]. In another example, a hypoxia-enhanced BBB-on-a-chip showed elevated expression of ABC and SLC transporter proteins, as well as higher BBB integrity, when iPSCs were hypoxia-treated during BMEC differentiation[42]. Using this model, RMT was examined using Angiopep-2-conjugated nanoparticles, which showed better transcytosis efficacy compared to bare nanoparticles, as Angiopep-2 is a ligand to LRP-1 on the BMECs[42].

5. Challenges and future directions

Recent advances in development of human BBB-on-a-chip models provide opportunities for addressing questions about BBB-mediated pathophysiology in neurological diseases. However, there remain challenges to be overcome.

5.1 Cell source with high reproducibility and physiological relevance

Robust cell source for reliable and reproducible application has been another challenge, including the need of advanced iPSC protocols. Existing iPSC-derived BBB cells are beginning to replace the immortalized or primary cells thanks to the superiority of physiologic accuracy or patient-specific genetic inheritance, although the low reproducibility, immaturity[64], and reprogramming-associated cellular rejuvenation make it hard to mimic the features of age-related diseases. Maturation of differentiated cells through a long-term culture or direct conversion of somatic cells, which circumvent the rejuvenation process, could be alternatives for new cell sources. Improvement of reproducibility for standardization in organ-on-a-chip technology requires development of automated systems capable of automated culture, media perfusion and refreshment, and analyses[74]. The current challenge lies in the incorporation of this automation into the manufacturable model platform of the BBB while maintaining the complex the structure and physiology.

5.2 Applying fluid flow

One key rationale to use microfluidic systems to culture cells is to be able to apply flow on cells cultured in the channels. Given the long-believed importance of shear stress in the vascular endothelium, numerous microfluidic approaches have readily applied various levels of shear stress to the endothelium, while it remains relatively difficult to have controlled shear stress in models using vasculogenesis. Structural definability and simplicity of the 2D endothelial monolayer model makes it easier to calculate the relationship of the shear stress and flow rate, which allows users to accurately subject a desired shear stress onto the endothelial layer. In contrast, 3D vasculogenesis models naturally and spontaneously form unpredictable complex structure, which makes it harder to apply controlled shear stress to the endothelium due to the variability. However, it remains to be further examined whether shear stress needs to be highly controlled on the microscale vessel structure for BBB recapitulation.

5.3 Maintaining a healthy physiological state as control vs. disease states

We have reported that astrocytes cultured in 3D exhibit more elongated morphology and quiescent state, while showing higher pro-inflammatory reactivity than in 2D[47]. These results indicate that astrocytes cultured in a 3D microenvironment are better used to model neurological diseases, the importance of which has been reported in several impactful research articles[64, 75]. Most BBB-on-a-chip models including Transwell-based ones have unfortunately underestimated the importance of this 3D astrocyte culture. More importantly, more accurate coverage of microvessels by 3D astrocytes may be tuned by adjusting the perivascular cell density to induce sufficient physicochemical contact one another and by providing additional perfusion route from and to 3D astrocyte-laden hydrogel. To do so, however, hydrogels need to be further developed for higher reliability and durability without easy degradation due to physical or enzymatic stimulation deteriorating the 3D structure.

5.4 Biomaterials mimicking the physicochemical properties of the ECM

The physicochemical properties of hydrogel such as elastic modulus, viscosity, and degradability determine the encapsulated cells’ fate[76]. Especially, hydrogels in BBB-on-a-chip models represent the soft brain tissue, and the selection of the hydrogel composition has been a challenge in several human BBB-on-a-chip models to achieve more physiologically accurate conditions. Matrigel, collagen, or fibrin gel is a widely used hydrogel in BBB models. However, commercially available hydrogels often have batch-to-batch variation and, once cultured with cells, are prone to degrade from cell secreted enzymes. The design tradeoff lies in the fact that softer gels better mimic the low modulus of the human brain whereas losing the durability, limiting long-term use of BBB chip models with physiological relevance.

5.5 Automation sensing technologies

A standard method to validate the BBB functionality which would help form a clinically relevant consensus regardless of the chip design. The TEER value is one common standard to evaluate the BBB integrity; however, its measurement still depends on the configuration of BBB chip device. Since the analyses on the current BBB-on-a-chip models rely on immunostaining or qPCR, integration with physical, biochemical, or photo sensors for a real-time behavior recording of BBB physiology could be considered in advanced BBB-on-a-chip designs for reconstruction and verification of various disease models. Sensor-incorporated organ-on-a-chip systems have been developed to monitor tissue functionality like a barrier function of the BBB using electrodes incorporated in BBB-on-a-chip to measure the TEER[77]. In AD models, biosensors can also be used to detect real-time ROS level or Aβ or tau fibrillization.

5.6 Manufacturability

Standard biomanufacturing also has been a big challenge in organ-on-a-chip for years. Laboratory chip designs and experiments, even in those by biotechnology companies remain heavily dependent on the use of PDMS for chip fabrication due to difficulty in mass production of complex channel configuration or multiple channel assembly. The usefulness of PDMS for prototype fabrication of new designs needs to be taken advantage of but widely agreed that PDMS is not an ultimate material to be used due to the selective biomolecule adsorptive property, significantly biasing drug screening[47, 78]. The fabrication material for these chips needs to be replaced with other types of biocompatible polymers more manufacturable and less interactive with molecules, such as polycarbonate or polystyrene. This successful manufacturability would enable high-throughput testing of drug candidates more accurately and efficiently, eventually making a meaningful contribution to the pharmaceutical and biomedical industry.

6. Conclusion

Recent findings in AD research have established that BBB breakdown is an initiator of AD pathogenesis. This has signified the importance of advanced human BBB model development, which is applicable to early mechanistic or theragnostic studies for the irreversible pathogenic cascades of AD. Considering the complexity of the human BBB structure, models that can more accurately replicate the essential BBB structure and function will increase the chance for reliability and reproducibility of pathogenic studies. Numerous advances made to human BBB-on-a-chip devices have been outlined in this review, however only a few of these advancements have been successfully applied to AD research. To design a human AD model, BBB-on-a-chips need to display high integrity, neuroinflammatory responses, and receptor mediated transcytosis. In terms of feasibility and reproducibility, it is hard to conclude that a good BBB-on-a-chip will demand higher technological complexity. As with any model, the most important factor in selecting a proper AD research platform is to focus on what necessary device functions are required based on the purpose of the study.

Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) structure and its role.

(A) BBB consists of endothelial monolayer supported by pericytes and astrocyte end-feet, redrawn from [79]. (B) To keep brain homeostasis, the BBB expresses tight junctions for high integrity, and transporters for selective molecule exchange.

Figure 2. Schematic illustration of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients.

BBB disruption is one of the earliest pathogenic symptoms observed in AD patients. In AD patients, (1) endothelial cells lose their integrity and impair transporter expression, which promotes influx or pathogens and leukocytes and impedes beta-amyloid (Aβ) efflux; (2) pericytes are detached from endothelial cells, and Aβ degradation process is inhibited; (3) astrocyte show depolarization of AQP4 which should be expressed on end-feet and inhibition of Aβ degradation process. Loss of homeostasis and failure of Aβ clearance result in Aβ aggregation, proceeding AD into the irreversible pathogenic cascades.

Figure 3. Illustrated top and side views of recent BBB-on-a-chip models.

(A) A microfluidic 2D cell culture model consists of an apical channel with media flow for endothelial shear stress, and a static basolateral channel with 2D pericytes on the membrane and 2D astrocytes on the membrane or the bottom layer of the channel. (B) A microfluidic 3D perivascular culture model also contains a channel with an endothelial monolayer subjected by shear stress and 2D pericytes on the opposite layer. The perivascular channel consists of 3D astrocytes cultured in hydrogel with side channels for media supply. (C) A microfluidic 3D vasculogenesis model consists of a spontaneously formed angiogenic tubulars. Pericytes and astrocytes are randomly distributed nearby the endothelial cells.
