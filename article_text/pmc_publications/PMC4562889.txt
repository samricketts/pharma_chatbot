The objective of this work was twofold: to generate macro-structural brain signatures of age-related neuropathologies in a community cohort of older adults, and to determine the contribution of brain macro-structure to the variation in antemortem cognition after accounting for the contributions of neuropathologies and demographics. Cerebral hemispheres from 165 participants of two cohort studies of aging were imaged with MRI ex vivo (mean age at death = 90 years; SD = 6 years). The volumes of white matter and 42 gray matter regions were measured. The same hemispheres also underwent neuropathologic examination. AD pathology was negatively associated with volumes of mainly temporal, frontal, and parietal gray matter regions, and with total white matter volume (p&lt;0.05, FDR-corrected). A negative association was also detected between hippocampal sclerosis and volumes of the hippocampus, as well as other temporal and frontal gray matter regions (p&lt;0.05, FDR-corrected). The volume of mainly medial temporal lobe regions explained an additional 5–6% of the variation in antemortem cognition, above and beyond what was explained by neuropathologies and demographics.

1. Introduction

Studies of the aging brain combining in vivo high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical evaluation suggest that different age-related disorders and dementias may be linked to characteristic brain atrophy spatial patterns (Risacher and Saykin, 2013; Weiner, et al., 2013). These patterns are of great interest due to their potential role in the development of in vivo MRI biomarkers of the underlying pathological processes. For example, such a spatial pattern has already been incorporated in the recently revised criteria for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease dementia (McKhann, et al., 2011). However, multiple pathologies commonly coexist in the brains of older persons (Schneider, et al., 2007), and definitive diagnosis of most age-related neuropathologies is only possible at autopsy. Therefore, in order to extract accurate macro-structural brain signatures of age-related neuropathologies it is necessary to combine MRI and pathology information on the same individuals. A number of studies have used in vivo or ex vivo MRI and autopsy to examine the neuropathologic correlates of brain macro-structure (Barkhof, et al., 2007; Burton, et al., 2012; Dawe, et al., 2011; Erten-Lyons, et al., 2013a; Jagust, et al., 2008; Josephs, et al., 2008; Josephs, et al., 2013; Kantarci, et al., 2012; Kaur, et al., 2014; Raman, et al., 2014; Rohrer, et al., 2010; Toledo et al., 2013; Vemuri, et al., 2011; Whitwell, et al., 2008; Whitwell, et al., 2011; Whitwell, et al., 2012; Zarow, et al., 2011). However, these MRI-pathology investigations were characterized by one or more of the following limitations: a) relatively long intervals between in vivo MRI and autopsy, which may have allowed formation of additional pathology not captured in the MRI data; b) relatively limited spatial detail, typically focusing on the volume of the whole brain, ventricles, hippocampus or other medial temporal lobe structures; c) use of clinical cohorts, limiting applicability of the findings to the general population; d) focus on one or few pathologies; e) relatively low numbers of participants. Consequently, the macro-structural brain signatures of various age-related neuropathologies remain a topic of active investigation.

The purpose of the present work was to examine the association between regional brain volumes and age-related neuropathologies using a study design that addresses the above shortcomings by combining ex vivo MRI volumetry and pathology on a large community cohort of older adults. The pathologies that were considered included: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, gross and microscopic infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and transactive response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Ex vivo MRI was selected for the present work because it a) captures brain characteristics at the same brain condition as pathological examination, and b) can be performed even on persons too frail for in vivo MRI (Kotrotsou, et al. 2014). Finally, the contribution of regional brain volumes to the variation in cognition proximate to death was assessed, after accounting for the contribution of neuropathologies and demographics.

2. Methods

2.1 Study Population

Participants in either of two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (Bennett, et al., 2012b) and the Religious Orders Study (Bennett, et al., 2012a), were included in this work. Both studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center, and all participants provided written informed consent and signed an anatomical gift act. All participants underwent annual uniform structured clinical evaluations, including medical history, neurological examination, and cognitive function testing (Bennett, et al., 2006a; Bennett, et al., 2006b). A diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease was determined in accordance with the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association (McKhann, et al., 1984). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was classified in persons who had cognitive impairment but did not meet dementia criteria (Boyle, et al., 2006). At the time of death, all available clinical data were reviewed, and a summary diagnostic opinion was rendered regarding the most likely clinical diagnosis at the time of death (Schneider, et al., 2007a). Summary diagnoses were made blinded to all postmortem data. Participants with structural brain abnormalities (e.g. tumors) not typical of aging and visible with ex vivo MRI were excluded. Persons with white matter lesions appearing hyper-intense in T2-weighted images, with infarcts or microbleeds were not excluded. Analyses were based on the first 165 eligible participants imaged with MRI ex vivo (Table 1).

2.2 Cognitive Testing

A battery of 21 cognitive tests was administered annually including the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Complex Ideational Material, 7 episodic memory tests, 3 semantic memory tests, 3 working memory tests, 4 perceptual speed tests, and 2 visuospatial ability tests (Bennett, et al., 2012a; Bennett, et al., 2012b). The Mini-Mental State Examination was used only for descriptive purposes and the Complex Ideational Material was only used for diagnostic classification. Raw scores on the remaining 19 tests were converted to z-scores. A person’s z-scores across all 19 tests were averaged to yield a single composite score of global cognition (Wilson, et al., 2003). Composite scores for each of the five cognitive domains (episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, visuospatial ability) were constructed by averaging the z-scores from the corresponding individual tests (Bennett, et al., 2006a; Bennett, et al., 2012a; Bennett, et al., 2012b). Cognitive performance most proximate to death was used in analyses.

2.3 Brain Hemisphere Preparation

After a participant’s death, an autopsy technician removed the brain, separated the cerebrum from the cerebellum and brainstem, and divided the cerebrum into left and right hemispheres. One cerebral hemisphere was immersed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde solution and refrigerated at 4 °C within 30 min after removal from the skull. Prior to ex vivo MRI, the hemisphere was positioned in a container filled with 4% paraformaldehyde solution with its medial aspect facing the bottom of the container, and returned to room temperature (Dawe, et al., 2009; Dawe, et al., 2011; Dawe, et al., 2014; Kotrotsou, et al., 2014).

2.4 Ex Vivo MRI Data Acquisition, Image Segmentation, and Volumetry

Ex vivo MRI scans were conducted on clinical 3 Tesla MRI scanners using a 2D fast spin-echo sequence with multiple echo-times (TEs). Due to typical MRI hardware updates, three different MRI scanners were used (Table 1). Nevertheless, similar acquisition parameters were prescribed across scanners (see Dawe, et al., 2014, for more details), and only similar TEs were used for processing.

Segmentation of ex vivo MRI data into white matter and 42 cortical and subcortical gray matter regions followed a recently published multi-atlas approach based on 25 atlases (Kotrotsou, et al., 2014). The volume of each brain region was calculated by multiplying the number of voxels in a region with the voxel volume. Regional volumes were normalized by the participant’s height (therefore, the normalized volumes had units of mm2) (Dawe, et al., 2011). Examples of raw images and segmentation results are presented in Kotrotsou, et al., 2014.

2.5 Neuropathologic Evaluation

Following MRI, the same hemispheres were sectioned into 1 cm thick coronal slabs, and underwent dissection of tissue blocks for diagnosis and evaluation of macroscopic pathology. Blocks were embedded in paraffin, cut into sections and mounted on glass slides. Each case was reviewed by a board-certified neuropathologist who was blinded to age and clinical diagnoses (Arvanitakis, et al., 2011a; Dawe, et al., 2014; Schneider, et al., 2004; Schneider, et al., 2007a; Schneider, et al., 2012).

Modified Bielschowsky silver stain was used to visualize and count neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles in the midfrontal, middle temporal, inferior parietal, entorhinal, and hippocampal (CA1) cortices. Plaque and tangle counts in each brain region were divided by the corresponding standard deviation, and the scaled scores were averaged across the five regions to generate a composite score of global AD pathology for each hemisphere (Schneider, et al., 2007b). A pathologic diagnosis of AD was also rendered according to the National Institute on Aging (NIA)-Reagan criteria (National Institute on Aging, and Reagan Institute Working Group on Diagnostic Criteria for the Neuropathological Assessment of Alzheimer’s Disease, 1997). Hippocampal sclerosis was defined as severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the hippocampus, typically CA1 and/or subicular region, and was rated as present or absent (Schneider, et al., 2009). Lewy bodies were detected by examination of the substantia nigra, entorhinal, cingulate, midfrontal, middle temporal, and inferior parietal cortex with monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylated alpha-synuclein and were rated as present or absent (Schneider, et al. 2012). The total number, location and age of gross infarcts were recorded and confirmed histologically (Schneider, et al., 2004) on paraffin embedded slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Microscopic infarcts were infarcts that were identified by microscopy but not seen grossly. They were identified on 6 μm H&amp;E-stained sections from a minimum of 9 dissected regions (midfrontal, middle temporal, entorhinal, hippocampal, inferior parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices, anterior basal ganglia, thalamus, and midbrain) and were classified by age and specific location (Arvanitakis, et al., 2011a). Gross and microscopic infarcts were scored as none, one, or more than one. Assessment of atherosclerosis was based on the number and extent of vascular involvement at the circle of Willis. Atherosclerosis was rated as none or possible, mild, moderate, and severe. Assessment of arteriolosclerosis was based on the severity of wall thickening and luminal occlusion of the small arterioles in one 6 μm H&amp;E-stained section of anterior basal ganglia. Arteriolosclerosis was rated as none, mild, moderate, and severe. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy was assessed on paraffin embedded sections from: angular gyrus, midfrontal, temporal and calcarine cortices (Arvanitakis, et al., 2011b). The severity of amyloid angiopathy was rated as none, mild, moderate, and severe. TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions (both neuronal and glial) were assessed in 6 μm sections from the amygdala, hippocampus CA1, dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, midtemporal cortex, and midfrontal cortex, stained for monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylated TDP-43 (pS409/410; 1:100). TDP-43 pathology was rated on 4 levels capturing the staging of the pathology: no inclusions; inclusions in amygdala only; inclusions in amygdala as well as entorhinal cortex or hippocampus CA1; and inclusions in amygdala, entorhinal cortex or hippocampus CA1, and neocortex (Yu, et al., 2015).

2.6 Statistical Analysis

Linear regression was used to investigate the association of regional volumes with the composite score of global AD pathology, the presence of hippocampal sclerosis, of Lewy bodies, of gross and microscopic infarcts, and with the severity of atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and TDP-43. All neuropathologies were entered in a single multiple linear regression model, with one model for each region. All regression models included terms to control for: age at death, sex, years of education, the time between death and immersion in paraformaldehyde solution, the time between death and ex vivo MRI, and the MRI scanner used for data acquisition. For all analyses, 2-tailed p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach. Associations of regional volumes with neuropathology were considered significant at p-corrected&lt;0.05.

Linear regression was also used to investigate the contribution of regional volumes to the variation in antemortem cognition across participants, controlling for the contributions of neuropathologies. More specifically, the measures of performance in each of the five cognitive domains, as well as global cognition, were used separately as outcome variables in multiple linear regression models, where the explanatory variables were the neuropathologies and covariates used above. Regression analyses were then repeated after adding a single regional volume in the list of explanatory variables, and the additional percentage of variation in cognition explained was computed as the difference in adjusted R2. The same process was repeated for each region separately.

3. Results

3.1 Demographics and Neuropathology

Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1, and neuropathologic diagnoses are presented in Table 2. There were no significant differences for the parameters presented in Tables 1 and 2 between the group of participants included in this work and 936 other participants of the parent studies (Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study) that had an autopsy after the start of the present work.

3.2 Association of Regional Brain Volumes with Neuropathology

Significant negative associations were demonstrated between regional brain volumes and AD pathology, as well as hippocampal sclerosis.

i) AD pathology

The composite score of global AD pathology was significantly negatively correlated with the volume of white matter, as well as with a number of subcortical and cortical gray matter regions in the temporal, frontal, and parietal cortices (Table 3, Fig. 1), when using multiple linear regression. The largest significant effects (model estimate &lt; −0.03×10−3 mm2, p&lt;0.05, FDR-corrected) were observed in white matter, inferior, middle and superior temporal gyri, fusiform gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus (Table 3).

ii) Hippocampal sclerosis

The presence of hippocampal sclerosis was significantly negatively associated with the volume of the hippocampus and gray matter regions in the temporal and frontal lobes (Table 4, Fig. 2), when using multiple linear regression. The largest significant effects (model estimate &lt; −0.03×10−3 mm2, p&lt;0.05, FDR-corrected) were observed in the hippocampus, inferior and middle temporal gyri, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and rostral middle frontal gyrus (Table 4).

3.3 Contribution of Regional Brain Volumes to the Variation in Cognition

Regression analyses investigating the contribution of individual regional volumes to the variation in antemortem cognition across participants showed that, the volumes of certain temporal lobe regions explained an additional portion of the variance of global cognition (as much as 5.8%) above and beyond what was explained by the neuropathologies and covariates (33%) (Table 5). Similar findings were obtained for the five cognitive domains (Table 5).

4. Discussion

The association of regional brain volumes with age-related neuropathologies was examined in this study by combining ex vivo MRI volumetry and pathology on a large community cohort of older adults (mean age at death = 90 years; SD = 6 years). Spatial patterns of significant negative correlations between regional brain volumes, AD pathology and hippocampal sclerosis were extracted. None of the other neuropathologies considered in this work showed statistically significant links to regional volumes. Finally, the volumes of certain temporal lobe regions measured ex vivo explained a portion of the variation in antemortem cognition not captured by the neuropathologic measures considered in this work.

The spatial pattern of gray matter regions with significant negative correlation between their volume and AD pathology was in general agreement with corresponding patterns from studies combining in vivo MRI volumetry, or voxel-based morphometry, and pathology (Josephs, et al., 2008; Josephs, et al., 2013; Vemuri, et al., 2011; Whitwell, et al., 2008; Whitwell, et al., 2012), as well as with the distribution of neurodegenerative changes of AD seen at autopsy (Braak and Braak, 1997). The agreement between the present findings based on ex vivo imaging and previous results based on in vivo imaging was anticipated, since, in a recent investigation that used the same ex vivo MRI approach on the same cohort as the present study, regional brain volumes measured ex vivo were linearly related to those measured in vivo (Kotrotsou, et al. 2014). The agreement in AD-related patterns serves as confirmation that in vivo and ex vivo MRI can provide similar spatial information on the link between regional brain volumes and neuropathology, increasing confidence on less-known non-AD patterns that were generated here, or will be generated in the future using the same approaches.

Despite the similarities in AD spatial patterns across studies, some discrepancies exist in the relative involvement of different regions within the patterns. More specifically, previous works showed the temporal lobes as the regions with the largest magnitude of AD-related effects (Fig. 2 in Josephs, et al., 2008; Fig. 5 in Josephs et al., 2013; Fig. 2 in Vemuri et al., 2011; Figs. 1 &amp; 2 in Whitwell, et al., 2012; Fig. 1 in Whitwell, et al., 2008), while in the present study, both temporal and frontal lobes showed strong involvement (Fig. 1). This discrepancy may be due to differences in inclusion criteria, demographics or disease progression. More specifically, the present study was based on a community cohort of older adults, while Josephs, et al., 2008, and 2013, and Whitwell, et al., 2012, targeted persons with at least intermediate probability of AD, Vemuri, et al., 2011, focused on persons with a single pathologic diagnosis, and Whitwell, et al., 2008, excluded persons with neurodegenerative disorders other than AD. In addition, statistical analyses in the present study included a wide range of pathologies, while one or few pathologies were considered in previous research. The discrepancies in AD spatial patterns across studies may also be due to differences in image processing approaches used (volumetry based on multi-atlas segmentation vs. voxel-based morphometry). Another possible explanation may be the fact that in the previously published in vivo MRI and pathology studies, the mean interval between the last MRI scan and death was between 2–6 years, with some individuals imaged for the last time as many as 13 years before death (Josephs, et al., 2008; Josephs, et al., 2013; Vemuri, et al., 2011; Whitwell, et al., 2008; Whitwell, et al., 2012). These long intervals may have allowed development of additional pathology that was captured at autopsy but its effects on the macrostructure were not captured by imaging, thereby leading to an underestimation of the relation between pathology and brain macrostructure. An additional possible explanation may be the fact that the most frail individuals tend to be excluded from in vivo MRI research studies, while ex vivo MRI investigations can be conducted without regard to clinical characteristics.

The total white matter volume was also significantly negatively correlated with AD pathology. This association has not been explored previously. Nevertheless, AD pathology has been linked to disruption of white matter integrity (Erten-Lyons, et al., 2013b; Salat, et al., 2009), and published work has shown significantly lower white matter volume in clinically diagnosed AD patients compared to healthy controls (Salat, et al., 2009). Additionally, reduced white matter volume has been associated with dementia in a group where 86% of demented participants met pathologic criteria for AD (Smith, et al., 2000).

The spatial pattern of gray matter regions with significant negative association between their volume and hippocampal sclerosis included not only the hippocampus, but also regions in the temporal and frontal lobes (Table 4, Fig. 2). The regions listed in Table 4 are known to be connected to the hippocampus either directly, or indirectly through other regions included in Table 4, suggesting that neurodegeneration associated with hippocampal sclerosis may extend to regions linked to the hippocampus (Andersen, et al., 2007). For example, neuronal loss and gliosis extending into the parahippocampal and inferior temporal gyri has been reported previously in a few cases of hippocampal sclerosis (Leverenz, et al., 2002). This is also consistent with clinicopathologic studies showing that hippocampal sclerosis affects not only memory but also additional cognitive domains (Brenowitz, et al., 2014; Corey-Bloom, et al., 1997). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first presentation of a spatial pattern of regional volumes negatively associated with hippocampal sclerosis. Most previous studies of brain macrostructure in hippocampal sclerosis focused on the hippocampal formation (Dawe, et al., 2011; Zarow, et al., 2011).

None of the other pathologies considered here showed significant associations with regional brain volumes. However, previous work combining in vivo MRI and pathology showed that Lewy bodies were associated with lower volume in the amygdala, brainstem, inferior and middle temporal lobes (Burton, et al., 2012; Kantarci, et al., 2012; Vemuri, et al., 2011). Also, gross infarcts have been associated with larger ventricular volume (Erten-Lyons, et al., 2013a), and microscopic infarcts with lower volume in the whole brain, precuneus, motor, and somatosensory areas (Raman, et al., 2014). Finally, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Erten-Lyons, et al., 2013a) and TDP-43 (Josephs, et al., 2008; Josephs, et al., 2014) have been linked to smaller hippocampal volumes. These discrepancies may be due to the use of groups with certain clinical symptoms or pathologies instead of community cohorts, or due to other differences in demographics, pathology measures, imaging methods, statistical power, or disease progression. Pathology data on amygdala and brainstem Lewy bodies were not available in the cohorts studied here, and the brainstem was not imaged. Furthermore, ventricular volumes cannot be assessed in brain hemispheres imaged ex vivo.

Regression analyses investigating the contribution of regional volumes to the variation in antemortem cognition across participants showed that, the volume of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and amygdala each explained an additional 4–6% of the variation in global cognition, above and beyond the 33% explained by the neuropathologic measures and other covariates. These findings indicate that temporal lobe regional volumes capture additional brain differences potentially associated with a) the neuropathologies considered here but not captured by the corresponding measures, b) other neuropathologies not considered in this work, or c) other factors that influence regional brain volumes and cognition but are unrelated to pathologic processes. The first is possible since pathology quantification was based on measurements made in specific brain regions and not everywhere in the brain, and the second may also be true since the list of neuropathologies considered here may be incomplete. The third option is also possible since, for example, particular occupations (Maguire, et al., 2000) and experiences (Carlson, et al., 2015) have been associated with higher regional volumes and enhanced cognition. These results demonstrate the important role ex vivo MRI can have in autopsy studies and investigations of cognitive aging.

Although volumetry based on the ex vivo MRI approach used here benefits from capturing brain characteristics at the same brain condition as pathological examination and allows investigation of a more representative sample of the community than conventional in vivo MRI, limitations also exist. First, laterality was not investigated. Second, the intracranial volume typically used for normalization was not available. The height of the participants, which is highly correlated with intracranial volume, was used instead. Third, random small variations in hemisphere resection may have occurred, introducing noise in white matter volume measurements. Furthermore, three MRI scanners were used due to typical updates. Additional factors were included in statistical analysis to account for potential scanner-related effects. Finally, the size of this community sample was not particularly large. Yet, the number of participants in this work was among the highest for studies combining MRI and pathology.

The present study generated spatial patterns of significant negative correlations between regional brain volumes and AD pathology, as well as hippocampal sclerosis. By combining ex vivo MRI volumetry and pathology on a large community cohort of older adults, important biases of previous work combining in vivo imaging and pathology were avoided. The derived AD pattern was consistent with published reports, yet compelling differences existed in the relative involvement of different regions. Evidence on the link between AD pathology and lower cerebral white matter volume was provided. Hippocampal sclerosis was negatively correlated with the volume of regions including, but not limited to the hippocampus. The presented spatial patterns may enhance MRI-based biomarkers. Finally, the volume of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala may have captured underlying processes contributing to the variation in antemortem cognition and not assessed by the neuropathologic measures, demonstrating the important role ex vivo MRI can have in enhancing autopsy studies and advancing our understanding of cognitive aging.

Highlights

Ex vivo brain MR volumetry and pathology in a community cohort of older adults

Alzheimer’s pathology is associated with lower volumes in gray and white matter

Hippocampal sclerosis is associated with lower volume even outside the hippocampus

Regional volumes capture variance in cognition not explained by neuropathologies
