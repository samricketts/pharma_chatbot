Background:

Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-related dementias may lose the ability to drive safely as their disease progresses. Little is known about driving prevalence in older Latinx and non-Hispanic white (NHW) individuals. We investigated the prevalence of driving status among individuals with cognitive impairment in a population-based cohort.

Methods:

This was a cross-sectional analysis of the cohort BASIC-Cognitive study in a community of Mexican American (MA) and NHW individuals in South Texas. Participants scored ≤25 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), indicating a likelihood of cognitive impairment. Current driving status was assessed by the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol informant interview. Logistic regression was used to assess driving versus non-driving adjusted for pre-specified covariates. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare NHW and MA differences in driving outcomes from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) questions for evaluating driving risk in dementia.

Results:

There were 635 participants, 77.0 mean age, 62.4% women, and 17.3 mean MoCA. Of these, 360 (61.4%) were current drivers with 250 of 411 (60.8%) MA participants driving, and 121 of 190 (63.70%) NHW participants driving (p = 0.50). In fully adjusted models age, sex, cognitive impairment, language preference, and Activities of Daily Living scores were significant predictors for the likelihood of driving (p&lt;0.0001). Severity of cognitive impairment was inversely associated with odds of driving, but this relationship was not found in those preferring Spanish language for interviews. Around one-third of all caregivers had concerns about their care-recipient driving. There were no significant differences in MA and NHW driving habits and outcomes from the AAN questionnaire.

Conclusions:

The majority of participants with cognitive impairment were currently driving. This is a cause for concern for many caregivers. There were no significant ethnic driving differences. Associations with current driving in cognitively impaired persons require further research.


pmcIntroduction

Approximately one in nine people aged 65 and older, or 6.7 million, are estimated to live with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in the United States in 20231. Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) have a multitude of symptoms, including problems or changes in memory, planning or problem-solving, familiar task completion, recognition of time or place, comprehension of visual images and spatial relationships, ability to retrace steps, and judgment and interpersonal interactions2. Due to these symptoms, an AD/ADRD diagnosis impacts a patient and their caregiver’s future decisions significantly. One of these surrounds the ability to drive safely as decision-making skills and judgment become impaired1.

However, the ability to drive a vehicle expands one’s freedom to involve themselves in the community. In a cohort study of 1017 drivers aged 70 and older, 71% of older drivers who made the decision to stop driving reported a decrease in their out-of-home engagement with organizations3. Therefore, although driving is still available to the older population and important for social interaction, those with cognitive impairment and risk factors for car accidents should be identified. Caregivers often have insight and influence about care-recipient’s driving.

A recent national sample estimated mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was 42% more common in Latinx than non-Hispanic white (NHW) individuals. Dementia prevalence, however, was not different between these populations4. By 2060, it is estimated 13.85 million people will have Alzheimer’s in the United States. This will include a 423% increase in prevalence from 2020 among the Latinx community5. With the symptoms of this disease affecting one’s ability to drive safely, it is important to understand if driving differs between Latinx and NHW individuals with cognitive impairment. The aims of this paper are to understand the driving prevalence in cognitively impaired Mexican American (MA) and NHW individuals, the predictors of driving in this cohort, and caregiver opinions about those who continue to drive.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC)-Cognitive project. The study is located in Nueces County, Texas, where 33% of residents are NHW, 61% are MA, and 96% of the Latinx population identify as US citizens6. BASIC-Cognitive is a National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded population-based prospective cohort study of cognitive impairment in MA and NHW populations.

Sample population

Randomly identified potential participants were contacted through door-to-door, community-based, phone, and nursing home/assisted living sampling with inclusion criteria of living in Nueces County, Texas for at least six months every year, being 65 years of age or older, and speaking English or Spanish. A cognitive screen done with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was performed, and those who scored 25 or less were identified as individuals with likely cognitive impairment. These participants are given their scores and encouraged to discuss the results with their personal healthcare provider. We also give participants and caregivers an extensive local resources list. To continue with the study, these individuals were asked to identify an informal caregiver to enroll with them. To be a caregiver, one must be 18 years of age or older and pass a short cognitive assessment (Mini-Cog). The full methods of BASIC-C were previously reported7.

Outcome

HCAP informant driving status

The outcome of interest is the participant’s current driving status reported by the caregiver on the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) informant interview8. Additionally, in January 2020, a series of questions were added for participants that did not drive. Caregivers were asked if the participant never drove, stopped driving less than 1 year ago, or stopped driving more than 1 year ago.

AAN informant risk assessment

For participants that did drive within the past 12 months, we asked the caregiver a series of 13 questions for evaluating driving risk in dementia developed by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN)9. Three questions were asked about the frequency of violations and car accidents(options zero to four). Ten questions were asked about the participant’s driving behavior and the concerns of the caregiver or others(options from ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’).

Covariates

Age, sex, race, ethnicity, number of years of education, marital status, and preferred language were self-reported by the participants. The preferred language choices include English only, Spanish only, both English and Spanish, and other. None of the MA or NHW participants preferred other languages. We consolidated English and Both into one category for the logistic regression analysis. Cognitive functioning was measured by the MoCA, a cognitive screening assessment that evaluates multiple domains of cognitive performance10. MoCA scores range from 0 to 30 and lower scores indicate worse performance. The participants, who were screened during 4/1/2020–8/11/2022, completed the assessment remotely using the telephone version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA) which ranges from 0–22 11. To conduct the analysis including the participants who completed either in-person or telephone versions of MoCA, T-MoCA scores were converted to the full MoCA score (0–30) using the equipercentile equating method12. Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) is the loss in everyday activities due to cognitive impairment and were measured by Part 1 of the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale13. The Blessed Part 2 rating scale measured the assistance needed with the Activities of Daily Living (ADL), which includes eating, toileting, and dressing functional loss due to cognitive impairment.

The participants whose caregiver completed the HCAP informant interview between 4/1/2020 and 3/31/2021 were classified as accessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This variable enabled the conduction of sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of the pandemic on the association between driving status and factors included in the final logistic regression model.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive analyses were conducted to analyze demographic characteristics and the MoCA, IADL, and ADL scores for the total sample. The effect of ethnicity on driving status was examined through logistic regression. Model 1 included only ethnicity to assess the unadjusted effect of ethnicity on driving. In Model 2, age, sex, education level, marital status, and preferred language were added. Model 3 included the same covariates as in Model 2 except that ethnicity and preferred language were replaced with the combined variable to evaluate how preferred language moderates the effect of ethnicity on driving status. In Model 4, MoCA scores and the interaction between MoCA scores, ethnicity, and preferred language were added. Bivariate analysis suggested a linear relationship between MoCA scores and the log odds of driving so a linear MoCA term was used. Both part 1 and part 2 of the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale were added in Model 5 to examine the effects after accounting for other covariates in Model 4. Model 6 is the final model where the covariates with p-value &gt; 0.05 were excluded from the model to achieve parsimony. In Model 7, we added the indicator of being accessed during COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the participants, whose caregiver completed the HCAP informant interview between 4/1/2020 and 3/31/2021, were excluded from Model 6b as a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the association between driving status and factors in the Model. Statistical analysis was performed using procedures in SAS V9.4. The significance level was set at 5%.

To illustrate the moderating effect of ethnicity and language on the association between MoCA score and driving status, the likelihood of driving was estimated based on the coefficients of Model 6 for 1)NHW individuals who preferred English or both (NHW-Eng) with MoCA score=17 (used as the reference level of the odds ratio), 2)NHW-Eng with a range of MoCA scores, 3)MA individuals who preferred English or Both (MA-Eng) with a range of MoCA scores, and 4)MA individuals who preferred Spanish (MA-Span) with a range of MoCA scores. The odds of driving for an NHW-Eng with a specific MoCA score over the odds of the reference group, NHW-Eng with MoCA score=17, can be computed based on the estimated likelihood of driving.

For the AAN driving questionnaire, only a few participants had two or more violations or accidents, so the response levels were consolidated into a binary variable with 0 for no incidents and 1 for one or more incidents. The Chi-square test was used to compare the proportion of any violations or car accidents between NHW and MA participants. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the difference between NHW and MA participants in the questions related to driving behaviors and the concerns from others. The FREQ and NPAR1WAY procedure in SAS V9.4 was used and the significance level was set at 5%. Only female respondents were never-drivers, so the likelihood of never-driving by ethnicity was analyzed for female respondents.

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents

The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approved the project. Verbal assent was obtained from participants before the MoCA. Caregivers provided informed consent for themselves and cognitively impaired participants for the baseline interviews. The data that support the findings of this study will be considered upon reasonable request from the corresponding author.

Results

There were 2190 participants that were age-eligible and consented to do the MoCA. Of these, 17 refused during the MoCA and 2173 completed it. Of those who completed it, 1470 were score-eligible and able to proceed to the baseline interview. There were 635 participants in the total analytic sample which included participants whose caregivers completed the HCAP baseline informant interview between 5/7/18–12/17/22. Participants with one or more missing values for the covariates listed in Table 1 (n=49) were excluded from the logistic regression models. The logistic regression analysis was also restricted to MA and NHW participants because of a low number from other racial/ethnic groups yielding 635 participant and caregiver dyads. The AAN questions and questions regarding when participants stopped driving were added to the study later. 160 and 286 participants answered these questions, respectively.

Among the 635 participants, the mean age was 77 (SD=8), 62.4% women, and 17.3 mean MoCA (SD=6.5). Participants’ characteristics are available in Table 1. There were 411 who identified as MA and 190 as NHW. For MA participants, 8.1% graduated college compared to 34.3% of NHW participants. Of those driving, 20.3% had a college education. 10.2% of those not driving had at least college education. Spanish was the preferred language for 25.9% of MA and for none of the NHW participants. In total, 61.4% were current drivers with 60.83% MA participants driving, and 63.68% NHW participants driving (p = 0.503). All 15 participants in the nursing home/assisted living sample were not driving. In the no-driving group, 73.6% were female, whereas 54.8% of the driving group were female.

The logistic regression models predicting driving is shown in Supplementary Table S1. Age, sex, and language were significant predictors of the likelihood of driving in Model 2 (p&lt;0.001). Age and sex continue to be significant in Model 3 (p&lt;0.001), where the combination term of language and ethnicity was added. In Model 4, cognitive status reported through MoCA score also had a significant impact on driving for NHW-Eng (p&lt;0.001) and for MA-Eng (p=0.005), as well as the ethnicity-language combination terms of NHW-Eng (p=0.002). The ADL factor was significant in Model 5, but IADL was not. The COVID-19 sensitivity analysis in Model 6b and 7 found that COVID-19 was not a predictor for driving. 16

The final factors associated with driving are shown in Table 2. Higher age is associated with a lower chance of driving, with a 7% decreased odds per year (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90–0.96). Male sex has a 285% increased likelihood of driving compared to female sex (OR, 3.85; 95% CI, 2.26–6.55). Higher ADL impairments had a 70% decreased likelihood of driving (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.22–0.42).

Severity of cognitive impairment as measured by MoCA score was associated with odds of driving, but this relationship was modified by the preferred language of the participant after accounting for age, sex, and the level of physical impairment (Figure 1). For the respondents with average cognitive status or a MoCA score of 17, the odds of driving were 2.4 times higher for NHW-Eng than for MA-Span. For MA-Span respondents, different cognitive status did not change their odds of driving. Higher cognitive performance increased the odds of driving for all respondents who preferred speaking English. The odds of driving for NHW-Eng increased with higher MoCA score. MA-Eng had a similar trend to NHW-Eng, but the effect of MoCA score was more attenuated. For NHW-Eng, the odds of driving for MoCA score=20 was 2.18 times the odds of driving for MoCA score=17, and an increase of 3 in the MoCA score in this population was estimated to increase the odds of driving by 118%. We have confirmed that MA-Span has the range of MoCA scores that can sufficiently capture the relationship between MoCA scores and driving.

Among 286 participants who answered the question about stopping or never driving, 7.0%never drove. All respondents in both ethnic groups who never drove were female. Among women, in the NHW population, 3 participants (5.08%) were never-drivers, compared to 15 participants (13.39%) in the MA population. The effect of MA versus NHW ethnicity was not significant in predicting the likelihood of never-driving for females after accounting for age and education (OR, 1.5; p=0.6).

Figures 2 and 3 show the responses to the AAN driving questionnaire comparing MA and NHW participants. In the total cohort of drivers over the past three years, two participants had received three or more traffic violations, one participant had been in four or more accidents, and one participant had been in three accidents where they were at fault. All these participants were MA individuals. There were 33 participants with one or two traffic violations, 38 participants that had been in one or two accidents, and 23 participants that had been at fault for these accidents over the past three years. Overall, there are no significant differences in the number of traffic violations or car accidents between the MA and NHW groups.

Caregivers were asked about driving habits if the care-recipient was currently driving. About one-third (35.6%) of caregivers agreed or strongly agreed with having concerns about the care-recipient’s ability to drive safely (38.3% of NHW caregivers, 34% of MA), and 31.3% of caregivers agreed or strongly agreed with others having concerns safely (36.7% of NHW caregivers, 28% of MA). Caregivers often agreed or strongly agreed that care-recipients currently limit the amount of driving they do (45.6% total, 48.3% of NHW and 44% of MA individuals), avoid driving at night (66.9% total, 65% NHW and 68% MA individuals), avoid driving in the rain (53.8% total, 53.3% NHW and 54% MA individuals), and avoid driving in busy traffic (52.5% total, 43.3% NHW and 58% MA individuals). Few caregivers believed the person they cared for would participate in aggressive driving, including actions like running a red light on purpose, driving after drinking too much alcohol, and displaying road rage toward other drivers. These behaviors ranged from 1.3% to 11.3% who answered agree or strongly agree. The caregiver’s rating of the study participant’s driving behaviors between these two ethnic populations was not significantly different.

Discussion

This study found that younger age, male sex, less cognitive impairment, the combination of ethnicity and preferred language, and ability to perform ADLs were significant predictors of the likelihood of driving status (p&lt;0.0001). This is similar to findings in other studies 14,15. In the current study of participants with a mean MoCA score of 17, 61% were still driving. The more cognitively impaired an individual was, the less likely they were to be driving. The relationship between their impairment and driving was shown to be modified by the language the participant preferred to speak, with MA-Span having lower odds of driving than NHW-Eng, depending on the level of cognitive impairment. Compared to NHW-Eng, MA-Eng had higher odds of driving at MoCA scores below 20 and lower odds of driving at MoCA scores of 20 and above. Overall, there was no significant difference in MA and NHW driving habits and outcomes from the AAN questions.

Dementia affects neuropsychological and visual skills, reducing driving safety. In a study that examined driving with dementia, participants who failed a driving exam scored more poorly on items regarding their ability to follow instructions, make correct and quick decisions, interpret traffic signs, stay in their driving lane, make a complete stop, and understand how their driving was affecting others16. A review of motor vehicle crash risk for driving with dementia found medium to large effects of driving impairment and an increased likelihood to fail a road test compared to healthy controls17. For those experiencing cognitive impairment, these processes could be dangerous.

The AAN questionnaire results from the current study showed that 36% of caregivers had concerns about participants continued driving, but participants continued to drive. Many caregivers stated high agreement that participants had already reduced the amount of driving they do or driving in stressful situations. Study participants may be choosing these behaviors because they notice or have been told about a decrease in their ability to react and safely assess road conditions.

Discussions between caregivers and care-recipients about driving cessation are difficult. Caregivers may fear discussions regarding losing autonomy, or for the care-recipient to experience embarrassment. Increased caregiving burden may also result when the care-recipient stops driving18. To help older persons and caregivers begin these conversations, some factors to consider are the caregiver and care-recipient’s baseline educational understanding of dementia in the context of driving19, the type of relationship between the individuals20, and access to post-driving support21. Close family members or individuals with shared experiences should initiate conversations for best acceptance20, preferably earlier when the care-recipient is still able to understand the reasons and actively participate in the discussion22. Clinicians can reference online guidelines to help caregivers navigate these conversations23. Advanced Driving Directives (ADD) are an agreement between a person and trusted individual to have conversations regarding driving cessation24. These directives have not been developed for or tested among Spanish-speaking populations. In a study analyzing opinions on ADD of individuals 55 or older, results showed that 86% said they “would” or “maybe would” complete an ADD if it was recommended to them24.

Differences in Latinx and NHW driving prevalence were not found in the current study, but cultural and social influences may explain the driving population’s composition. The current study found a higher proportion of never-drivers in female and MA individuals. Sex differences in driving have been previously studied. Data from a clinical trial on cognitive training interventions found that 165 out of the 205 participants who stopped driving over 5 years were female (80.5%)25. Using data from the 1993 Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) Study and the 2008 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), never-drivers were found to be 95% female in 1993 and 91% female in 200826. This same study looked at Latinx ethnicity and driving and found that Latinx people became more common among never-drivers over the years, rising from 13% to 35% from 1993 to 2009. During this same time-frame, the proportion of never-drivers who are NHW declined from 66% to 38%21. MA ethnicity and female sex together may be associated with greater likelihood of never driving, but this relationship has not been previously reported. Cultural influences may also contribute to the difference in driving prevalence in the MA population. The social determinants of health could also impact driving accessibility due to vehicle ownership and operation costs27.

The strengths of this study include its population-based cohort design and the door-to-door, phone, and community outreach procedure that allowed all age-eligible community members to participate. Nueces County has a large non-immigrant MA population and therefore is an optimal population to follow longitudinally. The BASIC-Cognitive staff included Spanish speakers which allowed for the participation of Spanish-speaking MA individuals and increased inclusivity. The limitations of the project were that the analysis was cross-sectional and therefore cannot determine causality, although nested in a cohort study. The MoCA was used to define cognitive impairment rather than a more comprehensive diagnostic tool. The caregiver’s self-report of care-recipient’s driving could potentially introduce bias. Participants with cognitive impairment that did not have an informal caregiver could not enroll. Less than 8% of participants were excluded from the analysis due to missing data so statistical analytic power was not diminished. If incomplete cases differ from complete ones, the analysis results could be slightly biased; however, Chi-square tests were used to confirm no association between the missingness and demographic characteristics.

In summary, this study found that the majority of persons with cognitive impairment were still driving despite concerns raised by caregivers and others. The study also found important predictors of not driving including, age, sex, cognitive status, the combination of ethnicity and preferred language, and ADL abilities. Some of the language preferences and sex associations are complex and require further evaluation in larger cohorts. Nonetheless, entities could utilize the information presented to address access and safety for their older adult population and distribute information. Additional research is needed to provide safety for drivers and pedestrians while preserving functional independence and social interaction for as long as safely possible.

Key Points

We report that the majority of cognitively impaired persons in this study were currently driving. One-third of caregivers and others were concerned about this.

There was no significant difference in Mexican American and Non-Hispanic White individuals driving habits and outcomes.

Why does this matter?

This is important since it suggests the need for further research to determine driving safety across multi-ethnic populations of cognitively impaired persons.

Conflict of Interest

Dr. Langa receives grant funding from the NIA and Alzheimer’s Association and consults on NIH-funded projects related to identifying dementia in population-based studies. Drs. Morgenstern, Briceño, Mehdipanah, Levine, Zahuranec, and Heeringa receive grant funding from the NIH.

Supplemental Material: Results of a series of logistic regression models assessing the factors associated with driving (vs. non-driving) is shown in Supplementary Table S1.
