Introduction: Alzheimer’s Disease

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration that progresses throughout the neocortex and limbic system. It is estimated that over 5 million people in the US alone are suffering from AD with this number expected to quadruple by 2050 due to the increased aging population. AD is the 6th leading cause of death in the US with an economic burden exceeding $1 trillion annually with no definitive method for diagnosis or treatment.

Neuropathologically, AD brains contain an extracellular buildup of amyloid plaques composed of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), in addition to the intraneuronal accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed mainly of aggregated forms of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases generates Aβ peptide. Aβ can aggregate in amyloid plaques due to several factors. Genetic mutations in rare forms of dominantly inherited AD are due to mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) or the presenilin (PSEN1, PSEN2) genes. PSEN1 and PSEN2 proteins are part of the gamma-secretase complex that cleave APP. In aggregate, these gene mutations strongly implicate Aβ aggregation as causative to the disease process (Sisodia &amp; St George-Hyslop 2002). These early observations led to the “amyloid cascade hypothesis” that accumulation of amyloid plaques result from an imbalance between the production, aggregation, or clearance of Aβ, which initiates the disease process (Hardy &amp; Allsop 1991; Hardy &amp; Selkoe 2002). The accumulation of Aβ aggregates further facilitates the formation of intracellular NFT that progress the neurodegenerative disease. These findings have led to therapeutic strategies targeting Aβ production that include inhibitors or modulators of β- and γ-secretases targeting Aβ production or immunotherapies to promote Aβ clearance (Ghosh et al 2012; Holtzman et al 2011).

Mouse models of Aβ amyloidosis

Following the observation that Aβ aggregation and plaque formation was associated with the development of AD, immunization against the plaque forming Aβ protein was first tested in animals in 1999. Active immunization with a synthetic human Aβ42 protein in PDAPP mice, a transgenic mouse model of AD, developed and maintained a high titre of anti-Aβ antibody (Schenk et al 1999). Strikingly, immunization of young animals halted the development of the Aβ-related neuropathological hallmarks of AD including Aβ plaques, dystrophic neuritis, and gliosis. Furthermore, immunization of aged animals after plaque deposition had started also revealed a significant decrease in amyloid burden, neuritic dystrophy and gliosis. Shortly following Janus C et al. and Morgan et al. demonstrated active immunization in AD mouse models prior to the development of plaque pathology decreased the development of memory and other cognitive deficits in APP transgenic mice. However, the neuroprotective effects on memory did not always corroborate with a significant decrease in amyloid plaque pathology (Janus et al 2000; Morgan et al 2000).

The overwhelming success of active immunization in mouse models of amyloidosis was immediately followed by studies of passive immunization by intraperitoneal injection of monoclonal antibodies against Aβ. Peripheral administration of monoclonal antibodies against Aβ peptide in one APP transgenic model, PDAPP mice, reduced cortical Aβ protein levels and effectively decreased Aβ plaque pathology (Bard et al 2000). In addition, treatment with ant-Aβ antibodies in 13 month old PDAPP mice already with some early beginnings of plaque deposition, significantly cleared preexisting amyloid plaques. In another study by DeMattos et al., chronic parenteral treatment in young PDAPP mice with anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody suppressed Aβ pathology in PDAPP mice (DeMattos et al 2001) and strongly increased plasma Aβ levels by as much as 1000-fold over basal levels. Furthermore, sub-chronic and acute passive immunization of aged 24 month old PDAPP mice improved the memory behavioral performance of these mice without any apparent effect on plaque pathology (Dodart et al 2002).

The dissociation between the neuroprotective effects on memory deficits and Aβ pathology were evident for both active and passive immunization studies. Additional studies have since further illustrated in AD mouse models, effects on behavior do not always correlate with effects on Aβ plaque pathology (Chen et al 2007; Hartman et al 2005; Oddo et al 2006). Collectively, these studies suggest other mechanisms in addition to Aβ plaque formation per se may underlie the memory and cognitive deficiency in APP transgenic mouse models of Aβ amyloidosis (Brody &amp; Holtzman 2008). Conceivably, active or passive immunization targets toxic soluble Aβ species or species that can be solubilized that sequester or facilitates central or peripheral clearance, thus decreasing cognitive and memory deficits (Klein et al 2001; Selkoe 2002). Indeed, in human AD pathological studies the amyloid burden does not correlate well with the severity of dementia, as opposed to a stronger correlation between biochemically soluble Aβ levels and the severity of cognitive impairment (Esparza et al 2013; Lue et al 1999; Wang et al 1999). Furthermore, cell culture and animal models of AD have illustrated that soluble, oligomeric forms of Aβ is not only neurotoxic but also memory impairing (Lambert et al 1998; Lesne et al 2006; Shankar et al 2008; Walsh et al 2002). A major challenge for the field is to determine whether amyloid plaque clearance per se or sequestration-clearance/neutralization of soluble oligomeric Aβ species prevents or slows the neurodegenerative processes in human AD.

Mechanisms of antibody-mediated Aβ clearance

Understanding a mechanism that accounts for the clearance of Aβ or neutralization of its toxicity is critical for developing a safer and more effective immunotherapeutic. A number of hypotheses have arisen that are largely dependent on whether antibodies effectively enter the central nervous system “CNS hypothesis” and have their effects there or whether the antibody present in the periphery is sufficient to result in beneficial effects “peripheral sink hypothesis” (Figure 1). It is possible that more than one mechanism is important. All antibodies present in the periphery enter the CNS to some extent. Approximately 0.1 to 0.2% of the concentration of an IgG in plasma is present in CSF. Initial studies in immunized PDAPP mice illustrated that anti-Aβ antibodies effectively entered the CNS and decorated Aβ plaques. Immunohistological analyses presented evidence for a microglia-dependent phagocytosis of Aβ, as activated microglia cells were associated with the remaining plaques that were immunoreactive for Aβ (Bard et al 2000). Moreover, ex vivo assay using sections of PDAPP mouse brains and topical antibody treatment induced a microglia phagocytic clearance of Aβ plaques that were Fc-dependent. Despite these findings, anti-Aβ antibodies that lack effector function have still been shown to have efficacy (Adolfsson et al 2012; Bacskai et al 2002). This suggests that more than one mechanism of local clearance may be at play in addition to FcRγ-mediated microglial clearance such as direct dissolution of plaques or altering the equilibrium between plaques and soluble Aβ species.

The initial findings that soluble Aβ is cleared from the CNS into the periphery across the blood brain barrier (BBB) by active transport, together with a continuous influx of Aβ from the periphery into the CNS are the initial bases for the “peripheral sink” hypothesis (Figure 1) (Deane et al 2003; DeMattos et al 2001; Dodart et al 2002; Sagare et al 2007; Shibata et al 2000). Potentially, passive immunization sequesters soluble Aβ within the periphery lowering free Aβ concentrations in the blood resulting in a net efflux of Aβ from the CNS (DeMattos et al 2001; Dodart et al 2002). Indeed, passive immunization with anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody m266 effectively reduced amyloid pathology in AD mouse models without directly binding to Aβ plaques yet, a massive increase of Aβ levels were detected in the plasma. Therefore, disrupting the Aβ equilibrium between the CNS and periphery may have played a role in decreasing the amyloid burden. Moreover, active immunization with a nonfibrillogenic Aβ peptide that elicited an attenuated IgM antibody response that are less permeable to the BBB improved cognitive performance and effectively lowered Aβ burden (Sigurdsson et al 2004). Further analysis revealed plasma levels of IgM correlated inversely with the amyloid burden. In another study, mutant Aβ with a form predisposing to both amyloid deposition and CAA that could not cross the blood-brain-barrier effectively from the brain to the blood could not be cleared in the presence of plasma anti-Aβ antibodies supporting the “peripheral sink” hypothesis(Vasilevko et al 2007). These studies argue that peripheral sequestration of Aβ acts as a “peripheral sink” may also be operative. An antibody such as m266 is also likely to locally sequester monomeric Aβ in the brain where it could also directly sequester soluble Aβ and alter the equilibrium between soluble and aggregated species.

Active Immunization targeting Aβ

Translation to clinic was met with much enthusiasm as the first immunotherapeutic to target amyloid burden in AD patients rapidly moved into a phase 1 clinical trial (AN1792). In 2000, the first phase I trial for a single dose using a mixture of full length fibrillar Aβ protein along with a saponin adjuvant to prime the immune system involved only 24 patients. No adverse effects were reported with a good tolerance which quickly transitioned toward a multiple dosing study involving over 70 patients with mild-to-moderate sporadic AD. Although, AN1792 was well tolerated and elicited a good immunological response, one patient developed dizzy spells, drowsiness, fever and unstable gate following a fifth injection with a reformulated preparation containing polysorbate-80. The patient remained unstable until she died from pulmonary embolism one year after the last injection and well after a phase II study had been initiated. Postmortem examination confirmed the patient had developed T-lymphocyte predominant meningoencephalitis a symptom not associated with AD (Nicoll et al 2003). The exact cause of meningoencephalitis remains unknown, however, cytotoxic T-cells surrounding cerebral vessels suggested an excessive Th1-meidated response.

The phase I study was too small to determine possible efficacy and a phase II study of active immunization with a mixture of full length fibrillar Aβ protein and polysorbate-80 involving 372 mild-to-moderate AD patients was initiated. Abruptly, the study was halted in January 2002 after reports of four actively immunized patients developed signs which were consistent with meningoencephalitis (Senior 2002). An additional study identified a total of 6% (18/300) of actively immunized patients developed meningoencephalitis with no obvious relationship between the number of injections and the severity of postvaccination meningoencephalitis (Orgogozo et al 2003). In addition, there was no consistent correlation with Aβ antibody titers with the development of encephalitis.

Although the AN1792 trial was terminated prior to full evaluation of any therapeutic benefits on cognitive decline, insights into the potential of immunotherapies was gained by neuropathological analysis of the first deceased participants in the phase I trial. Post mortem analyses revealed AN1792 treatment resembled characteristics to that of aged PDAPP mice following Aβ immunization (Nicoll et al 2003). Extensive areas of the cerebral cortex displayed low Aβ plaques density with decreased plaque-associated dystrophic neurites. Furthermore, both astrocyte and microglia clusters were significantly decreased and Aβ immunoreactivity was associated with microglia cells implicating active phagocytosis as plausible mechanism of clearance. However, tangles, neuropil threads and cerebral amyloid angiopathy were unaltered and displayed typical AD pathology.

More recent neuropathological studies of the remaining patients from the AN1792 immunization trial confirmed active immunization with full length fibrillar Aβ protein can lead to a reduced Aβ burden (Masliah et al 2005; Serrano-Pozo et al 2010). More specifically, a significant reduction in total Aβ deposits with reduced plaque density throughout the cerebral cortex and hippocampus compared to non-treated AD patients. Further, the decrease in amyloid burden was inversely correlated with anti-Aβ antibodies titres in plasma and CSF. In addition, a significant decrease in Aβ proteins levels from the frontal cortex of actively immunized patients was also evident, consistent with a reduction in Aβ plaques. More recently, quantification of phosphorylated tau and total tau protein in CSF were also reportedly reduced in immunized patients, speculating that there may be a reduced neurodegenerative process (Boche et al 2010; Gilman et al 2005).

Despite the overwhelming evidence that active immunization decreased amyloid burden and related pathology in AD patients, there is little evidence to suggest any major positive effects on cognitive function. While early reports for a subset of treated AN1792 patients that displayed a modest but significant slowing of cognitive decline, more recent long-term follow-up studies have yielded no differences in neither progression of dementia nor overall survival (Hock et al 2003). Including neuropathological studies from a few AN1792 patients that displayed significant complete amyloid plaque clearance yet developed severe end stage dementia at death (Holmes et al 2008). Importantly, these early studies were not powered to see a treatment effect on cognition and they were terminated very early. In addition, they were done in individuals with mild to moderate dementia believed to be due to AD. This is a time point years after Aβ deposition had likely reached its maximal extent (Holtzman 2008), making it likely that this was not the optimal time to target Aβ during the course of AD.

While AN1792 trial provided little evidence for preventing cognitive decline in AD, a second generation of active Aβ immunization was developed avoiding a Th1-mediated cellular response. CAD106 is comprised from a small Aβ fragment (Aβ1-6) eliminating residues 15–42 that had been attributed to Th1 lymphocyte activation leading to meningoencephalitis (Furlan et al 2003; Wiessner et al 2011). To induce an immune response the Aβ1-6 was coupled to a carrier containing 180 copies of the coat protein from bacteriophage Qβ. In mouse models of AD, CAD106 induced anti-Aβ antibodies and reduced amyloid plaque burden (Wiessner et al 2011). A phase I clinical trial was initiated in 2012 to assess tolerability, immune response, and potential alterations on biomarkers in mild-to-moderate AD patients (Winblad et al 2012). CAD106 treated subjects reported minor adverse effects predominantly nasopharygitis but no cases of meningoencephalitis that ended AN1792 trials. At 8 weeks post injection, plasma levels of anti-Aβ antibody peaked and correlated with an increase in total Aβ protein in the plasma. No significant changes were identified in CSF biomarkers between CAD106 treated and control groups. A phase II clinical trial involving an extended exposure to antibodies, higher doses, and longer time points for collecting data analyses was recently completed and data analyses are pending (Clinical Trials.gov Identifiers: NCT01097096, NCT00956410, NCT00795418, NCT01023685 and NCT00733863).

Additional active Aβ immunotherapies designed to avoid activation of the Th-1 mediate response include Affitope and ACC-001. Similar to CAD106, Affitope is composed of a small synthetic peptide of six amino acids from the N terminus of Aβ with an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (Schneeberger et al 2009). Following a two year phase I trial that tested tolerability and immunogenicity, a phase II trial in patients with early AD as diagnosed by episodic memory deficit, hippocampal atrophy, or diagnosis by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was recently completed with data pending (Clinical Trials.gov Identifiers: NCT01117818). ACC-001 is a N terminal peptide conjugated to a surface-active saponin adjuvant OS-21 an immunostimulatory agent. Currently ACC-001 is in phase II clinical trial however no data has been reported at the time of this review (Clinical Trials.gov Identifiers: NCT01284387).

Passive Immunization targeting Aβ

Although active immunization presents a sustainable long term treatment that may be favorable for AD, especially as a primary or secondary prevention, several concerns have arisen. In particular, active immunization is dependent on the immunogenicity that may not be favorable in elderly populations that potentially display a decreased immune response. Moreover, the specificities and titre of each generated antibody may vary vastly between individuals, making it difficult to control dosing and adverse effects. Furthermore, adverse effects are difficult to shut down as active immunization is long lasting. An alternative approach to overcome many of these complications is passive immunization. Passive immunization involves the administration of an externally generated antibody into individuals, bypassing the dependency on an immune response. Therefore, passive immunization enables strict regulation of antibody titre allowing for a safer control of adverse effects. In addition, it allows for precise targeting of epitopes or conformations, decreasing variability between individuals.

The first passive immunization trial in humans involved Bapineuzumab (Table 1) a humanized version of the mouse anti-Aβ monoclonal 3D6 antibody targeting the N terminus of Aβ1-5. In mouse models of AD, 3D6 was shown to bind soluble, oligomeric and fibrillar Aβ species which effectively decreased amyloid burden when given in a preventive mode (Bard et al 2000). When given to animals with significant Aβ burden, it did not significantly decrease Aβ burden (Demattos et al 2012). A phase II trial revealed high dosages of Bapineuzumab was associated amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) and intracerebral microhemorrages that were observed more frequently in APOEε4 carriers (Rinne et al 2010; Salloway et al 2009). These adverse effects may be due to certain antibodies including this one targeting aggregated forms of Aβ with the antibody having intact FcRγ receptor function leading to an increase in vascular Aβ, inflammation, and damage to the BBB (Pfeifer et al 2002; Racke et al 2005; Wilcock et al 2004).

In a phase III trial with Bapineuzumab a moderate but significant reduction in CSF phosphorylated tau was reported specifically in known carriers of APOEε4 treated with Bapineuzumab, consist with a phase II results (Salloway et al 2014). In addition, Pittsburgh compound B (C-PiB) measurements of Aβ plaques revealed a slight reduction in amyloid burden in APOEε4 patients treated with Bapineuzumab. However, in small subsets of non-carriers for APOEε4 studied with biomarkers, there were no significant changes in either biomarkers or amyloid burden. Despite the promising results within the APOEε4 carrier group, the overall phase III trial failed to meet primary end points with respect to changes in cognitive and functional performance. A more recent phase I trial has been completed with a new version of Bapineuzumab (AAB-003) that was reengineered to prevent the adverse effects of ARIAs enabling a higher sustainable dosing in mild-to-moderate AD patients (Clinical Trials.gov Identifiers: NCT01193608).

Solanezumab is a humanized version of a murine anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody m266 that selectively targets the mid-domain of the Aβ protein (Table 1). Studies in AD mouse models demonstrated that m266 specifically binds soluble Aβ with little affinity for fibrillar Aβ or amyloid plaque deposits (DeMattos et al 2001; Dodart et al 2002). Passive immunization of aged AD mouse models with m266 reverted memory deficits independent of altering amyloid pathology. In a phase II study, 52 patients displaying mild-to-moderate AD received monthly injections of Solanezumab for three months and there was good tolerance with no significant adverse effects (Farlow et al 2012). Following a 12 week endpoint, no significant changes in cognitive performance were measurable between the placebo and Solanezumab group. In addition, amyloid imaging studies with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) did not reveal any significant changes within the treated Solanezumab group. Biomarker analyses revealed a significant increase in total Aβ concentrations in the CSF of individuals treated with Solanezumab with no changes in tau protein. Consistent with phase I trials, no significant adverse effects were reported including no evidence of ARIAs or meningoencephalitis that had been previously reported for Bapineuzumab and ended AN1792 trials (Siemers et al 2010).

The elevated Aβ concentration in CSF of treated Solanezumab group was reminiscent to AD mouse studies that led to the reversal of cognitive and memory impairments. These encouraging results prompted two large scale double blinded phase III trials, EXPEDITION 1 and EXPEDITION 2 (Doody et al 2014). The paradigm consisted of monthly injections in over 1000 mild-to-moderate AD patients with primary outcomes measured from baseline to 18 months. Analysis included cognitive function, quality of daily activity, morphological measurements and biomarkers. Consistent with mouse models of AD, Solanezumab did not alter the amyloid burden in either trial in the small subset of subjects in which amyloid imaging was assessed, plausibly due to the preferential binding to soluble Aβ and lack of direct binding to fibrillar Aβ plaques. Both clinical trials EXPEDITION 1 and EXPEDITION 2 showed no significant differences in whole brain volumes or hippocampal volumes, as measured by MRI. Measurement of cognitive performance at end point for EXPEDITION I trial revealed no beneficial effects on the progression of dementia in mild-to-moderate AD patients treated with Solanezumab. Conversely, though, a pre-specified analysis in EXPEDITION 1 revealed a significant reduction in cognitive decline in a subgroup of patients with mild AD. These findings led to a revised analysis for EXPENDITION 2 where patients with mild AD were considered the primary-analysis population. These analyses revealed significant cognitive and functional benefits in some assessments in patients with mild AD.

Biomarkers analyses revealed a significant increase in both plasma and CSF Aβ levels at four months following the administration of Solanzumab that was sustainable to the endpoint. The increased CSF Aβ concentrations in treated Solanezumab group suggested the dynamic of Aβ transport were altered favoring the efflux of Aβ from the brain potentially decreasing soluble Aβ toxicity. No other biomarkers demonstrated any significant changes including tau. As in phase II trials, no evidence of ARIAs or meningoencephalitis was reported.

Although both EXPEDITION 1 and EXPEDITION 2 did not meet the overall endpoint for beneficial effects on cognitive decline in mild-to-moderate AD, the encouraging findings that Solanezumab moderately slowed cognitive decline in mild AD patients has propelled three ongoing trials. A phase III trial in mild AD (EXPEDITION 3), a secondary prevention trial in asymptomatic individuals with cerebral amyloidosis (A4), and inclusion in an adaptive trial of secondary prevention in the dominantly inherited Alzheimer network trial.

Ponezumab a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the C terminus of Aβ40 was designed specifically to bind to soluble and aggregated Aβ but without effector function. Ponezumab was uniquely engineered to eliminate binding to Fcγ receptors and complement component 1 minimizing an immune mediate clearance of Aβ (Table 1) (La Porte et al 2012). Studies in AD brains and mouse models of AD, demonstrated Ponezumab binds both soluble and fibrillar Aβ. Passive immunizations lead to an increased plasma Aβ levels and a decreased brain amyloid load. Following these encouraging studies in mice, a phase I clinical trials was initiated. Reportedly, Ponezumab increased plasma and CSF Aβ40 levels in a dose dependent fashion with minimal adverse effects (Burstein et al 2013; Landen et al 2013). Similarly, a phase II trial demonstrated increased plasma Aβ40 levels with good tolerance. However, little to no improvement of cognitive impairment was observed at end point and Ponezumab is not currently being tested in AD though it is being tested in cerebral amyloid angiopathy where Aβ40 is the most abundant Aβ species deposited. (Clinical Trials.gov Identifiers: NCT00945672, NCT00722046, NCT01821118)

Unlike other passive immunotherapies targeting Aβ that are humanized versions of murine monoclonal antibodies, Gantenerumab, is the first fully humanized IgG1 antibody (Table 1). Gantenerumab displays specific affinity for both the N terminus and central portions of fibrillar Aβ with no affinity for monomeric Aβ (Novakovic et al 2013). Studies in AD mouse models, Gantenerumab decreased amyloid pathology without altering plasma or CSF Aβ levels. Ex-vivo assays suggested Gantenerumab induced phagocytosis of amyloid plaques mediated by microglia (Bohrmann et al 2012). Subsequently, a phase I clinical trial for Gantenermuab reported a dose dependent reduction in amyloid burden as measured by amyloid imaging by PET scan with PiB in mild-to-moderate AD patients (Ostrowitzki et al 2012). However, higher dosages of Gantenerumab were associated with microhemorrages that were observed more frequently in APOEε4 carriers, similar to that seen with high dosages of Bapineuzumab (Novakovic et al 2013).

A more recent phase II adaptive trial involving dominantly inherited AD patients has been initiated to test tolerability, biomarkers, and amyloid burden assessing Gantenerumab and Solanezumab as well as potentially a third agent in the near future (Clinical Trials.gov Identifiers: NCT01760005). In addition, a phase III trial expanding over a two year period to determine the efficacy of Gantenerumab to prevent the progression of symptoms in prodromal AD patients has also been initiated (Clinical Trials.gov Identifiers: NCT0122416).

A major concern for certain anti-Aβ antibodies, particularly those that bind to aggregated Aβ and have the ability to activate FcRγ receptors is inflammation leading to BBB breakdown leading to ARIAs that include cerebral microhemorrhages. New strategies have recently been developed to potentially reduce these adverse effects. Crenezumab is a fully humanized IgG4 anti-Aβ antibody that displays a low affinity for Fcγ receptors reducing an inflammatory response (Table 1). Crenezumab binds to multiple forms of Aβ including monomeric, fibrillar and soluble oligomers (Adolfsson et al 2012). In a phase I trial conducted with mild-to-moderate AD patients, there was a dose dependent elevation of plasma Aβ levels following a single and multi-dosing paradigm (Adolfsson et al 2012). No patient developed ARIAs including a large subpopulation of APOEε4 carriers, as these patients were previously shown to be at higher risk. Two phase II trials have since been initiated BLAZE (Clinical Trials.gov Identifiers: NCT01397578) and ABBY (Clinical Trials.gov Identifiers: NCT01343966) to evaluate Crenezumab efficacy on delaying cognitive and functional decline in mild-to-moderate AD patients. Preliminary reports of these trials reported at the International Alzheimer’s Disease Conference in Copenhagen Denmark in July of 2014 revealed some slowing of cognitive decline in subjects with mild AD, similar to that reported for Solanezumab.

Future Directions

Despite the overwhelming evidence for immunotherapies targeting Aβ to prevent amyloid accumulation and reduce Aβ toxicity, immunotherapy has presented a low efficacy for preventing cognitive decline in mild to moderate dementia due to AD. There are, however, several potential explanations for the results to date. The dissociation between plaque clearance and the continued progression toward severe dementia, suggests plaque removal is not sufficient to halt the neurodegenerative process once a person reaches the stage of moderate dementia due to AD. Perhaps, amyloid plaques containing fibrillar insoluble Aβ initiates the neurodegenerative process of AD, however, the non-fibrillar, oligomeric forms of Aβ mediate disease progression. Previous studies have demonstrated dissociations between Aβ plaque density and severity of dementia. Further, studies have illustrated soluble oligomeric Aβ species blocked LTP and impaired memory, independently of fibrillar Aβ (Lesne et al 2006; Shankar et al 2008; Walsh et al 2002). In accordance with these observations, elimination or sequestering soluble Aβ species may therefore increase the efficacy of immunotherapies in AD.

Alternatively, immunization of individuals with mild-to-moderate AD may have been too late to halt the progression of the disease. AD biomarker studies clearly demonstrate that the neuropathology of AD, particularly the Aβ deposition phase of AD, begins about 15–20 years prior to the onset of the clinical symptoms (Bateman et al 2012; Holtzman et al 2011; Villemagne et al 2013). Longitudinal studies on autosomal dominant familial AD revealed Aβ42 levels in CSF, indicative of amyloid plaques, begin to decline 25 years prior to the manifestation of symptoms. The decline in CSF Aβ42 levels are an indicator of amyloid accumulation in the brain. Aβ deposition was visible ~15 years prior to onset of symptoms as measured by PiB-PET imaging. These studies demonstrate that the neurodegenerative process of dementia is initiated decades prior to visible clinical symptoms. Treatment of mild-to-moderate AD may have surpassed the therapeutic potential of Aβ immunotherapy, which highlights the importance for earlier intervention.

Attempts to begin treatment at earlier stages prior to the irreversible degenerative process have been initiated in three new trials. The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer’s Network (DIAN) is currently evaluating Solanezumab and Gantenerumab in asymptomatic patients identified to be carriers of autosomal dominant genetic mutations for AD. Patients are being assessed for amyloid plaque burden, CSF biomarkers, and efficacy on preventing cognitive decline.

The Alzheimer’s Prevention Initiative (API) is a randomized trial involving a large group of families that are known carriers of a fully penetrant autosomal dominant mutation in the gene encoding presenilin-1. These individuals are treated with Crenezumab for five years and will be evaluated for amyloid burden and CSF biomarkers as well as cognitive decline.

Unlike DIAN and API, Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic AD (A4 trial) is beginning to assess individuals 65 to 85 years of age within the general population that are non-carriers of AD gene mutations. Selection is based on the presence of amyloid burden as measured by PET scan. Participants are required to have no obvious cognitive decline at time of enrollment. Patients will be treated with Solanezumab vs. placebo to determine if there is a delay in onset of cognitive decline as well as being assessed for a variety of biomarkers.

Frontotemporal Lobar Dementia and Tau

Frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD) is the second most common form of dementia occurring before the age of 65, yet immunotherapies in clinical trials to battle cognitive decline in FTLD have lagged somewhat to the focus on Aβ. There are different underlying pathologies that account for FTLD. FTLD-tau is characterized by tau positive inclusions often referred to as Pick-bodies. Examples of FTLD-tau include Pick’s disease, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy. While FTLD and AD are both neurodegenerative disease that display a progressive decline in cognition, FTLD differs by the absence of Aβ pathology. FTLD clinically defines a wide spectrum of syndromes resulting from degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes that are genetically heterogeneous (D’Alton &amp; Lewis 2014). There are a number of subcategories of FTLD that are defined by their dominant clinical symptom in addition to gene mutations that have been discovered, reviewed in (Bennion Callister &amp; Pickering-Brown 2014).

The first genetic linkage in families with autosomal dominant FTLD was reported to be localized to chromosome 17q21.11, now referred to as FTDP-17 (Baker et al 1997; Froelich et al 1997; Wilhelmsen et al 1994). Histopathological studies of FTDP-17 revealed inclusions that stained positive for the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) (Murrell et al 1997). The findings that tau gene (MAPT) lies within the chromosome 17q21.11 in combination with histopathological studies of FTDP-17 brains that revealed inclusions positive for the microtubule-associated protein tau lead to the first novel missense and splice-site mutations in MAPT associated with FTD (D’Souza et al 1999; Hutton et al 1998; Spillantini et al 1998). To date, over 40 different MAPT mutations have been reported that are either missense, deletions or mutations that affect alternative splicing of MAPT transcript that ultimately lead to the accumulation of tau aggregates.

Tau was initially identified as a microtubule-associated protein that subsequently was found to be the main component of neurofibrillary tangles in several neurodegenerative diseases, referred to as tauopathies (Joachim et al 1987; Lee et al 2001; Weingarten et al 1975; Witman et al 1976). It is a natively unfolded protein composed of four major regions including an N-terminal projection region, proline-rich domain, microtubule-binding domain (MBD), and a C-terminal region. Tau is expressed from a single gene that is alternatively spliced yielding six major tau isoforms in the CNS. Each isoform is identified by the number of microtubule binding repeats together with the N terminal exons. Under non-pathological conditions, half of the tau isoforms contain three repeats of the MBD (3R-tau) and half contain four MBD (4R-tau) controlled by alternative splicing of exon 10. Mutations that affect alternative splicing yielding an increase in 4R- over 3R-tau promote the formation of 4R-tau inclusions. Missense or splice site mutations within exon 10 display tau aggregates in both neuronal and glial cells, whereas mutations outside of exon 10 restrict tau aggregates to neurons (Zempel &amp; Mandelkow 2014).

Within the CNS, tau is predominately expressed in neurons and maintained at higher concentrations within axons to promote microtubule assembly and stability (Trojanowski et al 1989). The regulation of tau binding to microtubules is mediated by the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues at sites immediately adjacent to and within the MBD (Lee et al 2001). Phosphorylation within or around the MBD alters the conformation of the MBD decreasing its affinity for microtubule binding and liberates tau (Zempel &amp; Mandelkow 2014). The accumulation of liberated hyperphosphorylated tau in combination with its intrinsically disordered properties can foster the formation of insoluble paired helical filaments resulting in tau inclusions.

The formation of tau inclusions was once thought to be cell-autonomous, with the formation of filamentous tau inclusions within a single cell being independent of neighboring cells. However, several studies have now demonstrated the phenomenon of “spreading” tau pathology in a non-cell autonomous fashion that progress between cells through the brain in a well-defined pattern, depending on the specific disease in which it occurs. Neuropathological studies of postmortem demented patients provided the first evidence for a stereotypical spatial and temporal spreading of neurofibrillary tau accumulation in Alzheimer’s disease (Braak &amp; Braak 1991). Amongst the first neurons to develop neurofibrillary inclusions during normal aging are within the transentorhinal region (Braak stages I–II). These neurons give rise to the perforant pathway, the major projections to the hippocampus where tau pathology gradually advances (Braak III–IV) and finally spreads into the neocortex (Braak V–VI) during the process of AD.

The hierarchical pattern of neurofibrillary tau accumulation in AD as well as in other human tauopathies encompassing FTLD-tauopathies is consistent with transmission of tau fibrils in mouse models of tauopathy. Injection of brain extracts from diseased mutant P301S tau transgenic mice into the cortex or hippocampus of mice expressing human wild type tau induced the formation of wild type tau fibrils that spread to distant neurons (Clavaguera et al 2009). Similarly, injection of tau oligomers isolated from AD brain demonstrated propagation of tau pathology in wild type mice (Lasagna-Reeves et al 2012). More recently, injection of preformed synthetic tau fibrils into the hippocampus or striatum of P301S tau transgenic mice induced neurofibrillary inclusions that propagated from the injected site to connected brain regions in a time-dependent manner (Iba et al 2013). Furthermore, cell culture studies have illustrated that exogenous fibrillar tau is taken up into cells and seeds the aggregation of endogenous soluble tau (Frost et al 2009; Guo &amp; Lee 2011). A recent study shows that tau conformations, like prions, can propagate in vitro, and have other features like prions such as having distinct strain-like features (Sanders et al 2014). These studies suggest that the propagation of tau fibrils is mediate by a non-cell autonomous mechanism (Figure 2).

The route of spreading coincides with synaptic connections between the injection site and affected brain regions, suggesting a synaptic mechanism of tau spreading. Consistent with transynaptic spreading, selective expression of human tau within the entorhinal cortex leads to tau pathology at the axonal terminals within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (de Calignon et al 2012; Liu et al 2012). Furthermore, monomeric tau is normally released into the brain interstitial fluid (ISF) that is regulated by neuronal activity, yet diseased aged P301S mice display reduces levels of soluble tau in ISF (Yamada et al 2011; Yamada et al 2014). Therefore, these studies support that monomeric tau released extracellularly may be in equilibrium with extracellular tau aggregates which may be the species that propagate.

Tau Active and Passive immunization

Active immunization against tau has been reported in mouse models of tauopathies. In the earliest of studies, P301L transgenic mice were immunized with a 30 amino acid fragment (tau 379–408) containing two phosphorylation sites (Ser396, Ser404). The P301L tau mutation is responsible for FTLD in patients and expression of P301L-tau in mice recapitulates the many features of FTLD including tau inclusions and motor impairment (Lewis et al 2000). Immunization of young P301L mice effectively decreased tau pathology in multiple brain regions, altered the insoluble to soluble tau ratio, as well as improved motor dysfunction (Asuni et al 2007). However, measurements of cognition were not evaluated as it is difficult to discern between memory impairments and motor abnormalities. A follow up study using a double transgenic mouse strain expressing human tau isoforms together with M146L presenilin mutation that display spatial memory deficits prior to motor impairments were immunized. This study demonstrated that active immunization prevented cognitive impairment in addition to reconfirming a decreased in tau pathology (Boutajangout et al 2010). Furthermore, active immunization in aged P301L mice with pre-existing pathology reduced phosphorylated tau and NFT pathology (Bi et al 2011). In addition, passive immunization with antibodies that target tau phospho-epitopes serines 396 and 404 reduced tau pathology and improved motor function in P301L mice as well as in a second transgenic mouse expressing mutant P301S tau (Boutajangout et al 2011; Chai et al 2011). These improvements in behavior and pathology were also evident by passive immunization using antibody MC1 that recognizes early tau pathology (Chai et al 2011).

While these studies demonstrate immunization against tau effectively reduced tau pathogenesis, the mechanism that prevented tau spreading and tau species responsible for seeding remained unclear. Previous studies have illustrated that tau fibrils that penetrate into cells can induce misfolding of intracellular native tau i.e. “seeding”. A more recent passive immunization study illustrated that antibodies that were most effective at blocking tau seeding activity were most effective at decreasing tau pathology and improving cognition (Yanamandra et al 2013). Following a screen to identified anti-tau antibodies that selectively blocked tau seeding activity in a cellular biosensor assay, infusion of these antibodies into P301S tau transgenic mice dramatically reduced tau pathology. In addition, another recent passive immunization study illustrated that targeting oligomeric tau species effectively protected against tau-dependent pathogenesis in P301L transgenic mice (Castillo-Carranza et al 2014). Using a tau oligomer-specific monoclonal antibody that does not target monomeric tau, passive immunization decreased oligomeric tau species, reversed motor abnormalities, and decreased tau pathology. Therefore, these studies provide evidence that one target of anti-tau antibodies may be oligomeric tau species and that blocking certain forms of tau oligomers may block seeding and spreading of tau aggregates thereby suppressing tau pathology and improving behavior (Figure 2).

While there is great interest in moving tau immunotherapy into humans, the only immunotherapy trial currently reported on www.clinicaltrials.gov is NCT02031198 by Axon Neurosciences. This is a phase I study assessing the safety of an active immunization approach with AADvac1, a vaccine directed against pathologically modified Alzheimer tau protein.

Conclusion

With the uncertainty as to whether immunotherapeutic targeting Aβ will be useful in preventing cognitive decline in already symptomatic individuals with AD, much scientific focus has recently been on targeting tau, the other aggregate-prone protein in AD and FTLD as an alternative. Recent studies have illustrated that tau pathology within specific brain regions and tau levels in CSF (in AD) correlate well with cognitive decline and synapse loss in human disease, speculating tau pathogenesis may ultimately drive neurodegeneration. Moreover, tau pathology occurs in over 20 distinct neurodegenerative diseases in conjunction with recent evidence that extracellular tau species may lead to trans-cellular propagation of tau pathology. Thus, newly emerging data further warrants exploration of the potential beneficial effects of immunotherapeuties targeting tau.

Figure 1 Schematic of potential mechanisms for antibody-mediate clearance of amyloid-β. Antibodies within the CNS potentially clear amyloid deposits in a microglia-dependent phagocytosis mechanism “CNS hypothesis”. Local clearance in the CNS may occur also appears to occur with non-Fcγ mediated mechanisms. Alternatively antibodies within the periphery sequester Aβ altering the dynamics of Aβ into the CNS lowering amyloid burden “peripheral sink hypothesis”. It is possible that more than one mechanism is important.
