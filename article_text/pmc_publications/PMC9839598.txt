A rare missense APOE variant (L28P; APOE*4Pittsburgh), which is present only in populations with European ancestry, has been reported to be a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD). However, due to the complete linkage disequilibrium of L28P with APOE*4 (C112R), its independent genetic association is uncertain. The original association study implicating L28P with LOAD risk was carried out in a relatively small sample size. In the current study, we have re-evaluated this association in a large case-control sample of 15,762 White U.S. subjects and investigated its independent effect in APOE 3/4 subjects, as L28P has been observed only in the heterozygous state of APOE*4 carriers and 3/4 is the most common genotype containing the APOE*4 allele. The heterozygous carrier frequency of L28P, all with APOE*4, was about 3-fold higher in AD cases than in cognitively intact controls (0.845% vs 0.277%). The age- and sex-adjusted meta-analysis odds ratio (OR) was 2.87 (95% CI: 1.34 – 6.13; p= 0.0066). Among APOE 3/4 subjects, age- and sex-adjusted meta-analysis OR was 1.53 (95% CI: 0.70 – 3.36; p= 0.28), indicating its effect was independent of APOE*4. The lack of statistical significance appears mainly due to the low power of 4,138 subjects with the 3/4 genotype (12% power at α= 0.05) compared to the required sample of 139,088 subjects with the 3/4 genotype to detect an OR of 1.5 at α= 0.05 and 80% power. Our data suggesting that L28P has an independent genetic effect on AD risk is reinforced by earlier experimental findings showing that this mutation leads to significant structural and conformational changes in the ApoE4 molecule and can induce functional defects associated with neuronal Aβ42 accumulation and oxidative stress. Additional functional studies in cell-based systems and animal models will help to delineate its functional significance in the etiology of AD.

pmcIntroduction

Human apolipoprotein E (ApoE, protein; APOE, gene) plays a pivotal role in cholesterol/lipid transport in the peripheral and central nervous systems [1]. The most common APOE polymorphism due to missense mutations at codons 112 and 158 results in three allelic forms, of which APOE*4 is associated with an increased risk and earlier age-at-onset (AAO) of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), while APOE*2 is associated with decreased risk and later AAO of AD as compared to the wild type APOE*3 [2–6]. Since the original discovery of the association between APOE*4 and AD, evidence that APOE alleles differentially influence amyloid and tau pathology, network dysfunction, and neuroinflammation has been identified [7, 8].

In 1999, two groups independently identified a novel and rare missense mutation in the APOE gene [9, 10] in which the leucine residue is replaced by proline at codon 28 (L28P; rs769452). This mutation occurs in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the APOE*4 allele, hence named APOE*4Pittsburgh and APOE*4Freiburg, and it was associated with an elevated risk for AD [9] and coronary artery disease [10]. Since then, this variant has been examined in additional AD case-control samples [11–13], although a consensus as to whether this mutation by itself increases the odds of developing AD is yet to be reached. The main drawbacks of aforementioned studies are the use of relatively limited samples, considering L28P is an ultra-rare variant and would require a very large sample size. The rarity of the L28P mutation, and its complete LD with the APOE*4 allele, makes it nearly impossible to separate its unique contribution from the overwhelming effect of the APOE*4 allele on the risk of developing AD. In the current study, we have re-evaluated this association in a large case-control sample of 15,762 U.S. White subjects and investigated its independent effect among subjects with the APOE 3/4 genotype, as L28P has been observed in the heterozygous state only on the APOE*4–containing chromosome and 3/4 is the most common genotype containing the APOE*4 allele.

Methods

Study Samples

To maximize the sample size for this rare variant study, we used data from 15,762 White AD cases and controls derived from three major cohorts: Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), The Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory (GEM) study, and a cohort comprising three studies at the University of Pittsburgh: the case-control cohort at the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) and two population-based cognitively normal cohorts, the Monongahela Valley Independent Elders Survey (MoVIES) and the Monongahela-Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (MYHAT). The demographic data on each study sample is presented in Table 1 and their detailed descriptions are given elsewhere [14–18].

Genotyping

Genotypes for the APOE/rs429358 (APOE*4) and APOE/rs7412 (APOE*2) SNPs in the Pittsburgh and GEM samples were determined using TaqMan genotyping assays followed by the determination of traditional six genotypes (2/2, 2/3, 2/4, 3/3, 3/4, 4/4) based on the three-allele APOE polymorphism [6]. The genotype identification of these variants in the ADSP sample were derived directly from the whole-exome sequencing (WES) data [19].

Statistical Analysis

Logistic regression was implemented for calculating odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) while using sex and age as covariates. The ORs were calculated individually for each of the three research studies followed by the meta-analysis. To determine the independent effect of APOE*4Pittsburgh L28P from APOE*4 on AD risk, we examined the distribution of L28P among subjects with the APOE 3/4 genotype, since as detailed above, it has been observed in the heterozygous state only on the APOE*4–containing chromosome and 3/4 is the most common APOE*4 genotype. All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.1 [20] using the R package epitools [21]; meta [22]; and metafor [23]. The power analysis for the current sample size and the required sample size for 80% power were calculated in G*Power 3.1 [24] following the formula in Demidenko [25].

Results and Discussion

We examined a total of 15,762 subjects from three studies (6,390 AD cases and 9,372 controls) for the L28P variant (Table 1). As expected, the frequency of APOE*4 carriers was higher in AD cases than in controls. Genotyping of L28P revealed two genotypes, TT and TC; no example of the rare allele homozygosity (CC) was observed. Table 2 shows the carrier frequency of the TC genotype along with the minor allele frequencies (MAF). Eighty subjects carried the L28P mutation, all with the APOE*4 allele. The L28P carrier frequency was significantly higher in AD cases than controls (0.845% vs 0.277%; P = 1.25E-06). The meta OR was 2.87 (95% CI: 1.34 – 6.13; P = 6.60E-03).

To distinguish the independent effect of L28P from APOE*4 on AD risk, we restricted the analysis among subjects with the APOE 3/4 genotype, as detailed above. Among the 4,834 AD cases and controls with APOE*4 carriers, 85.62% had the 3/4 genotype followed by 4/4 (8.05%) and 2/4 (6.33%) genotypes. Subjects with the APOE 2/4 and 4/4 genotypes were excluded in order to avoid the confounding protective effect of E2 and an extra copy of E4 on L28P. The age- and sex-adjusted meta-analysis OR of L28P among APOE 3/4 was 1.53 (95% CI: 0.70 – 3.36; p = 0.28; Figure 1). The lack of significance is mainly due to the low power of a sample size of 4,138 in the 3/4 genotype (12% power at α = 0.05); the calculated required sample size was 139,088 (Figure 2). Considering that about 25% of the European Whites carry the APOE*4 allele, the total required sample size to detect an OR of 1.5 at α = 0.05 and 80% power was 556,352 (139,088/0.25) European Whites.

Even with non-statistically significant p-value, the OR of 1.53 among 3/4 subjects suggests that the effect of L28P on AD risk is independent of APOE*4. This genetic observation is further supported by a comprehensive experimental study in which the L28P mutation was associated with significant structural and conformational changes in the wild type (WT) ApoE4 that resulted in intraneuronal Aβ42 accumulation and oxidative stress [26]. As compared to lipid-free WT ApoE4, lipid-free L28P induced the intracellular accumulation of Aβ42 in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells and mouse primary neurons. Furthermore, lipidated L28P significantly reduced the viability of SK-N-SH cells when compared to lipidated WT ApoE4, which was due to greater cellular oxidative stress induced by L28P than WT ApoE4 [26]. Regardless of its lipidation state, if L28P promotes the in vivo neuronal accumulation of Aβ42 followed by induction of increased oxidative stress and ensuing AD pathogenesis, this would represent a gain of function over the WT ApoE4, that itself does not induce the intracellular accumulation of Aβ42. WT ApoE4 is more susceptible to proteolysis than the other ApoE isoforms (E2 and E3) and ApoE4 fragments have been found in brains of AD patients [27]. In this regard, a specific ApoE4 fragment, ApoE4[Δ(166-299)], has previously been found to promote the cellular uptake of extracellular Aβ42 and resulted in increased oxidative stress [28], similar to the effect of L28P. Since the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ42 and the resulting persistent oxidative stress are considered early events in the pathogenesis of AD and the naturally occurring L28P mutation is associated with both these events as well as with AD risk, it will be important in future studies to examine the role of L28P in cell-based systems, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can successfully recapitulate the pathology of AD [29, 30] and/or animal models.

In summary, our genetic data among APOE 3/4 subjects suggest that L28P has an effect independent of APOE*4 on AD risk, which is reinforced by earlier experimental findings. Further confirmation of our genetic data in much larger APOE 3/4 subjects would help validate this independent association.

Highlights

A rare missense APOE (L28P) has been reported to be a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD).

However, due to the complete linkage disequilibrium of L28P with APOE*4, its independent genetic association is uncertain.

we have re-evaluated the L28P association in 15,762 White U.S. case-control subjects and in 4,139 APOE 3/4 subjects, since APOE 3/4 is the most common genotype containing the APOE*4 allele

Our data suggesting that L28P has an independent genetic effect on LOAD.
