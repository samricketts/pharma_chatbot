The defining evolutionary feature of eukaryotic cells is the emergence of membrane-bound organelles. Compartmentalization allows each organelle to maintain a spatially, physically, and chemically distinct environment, which greatly bolsters individual organelle function. However, the activities of each organelle must be balanced and are interdependent for cellular homeostasis. Therefore, properly regulated interactions between organelles, either physically or functionally, remain critical for overall cellular health and behavior. In particular, neuronal homeostasis depends heavily on the proper regulation of organelle function and crosstalk, and deficits in these functions are frequently associated with diseases. In this review, we examine the emerging role of organelle contacts in neurological diseases and discuss how disruption of contacts contributes to disease pathogenesis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and regulation of organelle contacts will broaden our knowledge of their role in health and disease, laying the groundwork for development of new therapies targeting interorganelle crosstalk and function.


pmcORGANELLE MEMBRANE CONTACT SITES (MCS)

Definition –

Membrane contact sites (MCS) are defined as regions of close apposition between two membrane-bound organelles which enable functional crosstalk and cooperation. MCS are distinct from incidental organelle association and from membrane fusion events, requiring tethers that specify and maintain contact distance (generally 10–30 nm), a defined macromolecular context that is distinct from either individual organelle in isolation, and one or more dedicated functions (Prinz, 2014; Scorrano et al., 2019).

History –

Early studies in cell biology focused mainly on the functions and dynamics of organelles individually. However, in the late 1950s, groundbreaking electron microscopy (EM) experiments in rat liver cells provided the first suggestion of direct, functional interorganelle coordination. Liver cell injuries caused by starvation, hepatectomy, or poisoning altered the association between ER and mitochondria, indicating a cell-type and condition-specific physiological relationship between distinct organelles (Bernhard and Rouiller, 1956). From these initial findings ultimately emerged a field of research on the interaction of organelles through membrane contact sites (Prinz, 2014). Attribution of emergent biochemical functions to MCS appeared as early as 1990 when a class of phospholipid synthesis enzymes on the ER was found in close association with the mitochondrial fraction (Vance, 1990). Since then, the identification of molecular tethers has demonstrated conclusively that MCS are both specific and regulated (Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2016). To date, MCS between ER-mitochondria (Iwasawa et al., 2011; Szabadkai et al., 2006b), ER-Golgi (Mesmin et al., 2013; Peretti et al., 2008), ER-endosome (Eden et al., 2010; Raiborg et al., 2015; Rocha et al., 2009), ER-peroxisome (Costello et al., 2017; Hua et al., 2017), ER-lipid droplet (LD) (Xu et al., 2012), ER-Plasma membrane (PM) (Chung et al., 2015; Giordano et al., 2013; Liou et al., 2007), mitochondria-lysosome (Aston et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Fermie et al., 2018; Han et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2020; Valm et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2018), mitochondria-PM (Lackner et al., 2013; Perkins et al., 2010), mitochondria-LD (Wang et al., 2011) and lysosome-peroxisome (Chu et al., 2015) have been characterized (Figure 1).

Experimental Approaches –

A variety of experimental methods exist to identify membrane contacts, characterize their dynamics, and probe their functions (Huang et al., 2020). The first membrane contact sites were identified by EM, but now the most commonly-employed approach features confocal microscopy using organelle-specific fluorescence markers (Valm et al., 2017), which is less technically challenging and can be performed in live cells. However, confocal microscopy is limited in resolution to about 250 nm (Scorrano et al., 2019). The development of super-resolution microscopy has improved on this limitation, but other experimental methods must be included for clear confirmation and functional analysis of MCS.

MCS can be validated with a number of proximity-based assays, in which the activation of a bipartite reporter requires close association between two membranes. For example, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) approaches such as split-GFP (Kakimoto et al., 2018) or split Venus (Shai et al., 2018) feature the reconstitution of a fluorophore from an interaction between constructs on apposed membranes. Similarly, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is often employed to study MCS (Csordas et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2018) because the efficiency of FRET decreases with the sixth power of the distance between the donor and acceptor pair. While BiFC and FRET allow for live-cell, microscopy-based visualization of MCS, overexpression of constructs may sometimes introduce artifacts. In proximity ligation assays (PLA), endogenous proteins are probed instead, using antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates. At membrane contact sites, distinct target proteins are close enough that their respective antibody probes can form a platform for the generation of a reporter transcript (Benhammouda et al., 2021).

Recently, several assays have used reconstitution of a biotin ligase such as split APEX2 (Ozkan et al., 2021) or split BioID / TurboID (Cho et al., 2020; Kwak et al., 2020) to visualize and map the proteomes of membrane contact sites. These methods have identified membrane-bound proteins specifically enriched at target sites and have indicated potential new tether proteins.

Membrane contacts can also be studied in vitro. Early in the study of membrane contact sites, traditional fractionation methods were adapted to enrich membranes involved in MCS (Vance, 1990). More recently, methods have emerged to isolate intact organelles, such as by immunopurification (Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017) or nanoparticle-based magnetic separation (Le et al., 2022). In vitro reconstitution of interactions between isolated organelles may help to elucidate key regulators and functions of MCS without the confounder of compensatory homeostatic pathways.

Since each method has distinct advantages and limitations, studies of MCS are most compelling when they feature a combined approach using several complementary imaging and biochemical techniques.

Constituents and functions –

All membrane contact sites feature tethers which help maintain the association. Tethers can be either proteins or lipids such as ceramides and sterols (Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2016; Garofalo et al., 2016), and tethering is often accomplished by a collection of interactions rather than one dedicated pair of molecules (Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2016). Not all MCS tethers have been defined. Moreover, non-tethering proteins which do not physically bridge membranes may also be present at contact sites (Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2016). These non-tether proteins frequently participate in the key functions of the MCS.

The most well-known function of MCS is the bidirectional transport of metabolites and ions. For instance, Ca2+ transfer and lipid metabolism are important functions of ER contacts with other organelles (Burgoyne et al., 2015; Lahiri et al., 2015). Furthermore, MCS also play roles in signal transduction (Bui et al., 2010; Eden et al., 2010; Levine and Patel, 2016) and in the regulation of organelle dynamics, including fission (Friedman et al., 2011; Rowland et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2018), trafficking (Raiborg et al., 2015; Rowland et al., 2014), and autophagosome formation (Hamasaki et al., 2013).

It is becoming increasingly clear that MCS play a pivotal role in the bidirectional regulation of organelle function and dynamics, which further contribute to multiple cellular homeostatic functions (Prinz, 2014). Consequently, defective MCS may result in organelle dysfunction and impaired cellular homeostasis. Increasingly, studies on MCS have shed new light on various diseases that have been traditionally studied from a single-organelle perspective (Allison et al., 2017; Chu et al., 2015; Cioni et al., 2019; Hoglinger et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2019). Understanding the key functions and pathways of disease-associated MCS will bring additional insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of multiple human diseases.

Here, we review the current knowledge of diverse interorganelle MCS with an emphasis on their function and molecular constituents, including tethers and regulatory proteins. In particular, we focus on the role of MCS in neurological diseases which affect the brain and nervous system, including diseases caused by the degeneration of neurons in patients.

MITOCHONDRIA-LYSOSOME CONTACT SITES

Both mitochondria and lysosomes are multifunctional organelles that have dysfunctions closely connected to numerous human diseases (Burte et al., 2015; Mc Donald and Krainc, 2017). Mitochondria are necessary for cellular respiration and ATP synthesis, and they are also important storage sites for ions, lipids, and other metabolites. They play vital roles in apoptosis, inflammation, and aging (Friedman and Nunnari, 2014). Similarly, lysosomes act as storage sites for ions such as calcium and iron. They have also been found to be enriched for nucleosides (Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017), including ATP (Zhang et al., 2007). Most prominently, lysosomes have a critical role in degrading cellular contents such as proteins and lipids (Ballabio and Bonifacino, 2020). Exploration of the contacts between mitochondria and lysosomes is still in an early stage. Using advanced 2D and 3D imaging techniques, multiple studies demonstrated MCS between mitochondria and lysosomes in various cell types under healthy conditions (Aston et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Fermie et al., 2018; Han et al., 2017; Valm et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2018). Importantly, the formation of mitochondria-lysosome contacts is independent from autophagosome biogenesis or mitophagy, as contact sites are not marked by autophagosome markers such as ULK1, Atg5, or LC3 (Wong et al., 2018). Moreover, simultaneous knockout of five proteins that mediate autophagy (NDP52, OPTN, NBR1, TAX1BP1, and p62) did not affect mitochondria-lysosome contact formation (Chen et al., 2018).

Mitochondria-lysosome contacts are regulated by multiple proteins on the mitochondrial and lysosomal membranes. In its active GTP-bound and lysosome-localized state, Rab7 mediates the tethering between mitochondria and lysosomes (Wong et al., 2018). Rab7 GTP hydrolysis is stimulated by Rab GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins) such as TBC1D15, resulting in an inactive, cytosolic GDP-bound form of Rab7 (Zhen and Stenmark, 2015). Interestingly, TBC1D15 is recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane by the mitochondrial transmembrane fission protein FIS1 (Onoue et al., 2013), and TBC1D15-mediated Rab7 GTP hydrolysis was found to promote untethering of mitochondria-lysosome contacts (Wong et al., 2018). It is conceivable that Rab7 GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) such as Mon1-Ccz1(Nordmann et al., 2010), which promote GTP-loading and lysosomal recruitment of Rab7, may also regulate contact formation between mitochondria and lysosomes.

Recent studies have suggested that mitochondria-lysosome contact sites may regulate organelle dynamics and metabolite transfer, a function observed at other types of MCS. Rab7 interacts with effector proteins such as RILP and FYCO to recruit dynein and kinesin, motor proteins required for lysosomal fusion and bidirectional transport (Jordens et al., 2001; Pankiv et al., 2010). Mitochondrial dynamics also depend on MCS with lysosomes, which affect the rate of mitochondrial fission in a manner dependent on FIS1, TBC1D15, and Rab7 (Wong et al., 2018). Beyond organelle dynamics, mitochondria-lysosome contacts were recently found to be sites of direct Ca2+ transfer from lysosomes to mitochondria (Peng et al., 2020). Although the ER is the primary site for cellular calcium storage, both mitochondria and lysosomes contain additional stores of calcium and are essential for the regulation of Ca2+ dynamics (Todkar et al., 2017). Thus, the transfer of Ca2+ from lysosomes to mitochondria may collaboratively regulate calcium homeostasis. In addition to calcium, mitochondria-lysosome contacts may be sites of cholesterol transfer. Niemann-Pick type C protein 1 (NPC1) is a regulator of cholesterol transport between ER and lysosomes. Depletion of NPC1 disrupted ER-lysosome contacts but notably expanded mitochondria-lysosome contacts in a manner dependent on the sterol transporter STARD3 (Hoglinger et al., 2019). This suggests a potential compensatory role for mitochondria-lysosome contacts, serving to offload lysosomal cholesterol when lysosome-ER contacts are disrupted. Interestingly, yeast show increased contacts between mitochondria and the vacuole (a functional relative of the lysosome) upon disruption of mitochondria-ER contacts (Elbaz-Alon et al., 2014; Honscher et al., 2014), although it is unclear whether this mode of compensation is functionally connected to metabolite or lipid transfer. Finally, mitochondria-lysosome contacts play a role in the regulation of protein synthesis in neurons. RNA-binding proteins, in association with Rab7-positive late endosomes and mitochondria, serve as a platform for local protein synthesis. Mutations in Rab7 disrupted local translation, endosomal trafficking, and mitochondrial and axonal integrity (Cioni et al., 2019).

Taken together, studies on the structure and function of mitochondria-lysosome contact sites reveal a clear role in cellular homeostasis, including in neurons. This raises the question of the importance of mitochondria-lysosome contacts to the development and progression of neurological disease. Indeed, several proteins associated with contact sites have been implicated in the pathology of Parkinson’s disease (PD), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), and other neurological disorders.

Parkinson’s Disease (PD)

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a clinically heterogeneous movement disorder with multifactorial etiology that includes both environmental and genetic factors (Klein and Westenberger, 2012; Sulzer and Surmeier, 2013a). Multiple genes have been linked to familial forms of PD, altogether presenting a salient functional association with lysosomal and/or mitochondrial pathways. For example, the GBA1 gene, whose mutations are the greatest genetic risk factor for PD, encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (Gcase), while the kinase LRKK2 regulates several Rab GTPases crucial for lysosomal maintenance (Eguchi et al., 2018). Meanwhile, PINK1 and Parkin are key activators of mitophagy, the failure of which is directly related to PD pathogenesis (Pickrell and Youle, 2015). Beyond the dysfunction of mitochondria and lysosomes, protein accumulation, synaptic and axonal dysfunction, and ER stress also have been linked to PD at the cellular level (Nguyen et al., 2019).

Mitochondrial dysfunction and lysosomal dysfunction in PD have traditionally been studied separately or in the context of mitochondrial clearance (Nguyen et al., 2019; Spinosa et al., 2008; Timmerman et al., 2014), but direct interaction of the organelles was also recently found play an important role in PD. In PD patient-derived neurons harboring mutant GBA1, the average duration of mitochondria-lysosome contacts was significantly longer than in isogenic control neurons (Kim et al., 2021). Reduced GCase activity in those neurons reduced the level of the Rab7-GAP TBC1D15, contributing to the deficiency in mitochondria-lysosome contact untethering. Notably, this dysregulated untethering decreased the distribution of mitochondria to axons and synaptic terminals, leading to decreased ATP production in PD neurons. Increasing GCase activity or expressing TBC1D15 in PD neurons was sufficient to rescue abnormal mitochondria-lysosome untethering and improve the pathogenic phenotypes (Kim et al., 2021). More research is needed to advance our understanding of the mechanistic role of mitochondria-lysosome contacts in PD pathogenesis and to determine whether therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondria-lysosome contacts might be effective in the treatment of PD.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) encompasses a group of heritable neurological disorders that mainly affect the peripheral nervous system. In particular, CMT Type 2 is an autosomal dominant form of the disease characterized by axonal degeneration (Harel and Lupski, 2014). To date, mutations in approximately 80 genes have been identified as causes of different types of CMT neuropathy (Timmerman et al., 2014). Many of those genes encode proteins involved in lysosomal degradation or mitochondrial dynamics. Mitochondria-lysosome contacts have also been implicated in multiple types of CMT. Rab7 GTPase, one of the key modulators of mitochondria-lysosome contacts (Wong et al., 2018), is causal for CMT Type 2B (Spinosa et al., 2008). Indeed, CMT Type 2B-linked mutations in Rab7, which disrupt efficient Rab7 GTP hydrolysis, impair mitochondrial and lysosomal trafficking in axons (Cioni et al., 2019) and also abnormally prolong mitochondria-lysosome contact tethering (Wong et al., 2019). CMT Type 2C-associated missense mutations in the TRPV4 gene impair the untethering of homotypic mitochondrial contacts, an event which was found in turn to be regulated by mitochondria-lysosome contacts (Wong et al., 2019). Lastly, the outer mitochondrial membrane protein GDAP1, whose mutations cause CMT Type 2K, interacts with the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1, and depletion of GDAP1 reduces mitochondria-lysosome contacts (Cantarero et al., 2021). It is possible that mutations associated with other forms of CMT Type 2 may impair mitochondria-lysosome contact formation. Exploring whether these mutations converge on MCS will enhance our understanding of both mitochondria-lysosome contacts and the molecular pathogenesis of CMT.

Other neurological disorders

TRPML1 is a lysosomal channel protein that mediates Ca2+ release. At mitochondria-lysosome contact sites, the activities of TRPML1 and mitochondrial VDAC1 are coordinated to transfer Ca2+ into mitochondria (Peng et al., 2020). Although TRPML1 has been investigated mainly in association with lysosomal function, mutations in TRPML1 have also been shown to cause mitochondrial defects (Jennings et al., 2006). Clinically, loss-of-function mutations in TRPML1 are associated with Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by psychomotor retardation and visual impairment (Sun et al., 2000). In addition to various mitochondrial and lysosomal phenotypes, abnormal mitochondria-lysosome contact dynamics were observed in MLIV patient fibroblasts (Peng et al., 2020).

Niemann Pick Disease Type C (NPC) is another neurological disease that has been associated with mitochondria-lysosome contacts. NPC is caused by mutations in the genes NPC1 or NPC2 and features the pathological accumulation of cholesterol and lipids across several organs, including the brain (Carstea et al., 1997). In NPC1-deficient cells, ER-lysosome contacts were reduced while mitochondria-lysosome contacts were significantly increased (Hoglinger et al., 2019). This raises the possibility that increased mitochondrial cholesterol observed in NPC patients may potentially be a consequence of increased mitochondria-lysosome MCS.

ER-MITOCHONDRIA CONTACT SITES

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) consists of an extensive network of tubules and sheets, including the outer nuclear envelope. It is the largest cellular compartment in the majority of cells. Distinct ER domains participate in protein modification and transport, lipid synthesis, and Ca2+ storage (Schwarz and Blower, 2016). Direct interactions between ER and mitochondria through MCS (ERMCS) are among the earliest identified interorganelle contacts (Copeland and Dalton, 1959). Since the 1950s, extensive studies have revealed functional roles of ERMCS in diverse cellular processes encompassing Ca2+ homeostasis (Giacomello et al., 2010), lipid synthesis and transfer (Petrungaro and Kornmann, 2019), regulation of mitochondrial fission (Friedman et al., 2011), autophagic regulation (Hamasaki et al., 2013), unfolded protein response (UPR) (Bravo et al., 2011) and apoptosis (Chami et al., 2008) in multiple cell types. For instance, ERMCS have been found in cell bodies, neurites, and synaptic regions in neurons (Wu et al., 2017), and they contribute to neuronal homeostasis, plasticity, and synaptic transmission (Fowler et al., 2019). Additionally, the function of ERMCS-mediated Ca2+ signaling in the maintenance of neural stem cells was found in Drosophila, where ERMCS were regulated by Polo kinase signaling (Lee et al., 2016). In astrocytes, ERMCS are enriched in astrocyte endfeet regions and enhance vascular remodeling under injury (Gbel et al., 2020). Furthermore, astroglial ERMCS-mediated calcium transfer from the ER to mitochondria mediates synaptic integration in mouse hippocampal circuits (Serrat et al., 2021). In line with this multifarious functionality, ER-mitochondria contacts are associated with several diseases (Paillusson et al., 2016).

To date, a large cohort of molecular tethers between the ER and mitochondria have been identified in mammalian cells, including Mitofusin2 (Mfn2) (de Brito and Scorrano, 2008), Vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAPB) – protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein-51 (PTPIP51), Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1) – Glucose-regulated protein 75 (Grp75) – Deglycase (DJ-1) – Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) (Liu et al., 2019; Szabadkai et al., 2006a), B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (Bap31) – mitochondrial fission protein (Fis1) (Chandra et al., 2004; Iwasawa et al., 2011), and VPS13A (Kumar et al., 2018). PDZ domain containing 8 (PDZD8) has also been implicated in mitochondria-ER contacts (Hirabayashi et al., 2017), although it has also been suggested that PDZD8-dependent association of ER and mitochondria is secondary to direct ER-lysosome contacts mediated by the interaction of PDZD8 with Rab7 (Elbaz-Alon et al., 2020; Guillen-Samander et al., 2019). Mass-spectrometry proteomic approaches have also identified several novel candidates which may contribute to ER-mitochondria tethering (Cho et al., 2020; Kwak et al., 2020).

Owing to the multifunctionality of tethers and regulatory proteins, and because various ERMCS-mediated cellular processes are essential for neuronal survival, dysfunction of ERMCS has been associated with multiple neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD).

Alzheimer’s disease (AD)

Amongst the various neurodegenerative diseases, ERMCS were the first and most extensively studied in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The key hallmark of AD is the formation of plaques composed of tau and amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). Tau is found in an insoluble hyperphosphorylated form in the somatodendritic compartment of AD neurons. Overexpression of caspase 3-cleaved tau in HeLa cells enhances ER-mitochondria association, which may be a compensatory response to disrupted Ca2+ homeostasis in AD (Cieri et al., 2018). Increased ERMCS was also found in mouse motor neurons expressing human tau with P301L mutation (Perreault et al., 2009). Another component of AD plaques, amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), is a product of sequential enzymatic reactions that cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is found at ERMCS alongside β-secretase (Del Prete et al., 2017), and recent evidence showed enhanced ERMCS in AD patient fibroblasts harboring APP mutation (Area-Gomez et al., 2012). Interestingly, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), accumulation of the C99 fragment of APP at the ER membrane elevated cholesterol content and induced the formation of excessive ERMCS (Montesinos et al., 2020). In mouse models expressing mutant APP and in postmortem AD brains, protein levels of ERMCS-associated proteins such as PACS2 or sigma-1R were elevated (Hedskog et al., 2013). Correspondingly, acute Aβ exposure was found to increase ERMCS. This Aβ exposure also produced downstream defects in Ca2+ homeostasis in primary hippocampal neurons, while PACS2 knockdown was found to promote hippocampal neurodegeneration (Hedskog et al., 2013), underscoring a delicate balance in ERMCS function which is disrupted by AD-associated mutations in APP. Similar to mutation of APP, knockout of the AD-associated presenilin 1 (PS1) and/or presenilin 2 (PS2) increased ERMCS in MEFs, concomitantly increasing the synthesis of cholesteryl ester and phospholipids (Area-Gomez et al., 2012). Finally, astrocyte-conditioned media containing Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), the most prevalent genetic risk factor of AD, was found to upregulate phospholipids and cholesteryl synthesis, although the role of ApoE4 in ERMCS is still unclear (Tambini et al., 2016). Because dysfunction in ERMCS precedes neurodegeneration, continued study of ERMCS may yield more insight into the progression and treatment of AD.

Parkinson’s disease (PD)

Lewy bodies are a major pathological hallmark of PD. They are characterized by the accumulation of toxic constituents, of which α-synuclein is the most abundant. Interestingly, PD-associated mutations in α-synuclein were shown to decrease ERMCS in two independent studies (Guardia-Laguarta et al., 2014; Paillusson et al., 2017). It is possible that α-synuclein disrupts the VAPB-PTPIP51 interaction that bridges the ER and mitochondrial membrane, and it appears this effect is enhanced by PD-associated mutations (Paillusson et al., 2017). Like α-synuclein, mutations in DJ-1 associated with early-onset PD have been linked to disruption of ERMCS (Liu et al., 2019; Ottolini et al., 2013). DJ-1 was reported to colocalize and physically associate with a tethering complex containing IP3R3, Grp75, and VDAC1. Knockout of DJ-1 destabilized this complex (Liu et al., 2019; Ottolini et al., 2013), reducing ER-mitochondria contact and decreasing Ca2+ transfer from the ER to mitochondria (Liu et al., 2019; Ottolini et al., 2013). Outside of basal conditions, ERMCS have also been found to be upregulated during the process of mitophagy. Upon import stress, PINK1 mislocalizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it recruits and activates Parkin (Narendra et al., 2010). During this process, PINK1 becomes enriched at ERMCS, first promoting the formation of autophagosomes and later stimulating the dissolution of ERMCS through PINK1/Parkin-mediated phosphoubiquitination of MFN2 (Gelmetti et al., 2017; McLelland et al., 2018), another tether of ERMCS. As with DJ-1, calcium homeostasis through ERMCS was found to be regulated by Parkin/PINK (Cali et al., 2013; Gautier et al., 2016). Finally, PD-associated mutations in Miro1/RHOT1 were found to reduce ERMCS in PD patient fibroblasts (Berenguer-Escuder et al., 2019; Grossmann et al., 2019). Thus, many PD-associated genes involved in mitochondrial quality control and function have been linked to ERMCS, which may offer a link between disrupted organelle interaction, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and PD pathogenesis.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

ALS is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of both upper and lower motor neurons, leading to muscle atrophy (Boillee et al., 2006). ALS-causing mutations in Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) account for 20% of inherited cases (Rosen et al., 1993) and are known to cause dysfunction in both mitochondria and ER. Mutant SOD1 has been observed to accumulate at ERMCS, causing mislocalization of the IP3R tether and weakening the association between mitochondria and ER (Watanabe et al., 2016). This disruption of ERMCS is accompanied by reduced Ca2+ transfer from ER to mitochondria and lower intracellular ATP levels (Watanabe et al., 2016). Interestingly, IP3R polymorphisms have also been linked to ALS, with mRNA levels of IP3R isoform 2 elevated in patient samples (van Es et al., 2007). In addition to SOD1, TDP-43 has also been linked to ERMCS. TDP-43 pathology is a key hallmark of ALS, with ubiquitinated TDP-43 inclusions found in approximately 97% of ALS cases (Scotter et al., 2015). TDP-43 appears to contribute to ALS by disrupting normal protein-protein interactions (Buratti and Baralle, 2012), which may underlie its effect on ERMCS. Overexpression of either WT or mutant TDP-43 reduces ERMCS by disrupting the association between VAPB and PTPIP51 (Stoica et al., 2014). As with other cases of ERMCS dysfunction, ER to mitochondria calcium transfer was also impaired upon overexpression of TDP-43 (Stoica et al., 2014).

Other neurological disorders

ERMCS dysfunction has also been identified in less prevalent neurological disorders. While disruption of the VAPB-PTPIP51 tether by aberrant interactions has been implicated in both PD and ALS, a missense mutation in VAPB has also been directly implicated in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (Nishimura et al., 2004). Mutations in another ERMCS tether protein, VPS13A (Kumar et al., 2018), are associated with Chorea acanthocytosis (Rampoldi et al., 2001b; Ueno et al., 2001). MFN2 is a third ERMCS tether which maintains contacts through homotypic MFN2-MFN2 or heterotypic MFN2-MFN1 interactions, and missense mutations of MFN2 are associated with CMT2A (Larrea et al., 2019). Meanwhile, CMT2D has been linked to INF2 (Boyer et al., 2011), an ER-associated protein which regulates mitochondrial fission through ERMCS (Korobova et al., 2013).

The role of ERMCS in neurodegeneration is more completely understood in the case of Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP). RTN2 is an ER shaping protein (Voeltz et al., 2006) that has also been found to regulate lipid exchange at ERMCS, causing ERMCS expansion when overexpressed (Cho et al., 2017). Loss-of-function mutations in RTN2 were identified as causes of SPG type 12 (SPG12), which is characterized by progressive weakness and lower limb spasticity (Montenegro et al., 2012). A distinct HSP, SPG31, is associated with mutations in REEP1 (Goizet et al., 2011). While WT REEP1 localizes to and helps maintain ERMCS in primary cortical neurons, SPG31 mutations of REEP1 have been shown to disrupt ER-mitochondria interaction and function (Lavie et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2015). More work is needed to establish a direct role of ERMCS to disease pathogenesis, but the common appearance of ERMCS tethers and regulators in neurological disease suggests that impaired coordination of mitochondrial and ER activites may underlie disease development and progression.

ER-ENDOLYSOSOME CONTACT SITES

Proper functioning of the ER and lysosome are linked, because lysosome proteins are first inserted into the ER and must undergo anterograde trafficking through the trans-Golgi network as part of the lysosome targeting process. However, even more direct coordination can be seen at ER – endolysosome MCS, which participate in functions such as regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling (Eden et al., 2016), early to late endosome maturation (Friedman et al., 2013), lipid transport (Levin-Konigsberg et al., 2019; Rocha et al., 2009), and transport of lysosomes into axons (Ozkan et al., 2021). The role of ER – endosome MCS in lipid metabolism is of particular interest because the ER provides a critical supply of lipids for diverse cellular processes including proliferation and maturation, morphological and structural rearrangement, and homeostasis of the plasma membrane and other membrane-bound organelles. While vesicles are the primary vehicle for the transfer of lipids from the ER to the plasma membrane, lipids transferred from the ER to the endolysosome are heavily supplied by non-vesicular exchange which occurs at MCS (Prinz, 2014). MCS have also been identified as sites of direct lipid exchange for other organelle pairs (Prinz, 2014), although in many cases the precise molecular mechanism remains elusive. Direct transport of cholesterol from endosomes to ER has also been demonstrated (Underwood et al., 1998).

ER-endolysosome contacts have been found to be regulated by several different tethers. Cholesterol transfer from endosomes to the ER requires NPC1, which also serves as a tether during the process (Hoglinger et al., 2019). Additionally, vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)–associated proteins (VAPs) on the ER membrane interact with several endolysosomal membrane proteins containing FFAT domains, including ORP1L (Rocha et al., 2009) and STARD3 (Alpy et al., 2013). Other tethering pairs have been identified as EGFR-PTP1B (Eden et al., 2010), NPC1-ORP5 (Hoglinger et al., 2019), and Rab7-Protrudin (Raiborg et al., 2015). Many of these tethers and regulatory proteins have been associated with neurological diseases.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

In addition to ER – mitochondria contacts, ALS has also been connected to ER – lysosome contacts. ER membrane-anchored proteins VAPA and VAPB are direct and indirect tethers at ER-endocytic vesicle MCS. On endocytic vesicles, known interaction partners of the VAPs include ORP1L (Rocha et al., 2009) and STARD3 (Alpy et al., 2013). The VAPs also enforce the ER retention of protrudin (Saita et al., 2009), which in turn engages with Rab7 and PI3P to promote ER – endosome MCS (Raiborg et al., 2015). The VAPB loss-of-function point mutant P56S causes familial ALS (ALS8) by forming aggregates and promoting ER stress (Kanekura et al., 2006). VAPA and VAPB are binding partners, and VAPA is sequestered along with mutant VAPB into insoluble aggregates in ALS8, a functional depletion which is mirrored by reduced protein levels of VAPA and VAPB in motor neurons from patients with SOD1 mutation (Teuling et al., 2007). The mechanistic connection between misregulated ER – endolysosome contacts and ALS is not yet completely understood, but it is likely that the impaired endosome maturation and lipid trafficking contribute to impaired neuronal viability.

Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP)

Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), also known as familial spastic paraparesis, describes a group of inherited neurological disorders with more than 80 associated genetic loci (Blackstone, 2018). HSPs share common symptoms of progressive spasticity, stiffness, and gait disorder caused by axonal degeneration in the corticospinal tract. Recent studies have honed in on dysfunction of the endolysosomal system as a potential cellular mechanism of HSPs (Edmison et al., 2021).

The first gene identified in autosomal dominant subtypes of HSP was SPG4, which encodes Spastin. Mutations of SPG4 are the most common cause of HSPs and are found in ~40% of cases (Hazan et al., 1999). Spastin resides at the ER and bridges ER – lysosome contacts with its binding partner IST1 (Allison et al., 2017). Through these contacts, Spastin drives the fission of endosomal tubules, and depletion of Spastin results in enlarged lysosomes with aberrant ultrastructure (Allison et al., 2017). Interestingly, two other HSP-associated proteins, Spatacsin (SPG11) and Spastizin (SPG15), are required autophagic lysosome reformation (Chang et al., 2014), a process which features the scission of autolysosomal tubules. However, the role of the ER in this process has not been explored.

Protrudin, which is involved in ER – endosome contacts through Rab7-binding, is a known binding partner of Spastin [179] and has a contested link to HSP subtype SPG33 (Martignoni et al., 2008). Overexpression of the putative HSP mutant Protrudin G191V was found to increase ER stress compared to WT [181], but a more mechanistic link to HSP has yet to be shown.

Other neurological disorders

Loss of function mutations of SNX14 are associated with autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia 20 (SCAR20), which is characterized by neurodegeneration of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. SCAR20 patients manifest early-onset cerebellar atrophy, displaying motor dysfunction and various levels of intellectual disability (Akizu et al., 2015b; Thomas et al., 2014). The yeast homolog of the SNX14, Mdm1, was identified as a tethering protein at NVJs whose overexpression increased the extent of perinuclear ER – vacuole contacts (Henne et al., 2015). The involvement of ER – endolysosome contacts in SCAR20 progression is still unknown, but phenotypes of impaired autophagy and lipid metabolism caused by SNX14 mutations suggest a potential role (Akizu et al., 2015b; Thomas et al., 2014).

Finally, non-syndromic mental retardation (NS-MR) has been linked to a missense mutation in TECR by exome sequencing (Nolan et al., 2008). The yeast homolog of TECR, Tsc13, catalyzes the elongation of long-chain fatty acids and is responsible for maintaining the cellular sphingolipid profile (Abe et al., 2013; Kohlwein et al., 2001). Tsc13 is an ER-membrane protein which interacts with Vac8 on vacuoles at NVJs (Kohlwein et al., 2001). However, the role of TECR in ER – endolysosomal MCS has not been elucidated.

OTHER CONTACT SITES

VPS13 homologs and neurological disease

Yeast vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13 (Vps13) is found at perinuclear ER – vacuole junctions (NVJs), which correspond to mammalian ER – lysosome MCS (Honscher and Ungermann, 2014). There are four human homologs of Vps13 (Velayos-Baeza et al., 2004). Interestingly, each homolog is associated with a distinct neurological disorder, which is likely related to the enrichment of each Vps13 homolog at distinct MCS, though precise mechanistic details remain unresolved (Dziurdzik and Conibear, 2021).

VPS13A localizes to ERMCS and ER – lipid droplet MCS (Kumar et al., 2018). Mutations in VPS13A result in Chorea acanthocytosis (ChAc), an autosomal recessive progressive movement disorder characterized by striatal neurodegeneration (Rampoldi et al., 2001a). Loss of VPS13A diminishes K+-induced dopamine release in PC12 cells (Honisch et al., 2015) and decreases synaptic function in mouse striatum (Shiokawa et al., 2013a).

VPS13B is found at Golgi and endolysosomal vesicles (Seifert et al., 2015). More than 150 mutations of VPS13B are associated with Cohen syndrome (COH) (Balikova et al., 2009), symptoms of which include developmental delay, visual and intellectual disability, and seizures (Atabek et al., 2004; Kivitie-Kallio et al., 1998).

VPS13C mediates ER-endolysosome and ER – lipid droplets MCS (Kumar et al., 2018). VPS13C mutations cause various forms of early-onset parkinsonism marked by rapid disease progression and early cognitive impairment (Lesage et al., 2016).

VPS13D negatively regulates ERMCS through interactions with VCP (Du et al., 2021). Mutations in VPS13D cause Spastic ataxia (SPAX) (Gauthier et al., 2018; Seong et al., 2018). Unlike VPS13A/B/C, VPS13D is an essential protein (Wang et al., 2015), and disease-causing mutations in VPS13D are not functionally null (Dziurdzik et al., 2020). It is also worth noting that mutations in VCP are associated with a broad set of diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases (Tang and Xia, 2016).

ER – lipid droplet contacts

Lipid droplets (LDs) are multifunctional, dense stores of neutral lipids, which include triacylglycerol (TAG) and steryl esters (SE). LDs act as fatty acids reservoirs for lipid metabolism and energy production, but their function can become toxic in cells overloaded with fatty acids (Farese and Walther, 2009). LDs are constitutively poised near the ER, and ER-localized enzymes mediate key biosynthetic reactions at ER – LD contacts which are essential for normal lipid storage (Farese and Walther, 2009; Salo et al., 2016).

Several proteins which have been localized to the ER – LD interface are implicated in neurological diseases. Seipin is a lipodystrophy protein of the ER membrane that is required for the formation and maturation of regular LDs. Seipin knockout produces abnormal LD morphology and a sharp decrease in ER – LD contacts (Salo et al., 2016). Patients with heterozygous missense mutations in BSCL2 (which encodes seipin) develop HSP (SPG17, Silver syndrome) and other neurological conditions, such as CMT2A and distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) type V (Windpassinger et al., 2004). These seipinopathies are triggered by the formation of aggregates containing seipin N88S and S90L, which cause ER stress and perturb organelle function (Ito et al., 2012) and can lead to a combination of neurological defects and lipodystrophy (Guillen-Navarro et al., 2013).

The GTPase Rab18 is an LD-resident protein that regulates their growth and maturation (Ozeki et al., 2005). Deletion of Rab18 results in a dramatic decrease in mature LDs and lipid storage, along with increased ER stress (Xu et al., 2018). By super-resolution live-cell imaging, the ER-localized protein DFCP1 was determined to redistribute to ER – LD contact sites during LD biogenesis, forming a tether along with Seipin and Rab18 (Li et al., 2019). Rab18 also associates with the ER-associated NAG-RINT1-ZW10 (NRZ) complex and the ER Q-SNAREs (Syntaxin18, Use1, and BNIP1), representing a potentially complementary ER – LD tether (Li et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2018). Loss of function in Rab18 or mutations in its regulatory GTPases cause Warburg micro syndrome (Bem et al., 2011), a neurological disorder characterized by optical atrophy, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and hypogenitalism.

In addition to ER – endolysosome MCS, SNX14 has been localized to ER – LD contact sites, where it functions in neutral lipid homeostasis between the ER, LDs, and lysosomes. Upon treatment with fatty acids, SNX14 localizes to ER – LD contacts and promotes LD maturation and perinuclear accumulation (Datta et al., 2019). Deletion of SNX14 decreases LD formation and organization.

One additional tether identified at ER – LD contacts is a complex formed between the acyl-CoA synthetase FATP1 on the ER and diacylglycerol-transferase DGAT2 on LDs. This complex is associated with triglyceride synthesis and deposition, and it facilitates LD expansion in mammalian cells (Xu et al., 2012). DGAT2 was also found to cofractionate with mitochondria-associated membranes and to recruit lipid droplets to mitochondria upon fatty acid treatment (Stone et al., 2009). A missense mutation in DGAT2 causes autosomal-dominant axonal CMT2 (Hong et al., 2016).

LD – peroxisome contacts

Peroxisomes have a central role in the metabolism of lipids, polyamines, D-amino acids, and fatty acids (Van Veldhoven, 2010). Like LDs, their biogenesis also occurs in the ER (Geuze et al., 2003), though mitochondria are also involved (Sugiura et al., 2017). Trafficking of fatty acids from LDs to peroxisomes is regulated by the M1 isoform of Spastin, which localizes to LDs through an N-terminal hydrophobic helical hairpin (Chang et al., 2019). At LD – peroxisome contact sites, Spastin forms a tethering complex with the peroxisomal fatty acid transporter ATP binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) (Chang et al., 2019). The K388R mutation of Spastin is the most common cause of HSP (Blackstone, 2018), while mutations in ABCD1 are associated with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (Mosser et al., 1993).

ER – plasma membrane (PM) contact

ER – PM contacts are particularly abundant in neurons, where they have been linked to both replenishment of ER calcium stores and lipid recycling (Fowler et al., 2019). One identified ER – PM tether features VAPA/B (which have also been implicated in ERMCS) and phosphorylated voltage-gated potassium channels Kv2.1/Kv2.2 (KCNB1/2) (Johnson et al., 2018). The VAP/Kv2 interaction-dependent formation of ER – PM contact sites underlies a well-documented phenomenon of Kv2 channel clustering, which has been associated with the delivery and recycling of ion channels to the plasma membrane (Deutsch et al., 2012). Kv2 channel activity appears to assist with repetitive firing of motor neurons (Romer et al., 2019). Interestingly, motor neuron activity may promote calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of Kv2, which reduces channel clustering. This suggests a potential regulatory mechanism, where the ER and plasma membrane dynamically couple and uncouple to modulate the firing capacity of motor neurons. Indeed, VAPB mutation is associated with ALS8 (Nishimura et al., 2004), and missense mutations in Kv2.1 are associated with epileptic encephalopathy DEE26, in which repetitive neuronal firing is impaired (Saitsu et al., 2015). Other ER – PM tethers have been identified in E-Syt1 and TMEM24, although neither has been reported in association with neurodegenerative disease (Fowler et al., 2019).

CONCLUSION

Cells were first described by Robert Hooke in 1665, but another 170 years passed before the discovery of the nucleus by Robert Brown revealed the existence of organelles (Brown, 1833). Since then, most of our understanding of organelles has come from studying them individually or in isolation. However, advanced microscopy and biochemical techniques now enable us to track the dynamic movements of organelles with respect to each other, discover molecular structures and functions of membrane contact sites between organelles, and compare the difference of MCS between healthy and diseased cells. However, many fundamental questions related to MCS and their disease contribution still remain unanswered.

First, we need to better understand the role of MCS in healthy cells and how altered MCS contribute to neurodegenerative disease pathology. For example, ER-mitochondria contacts are increased in Alzheimer’s disease, but they are often decreased in ALS and Parkinson’s disease. However, increases in ERMCS have also been reported in both ALS and PD. It is possible that conflicting data may be due to technical or contextual differences. However, to satisfyingly resolve this discrepancy, we must define the relevant mechanistic outputs of altered MCS. MCS are sites of multiple important functions, and it is likely that disease-associated mutations do not uniformly impact each function, even in instances where the overall impact on MCS appears similar. For example, VPS13A mutations are likely to impact lipid transfer most heavily, while DJ-1 mutations will have strong impacts on mitochondrial quality control and bioenergetics, even though in both cases ERMCS are observed to decrease.

Next, we need to better understand the dynamic regulation of MCS. Since some MCS functions appear to overlap or complement each other, it will be important to characterize the compensatory mechanisms by which dysfunction in one MCS may elicit changes in another. For example, STARD3-dependent mitochondria-lysosome contacts are upregulated when NPC1-dependent ER-lysosome understanding of the contextual regulation of MCS may also help to resolve apparently conflicting MCS alterations in the same disease with different underlying genotypes. In one case, a mutation might disrupt an MCS, thus impairing a particular disease-relevant function. A different mutation might abrogate that function directly, triggering compensatory increases in MCS.

In line with this, further research must carefully examine whether alterations to MCS are causal for disease pathology or incidental to other cellular deficiencies. This could possibly vary with respect to the particular disease mutation, and it is doubtful that MCS dysfunction will account for all aspects of disease presentation. However, if rescuing normal MCS levels can improve certain cellular functions, such as lysosomal degradative capacity or mitochondrial function (Kim et al., 2021) then MCS will represent promising therapeutic targets.

Finally, many questions remain about the cell type-specific roles and regulation of MCS. For example, previous studies have reported variable effects of α-synuclein on ERMCS in SH-SY5Y cells (Paillusson et al., 2017), M17 cells, and Hela cells (Guardia-Laguarta et al., 2014), suggesting that different MCS regulatory mechanisms may exist in different cell types. Given the highly specialized nature of neurons and their accessory cells, it is critical to understand the factors which underlie differential regulation of MCS, as these factors may provide important clues to selective vulnerability seen in many neurological disorders. MCS are central to interorganelle communication and are likely critical in the cellular response to changing metabolic and energetic demands, so it is easy to envision a key role for MCS in the maintenance of fragile and demanding neurons. However, MCS are ubiquitous to all cell types, and their contribution to disease pathology via non-neuronal cell types must also be explored.

Although many contact sites remain to be discovered, it seems increasingly probable that most pairwise combinations of organelles feature functional interaction, including physical association. It is likely that disease pathology which has been linked to the dysfunction of specific organelles additionally or alternatively reflects dysfunction of interorganelle interactions, including in neurological disease. Future studies must consider the integrated network of organelles through MCS and must not rely solely on the characterization of dysfunctional organelles in isolation. We expect that as our information on MCS grows, it will become central to our understanding of subcellular activity and homeostasis and will represent novel targets for therapeutic development.

Kim et all review the emerging field of inter-organelle contact sites, focusing on their role in organelle dynamics and inter-organelle communication to maintain cellular homeostasis. In particular, they discuss how disruptions in inter-organelle contacts contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases.

Summary

Interorganelle membrane contacts occur across diverse combinations of organelles and are critical for cellular homeostasis and the coordination of metabolic and signaling processes.

Interorganelle interaction is a key feature of neuron biology, where contact sites are involved in general functions as well as neuron-specific processes.

A growing number of neurodegenerative diseases feature dysregulation of membrane contact sites, particularly between the mitochondrial and the ER or endolysosomal membranes.

Important questions remain about the mechanisms linking dysfunctional interorganelle interactions to disease pathology, context and cell-type specificity of contact regulation, and the role of compensatory formation of interorganelle contacts.

Membrane contact sites facilitate our understanding of organelle dysfunction in disease and may represent an important target for therapeutic development.
