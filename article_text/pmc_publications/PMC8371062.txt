Purpose

Recent studies have shown that standard compartmental models using plasma input or the cerebellum reference tissue input are generally not reliable for quantifying tau burden in dynamic 18F-Flortaucipir PET studies of Alzheimer disease. So far, the optimal reference region for estimating 18F-Flortaucipir delivery and specific tau binding has yet to be determined. The objective of the study is to improve 18F-Flortaucipir brain tau PET quantification using a spatially constrained kinetic model with dual reference tissues.

Methods

Participants were classified as either cognitively normal (CN) or cognitively impaired (CI) based on clinical assessment. T1-weighted structural MRI and 105-minute dynamic 18F-Flortaucipir PET scans were acquired for each participant. Using both a simplified reference tissue model (SRTM2) and Logan plot with either cerebellum gray matter or centrum semiovale (CS) white matter as the reference tissue, we estimated distribution volume ratios (DVRs) and the relative transport rate constant R1 for region of interest-based (ROI) and voxelwise-based analyses. Conventional linear regression (LR) and LR with spatially constrained (LRSC) parametric imaging algorithms were then evaluated. Noise-induced bias in the parametric images was compared to estimates from ROI time activity curve-based kinetic modeling. We finally evaluated standardized uptake value ratios at early phase (SUVREP, 0.7–2.9 min) and late phase (SUVRLP, 80–105 min) to approximate R1 and DVR, respectively.

Results

The percent coefficients of variation of R1 and DVR estimates from SRTM2 with spatially constrained modeling were comparable to those from the Logan plot and SUVRs. The SRTM2 using CS reference tissue with LRSC reduced noise-induced underestimation in the LR generated DVR images to negligible levels (&lt; 1%). Inconsistent overestimation of DVR in the SUVRLP only occurred using the cerebellum reference tissue-based measurements. The CS reference tissue-based DVR and SUVRLP, and cerebellum-based SUVREP and R1 provided higher Cohen’s effect size d to detect increased tau deposition and reduced relative tracer transport rate in CI individuals.

Conclusion

Using a spatially constrained kinetic model with dual reference tissues significantly improved quantification of relative perfusion and tau binding. Cerebellum and CS are the suggested reference tissues to estimate R1 and DVR, respectively, for dynamic 18F-Flortaucipir PET studies. Cerebellum-based SUVREP and CS-based SUVRLP may be used to simplify 18F-Flortaucipir PET study.

pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline, brain deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide plaques and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) protein [1]. Although most studies of AD have focused extensively on brain amyloidosis, recent studies in AD pathobiology and treatment strategies strongly suggest aggregate ptau may be a main driver for neurodegeneration [2, 3]. Tau-targeted therapies are now under consideration for AD clinical trials, necessitating methods to carefully identify potential participants [4–6], while new research criteria have redefined AD by quantitative amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau, and FDG positron emission tomography (PET) for neurodegeneration (AT(N)) measurements [7].

One such method to identify and monitor potential clinical trial participants is PET, a molecular imaging technique that has been used to measure in vivo tau pathology with high sensitivity and specificity. Using tau-specific radiotracers, such as the widely used second generation tracer 18F-Flortaucipir (formally 18F-AV1451 and 18F-T807; commercially marketed as Tauvid), tau burden can be both quantified and spatially characterized [8]. Previous works have characterized the tracer binding kinetics of 18F-Flortaucipir PET using standard compartmental model and Logan plots with either plasma or reference tissue input [9–14]. These previous studies have consistently reported that 1-tissue and 2-tissue compartmental models describe the brain tissue 18F-Flortaucipir kinetics with negative and positive binding, respectively. Due to the high variance of estimates using these models, the conventional compartmental modeling method may not be a reliable method to measure tau burden. Logan plots with either plasma or cerebellum reference tissue input were instead recommended to quantify 18F-Flortaucipir binding ([9]). As an alternative to Logan plots, spatially constrained kinetic modeling methods were theorized to reduce the estimate variance for compartmental model with plasma ([15]) and reference tissue input ([16]).

Although compartmental models with plasma input are considered the “gold standard” in kinetic analysis approaches, they come with increased risks to participants due to arterial blood sampling, resulting in smaller sample sizes in AD studies ([9, 10, 13]). To address this issue, a simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and the Logan plot method using cerebellum gray matter as a reference region are now widely used to estimate tracer tissue distribution volume ratio (DVR) or binding potential (BPND = DVR – 1) to reflect tissue density of tau [10, 11, 13, 17–30]. However, the cerebellum may not be an optimal reference tissue for estimating DVR or BPND as cerebellum 18F-Flortaucipir VT was positively correlated with age in healthy controls and patients with AD ([10]). White matter regions, such as the centrum semiovale, have been suggested as alternative reference regions to measure amyloid-β and tau brain deposition with SUVRLP and DVR for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of AD [12, 31–34]. Few studies have carefully evaluated both the cerebellum and centrum semiovale as a reference tissue for improving 18F-Flortaucipir PET quantification in diagnosis and monitoring AD development.

Multiparametric images generated from single dynamic PET scans provide complementary quantitative information about different pathophysiological changes during disease progress. For example, DVR and relative transport rate constant R1 images generated from [11C]PIB dynamic PET have been used to assess brain Aβ deposition and cerebral blood flow decreases in AD studies, respectively [16, 35–38]. In contrast to an apriori regions of interest (ROIs) analysis approach, data driven-based PET parametric imaging has the potential to become a new standard for imaging pathophysiology to diagnosis and monitor neurodegenerative disease progression and evaluate therapeutic responses [39–41]. The noise-induced underestimation in DVR images generated from the SRTM and Logan plot with conventional linear regression are dependent on the noise levels and magnitude of DVR in the compartmental model and Logan plot ([16, 42, 43]). The inconsistent noise-induced underestimation may reduce statistical power to separate AD from cognitively normal in brain tau binding. To improve 18F-Flortaucipir PET parametric imaging, a linear regression with spatially constrained (LRSC) parametric imaging method was developed [16, 44] and further evaluated in the present study.

Due to time limitations, PET acquisitions in clinical settings are typically restricted to simple quantifications to approximate DVR, such as standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) calculated at a late phase in the scan (SUVRLP). As an example, SUVRLP can be calculated for the 30 minutes of data collected 75–105 min post 18F-Flortaucipir injection per the ADNI study protocol (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/pet-analysis-method/pet-analysis/). SUVRLP is widely used as a semi-quantitative tau PET measurement and is often calculated over the shortened 20-min (80–100 min) or 30-min (75–105 min, ADNI protocol) 18F-Flortaucipir dynamic tau PET acquisitions using the cerebellum or a white matter reference tissue. SUVRLP has been shown to be highly correlated with DVR or BPND ([9–11, 13, 45]); however, SUVRLP also systematically under- or overestimates tau deposition levels as the scan time window shifts earlier or later from the acquisition protocol, which commonly occurs due to the unpredictable nature of clinical settings. This overestimation reflects increasing SUVRs as scan duration increases to 2 hours [10, 14, 45]. Further, even though SUVRLP attains a constant level during this range of study times, such as in [11C]PIB amyloid PET at 50–70 min post tracer injection, the overestimation of DVR in SUVRLP depends on the magnitude of SUVRLP or DVR [21]. Since the early phase of the dynamic tissue activity curve from a tau-based PET scan [46] depends on regional cerebral blood flow, some have proposed that calculating SUVR from this part of the curve (SUVREP) can reflect neuronal injury and neurodegeneration [47].

To improve and simplify quantitative 18F-Flortaucipir tau PET imaging, we assessed the effects of reference tissue selection on the 18F-Flortaucipir PET kinetic modeling, whether desirable results can be obtained using a spatially constrained parametric imaging algorithm using these reference regions, and whether SUVREP and SUVRLP can be used as proxies for R1 and DVR quantification in cases where a shortened 18F-Flortaucipir dynamic PET protocol is required. We assess these questions in a sample of cognitively normal and impaired older adults.

Methods

SRTM2 for ROI TAC based spatially constrained kinetic modeling

The SRTM assumes 1) tracer concentration in target and reference tissues can be modeled by 1-tissue compartment, and 2) the tracer distribution volume of free plus nonspecific binding (DVF+NS) in the target tissue equals the tracer distribution volume in a reference tissue (DVREF) [24]. SRTM includes R1, k2, and BPND parameters, where R1 is the transport rate constant K1 ratio relative to reference tissue (=K1/K1R), k2 (1/min) is the efflux rate constant from free plus nonspecific compartment to blood, and BPND is binding potential, an index of tracer specific binding to tissue. Note that BPND = DVR-1, and DVR is the tracer distribution volume ratio relative to reference tissue. Based on the underlying assumption of SRTM, namely DVF+NS (target tissue)=DVREF, the 3-parameter SRTM (R1, k2, and BPND) can be represented by SRTM2 (R1, k2R, and BPND), where k2R (1/min) is the efflux rate constant from reference tissue to blood [16, 48]. The parameters of the SRTM2 can be estimated by simultaneously fitting a model to the time activity curves (TACs) for all ROIs [16, 49, 50] (1) ∑j=1N∑i=1Mwi(Cjti-fSRTM2tiR1j,k2R,BPNDj)2

where M is the number of frames for the dynamic PET scan, N is number of ROI TACs, ti is the mid time of ith frame, wi is the duration of ith frame, and Cjti is the measured jth ROI’s tracer concentration at ith frame. The jth ROI′s tracer concentration at time ti is determined by fSRTM2 with the parameters R1j and BPNDj for jth ROI and the coupled parameter k2R.

SRTM2 based spatially constrained parametric imaging algorithm: linear regression with spatial constraint (LRSC)

The parametric images generated from dynamic PET using the SRTM2 are R1 and DVR (=BPND + 1). To generate R1 using a linear regression, the following operational equation derived from the SRTM2 was used (2) CTt=R1(CREFt+k2R∫0tCREFsds)-k2′∫0tCTsds

where k2′ (=k2/DVR) is the efflux rate constant from target tissue, and CREF(t) is the tracer concentration in reference tissue at time t. A LRSC algorithm using a general ridge regression with Eq. (2) generated an R1 image [16, 44, 51]. The linear equation below derived from SRTM2 was used to generate DVR images [16] (3) ∫0tCTsds=DVR(∫0tCREFsds+CREF(t)k2R)-δCTt

where δ = 1/k2′. To minimize the noise-induced underestimation in DVR, a LRSC algorithm was proposed by applying a 3 dimensional (3D) Gaussian spatial smooth filter S to the CT on the right side of Eq. (3), i.e., the operational equation (4) below was used to generate DVR images with the LRSC method [16]: (4) ∫0tCTsds=DVR(∫0tCREFsds+CREF(t)k2R)-δS(CTt)

Logan plot with reference tissue input

The standard Logan plot with reference tissue input is described by the operational equation (5) below [52] (5) ∫0tCTsdsCT(t)=DVR∫0tCREFs+CREF(t)k2RCT(t)+τfort&gt;t*

where the tracer kinetics in target and reference tissue follow a 1-tissue compartment model after t* post tracer injection. The Logan plot is reliable and widely used to estimate DVR for low noise level of tissue kinetics, such as in ROI based kinetic modeling. Note that the Logan plot determined by Eq. (5) is equivalent to Eq. (3) if CT(t) has negligible kinetic noise. The Logan plot determined by Eq. (5) can be simplified to Eq. (6) as CREF(t)/CT(t) attains a constant for t &gt; ts*. (6) ∫0tCTsdsCT(t)=DVR∫0tCREFsCT(t)+βfort&gt;ts*

Due to its simplicity, the simplified Logan plot without including efflux rate constant k2R is commonly used for quantification in radioligand-receptor dynamic PET studies. The ts* is usually &gt; t* as CREF(t)/CT(t) approaches a constant.

The Logan plot based LRSC parametric imaging algorithm

Similar to the SRTM2, we propose the operational Eq. (7) to minimize noise-induced under-estimation of DVR for Logan plot analyses [16, 42, 48, 49] (7) ∫0tCTsdsCT(t)=DVR∫0tCREFs+CREF(t)k2RS(CTt)+τfort&gt;t*

where S is the 3D Gaussian spatial smoothing filter as used in Eq. (4).

Based on a previous study [14] and the Logan graphical analysis in this study, t* = 50 min was used for the Logan plots determined by Eqs. (5) and (7) at both the ROI and voxelwise kinetic levels, and t*=80 min was used for the simplified Logan plot determined by Eq. (6) for cerebellum and centrum semiovale reference tissues.

SUVR for DVR approximation

SUVR can be used as an approximation of DVR to quantify tracer specific binding in situations where a shorter scan acquisition time is required—an advantage for clinical applications. In this study, the SUVR at early phase (SUVREP ) and late phase ( SUVRLP ) scan were calculated as SUVREP = ∫0.72.9CTtdt∫0.72.9CREFtdt and SUVRLP = ∫80105CTtdt∫80105CREFtdt from the dynamic PET images. The SUVREP and R1 reflect relative cerebral blood flow or perfusion [35] while SUVRLP and DVR reflect tracer specific binding to tau proteins [10, 13, 27, 28, 45].

Cerebellum gray matter versus centrum semiovale white matter for reference tissue

The tracer kinetics of cerebellum gray and centrum semiovale white matter uptake were evaluated via SUV and k2R estimates from ROI TAC based SRTM2 kinetic modeling. The effects of reference tissue selection were calculated on the quantification of 18F-Flortaucipir uptake using either ROI-based analysis or voxelwise calculations. Both cerebellum and centrum semiovale were used as reference tissue for the estimates from SRTM2, Logan plot, and SUVR calculation.

Human 18F-Flortaucipir dynamic PET and data acquisition

Imaging data for 120 participants enrolled in longitudinal studies of aging and dementia at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) at Washington University School of Medicine were included in the study. Based on the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale [53], participants were classified as either cognitively normal (CN; CDR=0; n=104, male:female, 45:59, age 68.08 ± 8.32 (mean ± SD, hereafter)) or cognitively impaired (CI; CDR&gt;0; n=16, male:female, 6:10, age 76.44 ± 5.79).

18F-Florbetapir imaging was performed on a Siemens Biograph 40 PET-CT scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Knoxville, Tennessee). Immediately following a single intravenous bolus injection (9.29 ±0.80 mCi, range, 7.20 – 10.70 mCi), dynamic PET data were collected for each participant in 3D acquisition list mode with the following frame durations: 10×6 sec, 6×20 sec, 4×30 sec, 5×1 min, 5×2 min, 17×5 min (105 min total, 47 frames). PET data (volume 256×256×109, voxel size 1.33×1.33×2.03 mm3 in x, y, z direction) were reconstructed using a 3D-Ordered-Subset Expectation-Maximization (OSEM) with 3 iterations and 21 subsets. A post-reconstruction Gaussian filter of 3 mm was applied to the data, resulting in a spatial resolution of 5.8 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). Each participant additionally received a structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan using a magnetization prepared-rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence (volume size: 256×256×256, voxel size: 1.05 × 1.05 × 1.19 mm3 in x, y, z direction) to provide anatomic information for PET image processing and analysis.

The Washington University Human Research Protection Office approved study protocols. Written informed consents were obtained from all individuals or their authorized representatives. The data presented in this study have not been published elsewhere previously.

Image processing and statistical analysis

PET and MRI data were processed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom) in the MATLAB (2019b, The MathWorks Inc.) environment. First, to correct head motion during PET scan, the dynamic PET images were aligned using a moving average reference method [54]. Frames covering the first 2-mins of scan time were integrated into a single image to be used as an initial reference for alignment. Using the SPM12-based PET-to-PET registration tool, the first PET frame after 2-min window was registered to the initial reference image. The reference image was then updated by combining the previous reference image with the co-registered PET wherein the integration was calculated as a frame duration weighted average. This iterative registration procedure stopped when the last PET frame was registered to the current reference image. MRIs were then co-registered to the frame duration weighted mean of the motion corrected PET images using a mutual information method.

The co-registered MRI images were spatially normalized to the standard Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) atlas using SPM12 and the CAT12 toolbox (http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/). The MRI template with image volume 121×145×121 and voxel size 1.5×1.5×1.5 mm in x, y, z direction was used for spatial normalization. The transformation parameters determined by MRI spatial normalization were then applied to the aligned dynamic PET images for PET spatial normalization. A total of 32 ROIs including cerebellum gray matter and centrum semiovale reference tissues, and the entorhinal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior temporal, lateral temporal, fusiform, orbital frontal, prefrontal, superior frontal, anterior and posterior cingulate, posterior precuneus, parietal, occipital regions were manually drawn on the MRI template using the PMOD software program (PMOD 4.002, PMOD Technologies Ltd., Zürich, Switzerland) in standard MNI space [55–57]. Centrum semiovale white matter was drawn on 8 consecutive slices from z=78 mm to z=88.5 mm in the axial view from top of the head, as demonstrated in a previous study [31]. ROI TACs were generated by applying each ROI to the aligned dynamic PET images in MNI space. These calculated TACs served as a “gold standard” reference for evaluating the noise effects on the parametric images.

Cohen’s effect size d [30, 58–60] between the CN and CI groups was calculated as d= (mean (X at group 1) – mean(X at group 2))/SDpooled, where SDpooled is the standard deviation of X in pooled population, and X represents estimates of DVR, R1, SUVRLP, and SUVREP for ROI and voxelwsie analyses. SUVREP and SUVRLP were compared to the R1 and DVR by Bland-Altman analysis [61–64], respectively. The Statistical Analysis System software package (SAS 9.4, SAS Institute, Inc) and MATLAB were used for all statistical analyses.

Results

Demographics and statistics of cognitive assessments

The CI group was significantly older (mean of 8.4 years) in age than the CN group (p &lt; 0.01). There were 31 and 10 apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele carriers in the CN and CI participants, respectively. Statistical χ2 test showed the frequency of APOE ε4 carriers in the CI group was significantly higher than in the CN group (p = 0.01). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [65] scores for CN group (29.20 ± 1.13) were significantly higher than for the CI group (26.31 ± 3.24) (p = 0.003). No significant difference in education levels between CN (16.12 ± 2.26 years) and CI individuals (14.94 ± 2.84 years) (p = 0.13) was detected.

ROI kinetic analysis using cerebellum and centrum semiovale reference tissues

The statistics of SUVEP, SUVLP, and k2R estimated from ROI TAC based SRTM2 modeling for cerebellum and centrum semiovale from the CN and CI groups are listed in Table 1. Although higher centrum semiovale SUVEPs were observed in CNs relative to CI group, this difference was not significant (d = −0.21, p = 0.44). Comparable cerebellum SUVEPs between the two groups were observed (d = −0.34, P = 0.90). In contrast to SUVEP, significant differences in the SUVLP (d = 0.53, P &lt; 0.05), and k2R (d = −1.16, P &lt; 0.01) between the two groups were detected for the cerebellum but not for the centrum semiovale (d ≥ 0.24, P ≥ 0.20).

TACs for the inferior temporal region using cerebellum gray matter and centrum semiovale reference tissues from an exemplar participant (female, age = 84.6 years, apolipoprotein E ε3/ε3, AD dementia, CDR = 1, MMSE = 23) are depicted in Figure 1. The TAC for the cerebellum reference reached its peak at 2.73 min post-injection, and the cerebellum to centrum semiovale ratio was approximately 1.00 from 80 min post-injection to the end of the scan (Fig. 1a). Due to the tracer’s slow delivery into white matter, low tracer activity in centrum semiovale resulted in high noise and poor fitting for the inferior temporal region in the early phase reference tissue input (Fig. 1a–1b). Compared to the centrum semiovale reference tissue, the lower noise in the cerebellum reference tissue improved the model fit from the early phase to the end of the scan (Fig. 1a and 1c). The SUVR of the inferior temporal region relative to cerebellum increased and attained an approximately constant level (1.915 ± 0.031) after 80 mins (Fig. 1g), while the SUVR relative to the centrum semiovale attained a constant level as early as 10 mins (1.964 ± 0.032) (Fig. 1d). In line with the SUVR plots in Figs 1d and 1g, the linear segments of their corresponding simplified Logan plots (Eq. 6) were started from t* = 80 and =0 min for the cerebellum (Fig. 1h) and centrum semiovale (Fig. 1e) reference tissues, respectively. The t* determined by the Logan plot (Eq. 5) using k2R estimated from the SRTM2 fitting was around 10 mins for both centrum semiovale (Fig. 1f) and cerebellum (Fig. 1i). Overall, the SRTM2 fit using either centrum semiovale or reference tissue matched the measured inferior temporal TAC quite well (Figs 1b and 1c). The exemplar participant demonstrates that the Logan plot using the k2R estimated from the SRTM2 is equivalent to the SRTM2 DVR estimation with t*, independent of reference tissue selection. Additionally, the Logan plot and simplified Logan plot with centrum semiovale reference tissue were more robust in t* than the cerebellum as the centrum semiovale attained relative equilibrium earlier (see Methods section).

SUVR and DVRs estimates for 14 ROIs from SRTM2 and the Logan plot for cerebellum and centrum semiovale reference tissue are summarized in Table 2. DVR estimates from the SRTM2 and the Logan plot were highly correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.96 and 0.98 for cerebellum and centrum semiovale-based DVRs, respectively) with &lt; 4% difference. DVR estimates from SRTM2 using the centrum semiovale reference were (10.4 ± 1.8)% and (13.0 ± 3.0)% higher than cerebellum-based DVRs for CN and CI groups, respectively. For the Logan plot, the centrum semiovale-based DVRs were (13.3 ± 0.7)% and (17.8 ± 0.6)% higher than the cerebellum-based DVR for CN and CI groups, respectively. The cerebellum-based SUVRLP calculations were (8.8 ± 5.3)% and (14.8 ± 5.2)% higher than DVRs from SRTM2 for CN and CI groups, respectively. In contrast, the centrum semiovale-based SUVRLPs were (7.1 ± 3.2)% and (2.7 ± 3.6)% lower than DVRs from SRTM2 for CN and CI groups, respectively. Higher Cohen’s d and lower p values were found in the centrum semiovale-based DVRs and SUVRs as compared to the cerebellum-based measurements. The differences between CN and CI groups in cerebellum-based DVRs and SUVRs were not significant for orbital frontal, prefrontal cortex or hippocampus but were significant for centrum semiovale-based DVR and SUVRs for all 14 ROIs (p &lt; 0.05). R1 and SUVREP estimates for 14 ROIs for the CN and CI groups in Table 3 show that both the cerebellum-based R1 and SUVREP had lower p- and Cohen’s d values than the those from centrum semiovale-based estimates. The cerebellum-based R1s were significantly reduced for several of the ROIs in CI individuals, including superior frontal, lateral temporal, parietal, posterior precarious, posterior cingulate, medial temporal, hippocampus, and parahippocampus (p &lt; 0.05).

SUVRLP and SUVREP were used to approximate the DVR and R1 estimates from the full TAC with SRTM2 kinetic modeling, respectively. We used the Bland-Altman plots (Fig. 2) for evaluating agreement between the two sets of measures. The difference between cerebellum-based SUVRLP and DVR (SUVRLP – DVR), and the difference between centrum semiovale-based SUVREP and R1 (SUVREP - R1) were inconsistent over their respective ranges, and the slopes of their linear regression lines were significantly differently from 0 (p &lt; 0.01) (Fig 2a and 2d). In contrast, the difference between centrum semiovale-based SUVRLP and DVR (SUVRLP - DVR: −0.02 ± 0.05, n=3600), and the difference between cerebellum-based SUVREP and R1 (SUVREP – R1: 0.01 ± 0.05, n=3600) were consistently close to 0 (Figs 2b and 2c). Fig. 2 shows that the overestimation of SUVR in DVR increases as DVR increases for the cerebellum reference tissue. This is similar to the results from quantitative [11C]PiB amyloid PET using the cerebellum reference tissue [21]. However, the underestimation of SUVREP in R1 decreases as R1 increases for centrum semiovale but not for the cerebellum reference tissue.

Parametric imaging with LRSC

The noise-induced underestimation in the DVR images generated by the Logan plot and SRTM2 using conventional linear regression were reduced by the LRSC algorithm as a function of the FWHM used in smoothing (Fig. 3). The DVRs in high binding regions, such as amygdala and lateral temporal, increased as the size of FWHM increased and became stable at a Gaussian filter FWHM ≥ 9 mm. The quantitative analyses on the DVR and R1 images generated by the SRTM2 or Logan plot with LRSC were based on a Gaussian filter of 11.6 mm FWHM. In contrast to the DVRs estimated from ROI TACs with low noise levels, the DVRs from the parametric images generated from the Logan plot or SRTM2 with regular LR method were 11.7 to 22.3% lower on average across all 31 ROIs (Fig 4a–4b). The underestimation in the cerebellum reference tissue-based DVR images in the CI group were significantly higher than those in CN group (p &lt; 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in noise-induced underestimation between the CN and CI groups for the centrum semiovale reference tissue-based DVR images. The SRTM2 using the centrum semiovale reference and LRSC reduced noise-induced underestimation in the DVR images to negligible levels (&lt;1%) (Fig. 4d).

The inconsistent underestimation in the cerebellum reference-based DVR images generated from the Logan plot and SRTM2 with LR reduced the contrast in the DVR images between CI and CN, which may result in lower statistical power to distinguish DVRs in CI individuals from the CN group. On the other hand, the consistent underestimation in the centrum semiovale reference-based DVR images generated from the Logan plot and SRTM2 with LR result in higher values in Cohen’s d images in precuneus and frontal cortex (Fig. 5). The DVR images generated from the SRTM2 using the centrum semiovale reference and LRSC gave the highest Cohen’s d values. But the R1 images generated from the SRTM2 using the cerebellum reference provided higher d values than those calculated from the centrum semiovale–based R1 images (Fig. 5). The mean images of DVR and R1 generated from the CN and CI groups showed lower R1 values in the parietal, anterior and posterior cingulate, and hippocampus regions in CI group. Higher DVR values in lateral temporal, parietal, entorhinal cortex and amygdala regions were seen but not in hippocampus (Fig 6a and 6b, and Tables 2 and 3). Significant negative linear correlations between the ROI DVR and R1 estimates were found in the inferior temporal, occipital, and lateral temporal cortices in the CI individuals. The DVR and R1 estimates from dynamic 18F-Flortaucipir are complementary for AD diagnosis and evaluation of responses to treatment as they represent brain tau burden and relative cerebral blood flow [66].

Discussion

We proposed to use a spatially constrained model with parametric-specific reference tissue input to improve noninvasive 18F-Flortaucipir quantification. Two reference tissues, cerebellum and centrum semiovale, were compared for quantification of 18F-Flortaucipir relative perfusion and specific binding in cognitively impaired and unimpaired participants from a cross-sectional cohort. The centrum semiovale reference tissue based SUVRLP and DVR provided higher statistical power to distinguish CN from CI in tau pathology as compared to the cerebellum based SUVRLP and DVR. In contrast, the cerebellum reference tissue based SUVREP and R1 calculations were more sensitive to differences in tracer delivery to tissues between CN and CI groups. Similar findings were reported in previous studies. Cerebellum reference tissue-based SUVREP and R1 measured from dynamic amyloid and tau PET were proposed as a surrogate of cerebral blood flow for both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of AD [35, 46, 67, 68]. Note that the intrinsic high noise levels in white matter in the early phase (Fig 1) could cause higher variations in the centrum semiovale-based R1 and SUVREP-based measurements (Fig. 2, Table 3). However, white matter including centrum semiovale and pons have been used to calculate amyloid-β and tau brain deposition by SUVRLP and DVR from dynamic amyloid and tau PET [12, 31–34]. We expect the results from this cross-sectional study on cerebellum and centrum semiovale reference tissue-based quantification of 18F-Flortaucipir perfusion and brain tau burden could be used to predict their performance in longitudinal AD studies. Careful evaluation is needed for selecting the appropriate reference tissue for amyloid and tau PET studies as many factors including interested output measurement, studied population, and differences in biological, physiological and structural changes during AD progression between the cerebellum and white matter can impact quantitative analyses [69, 70].

One limitation of the study is that we could not perform standard compartmental modeling with plasma input since we did not collect arterial blood samples to determine the benefit from reference tissue-based kinetic modeling used in the study. Note that 2-tissue and 1-tissue compartmental models with plasma input were preferred for 18F-Flortaucipir kinetics of positive and negative tau binding [10, 13, 14], respectively. But the SRTM2 and Logan plot (t &gt; t*) are based on a 1-tissue compartmental model for both target and reference tissues. The model simplification for SRTM2 and Logan plot with reference tissue input may result in underestimation in DVR or BPND for CI group [16, 24]. The k2R of cerebellum estimated from SRTM2 with spatially constrained kinetic modeling were (0.044 ± 0.008)/min and (0.034 ± 0.006)/min for CN and CI groups, respectively, which are comparable to the cerebellum k2R of 0.048/min [10] and 0.06/min [14] (calculated as mean(K1)/mean(VT). The DVR estimated from the Logan plot with cerebellum reference tissue input was found to be up to 20% lower than the ones from 2-tissue compartment model with plasma input [10, 14]. Based on the two previous studies, we conservatively believe the underestimation of cerebellum and centrum semiovale reference-based DVR to be in a range of 0–20% for CI group. In contrast, the underestimation in the DVR from CN group is expected to be smaller, as 1-tissue compartment model is appropriate for most target ROIs of negligible tau binding.

Partial volume effects and atrophy also may affect PET noise levels, kinetic modeling methods [10, 14, 29, 30, 45, 71, 72] and the DVR, R1, and SUVR calculations [31]. Due to high noise levels that occur with voxelwise tracer kinetics, voxelwise partial volume correction (PVC) remains challenging for brain dynamic PET data. Our previous studies demonstrate that PVC increased statistical power to detect SUVRLP differences between CN and CI groups in AD tau PET studies [55–56]. It is rational to assume that PVC will increase the sensitivity in detecting DVR and R1 differences between CN and CI groups, and this hypothesis will be tested in the ongoing project.

Our theoretical and data analysis confirmed the ROI TAC-based DVR estimates from the Logan plot are comparable to those from the SRTM2 in the kinetic modeling of low or negligible noise levels of ROI TACs. The noise-induced underestimation in the DVR images from the Logan plot is also comparable to those obtained from SRTM2 for conventional weighted linear regression. The DVR images generated from the centrum semiovale-based SRTM2 with LRSC algorithm provided negligible noise-induced underestimation and the highest statistical power to distinguish the DVRs of cognitively impaired individuals from cognitively normal older adults. Similar to the findings in our previous 11C-PiB dynamic PET study [73], cerebellum-based SUVRLP overestimated DVR inconsistently (Fig 2a) but not for centrum semiovale–based SUVRLP (Fig 2b). This could be mainly due to the fact that centrum semiovale–based SUVR TACs in tau positive ROIs reached a plateau earlier than cerebellum-based SUVR during study period (Fig 1). Both ROI TAC and voxelwise kinetic analyses suggest the use of centrum semiovale–based SUVRLP to approximate DVR, and cerebellum–based SUVREP to approximate R1 to simplify dynamic PET acquisition and quantification.

The difference in the statistical power of DVR, R1, and SUVR measurements to distinguish cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals are dependent on sample size, ROIs, and noise levels in the PET images. We would expect that the differences in statistical power between cerebellum and centrum semiovale reference tissue based PET quantification decreases as sample size increases. As many of the risk factors in AD (e.g., sex, APOE status, and age) are associated with brain tau deposition, high biological and physiological heterogeneity [56, 74–76], and time and financial burden in acquiring PET scans, robust and objective-specific quantitative PET measurements are needed for clinical diagnosis, monitoring and evaluation of therapeutic treatment.

In conclusion, calculations of DVR and SUVRLP using the centrum semiovale reference tissue compared to using cerebellum as a reference tissue provided higher statistical power to detect the differences between CN and CI groups. In contrast, using the cerebellum as a reference tissue to calculate R1 and SUVREP provided greater sensitivity to detect the two group’s differences than using the centrum semiovale reference tissue. The LRSC parametric imaging algorithm remarkably reduced the noise-induced underestimation in DVR images generated by the SRTM2 and the Logan plot. Our study supports an improved approach for brain tau PET precision imaging in studies of AD.

Fig. 2 Bland-Altman plots for the estimates of SUVRLP versus DVR and SUVREP versus R1. SUVRLP was calculated in the late phase (80–105 min) while SUVREP was calculated at the early phase (0.7–2.9 min). DVR and R1 were obtained by fitting the SRTM2 model to the ROI TACs measured from the 105-min dynamic PET data.

Fig. 3 Parametric images of DVR were generated by the Logan plots ( t* = 50 min ), the SRTM2 using linear regression (LR), and linear regression without and with the spatially-constrained (LRSC) algorithm with 3-dimensional Gaussian filters with FWHM varying from 3 mm to 15 mm, where the spatial resolution of reconstructed PET image is 5.8 mm FWHM. The Logan plots were determined by Eq. 5 and Eq. 7 for linear regression (LR) and linear regression without and with spatial constraint (LRSC), respectively.

Fig. 4 Noise-induced underestimation in the DVR images generated by the Logan plot and SRTM2 by weighted linear regression. The Bias% = 100*(DVR(ROI TAC)-DVR(ROI parametric image))/ DVR(ROI TAC). The means and standard deviations were calculated from the DVR for CN and CI groups for 30 ROIs.

Fig. 5 Cohen’s d images were calculated from parametric images of cerebellum and centrum semiovale reference tissue-based DVR and R1, where d(DVR)=mean(DVR(CI group))-mean(DVR(CN group)/SD(pooled), and d(R1)=mean(R1(CN group))-mean(R1(CI group)/SD(pooled), for display purpose.

Fig. 6 Mean images of R1 and DVR for cognitive normal (CN) and impaired groups (CI) (a, b) and negative correlations between ROI estimates of DVR and R1 in CI group (c, d, e). The R1 and DVR images were generated from 18F-Flortaucipir dynamic PET using optimal noninvasive parametric imaging method: a simplified reference tissue model and linear regression with spatially constrained parametric imaging algorithm and parametric-specific reference tissue. Cerebellum gray matter and centrum semiovale were used as reference tissue input for R1 and DVR, respectively, for ROI TAC based kinetic modeling and parametric imaging.
