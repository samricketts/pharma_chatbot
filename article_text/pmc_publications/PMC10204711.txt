Background:

An increasing number of experimental and clinical studies show a link between Alzheimer’s disease and heart diseases such as heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and atrial fibrillation. However, the mechanisms underlying the potential role of Aβ in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease remain unknown. We have recently shown the effects of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 on cell viability and mitochondrial function in cardiomyocytes and coronary artery endothelial cells.

Objective:

In this study, we investigated the effects of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 on the metabolism of cardiomyocytes and coronary artery endothelial cells.

Methods:

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze metabolomic profiles of cardiomyocytes and coronary artery endothelial cells treated with Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42. In addition, we determined mitochondrial respiration and lipid peroxidation in these cells.

Results:

We found that the metabolism of different amino acids was affected by Aβ1–42 in each cell type, whereas the fatty acid metabolism is consistently disrupted in both types of cells. Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased, whereas mitochondrial respiration was reduced in both cell types in response to Aβ1–42.

Conclusion:

This study revealed the disruptive effects of Aβ on lipid metabolism and mitochondria function in cardiac cells.

pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia that affects many people in the United States and worldwide [1]. AD is a multifactorial disease mainly characterized by neuritic plaques due to the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregates and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. These changes are associated with the loss of synapses and neurons, oxidative stress, inflammation, energy and lipid metabolism alterations, and morphological changes in the brain [2, 3]. Structural and functional changes develop in the AD brain due to the dysregulation of different metabolic pathways. There is a crosstalk between various metabolic changes and intracellular processes, and the biological heterogeneity of these alterations is affected by intra- and extracellular factors in the AD brain [4, 5].

In addition to the brain, numerous studies demonstrate the adverse effects of AD on metabolism and function in other organs/tissues. There is a link between heart diseases, particularly heart failure, and AD development [6]. Brain hypoperfusion and hypoxia due to cardiac dysfunction can increase brain oxidative stress and acidosis, leading to Aβ aggregation and AD progression [7, 8]. However, it is not clear whether AD and the accumulation of Aβ aggregates can induce cardiac abnormalities. Interestingly, the AD brain and the failing heart share similar risk factors and some common biochemical and genetic features [9, 10]. Aβ aggregates were identified in the hearts of patients with heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy [9, 11, 12]. Blood levels of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were connected to heart failure in patients without AD in an extensive study, which included 4,156 participants of the population-based who had no established dementia at baseline [13]. Circulating Aβ1–40 levels could predict clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure, while special measures to specifically exclude AD were not applied [14].

On the other hand, experiments with brain ischemia and coagulation showed that Aβ rapidly accumulates after coagulation in nearby blood vessels and then spreads to surrounding tissue, while APP released from platelets can be a major source found around damaged vessels [15, 16]. Similarly, Aβ may be produced during coagulation and ischemia in the myocardium, and its concentration in plasma may predict the severity of heart failure and underline pathological processes. Furthermore, Aβ release and accumulation in the heart may act as an additional damaging factor preventing the regeneration of the myocardium and post-infarction recovery of the heart. Interestingly, Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were found in the hearts of patients with AD who developed diastolic heart failure [11]. However, the causative role of AD in developing heart amyloidosis and cardiac dysfunction remains unknown.

One of the potential mechanisms underlying AD-induced cardiac abnormalities can be associated with detrimental effects of Aβ aggregates at cellular and subcellular levels. Intra- and extracellular effects of Aβ aggregates can modulate different metabolic pathways and, thus, induce functional and structural changes in cardiomyocytes. Although several studies investigated proteomic changes in the brain of AD patients [17, 18], only a few studies elucidated the effects of AD or Aβ aggregates on the metabolomic profile of the heart. In this study, we investigated the impact of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 on metabolomic profiles of cultured cardiomyocytes and coronary artery endothelial cells. Results demonstrated that Aβ1–42 disrupts the metabolism of amino acids, whereas Aβ1–40 has no effects in both types of cardiac cells. Moreover, the metabolism of fatty acids was consistently disrupted in the presence of Aβ1–42 in both cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. In addition to the metabolic alterations, Aβ1–42 increased lipid peroxidation and diminished mitochondrial respiration in the cells.

Materials and Methods

Primary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC)

Primary HCAEC were cultured according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (ATCC) as described earlier [19]. Briefly, the cells were cultured in Vascular Cell Basal Media supplemented with a VEGF-based Endothelial Cell Growth Kit (5 ng/mL rh VEGF, 5 ng/mL rh EGF, 5 ng/mL rh FGF, 15 ng/mL rh IGF-1, 10 mM L-glutamine, 0.75 units/mL heparin sulfate, 1 μg/mL hydrocortisone, 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid, 2% fetal bovine serum, ATCC) and 1% antibiotic solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells with less than 80% confluence from passages 3–8 and less than 14 divisions were used in experiments.

H9c2 cardiomyoblasts

H9c2 cardiomyoblasts were cultured according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (ATCC) as previously described [20]. Briefly, the cells were cultured in modified DMEM (4 mM L-glutamine, 4.5 g/L glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were maintained in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells within 80–90% confluence from passages 3–10 were used in experiments.

Permeabilization of cells

For analysis of mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (OCR), primary HCAEC and H9c2 cardiomyoblasts were freshly harvested using trypsin-EDTA and then permeabilized for 10 min on ice in the sucrose buffer (300 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) containing 50 μg/mL saponin. After the permeabilization, cells were washed with equilibration buffer (100 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 μM EGTA, pH 7.4) and then resuspended in the incubation buffer (200 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-MOPS, 5 mM α-ketoglutarate, 2 mM malate, 1 mM Pi, 10 μM EGTA-Tris, pH 7.4). We have previously shown that the structural and functional integrity remains intact upon permeabilization with saponin [21].

Oligomerization of Aβ peptides and treatment groups

The Aβ peptides Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and Bon Opus Biosciences were prepared as described previously [19, 22]. First, lyophilized amyloid peptides were dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) to 1 mM. After the peptides were monomerized entirely, they were lyophilized and re-dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to 10 mM, then diluted to 1 mM by adding deionized water. The peptides were diluted in culture media to 0.2 mM and incubated at 4 °C for 48 h to form oligomers, which were then applied to cultured cells at a final concentration of 10 μM [23]. Low-binding surface plastic wares were used to prepare the amyloid peptides. To treat H9c2 cells, media was changed to serum-free media, Aβ peptides were added, and incubated for 48 h. To treat primary HCAEC, Aβ peptides were added and incubated for 48 h in the unmodified growth media (Vascular Cell Basal Media supplemented with VEGF-based Endothelial Cell Growth Kit, ATCC).

Cellular oxygen consumption assay

Oxygen consumptions were measured using 50 μM palladium(II)-coproporphyrin I (Frontier Specialty Chemicals, Logan, UT) based on Vanderkooi et al. [24] with modifications. Oligomycin-sensitive oxygen consumption rates were compared using the saponin-permeabilized cells in the presence or absence of 1 mM ADP in the incubation buffer (200 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-MOPS, 5 mM α-ketoglutarate, 2 mM malate, 1 mM Pi, 10 μM EGTA-Tris, pH 7.4). The reaction chambers were sealed with pre-warmed mineral oil (MilliporeSigma). Fluorescence quenching of palladium(II)-coproporphyrin I (excitation: 385–40; emission: 670–20) by dissolved dioxygen was monitored for 30–40 min at 37°C. Fluorescence signals were measured using a CLARIOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Glucose oxidase and glucose were used as oxygen-depleted standards. The respiratory control index was calculated as a ratio of respiration rates in the presence of ADP (state 3) to the absence of ADP (state 2). Data were normalized to the control samples at state 3.

Cellular lipid peroxidation assay

Lipid peroxidation was analyzed using BODIPY-C11 581/591 according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Thermo Fisher). The ratio between two individual spectra (excitation: 477–35, emission: 530–40, and excitation: 565–30, emission: 600–30) was measured in live cells using a CLARIOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Cells treated with 100 μM tert-butyl hydroperoxide were used as the references.

Metabolomic analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)

Cellular metabolites were extracted from H9c2 cardioblasts and HCAEC and processed for GC-MS analysis as previously described [25, 26]. Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold saline buffer, and samples were extracted with a cold mixture of methanol/H2O (85:15). Then, samples went through a series of steps involving sonication and centrifugation to obtain a final supernatant sample. Supernatants were evaporated using RapidVap® N2/48 Evaporation System (Labconco). For the first derivatization, methoxyamination was performed by incubating all samples at 37 °C for 2 h with 30 μL of methoxyamine hydrochloride (20 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich). Trimethylsilylation was achieved by incubating the samples for 1 h at 65 °C in the presence of 30 μL of N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (Sigma-Aldrich). Then, the metabolite samples were centrifuged at room temperature, and supernatants were transferred to analytical vials. Finally, 20 μL of each sample was mixed with 1 mM 2-fluorobiphenyl as an internal standard (Sigma-Aldrich) and subsequently processed by GC-MS-QP2010 (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments).

Data processing and bioinformatics

The collected unprocessed data was refined using GC-MS Labsolution Postrun Analysis software (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments), by which all the metabolites were identified utilizing the database (NIST14/2014/EPA/NIH). In a final list, 36 and 39 metabolites were identified in H9c2 cardioblasts and HCAEC, respectively. The metabolites of each sample were quantified and converted to mM based on the internal standard concentration. A table in comma-delimited (*.csv) was uploaded to the MetaboAnalyst platform [27] for statistics, and the results were normalized to cell number calculated previously and range scaled. The heatmap plots were generated using the MetaboAnalyst (5.0) platform for each type of cardiac cell, where the different conditions were structured in dendrograms employing a hierarchical fashion via the Wards method. Multivariate analysis between the control and the treatment groups for each type of cell was performed by the default parameters of MetaboAnalyst of one-way ANOVA with Fisher’s LSD post-hoc test.

Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed using Student’s t-test and ANOVA followed by Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (Tukey’s HSD) post-hoc analysis. Results are presented as mean ± SEM. p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The number of biological samples but not technical replicates was used as a sample size.

Results

Identification of metabolites

We elucidated the effects of amyloid peptides in vitro on the metabolomic profile of H9c2 cardiomyocytes and HCAEC. To identify and quantify cellular metabolites, cell lysates obtained from the cells after incubation with or without 10 μM Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 for 48 h were processed through GC-MS. A total of 36 and 39 metabolites were identified in H9c2 cardioblasts and HCAEC, respectively. The characterization of each identified metabolite was presented previously [26]. Information regarding the statistics that include the p values and fold changes is given in Tables 1 and 2.

The results acquired from the univariate analysis of all metabolite concentrations are depicted in the heatmap (Figures 1A, 2A) based on the intensity of the color as discrete variables (−1 to 1). Two superior clusters were identified based on group similarities. The first column represents the control group, the second is the Aβ1–40 group, and the third is the Aβ1–42 group.

Effect of amyloid peptides on cell metabolites

Analysis of amino acids in H9c2 cardioblasts demonstrated that Aβ1–42 significantly reduced L-alanine, L-glutamic acid, L-methionine, and L-threonine levels (Figure 1A,B) with no effects on the rest of the amino acids. Likewise, the levels of L-aspartic acid, L-phenylalanine, and L-tyrosine were lower in Aβ1–42-treated H9c2 cells compared to the control; however, the differences were not statistically significant. In contrast, Aβ1–42 increased 14 amino acids, with substantial effects on L-aspartic acid (59%, p&lt;0.05) and L-glutamine (55%, p&lt;0.01) in HCAEC. Aβ1–42 decreased methionine and threonine levels in both cell types, but the decrements were statistically significant only in H9c2 cardiomyocytes (Figures 1A, 2A, Tables 1, 2).

Changes in fatty acids showed similar trends in H9c2 cardioblasts and HCAEC. In both types of cardiac cells, myristic acid (14:0) was significantly reduced by Aβ1–42 (H9c2 cells: by 33%; HCAEC: by 29%, p&lt;0.01 for both). Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 decreased palmitic acid (16:0) levels by 32% and 46% (p&lt;0.05 for both), respectively, in H9c2 cardioblasts; however, their effects were not observed in HCAEC. Stearic acid (18:0) and oleic acid (18:1) were significantly decreased in both types of cells by the Aβ1–42 treatment. In addition, Aβ1–42 reduced glycerol in H9c2 cells by 37% (p&lt;0.01) (Figures 1C, 2C, Tables 1, 2).

In H9c2 cells, the levels of fumaric acid (2-butenedioic acid), citric acid, and hypoxanthine (a purine derivative) were significantly decreased by 26% (p&lt;0.01), 15% (p&lt;0.01), and 67% (p&lt;0.05), respectively. In contrast, lactic acid was increased by 32% (p&lt;0.05) in the presence of Aβ1–42. The latter reduced the levels of L-pyroglutamic acid (an intermediate in the γ-glutamyl cycle involved in glutathione metabolism) and suberic acid (a breakdown product of oleic acid) by 32% and 46%, respectively. Still, the differences were not statistically significant (Figure 1D, Table 1). In HCAEC, only urea showed a 17% (p&lt;0.05 for both) reduction by both Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42. Although fumaric acid (14%), malic acid (55%), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5, 13%), and suberic acid (29%) levels were lower in Aβ1–42-treated cells compared to control, the differences were not statistically significant. Likewise, in both cell types, fumaric acid, suberic acid, and urea showed a noticeable reduction (Figure 2D, Table 2).

Effect of amyloid peptides on lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial respiration

Considering the effects of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 on several fatty acids in both cardiac cell types, we then examined lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial respiration in the presence of the amyloid peptides. In both cell types, Aβ1–42-treated cells showed a significant increase of lipid peroxidation in live cells in contrast to the Aβ1–40, which did not exert any noticeable changes. Tert-butyl hydroperoxide, an organic peroxide used as a positive control, increased lipid peroxidation in H9c2 cardioblasts and HCAEC, respectively, by 62% and 81% (p&lt;0.01 for both). Similarly, Aβ1–42 markedly increased lipid peroxidation in H9c2 cardioblasts (by 34%; p&lt;0.05) and HCAEC (by 63%; p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3A,B).

Analysis of mitochondrial respiratory function demonstrated that Aβ1–40 had no significant effects on state 2 and state 3 respiration rates in H9c2 cells and HCAEC. Interestingly, state 2 and state 3 were even higher in Aβ1–40-treated HCAEC than in control, but not statistically significant (Figure 4A,B). However, Aβ1–42 decreased the state 3 respiration rate in H9c2 cells and HCAEC by 48% and 42% (p&lt;0.05 for both), respectively, compared to the control. As a result, Aβ1–42 reduced the respiratory control index, an index of coupling between respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, by 33% (p&lt;0.05) and 60% (p&lt;0.05) in H9c2 cells and HCAEC, respectively. Aβ1–40 significantly decreased the respiratory control index (34%, p&lt;0.05) in HCAEC and had no effect in H9c2 cells (Figures 4C,D).

Discussion

The results of this study demonstrate the effects of the amyloid peptides Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 on two types of cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells). We found that the effects of Aβ1–42 on both cell types were more significant than Aβ1–40. Particularly, Aβ1–42 disrupted fatty acid metabolism in both cell types, diminished mitochondrial respiration, and enhanced lipid peroxidation.

Advances in metabolomics have demonstrated the complexity of dynamic change related to AD progression. This complexity highlights the challenges posed by developing effective therapeutic interventions and defining system-level changes that can provide insight into the disease mechanisms of AD [28]. It has been found that intracellular Aβ induces profound changes in the omics landscape of neurons associated with inflammation and metabolic reprogramming in which cells are prone to death through oxytosis/ferroptosis-regulated death pathways. In particular, the degenerative processes included substantial changes in glucose metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics [29]. Most studies uncovering the effect of Aβ on cell metabolism have been done in the brain, so the mechanism of Aβ production and its possible effects on the heart are unknown.

Unbiased lipidomics and metabolomics approaches were used to analyze tissue metabolites in the postmortem frontal cortex obtained from patients with AD and age- and gender-matched control groups [30]. The study revealed that thirty-four significantly altered metabolites that distinguished AD patients from the control group were involved in the metabolism of alanine, arginine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glycine, methionine, proline, purine, serine, and threonine as well as biosynthesis of pantothenate and CoA. Among them, significant regulatory disorders of aspartate and glutamate metabolism were also confirmed by mass spectrometry imaging experiments [30]. In our study, we also observed changes in intermediates involved in the TCA cycle such as glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate by Aβ1–42, that could lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. In line with this, we have previously shown that Aβ1–42 had adverse effects on mitochondrial function in both H9c2 cardioblasts and HCAEC, as evidenced by increased mitochondrial ROS and reduced membrane potential and calcium retention capacity of mitochondria [19]. Likewise, Aβ1–42 had adverse effects (high ROS production and low membrane potential) on mitochondria isolated from rat hearts. The observed mitochondrial abnormalities were associated with an increased caspase 3/7 activity in both types of cells suggesting that Aβ1–42 stimulates apoptosis in cardiac cells [19].

Mitochondrial abnormalities and, as a result, alterations in cardiac energy metabolism could be involved in cardiac dysfunction observed in AD patients [11]. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis of heart failure [31], which has similarities to the AD brain risk factors and metabolic characteristics [9]. Furthermore, analysis of tissue samples of patients with heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy revealed Aβ aggregates in the heart [9, 11]. Our in vivo studies demonstrated the accumulation of Aβ in rat hearts during myocardial infarction (Supplementary Material). These studies suggested that Aβ can affect both cardiomyocytes and coronary endothelial cells.

Changes in the levels of as aspartate, glutamate, citrate, and malate in frontal cortex samples of AD subjects, as well as the accumulation of N-acetylaspartate, pyruvate, serine, and lactate, suggest that the mechanisms responsible for the transport of metabolites between mitochondria and cytosol may be impaired in the AD brains [30]. Metabolic disturbances induced by AD have been found in many tissues and biofluids, suggesting that the disease can affect numerous organs and systems beyond the central nervous system [32, 33]. Analysis of metabolomics and lipidomics biomarker profiles revealed several factors responsible for AD pathophysiology, where impaired lipid homeostasis was identified as a critical component [34].

Whiley and coauthors [35] disclosed reduced plasma concentrations of three distinct phosphatidylcholines (16:0/20:5, 16:0/22:6, and 18:0/22:6) in AD patients and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus age-matched controls. Significant decreases in stearic acid (18:0) were seen in the plasma from AD and MCI groups compared to the control group [36]. There is a consensus that impaired lipid homeostasis is the most constantly dysregulated molecular pathway in AD [33, 37–41].

Palmitate (16:0), the main product of the fatty acid synthase system in animal cells, is the precursor of other long-chain fatty acids. It may be lengthened to form stearate (18:0) or even longer saturated fatty acids through the action of fatty acid elongation systems in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria [42]. Mitochondrial pathways of fatty acid chain elongation and desaturation are crucial for mitochondrial structure and function that is often overlooked given the lack of studies in this area [43]. Our current (Figure 3) and previous studies [19] demonstrate that Aβ1–42 increases lipid peroxidation and induces mitochondrial dysfunction, which may diminish fatty acids’ elongation and unsaturation. This can cause a negative feedback loop not only because these fatty acids are energy sources but also because of their critical role as major structural components of cell membranes, including mitochondrial membranes. Notably, the synthesis of cardiolipin, a signature phospholipid that is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane, requires unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, most of which cannot be synthesized by animals. Cardiolipin profile changes have been associated with early synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction in AD [44]. In addition, high dietary intake of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a lower risk for AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD) in epidemiological and clinical research studies [45].

Interestingly, a high intake of saturated fatty acids was inversely associated with the risk of developing AD, and no evidence of a protective effect of n-3 fatty acids against dementia was found. The results remained unchanged if the competing risk from mortality was considered [46]. The levels of total fatty acids were 27% lower in the plasma of AD patients relative to controls, which was reflected almost uniformly in all specific fatty acids in AD [47]. Unsaturated fatty acid metabolism is significantly dysregulated in the brains of patients with varying degrees of AD pathology [48]. APOE ε4, one variant of apolipoprotein E, is known to increase the risk of AD significantly, and APOE polymorphism is an essential determinant in the interindividual variations of lipids in healthy subjects in various populations [49].

In conclusion, this study uncovers the adverse effects of Aβ, particularly Aβ1–42, on cultured cardiomyocytes and coronary artery endothelial cells, including alteration of fatty acid metabolism, increased lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Like neurons and cerebral endothelial cells, mitochondrial disruptions in cardiac cells might stimulate the aggravated feedback loop of lipid peroxidation and fatty acid shortage, leading to cell senescence and death. This study opens new perspectives in uncovering the potential mechanisms of the detrimental effects of Aβ on heart function.
