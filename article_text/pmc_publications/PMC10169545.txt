INTRODUCTION:

One-year healthcare costs associated with delirium in older hospitalized patients with and without Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) have not been examined previously.

METHODS:

Medicare costs were determined prospectively at discharge, 30-, 90- and 365-days in a cohort (n=311) of older adults following hospital admission.

RESULTS:

76 (24%) patients had ADRD and were more likely to develop delirium (51% vs. 24%, p&lt;0.001) and die within one year (38% vs. 21%, p=0.002). In ADRD patients with vs. without delirium, adjusted mean difference in costs associated with delirium were $34,828; most of the excess costs were incurred between 90-365 days (p=0.03). In non-ADRD patients, delirium was associated with increased costs at all timepoints. Excess costs associated with delirium in ADRD patients increased progressively over one year, whereas in non-ADRD patients the increase was consistent across time periods.

DISCUSSION:

Our findings highlight the complexity of healthcare costs for ADRD patients who develop delirium, a potentially preventable source of expenditures.

pmcBackground

Dementia is a neurodegenerative syndrome and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) cause progressive decline in cognitive function.1,2 It is estimated that by the year 2050, 13.8 million older adults in the United States will have a diagnosis of ADRD,3 with associated healthcare costs ranging from $269-358 billion annually.4,5 ADRD is associated with life-altering consequences for patients and families. Thus, preventing reversible contributors to ADRD, such as delirium, has assumed an important role in the medical approach to ADRD.3

Delirium occurs in 13-19% of community dwelling and 40-89% of hospitalized older adults with ADRD.6 Delirium superimposed on ADRD is associated with poor outcomes, including increased mortality, longer hospital stays, and subsequent functional decline.7,8 Increased costs associated with delirium have been well-recognized,9 contributing $38-152 billion in excess healthcare costs per year in older medical patients,10,11 and &gt;$33 billion (95% CI, $25.7 billion-$42.2 billion) per year12 in older surgical patients. These costs rival those associated with cancer and diabetes.13 While delirium increases costs overall, the impact of delirium on costs in persons with ADRD has not been previously well-examined.

Healthcare costs in ADRD are nuanced and complex. Overall, healthcare utilization and costs are higher among persons with ADRD compared to those without. In particular, increased costs have been demonstrated for hospital care,14,15 nursing home,16 home care,17-19 and end of life care.5,20-22 However, decreased costs have been demonstrated in ADRD for critical care,23 mechanical ventilation,23 elective surgery,24 cancer evaluation,25 and preventive care.26 In some cases, these decreases may be appropriate and aligned with goals for care. However, both inappropriate over-utilization and under-utilization of healthcare have been demonstrated in persons with ADRD.15,26

For the present study, our goal was to describe the total direct healthcare costs associated with an incident diagnosis of delirium in hospitalized patients with and without ADRD from a healthcare system perspective. We first evaluated total healthcare costs associated with ADRD during an index hospitalization and through one-year after discharge, with the hypothesis that ADRD patients would have greater costs over the one-year period compared to non-ADRD patients. We then evaluated period-specific healthcare costs associated with delirium in ADRD vs. non-ADRD patients during index hospitalization, 30 days, 90 days and one-year after discharge. We also evaluated total healthcare costs associated with delirium severity in ADRD vs. non-ADRD patients from index hospitalization through one-year after discharge. We examined both cumulative and period-specific costs, and examined specific cost categories where possible, including acute hospital care, preventive care, home healthcare, etc. We hypothesized that incident delirium and increasing delirium severity among ADRD patients would be associated with higher healthcare costs compared to non-ADRD patients. Given our limited sample size, we considered this an exploratory study.

Methods

Study Sample: Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

The Better Assessment of Illness (BASIL) study is a prospective cohort study of older adults hospitalized for a variety of general medicine issues at a large teaching hospital, designed to study delirium, delirium severity, ADRD and associated clinical outcomes. BASIL study procedures were described previously.27,28 Briefly, 352 patients were enrolled from October 20, 2015 through March 15, 2017. Inclusion criteria were patients 70 years and older, English speaking, emergency or elective admissions, and living within 40 miles of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC; Boston, Massachusetts). Exclusion criteria included legal blindness, severe deafness, active alcohol abuse, alcohol withdrawal within 6 months, schizophrenia or active psychosis, nonverbal condition, immediate discharge plans, or imminent death.

Seven-hundred and sixty-eight eligible patients were approached, 469 patients were screened and ultimately 352 patients enrolled. For this cost study, we excluded patients with no claims data due to enrollment in a Medicare managed care plan (n=41), resulting in a final sample of 311 patients (Appendix Figure 1). The conceptual framework for our study analyses, along with the analytic subgroups included in analyses is presented in Appendix Figure 2. All study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of BIDMC and Hebrew SeniorLife, the study coordinating center.

Data Collection

Index hospitalization was defined as the hospital admission at which time point participants were recruited to this prospective cohort study. Participants and caregivers were interviewed within 48 hours after hospital admission. Detailed demographic characteristics, cognitive functioning and assessments of basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL, IADL)29,30 were collected. For these analyses, ADL and IADL were used as sum scores, and clinical-reported outcomes were not used. Family caregivers were interviewed and the proxy Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE)31 was completed, a validated assessment for dementia based on proxy-reported changes over a ten year timeframe. A trained research physician (GX) conducted detailed medical record review for information on the index hospitalization, including medical diagnoses, comorbidities, and surgical procedures. The Charlson Comorbidity Index28,52 was estimated from comprehensive diagnosis listings abstracted during medical record review, and used to control for multi-morbidity and disease severity in adjusted analyses.

Determination of ADRD Status

All participants in the original cohort (n=352) were determined to have ADRD or no ADRD at study enrollment according to a previously published clinical consensus process.32 It is important to note that ADRD status in this study was not based on codes or diagnoses from claims data. We assigned a diagnosis of probable dementia if a participant met any of the following criteria: (1) Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) ≥3.2;31,33 (2) documentation of dementia by International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes; or (3) impairment on any of three cognitive tests: Montreal Cognitive Assessment &lt;26;34,35 brief cognitive screen &lt;14/16;28,36 or MoCA delayed recall of ≤2. ICD-10 codes were Alzheimer's disease (G30.9); other Alzheimer's disease (G30.8); other frontotemporal dementia (G31.09); dementia with Lewy bodies (G31.83); vascular dementia (F01.50); unspecified dementia (F03.90); and dementia in other diseases (F02.80). Given the variable documentation of dementia, we included the majority of possible etiologies for cognitive impairment under the category of ADRD, such as non-specified dementia, frontotemporal dementia, amnestic and non-amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and non-specified cognitive impairment.27 Of the 352 original patients, 149 participants met these criteria, moving forward to chart review (see below), conducted only to clarify ADRD status. One-hundred and fifty-five participants from the total original cohort of 352 did not meet any of the above criteria and were thus categorized as non-ADRD. An additional 48 patients had uncertain cognitive status (e.g., missing data from IQCODE or cognitive testing) and were also included in the chart review; thus, 197 charts were reviewed.

The ADRD chart review process extracted relevant medications which were widely used in persons with cognitive impairment (cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, vitamin E), neuroimaging studies, provider notes (inpatient and outpatient) documenting a diagnostic evaluation for ADRD or memory loss, or formal neuropsychological evaluation. Based on these data, participants were classified as ADRD or non-ADRD by 2 expert clinicians (TGF, TTH). For cases with lack of agreement or limited chart documentation (n=24), available study data were further adjudicated by an interdisciplinary expert panel of physicians with expertise in dementia (TGF, TTH, SKI, and ERM) until consensus was reached.28,37

Assessment of delirium and delirium severity

Delirium was assessed daily during index hospitalization using brief cognitive testing,28,36 Delirium Symptom Interview (DSI),38 and interviews with family and nurses. Delirium was determined using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)39 supplemented by a validated chart review method.40,41 CAM is a standardized approach with high sensitivity (94-100%) and specificity (90-95%), and high inter-rater reliability (kappa = 0.92).42-44 Delirium severity was measured with the CAM-Severity (CAM-S) score long-form (scored 0-19, 19=most severe).45 The highest value of CAM-S during hospitalization, Peak CAM-S, was used as the measure of delirium severity for these analyses, categorized into three severity groups using established cut-points: none-mild (0-2 points), moderate (3-8 points), and severe (9-14 points).12,46,47

Healthcare costs

We calculated cumulative total direct healthcare costs for the index hospitalization and for 30-days, 90-days, and one-year after discharge from a bottom-up perspective.9 Following established procedures,12 total costs during the index hospitalization and at 30-days, 90-days, and one-year after hospital discharge were determined from Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR). Period-specific costs were computed for the time periods between discharge to 30-days, 30 to 90-days, and 90-days to one-year. Additionally, cumulative and period-specific costs were calculated for individual healthcare cost categories, described below.

The total cost calculations were based on Medicare Part A and B administrative claims, including MEDPAR, Outpatient (Fee-for-Service), and Home Health Agency (Fee-for-Service) files, acquired for 2014-2018. MEDPAR data includes inpatient hospital, surgery, readmissions, and skilled post-acute rehabilitation stays covered by Medicare. Outpatient data includes fee-for-service claims billed by institutional outpatient providers, and includes office visits, preventive care, and hemodialysis. Home healthcare costs included home health agency services covered by Medicare home health agency providers (nursing, physical therapy, aides, etc.). We further examined costs derived from the Cost and Utilization segment of the Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF), which contained summarized annual payments for services such as hospice, Durable Medical Equipment (DME), outpatient visits, ambulatory surgery, and dialysis. The MBSF costs were considered separately for outpatient costs (including outpatient physician visits, ambulatory surgery, and dialysis) and home healthcare (including formal home healthcare services, hospice and DME) in Appendix Table 4. Costs were calculated using Medicare reimbursed amounts rather than charges, since reimbursed amounts represent actual payments received by providers and are considered better measures of transaction prices than billed charges. All costs are reported in 2020 dollars, adjusting for inflation using the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index.10-12

Statistical Analyses

For baseline characteristics, we compared delirium and non-delirium groups using the ANOVA test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. We used standard statistics to compare ADRD and non-ADRD groups on hospital factors, including length of stay and mortality. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were used to assess the cost data. Adjusted mean total costs were estimated with GLM assuming gamma-distributed costs and a log link function. All covariables were mean-centered. Model estimated cumulative adjusted mean total costs from index hospitalization through discharge were first estimated, then similarly calculated for each time period. The excess cumulative costs associated with incident delirium and delirium severity among ADRD patients and non-ADRD patients were calculated as mean cost differences from the adjusted models with 95% confidence intervals derived from standard error estimates. For the delirium severity analyses, we stratified by delirium severity categories, ranging from none-mild delirium (peak CAM-S score 0-2), to moderate delirium (peak CAM-S score 3-8), to severe delirium (peak CAM-S score 9-14), groupings used in prior publications.37,45,47 Overall, our study was powered to detect a difference in cost of 20% ($16,918) between ADRD vs. non-ADRD patients. Minimum detectable effect sizes for all our subgroups (ADRD with vs. without delirium, and non-ADRD with vs. without delirium are presented in Appendix Table 2.

Survival Analysis

The BASIL cohort had a mortality rate of 26%, implying that the costs may be right-censored. Thus, ADRD patients may cost less because they die earlier than non-ADRD patients on average. To address this concern, a partitioned estimator approach used previously11 was applied for survival analysis. First, we divided the one-year study period into one-month time intervals and calculated average total costs in each month for delirium patients and non-delirium patients in both ADRD and non-ADRD samples among the patients who survived to the end of the month. The monthly average total costs were calculated using the GLM model. Next, we used a Cox proportional hazards model to compute Kaplan-Meier estimators for surviving to the end of each month. We then applied Kaplan-Meier estimators as inverse probability weights to sum costs across months.

Extrapolated National Costs

We extrapolated to national healthcare costs associated with delirium by determining the total population of 65 years and older with ADRD in the United States.1,3 We factored in the total number of ADRD patients hospitalized per year and the rate of delirium superimposed on dementia (Appendix Figure 3). Using the data analyses from this study, we extrapolated to nationally the estimated cost per year of caring for patients with ADRD and delirium. It is important to note that these extrapolations are specific to Medicare patients in the US.

Analyses were conducted with SAS Version 9.4 for the Medicare data files and STATA Version 15 for all statistical analyses; p&lt;0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance.

Results

Characteristics and outcomes of the 311 BASIL participants are presented in Table 1. Of the 311 participants, 76 (24%) were determined to have ADRD. We also compared the excluded sample (n=41) to the final sample (n=311) and found them to be similar in baseline characteristics (Appendix Table 1); however, we could not examine nursing home stay and total healthcare costs prior to hospitalization for the excluded sample since Medicare data were not available.

On average, among the 311 participants, patients with ADRD were older (81.8 vs. 79.8 years, p=0.02) and less likely to undergo a surgical procedure (16% vs. 32%, p=0.005) during index hospitalization than those without ADRD. We utilized pre-index Medicare data to verify that ADRD patients did not have greater healthcare costs during the year prior to the index admission date compared with non-ADRD patients; ADRD patients had on average $45,860 in total healthcare costs vs. $51,388 (p=0.58) without ADRD (Table 1). Twenty-five percent of these ADRD patients had a nursing home stay in the 365 days prior to index hospitalization compared to 24% without ADRD (p=0.72) (Table 1). Patients with ADRD were significantly more likely to develop delirium during index hospitalization (51% vs. 24%, p&lt;0.001) and more likely to die within 365 days after discharge (38% vs. 21%, p=0.002) compared to those without ADRD (Table 1). Appendix Figure 2 is a conceptual flow diagram of the cost analyses performed in this study.

Cumulative healthcare costs.

Adjusted cumulative healthcare costs showed an adjusted mean difference that was $21,000 higher at one-year after discharge for patients who developed delirium during hospitalization (p=.14), and were significantly higher at 30 days ($11,403, p=.04) and 90 days ($16,313, p=.03) following discharge. Adjusted cumulative healthcare costs per patient were significantly higher for ADRD patients who developed delirium compared to ADRD patients who did not up to 365 days after index hospitalization (adjusted mean difference $34,828, p=0.05) (Table 2). The majority of increased costs for ADRD patients with delirium were incurred during the period of 90 days to 365 days after discharge, demonstrating increased longer-term costs in this timeframe (adjusted mean difference $13,838, p=0.03) (Table 2). For non-ADRD patients, delirium resulted in significantly higher healthcare costs compared with non-ADRD patients without delirium at all time points (index hospitalization, p=0.01; 30 days after, p=0.01, 90 days after, p=0.049, and one-year after, p=0.05) (Table 2). The majority of costs, however, were incurred during the index hospitalization (adjusted mean difference $14,845, p=0.01) (Table 2), demonstrating increased short-term costs in the non-ADRD group.

Mortality rates.

Given the overall mortality rate of 25% in the cohort, we examined mortality and its association with delirium and ADRD status. Overall, delirium was associated with increased mortality in the time period through 365 days after index hospitalization (31% versus 22%, p=.042). In addition, a greater percentage of ADRD patients died during the 365 days after index hospitalization compared to non-ADRD patients (38% vs. 21%, p=0.002) (Table 3). However, when stratified by ADRD status, delirium contributed to increased mortality similarly across both groups. Thus, delirium status and severe delirium [determined by peak CAM-S (long form)] were not associated with a significantly higher differential mortality among ADRD compared with non-ADRD patients across time points (Table 3).

Costs by survival analyses.

Examining average days survived, ADRD patients survived fewer days in the one-year after index hospitalization (average 287 days) compared with non-ADRD patients (average 318 days) after index hospitalization (p=0.03) (Appendix Table 3). In survival analysis, ADRD patients did not incur more costs during index hospitalization (p=0.93) compared with non-ADRD patients (Table 4). Overall, ADRD patients also did not incur significantly higher healthcare costs at 30, 90, and 365 days after index hospitalization (p=0.55, p=0.23 and p=0.91 respectively) compared with non-ADRD patients (Table 4). During hospitalization, ADRD patients with delirium did not incur significantly more costs than ADRD patients without delirium (p=0.99) (Table 4). These ADRD patients with delirium during index hospitalization incurred more costs than ADRD patients without delirium at 30, 90, and 365 days after index hospitalization, but was not statistically significant (p=0.55, p=0.18, p=0.10 respectively) (Table 4). By contrast, non-ADRD patients with delirium incurred significantly higher healthcare costs compared with non-ADRD patients without delirium at all time points from index hospitalization through one-year (adjusted mean differences of $14,845, p=0.01; $18,652, p&lt;0.001; $25,710, p&lt;0.001; $29,340, p=0.03, respectively) (Table 4). Healthcare costs associated with delirium and ADRD status (adjusted mean differences) from survival analyses are presented in Figure 1 for one-year after the index hospitalization. The excess cumulative costs associated with delirium increases progressively from 90 to 365 days for ADRD patients with delirium compared to ADRD patients without delirium but is not statistically significant. The sharpest increase is in long-term, homebased healthcare costs (Figure 1a). By contrast, the excess cumulative costs are higher to a similar degree across all time periods for non-ADRD patients with delirium compared to those without delirium (Figure 1b), and is statistically significant.

Costs by delirium severity.

For non-ADRD patients, period-specific costs increase progressively and significantly across higher severity groups as expected through one-year after discharge (Table 4). For ADRD patients, however, period-specific costs demonstrated that more severe delirium resulted in significantly less healthcare expenditures: for index hospitalization, adjusted mean costs went from $46,137 in none-mild delirium to $36,521 in moderate delirium to $18,686 in severe delirium (p=0.03). Similar trends were seen at 30 days and 90 days after discharge (p=0.001 and p=0.004 respectively). Only for one-year post-discharge costs did we see increased costs with severe delirium in ADRD but this was not statistically significant [$385,205 vs. $213,067 compared with none-mild delirium (p=0.73)] (Table 4).

Specific cost categories.

We examined categories of healthcare costs to determine their relative contributions to the increased total healthcare costs observed in delirious patients, stratified by ADRD status (Appendix Table 4). Patients with ADRD incurred more healthcare costs compared with non-ADRD patients from 90 days after discharge through 365 days, with significantly increased home healthcare costs. Long-term, homebased healthcare costs included formal home care services (nursing, physical therapy, aides), DME and hospice: mean difference between ADRD and non-ADRD patients $2,119 (p=0.02) at 90 days and $4,027 (p=0.08) at 365 days.

Discussion

In this exploratory analysis of the BASIL cohort, where approximately one quarter of patients had ADRD, we found that delirium significantly increased healthcare costs in overall analyses for 30 days and 90 days after index hospitalization (p=0.04 and 0.03 respectively). After adjusting for the high mortality rate in the ADRD group (38% at one-year) in survival analyses, ADRD patients who developed delirium did not have significantly increased healthcare costs at all time periods (30, 90, 365 days follow-up). Of note, there is potential bias since we may not have captured all of the high healthcare costs at the end of life. In survival analyses, the non-ADRD patients who developed delirium had significantly increased healthcare costs at all time periods, including the index hospitalization.11 Non-ADRD patients who developed severe delirium also had significantly increased healthcare costs at all time periods. For ADRD patients, when examining excess cumulative costs associated with delirium, costs progressively increase over one-year, with the greatest cost differences associated with delirium at one-year although this was not statistically significant. However, ADRD patients with severe delirium resulted in significantly less healthcare expenditures during index hospitalization and at 30 and 90 days after discharge. Our findings demonstrate relatively lower healthcare expenditures in ADRD patients with more severe delirium – which might potentially be appropriate and aligned with patient goals for less aggressive care (e.g., less ICU stays, less elective surgery). This trend could also potentially be due to costs that are difficult to capture by Medicare (such as longer term admissions to psychiatric facilities, anti-psychotic medications, informal caregiving). By contrast, for non-ADRD patients, our results demonstrate consistently and significantly higher costs with delirium at all time periods in a stable fashion, when compared to their counterparts who did not develop delirium (Figure 1). This is the expected pattern based on prior studies where patients with intact cognition who become delirious receive more aggressive, costly care.11 Our findings highlight the complexity of healthcare costs for ADRD patients who develop delirium and severe delirium - particularly the costly burden of long-term homebased healthcare from 30-365 days.

While limited in sample size, our study is unique in examining healthcare costs associated with delirium in ADRD patients using primary prospective data collection, and supports prior work demonstrating increased healthcare costs associated with delirium;11,12 however, the findings with ADRD are more nuanced where long-term homebased healthcare costs following delirium assume greater importance. We examined some specific types of costs, ranging from inpatient, outpatient (including preventive care), short-term rehabilitation and home healthcare – and found that delirium in ADRD patients was associated with significantly increased costs of long-term homebased healthcare (home health aide services, hospice, durable medical equipment) in the 90-365 day time period. The impact of healthcare utilization on ADRD patients and caregivers is nuanced and our study aimed to capture this complex dynamic in the real-world setting. Our study has unique strengths including rigorous follow-up over one-year, with detailed clinical information, delirium assessments and comprehensive Medicare claims-based utilization and cost data. We had complete follow-up with minimal missing data and careful adjustments for key study covariables and survival-days.

Our study has important limitations. While our Medicare data captured costs for dual eligible patients, we did not have Medicaid data, and thus, may have missed nursing home costs which were either not covered by Medicare or exceeded the 100 days of Medicare coverage. Our study sample was relatively small and derived from a single urban medical center; thus, power may be limited and the results may not generalize to other cities, regions or settings (rural vs. urban). Our findings would benefit from replication in larger samples and in different geographic regions with differences in access to medical and ADRD care. We also lacked pre-hospital assessments on the study cohort; thus, to assure comparable pre-hospital Medicare expenditures, we examined pre-index Medicare costs for hospital or nursing home hospitalization costs and nursing home days 365 days before enrollment and found no significant differences by ADRD status. For this study, ADRD status was not determined by a clinical assessment, but rather by a rigorous clinical adjudication approach based on patient and caregiver interviews, cognitive testing, detailed chart review, and expert panel consensus, described previously.27,28,37 This was done, in part, due to the fact that ADRD is underdiagnosed in Medicare claims and survey data.12 Nonetheless, there may still be bias due to non-identified ADRD and the magnitude of this bias is unknown. Another limitation is that ADRD disease stage or severity were not measured and accounted for in the analyses; our study cohort is also age 70 and above and thus, our findings may not generalize to early-onset ADRD. We did not have detailed information on many important cost categories, such as specific preventive services, medications, and palliative care. For preventive care, specifically, there were missing or very few costs in some subcategories which were thus included in outpatient costs with office visits and hemodialysis. Finally, our cost estimates included direct healthcare costs only; thus, we were unable to capture the important indirect costs of caregiver burden, private-pay expenses, and productivity losses for caregivers.

Our results suggest that total one-year healthcare costs associated with delirium in ADRD patients are approximately $51.3 billion per year extrapolating nationally (Appendix Figure 3). Thus, delirium superimposed on dementia is an important contributor to healthcare costs. Our finding is consistent with prior work and provides an important updated cost analysis for 2020.8-11 Our study shows increased costs of $34,828 (adjusted mean difference) in delirious patients with ADRD. These costs are comparatively higher than those in Kinchin et al’s systematic review where, after adjusting for inflation, the additional costs attributable to delirium were $806-$24,509 per patient per year.49 Notably, Kinchen’s study included only non-ADRD populations (surgical, medical, oncology). Thus, our study demonstrated potentially increased costs of delirium in persons with dementia, compared to those without dementia. Given the known effectiveness of multicomponent delirium prevention strategies, such as the Hospital Elder Life Program,9,48,49 at least some of these costs may be preventable. The present study provides a nuanced examination of some of the healthcare costs associated with caring for ADRD patients. We had originally hypothesized that delirium in ADRD patients would increase costs overall but instead found that some costs are increased (for all patients with delirium) and other costs are decreased (particularly for ADRD patients with severe delirium). Careful cost estimates for delirium in ADRD such as these are urgently needed, to help healthcare and health policy leaders better understand how to improve quality of care for this growing population. Our work highlights the importance of recognizing and preventing delirium to improve health care of older adults with ADRD.

Figure 1. Total costs by survival analysis for delirium and ADRD status

ADRD patients with delirium cost more than those without delirium at 90 and 365 days – with greatest cost differences in long-term homebased healthcare costs at 365 days (Figure 1a) – but is not statistically significant. Non-ADRD patients with delirium cost significantly more than those without delirium at 30, 90, and 365 days – with the cost differences consistently increasing across all time periods (Figure 1b).

* ADL score includes a score for each item, transfer, mobility, toileting and eating – that ranges from 0 (independent) to 4 (total dependence); total score range is 0 (completely independent) to 16 (completely dependent). Charlson Comorbidity Score was calculated based on diagnoses abstracted from medical record review, scored from 0-35 with higher scores indicating more comorbidity.

Research in Context

Systematic review: The authors reviewed the literature using published, peer-reviewed (e.g., PubMed) sources, with evidence cited. One-year healthcare costs associated with delirium in older hospitalized patients with and without Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) have not been examined previously.

Interpretation: Our findings suggest an increasing cost differences across one year for ADRD patients with delirium as compared to ADRD patients without delirium. The costs in survival analyses for ADRD patients who develop delirium is $34,828 (adjusted mean difference) per patient.

Future directions: This study demonstrates the substantial economic impact of delirium and severe delirium among patients with ADRD, particularly the contribution to long-term, home-based care. The results highlight the importance of evidence-based health system and policy initiatives to prevent delirium48,50,51 in persons with ADRD.

Highlights

Novel examination of healthcare costs of delirium in persons with and without ADRD

Increased 1-year costs of $34,828 in ADRD patients with delirium (vs. without).

Increased costs for delirium in ADRD occur later during the 365-day study period.

For ADRD patients, cost differences between those with and without delirium increased over one year

For non-ADRD patients, the parallel cost differences were consistent over time
