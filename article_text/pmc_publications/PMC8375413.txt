Oligomerization of soluble tau protein is attracting the attention of an increasingly larger number of scientists involved in research on Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies. A variety of methods have been developed for the purification of proteins from biological tissues and bacterial cells. Various types of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and affinity tags represent the most common techniques for isolating proteins. Here, we describe a procedure for extracting recombinant tau protein from bacterial cells, utilizing a 6×His affinity tag, or endogenous tau from brain cortices using acid extraction followed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). Additionally, we introduce a method for oligomerization based on reduction and oxidation of cysteine residues. Our preparation assures high yield of tau protein, while preserving its physiological function.

1 Introduction

While originally characterized as a microtubule binding protein, subsequent research has identified additional intra- and extracellular activities for tau and its aggregates. These discoveries and the need to further understand the biological actions of normal and pathological forms of tau have created the need for an efficient and cost effective tau preparation method.

Protein purification refers to a multistep process aiming to isolate a protein of interest from a diverse mixture utilizing unique physico-chemical characteristics of the target protein including mass, net charge, isoelectric point, solubility, and ligand/metal binding properties [1]. There are a variety of protocols for protein purification in modern biochemistry. However, the development of an appropriate procedure for isolating the given protein while preserving its physiological properties and ensuring high yield is challenging. In general, common procedures for protein purification comprise the following steps: (1) extraction from the biological tissue or bacterial culture, (2) cell lysis, removal of cell debris and non-protein components, (3) enrichment process, including concentration and precipitation, (4) intermediate purification, usually accomplished by exploiting the binding properties of the desired protein, (5) polishing, in order to achieve higher level of purity alongside with high yield. Common techniques for the purification include HPLC and affinity-tag purification for recombinant proteins. Different types of HPLC could be used depending on the properties of the protein and the level of purification including reversed-phase chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography, and affinity chromatography [2–5]. When it comes to the isolation of recombinant proteins, utilization of affinity protein tags is a common strategy. Maltose-binding protein (MBP), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and poly-His (6×His) tag represent the most widely used affinity tags [6–8].

In this chapter, we describe in detail a method to isolate tau protein from bacterial cells and cortices of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients or mice. In the protocol for recombinant tau preparation, bacterial cells were lysed in Triton X-100 phosphate buffered saline with protease inhibitor. Further purification of the tau construct was performed with a nickel column with His-bind resin, and eluted with phosphate buffer containing imidazole. For the human Tau, homogenization with a buffer containing perchloric acid (PCA) followed by further enrichment by anion exchange chromatography. An advantage of the acidic homogenization with PCA is that it allows the removal of DNA and other proteins, while preserving tau phosphorylation. Moreover, this method permits the enrichment of soluble oligomeric tau species from human or mouse brain samples. In both the cases, purification was completed with several steps of buffer exchange via centrifugal concentrators.

After the final step of purification, isolated soluble tau was oligomerized. There are several methods for tau oligomerization such as addition of heparin, heparin sulfate, polyunsaturated fatty acids, RNA or quinones, and Aβ seeding [9–14]. Although the above-mentioned methods are effective for producing tau oligomers, they result in a variety of species with controversial toxicity or no toxicity [15]. Indeed, aggregation kinetics differ among methods, resulting in tau species that are not necessarily equivalent in terms of both size and biophysical properties [15]. In our preparation, tau oligomerization was achieved via introduction of disulfide bonds after overnight incubation with 1 mM H2O2. Even though the species that induce the toxicity could not be identified, our protocol for producing tau oligomers proved to affect efficiently key features of AD, including synaptic plasticity and memory [16]. We propose using the protocol described in this manuscript as a standardized method for the preparation and oligomerization of tau.

1. Since Triton X-100 is viscous, cutting the tip of the pipette will facilitate its aspiration.

2. Grind the protease tablets with mortar and pestle in order to expedite the process of dissolving them in the lysis buffer.

3. The velocity of rotation is essential for bacterial growth. In case that the incubator does not reach the 250 rpm speed, you should increase the time of incubation. Bacteria overgrowth can be easily distinguished since the culture media is turning from clear to hazy.

4. Resuspending the bacterial pelettes could be time consuming. In order to break up the pellets you could pipette up and down and vortex the bottles. Usually at the end of this step we end up with ~30 ml of lysate.

5. We divide the above lysate equally into 24 tubes and place them in a water bath at 70 °C. After 15 min of boiling you should see separation of lysate in two phases. Subsequent centrifugation at 15,000 × g will cause precipitation of one phase. In case that your centrifuge does not reach the above speed, you should increase the time of centrifugation until achieving complete precipitation. We usually collect ~24 ml of supernatant.

6. After adding the TCEP the pH should be acidic (pH ~4–5). Caution should be taken when you adjust the pH with 1 N NaOH since a single drop could cause dramatic shift in the pH from acidic to basic. Therefore, we suggest adding a single drop, mix well and measuring each time the pH before adding the next drop.

7. We mix the supernatant containing recombinant tau (~24 ml) with 45 ml of binding buffer and perform several steps of centrifugation—each lasting 20 min—until collecting ~50 ml of flow-through and ~9 ml from the lysate in the column. At each centrifugation step, we collect the flow-through in a new tube and fill up the column again with the above mixture. Progressively the volume that passes through the column is decreasing and the procedure could take time to be completed. When you collect the supernatant from the column at the very last step, avoid aspirating the viscous brown precipitant that formed at the bottom.

8. We recommend to vortex or shake the His-affinity gel each time before pipetting the appropriate amount to the columns; otherwise, the resin containing in the gel will precipitate. Additionally, make sure that after the centrifugation step the His-affinity gel is completely drained. It is possible that in some tubes the His-affinity gel of the columns will not be completely dry. In that case, repeat the step only for the above tubes in order to avoid over-drying the rest of the tubes due to the excess centrifugation.

9. Mixing the lysate with the gel and the following materials from the kit is essential; otherwise, the recombinant tau will pass through the column.

10. Along the same lines, we save the flow-through in the steps conducted with the kit in order to detect possible loss of our protein.

11. At this step we expect to collect ~5 ml of sample. Due to time limitation, we usually freeze the sample at −20 °C and proceed with the rest of the steps the following day.

12. As in the previous step we mix the eluate (~5 ml) with 47 ml of oligomerization buffer and perform several steps of centrifugation—each last 20 min—until collecting ~50 ml of flow-through and 1.5–2 ml of the eluate in the column.

13. This step is carried out as before. After cleaning the protein concentrators, we mix the eluate from the previous step with oligomerization buffer and we perform several steps of centrifugation. We want to collect 50 ml in the flow-through and 1–2 ml of the sample in the column. Adjusting the volume that you will finally collect from the column could result in more or less concentrated sample. Nevertheless, we do not recommend collecting less than 1 ml since at the final step it is difficult to predict the volume that will pass through the filter and it entails the danger of losing the protein.

14. For NanoDrop measurement we use molecular weight of 45,900 kDa and extinction coefficient of 7450 cm−1 m−1. Oligomerization buffer is used for the blank measurement.

15. For visualization with Western Blot, 7 μg of the sample was mixed with loading buffer without reducing agent and boiled for 5 min at 100 °C. Reducing agent was excluded because the latter breaks down disulfide bonds and in that case we won’t be able to visualize high order oligomers formed by disulfide bonds, but only monomers. The samples were loaded to 10% Tris-Acetate gels that transferred on nitrocellulose membrane, following a common Western Blot protocol. For immunoblotting we used an anti-tau antibody diluted to a final concentration according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After developing the membrane you should be able to detect bands above 100 kDa that represent tau oligomers. The band at ~50 kDa represents the monomeric form.
