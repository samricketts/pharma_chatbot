Introduction:

Early detection of cognitive decline in older adults is a public health priority. Assessing Reliable Measurement in Alzheimer’s Disease and cognitive Aging (ARMADA), a multisite study, is validating cognition, emotion, motor and sensory modules of the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function (NIHTB) in the aging spectrum from cognitively normal to dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT).

Methods:

Participants 65-85 years-old, in demographic groups racially proportional to the general US population, are recruited in one of three groups to validate the NIHTB: cognitively normal, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), or mild DAT. Additional special emphasis cohorts include: 1) African Americans in the three clinical groups; 2) Spanish-speakers in the three clinical groups; 3) cognitively normal, population-proportional, over age 85.

Discussion:

Longitudinal study will determine if NIHTB can predict cognitive decline and is associated with AD biomarkers. Here, we detail the methods for the ARMADA study.

pmc1. Introduction

Detecting cognitive decline in older individuals is of great concern for public health. Unlike “normal cognitive aging,” where decline occurs but does not threaten independence, conditions like dementia should be detected for intervention/prevention since they are progressive, impede functional autonomy, and reduce life expectancy. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that alone or in combination with other neuropathologies, is believed to be the most common cause of an amnestic dementia syndrome (dementia of the Alzheimer’s type; DAT) in individuals over age 65.1,2 Dementia slowly evolves from a state of normal cognition, through an intermediate stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI),3,4 a “prodromal” condition associated with AD neuropathology.5,6 Detection of MCI and early dementia is desirable if the progression of symptoms can be delayed. Currently, a “preclinical” stage of AD, defined as a point in time when in vivo AD biomarkers are detectable but individuals are asymptomatic7, has been of particular interest because the presence of biomarkers at this stage has been shown to increase risk for later cognitive decline.8

Currently, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has implemented the annual “Wellness Visit” for seniors. This practice, albeit laudable, has not had a significant impact on the detection of dementia.9 It is likely that the cursory evaluation in the wellness visit (e.g., MiniCog,10 or similar “screen”) can only identify those already moderately to severely affected at time of examination.

Clinical neuropsychological evaluation is a gold standard for assessing neurobehavioral disorders but interpretation requires special expertise. For example, age, level and quality of education, socioeconomic status, cultural background and a host of health variables can influence how cognitive scores are interpreted.11,12,13 Even if a primary provider is able to conduct a screening test, a normal score can be obtained by someone whose mild deficits have missed detection. On the other hand, neuropsychological evaluations that are lengthy and that may not be widely available are impractical for large-scale use. Finally, health disparities in underserved populations are hampered by lack of tests specifically designed for the appropriate demographic group, including primary language.14 Specifically, there is an urgent need for standardization of neuropsychological tests among diverse groups of Spanish-speaking adults.15 Additionally, many disparities in neuropsychological practice exist across racial and ethnic groups, including reduced diagnostic accuracy and underutilization of services.16

An approach somewhere between cursory cognitive screening and more comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation is needed. A number of short neuropsychological batteries exist, but still require clinical expertise, and, in paper-and-pencil format, require additional effort for scoring. Computerized instruments offer advantages over paper-and-pencil tests by reducing bias in methods of test administration and scoring. They can also capture reaction time to enhance sensitivity to early changes from baseline that might emerge over multiple administrations. Additionally, any widespread measure should provide demographically suitable norms.

The NIH Toolbox® for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function (NIHTB)17–28 was an NIH Blueprint project to design a research tool to measure the range of normal functioning in cognitive, emotional, motor and sensory domains in individuals aged 3–85. The goal was to create a tool applicable to a variety of settings to provide “common currency,” especially among longitudinal studies. Although each of the 4 domain modules requires approximately 30 minutes for completion, the NIHTB is more comprehensive than brief screening measures, more efficient than paper-and-pencil methods, and measures neurological health variables beyond cognition.

Adulthood changes in emotion, motor, and sensory functions may be related to, or predict, cognitive decline, and are not typically incorporated into evaluations for dementia. For example, late-life depression may increase risk for cognitive decline.29 Waning motor strength has been associated with increased risk of DAT, and changes in gait, and reduced finger tapping speed, and a more rapid rate of decline in these functions, can predict development of MCI and dementia in cognitively normal individuals.30–35 Other neurological functions, such as olfaction, are also impaired in DAT and correlate with severity, suggesting it may be useful to measure olfactory function as an adjunct of cognitive decline.36–40 The NIHTB is positioned to detect multidimensional neurological variables associated with cognitive aging in the trajectory from normal cognition to DAT.

2. Methods:

2.1 Goal of the ARMADA Study

ARMADA aims to validate the NIHTB in well-characterized, diverse samples of adults ages 65-85 and to extend norms to those over age 85. The NIHTB is royalty-free, with charges for app maintenance and support. The Spanish NIHTB is administered to the Spanish-speaking sample. The four batteries of the NIHTB have been described previously17–28. Research participants for ARMADA were recruited from existing longitudinal cohorts characterized prior to study enrollment as cognitively normal or having cognitive impairment, either amnestic MCI or early stage dementia, the latter two presumably due to AD based on clinical diagnosis and, in some instances, AD biomarkers. These groups are racially proportional to the US population. Additional groups with special emphasis included samples of: 1) cognitively healthy individuals over age 85, in racial proportion to the U.S. population; 2) African American individuals (cognitively healthy or have aMCI or early stage DAT); and 3) Spanish-speaking individuals (cognitively healthy or have aMCI or early stage DAT). The special focus cohorts will address disparities in the availability of ethnically/racially focused assessments and interpretive data. The NIHTB measures will be examined in relationship to available biomarker data, and established measures of cognitive functioning and mental health as tested in the Uniform Data Set (UDS),41–43 which is routinely administered at many participating sites. The main purpose of the study is to determine if NIHTB measures can discriminate among groups with different levels of cognitive functioning. A longitudinal arm of the study will also investigate if the NIHTB measures can capture changes in neurological functioning over time.

2.2. Recruitment Sites

Participants were recruited from existing cohorts of the network of Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and affiliated longitudinal NIH-funded studies incorporating many of the methods used in the ADRCs. Clinical Cores follow cognitively normal and impaired older adults with standard cognitive and clinical characterization for participation in research on cognitive aging and dementia. Nine sites participated: Northwestern University (NU, lead site), University of Michigan (U-M), University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-M), Mayo Clinic-Jacksonville, Florida (MCF), University of Pittsburgh (U Pitt), Emory University, University of California-San Diego (UCSD), Columbia University, and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Table 1 shows each site and its recruitment strategy. To make the NIHTB accessible to underrepresented groups, Spanish-speaking participants were recruited from the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) cohort13,44 and from the ADRC at San Diego, and an enhanced African American sample was recruited from all sites. Because of the need to capitalize on available biomarkers, it was important to include sites in which imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD neuropathologic change and genotypes of AD risk had been collected, and there was expertise in UDS41–43 methodology to characterize and diagnose samples. Participants were required to meet study inclusion/exclusion criteria and individuals with available AD biomarkers were recruited over those without biomarkers, all else being equal. Participant enrollment at baseline is listed in Table 2. Target enrollment was 120 participants per group to account for attrition. Baseline enrollment for all NC groups, 85+, and Spanish MCI are complete, while enrollment for remaining groups is ongoing.

2.3 Participant Diagnostic and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Cognitively Impaired Participants.

Two groups of participants were included with a research diagnosis of DAT (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)45 Global Score=1.0) or research diagnosis of aMCI (amnestic single or multidomain; Global CDR=0.5), based on their participation in the source study. aMCI and DAT were diagnosed using the 2011 NIA-AA criteria46,47 and are informed by data obtained from the participant, study partner, mental status examination, neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, and additional neuroimaging or laboratory data as available at each site. Most sites use a research diagnostic consensus conference to assign their participants into the cognitive categories.

Research diagnosis was based on established UDS procedures through the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC), including the UDS neuropsychological battery (UDSN)41–43 or similar cognitive tests, the CDR, Functional Activities Questionnaire,48 and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire.49 The NACC has systematized diagnostic decision-making guidelines based on the most up-to-date published research diagnostic criteria.46,47 (See https://www.alz.washington.edu/WEB/forms_uds.html.) Similar criteria were applied to the cohorts recruited outside of the ADC cohorts in affiliated studies. The diagnosis of cognitive impairment is multi-tiered, consisting of the assignment of a clinical profile (i.e., amnestic single or multidomain MCI or amnestic dementia of the AD type for ARMADA) and then the clinician’s prediction of the most likely etiology (i.e., AD vs other neurodegenerative diseases). In some cases, AD biomarkers can provide confirmatory etiologic evidence.

Exclusion criteria were applied at the source study, and involved the presence of acute disorders that could lead to cognitive impairment (e.g. toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, normal pressure hydrocephalus, stroke, inflammatory process, brain tumor), a history of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders50 criteria for any chronic major psychiatric disorder, and alcohol or other substance abuse.

Cognitively normal individuals were recruited and enrolled with similar methods. Participants included adults over age 65, with no significant complaints of cognitive impairment, and with normal cognition judged by clinical interview and mental status examination. Additionally, they were required to be living independently with no difficulties in daily living activities, as confirmed by a study partner, and had a CDR Global Score of 0. Exclusion criteria, in addition to those for cognitively impaired individuals, were serious medical illness (e.g. thyroid disorder, renal, hepatic, cardiac or pulmonary insufficiency, unstable diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, cancer), or other factors that could significantly impact cognition (such as chronic use of neuroleptic or hypnotic medications) at the investigator’s discretion. Participants were not excluded if they had conditions such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes that were well controlled. Similarly, those taking antidepressants or anxiolytics were not excluded if symptoms were well controlled.

2.4 Collection of biomarkers for AD neuropathology or AD risk

Each site collected blood, imaging, and/or CSF biomarker data on a significant proportion of their sample. The in vivo AD biomarker availability at every site (with the exception of Columbia University) ranged from 30% to 100% (Table 3). Structural MRI data are available for some participants at each site. The most commonly available in vivo AD biomarkers are amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and CSF tau/amyloid levels. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype is also available for a majority of participants across sites. While ApoE genotype is not a biomarker per se, it is a well-accepted AD risk factor that is worthwhile studying for its application to early detection and prevention.51,52

Although biomarker data are intended to validate etiology, they are not being collected prospectively for this study; rather, we are making use of existing biomarker data. To maximize the value of this resource, each site described their methods for biomarker collection and “cut point” adjudication (Table 4). Two amyloid PET ligands (i.e., Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)53 and Florbetapir) were used at each site and sites specified PET parameters and data processing. Each site described its CSF collection and analysis techniques, and biomarker cut points for CSF biomarkers. To harmonize across sites, each was asked to designate biomarker status for those in whom they were available as “normal” or “abnormal” based on site-specific standards. Since it was not possible to control the time elapsed between ARMADA participation and biomarker collection, the limit was set at 24 months for negative results. Within that period of time, status is not anticipated to change significantly.54 There was no time limit for positive results. NIHTB performance will be analyzed in relation to biomarker status. All data are uploaded and stored within the NACC database dedicated to this project and will be available for future use by investigators.

2.5 Collection of NIHTB Data and UDS Neuropsychological Battery

Participants recruited in year 1 completed baseline assessments, and are followed with 12-month and 24-month assessments. Each assessment includes all four modules of the NIHTB (Table 5). For more details on each module, refer to the original publications17–28, as well as Supplemental Methods and NIHTB website (nihtoolbox.org). Three new measures are being added in the first longitudinal wave to improve symptom detection, including the the FNAME Test55 (test of face-name associative learning shown to be highly effective in detecting episodic memory loss, and related to AD biomarkers), a measure of hearing acuity, and a test of near vision.

As described above, participants also completed the UDS or similarly detailed data inventory that provided participant demographics, family history, medical history and medications, research neurological exam, dementia severity level, functional ability assessment, behavioral and psychiatric symptoms, and clinical diagnosis. The neuropsychological test battery of the UDS 3.041–43,56 is comprised of: 1) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)57; 2) Craft Story, immediate and delayed story recall58; 3) Benson Complex figure copy and delayed recall59; 4) Number Span Test—forward and backward; 4) Category Fluency, animals and vegetables; 5) Trail Making Test (TMT) A &amp; B; 6) Multilingual Naming Test60; 7) Verbal Fluency–letters F and L. Estimated completion time is 30 minutes. The UDS is administered to participants enrolled in ADC Clinical Cores at yearly visits. Some sites that recruited from cohorts outside of the ADC clinical cores varied in their methods of neuropsychological testing but included measures for all domains captured in the UDS. In addition, they utilized UDS guidelines to standardize diagnostic consistency.

2.6 Statistical Analysis Plan

The primary objective of analyses will be to evaluate the NIHTB domains as they distinguish across diagnostic groups (cognitively normal, MCI, DAT) among the total sample as well as within each of the ARMADA cohorts, including African Americans, Spanish-speakers, and cognitively healthy individuals aged &gt;85 years. First, for both multi-item and single-item instruments, we will compute a variety of descriptive statistics at the item level: mean, SD, range, skewness, kurtosis, and percent of responses at the floor or ceiling. These analyses will help flag items that exhibit problems, such as little variability and ceiling or floor effects. We will conduct this evaluation for the overall sample and within African American, Spanish-speaking, and cognitively healthy &gt;85 years cohorts. We will similarly evaluate the distribution of UDS test scores.

For multi-item scales with items that are expected to correlate, we will compute Cronbach’s alpha, average inter-item correlation, and item-total correlations. We will also reconfirm in the ARMADA sample the dimensionality of multiple NIHTB measures. In doing so, we will focus most on unidimensional factor models, as well as general factor-strength indices, derived from bifactor models. To help quantify the fit of a unidimensional model, we will calculate commonly used fit indices: Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Tucker Lewis Index (TLI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA).

To evaluate the construct validity of the NIHTB Cognition Battery with respect to the UDS Neuropsychological battery, we will estimate convergent validity correlation coefficients, with 95% CI, for scores measuring the same or similar constructs on both. Correlation coefficients will be estimated for the sample overall and within each cohort. We use conventional criteria to determine levels of convergent validity, which will be assessed with Pearson correlation coefficients between the NIHTB-CB measure and a well-established “gold standard” measure of the same underlying construct. Across measures, correlations &lt; 0.3 are considered poor, 0.3–0.6 are considered adequate, and values &gt; 0.6 are considered good to very good evidence of convergent validity61.

To test cross-sectional and longitudinal differences across groups, we will first examine differences in each NIHTB module by diagnostic categories. Different racial/ethnic groups will be analyzed separately, with comparisons between normal and impaired samples within group, since we are most interested in group-specific characteristics of the cognitive aging spectrum. We expect declines in cognitive scores in the aMCI and DAT groups during this period, while those with normal cognition will remain stable. We will determine if racial/ethnic groups differ with respect to measures of change over time in each module since each group will serve as its own baseline for comparison.

We will examine the ability of the NIHTB Cognition battery to distinguish and discriminate among diagnostic groups (e.g., normal cognitive aging vs. aMCI, aMCI vs. DAT) across tests overall as well as between age groups (60-85 vs. 85+). To do this, we will compute receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC), which indicates the sensitivity/specificity of a test against clinically defined diagnoses. We will compare the discriminatory ability of cognitive tests across subgroups (e.g., whether a specific test discriminates similarly between normal and aMCI African American subjects and among these groups in Whites and in primarily Spanish speaking participants). Previously we showed that UDS V3 cognitive tests achieve ROCs which range from 0.63 to 0.79 in differentiating CDR=0 vs. 0.5, from 0.63 to 0.81 in differentiating CDR=0.5 vs. 1 and from 0.73 to 0.97 in differentiating CDR = 0 vs 156. We expect that each of NIHTB Cognition battery tests will achieve at least similar or further improved ROCs in differentiating across diagnostic groups. Finally, we plan to compare NIHTB scores between normal and abnormal biomarker groups using generalized linear regression models, overall as well as stratified by cohort. Certain items in NIHTB provide demographically adjusted scores. We will control for age, sex, and years of education when we use non-adjusted raw scores in model-based analyses discussed above. We will also adjust other potential confounders such as depression and comorbidities in exploratory analyses. There is evidence that racial cohorts may differ with respect to the relationship between biomarker levels and cognitive test scores, potentially increasing diagnostic inaccuracy.62

3. Discussion

The ARMADA study major aim is to validate the NIHTB in existing, well-characterized, diverse samples of older adults, ages 65 and older, and determine its utility in discriminating among older adults with normal or impaired cognition.

Several studies have examined the NIHTB cognition module in aging populations. Scott and colleagues63 investigated the psychometric properties of the NIHTB cognition module in a sample of cognitively intact older adults. Acceptable test-retest reliability was obtained over a one-year period. The NIHTB Fluid Composite correlated significantly with cerebral volumes, and both Fluid and Crystallized Composites correlated highly with their respective gold standard composites. Hackett and colleagues64 investigated the validity and utility of the NIHTB cognition module in individuals with normal cognition, subjective cognitive decline, aMCI, and mild DAT. Performance on the NIHTB cognition battery varied in a manner consistent with performance on traditional neuropsychological tests and yielded strong overall discriminative ability. Another study found that hippocampal volume predicted cognitive performance on the NIHTB Fluid Composite, and decreased hippocampal volume was associated with reductions in multiple NIHTB subdomains, including episodic memory, working memory, processing speed and executive function.65 These early studies show promise for the utility of the NIHTB across the cognitive aging spectrum.

The inclusion of non-cognitive measures that change with cognitive impairment and dementia in the ARMADA study will provide additional sensitivity for identifying at-risk individuals. Although these measures have not been examined sufficiently across the cognitive aging spectrum, they have proved useful in other neurological populations. For example, a study examining individuals with spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, or stroke provided support for the validity of the NIHTB in these conditions, with particular group differences in the Motor domain and Fluid Cognition measures.66 Higher self-reported depressive symptoms in the Emotion module were associated with poorer performance on tests of executive functioning and episodic memory, particularly in African American individuals, demonstrating sensitivity of NIHTB measures in detecting negative effects of depression on cognition.67

The NIHTB is adaptable to multiple settings. Several clinical trials currently underway for AD target “preclinical” stages, though cognitive measures used to assess outcomes in these studies were not originally designed to be sensitive at these very early stages, with one exception. The Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) has shown association with early cognitive markers of amyloid positivity.68 The PACC was compared to the NIHTB Cognitive Battery and the Cogstate Computerized Cognitive Composite (C3), another brief cognitive battery.69 Results from a pilot study in clinically normally adults demonstrated correlations between the NIHTB and the PACC, and that the NIHTB, particularly the Picture Sequence Memory Test, identified subtle cognitive impairment as defined by poor performance on paper-and-pencil composites.

An important consideration for utilizing the NIHTB on a large scale is weighing the benefits and harms of early detection of cognitive decline. A recent statement from the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment in older adults.70 While the utility of cognitive screening still requires research, especially for large-scale use, the glaring omission of cognitive measurement in general health assessment, especially of older individuals, cannot be overlooked. Given the growing ethnic and linguistic diversity in the U.S., there is a great need for appropriate, comprehensive norms that better represent diversity. This is especially important given health disparities and higher incidence rate of AD dementia in African American and Hispanic individuals.44,56,71 A baseline cognitive assessment would establish a “personal baseline” against which future measurements could be validly compared72 and would also partly address demographic differences in performance by making each individual their own control. We are used to having many types of health measurements in our society, but not many have had a a cognitive baseline in the years prior to entering the “danger zone” (mid-60’s) for age-related cognitive impairment. While the value of early detection may be unclear, ARMADA will validate the potential benefit of using the NIHTB to longitudinally track cognitive, motor, sensory and emotional functioning across the aging spectrum from normal to MCI to dementia due to AD and will provide data specialized for demographic factors and Spanish language speakers.

Research in Context

1. Systematic review:

The authors reviewed the literature using traditional (e.g., PubMed) sources. Scope of the literature review included relevant background on mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, and the methods currently used to diagnose cognitive and other neurological impairment in these populations, including available biomarkers. Relevant citations are appropriately cited.

2. Interpretation:

This manuscript details all methods used across research sites in the clinical validation of the NIH Toolbox across the cognitive aging spectrum, for future reference.

3. Future Directions:

Future studies will examine baseline sample characteristics, neuropsychological data, and NIH Toolbox performance in older individuals with normal cognition, aMCI, and early Alzheimer’s dementia. Special emphasis cohorts include over age 85, African American participants, and Spanish-speaking participants. The NIH Toolbox will be readministered longitudinally for up to two years.

Highlights:

Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia is a public health priority.

The NIH Toolbox® (NIHTB) battery may identify early cognitive and non-cognitive neurological factors in decline.

ARMADA is validating the NIHTB in the normal-to-dementia cognitive trajectory and against AD biomarkers in population-representative cohorts and in enhanced cohorts of African Americans and Spanish-speaking individuals.

Methods for this large-scale, multi-site study are reported as reference for future studies.

Future results for diverse populations, including a Spanish version of the NIHTB, will be reported.
