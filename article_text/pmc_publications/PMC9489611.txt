Background:

The emergency department (ED) is a critical juncture in the care of persons living with dementia (PLwD), as they have a high rate of hospital admission, ED revisits, and subsequent inpatient stays. We examine ED disposition of PLwD compared to older adults with non-dementia chronic disease as well as health care utilization and survival.

Methods:

Medicare claims data were used to identify community-dwelling older adults 66+ years old from 34 hospitals with either Alzheimer’s Disease/Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) or a non-AD/ADRD chronic condition between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018. We compared ED disposition at the index visit, as well as healthcare utilization and mortality in the 12 months following an index ED visit, and adjusted for age, gender, and risk of mortality.

Results:

There were 29,626 patients in the AD/ADRD sample, and 317,046 in the comparison sample. The AD/ADRD sample was older (82.4 years old (SD: 8.2) versus 76.0 years old (SD: 7.7)) and had more female patients (59.9% versus 54.7%). The AD/ADRD sample was more likely to experience ED disposition to acute care (OR 1.039, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI 1.029 – 1.050), to have an ED revisit (OR 1.077, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI 1.066 – 1.087), and an inpatient stay in the subsequent 12 months (OR 1.085, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI 1.075 – 1.095). ED disposition to hospice was low in both samples (0.2%). AD/ADRD patients had a higher risk of mortality (OR 1.099, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI 1.091 – 1.107), and high short-term mortality (31.9% within 12 months) than those without AD/ADRD (15.3% within 12 months).

Conclusions:

PLwD who visit the ED have high short-term mortality. Despite this, disposition to acute care, ED revisits, and inpatient stays, rather than hospice, remain the predominant mode of care delivery. Transition directly from the ED to hospice for PLwD is rare.

pmcIntroduction

Over six million Americans had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) in 2017.1 As the population over 65 years old continues to grow this number is projected to reach 13.8 million by 2050 with an estimated number of AD/ADRD related deaths of 1.6 million, 43% of all older adult deaths.2,3 AD/ADRD has become an important public health issue due to high healthcare and caregiving costs4, relative inattention to dementia as a healthcare problem5, and high caregiver demand and burnout.6 Emergency care for persons living with dementia (PLwD) is of critical importance,7 and up to 54% of PLwD visit the Emergency Department (ED) each year.8 PLwD have higher rates of ED visits than their peers without AD/ADRD8, and higher rates of ED revisits within 30 days.9 The ED is an important juncture in the care trajectory of PLwD, and ED providers must weigh the potential benefits and harms of admitting PLwD for acute care versus referring them to supportive home and community services.10

Previous studies examining healthcare utilization, ED disposition, and mortality provide a glimpse into the care trajectory and post-ED visit outcomes for PLwD. Studies have shown 40% - 64% of ED visits by PLwD result in inpatient admission, with an average inpatient length of stay of 6.5 days for admissions including the intensive care unit (ICU), and 5.2 days for non-ICU stays.8,11 In comparison, 30% of ED visits by patients aged 65 and older without dementia result in inpatient admission8, and the national median length of hospital stay for all patients and conditions is 4.0 days.12 Regarding mortality, LaMantia et. al. (2016) found 7.1% of AD/ADRD patients died within 6 months of their index ED visit, and 19.5% died within one year.8 Between 51% - 53% of patients with AD/ADRD who visit the ED are discharged home, and up to 17% of patients are discharged to a skilled nursing facility (SNF), with a broad range in SNF disposition.8,11 The high variability in ED disposition among previous studies emphasizes the need for more information regarding ED management for this population.

Further study is needed to help clarify the sources of these differences in ED disposition, healthcare utilization, and mortality of PLwD compared to similar populations with non-AD/ADRD chronic conditions. Thus, utilizing Medicare claims data we aimed to: 1) identify a large sample of community-dwelling PLwD from a diverse cohort of EDs across the United States (US) and, 2) compare post-ED outcomes to patients with non-AD/ADRD chronic conditions. This study is a sub-analysis of a larger national emergency medicine palliative care study titled Primary Palliative Care for Emergency Medicine (PRIM-ER).13

Methods

Data source and study population

Our study accessed Medicare claim records through the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse14 to identify PLwD aged 66+ years who presented to one of 34 EDs that are PRIM-ER sites across the US between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018.13 See Table 1 for the sites included in this study. For our AD/ADRD sample, we selected patients who fit one of two criteria: 1) patients with one or more dementia diagnoses from an inpatient, hospice, nursing home or home health care claim or 2) patients with two dementia diagnoses in the Carrier file, as defined by the “Evaluation and management” (EM) Berenson-Eggers Service codes that were at least 7 days apart, to avoid ”rule out” diagnoses. This selection criteria mirrors that of previous reports.15 The International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes used for our analysis are available in Supplemental Data Table 1. Our comparison sample consisted of patients that had at least one non-AD/ADRD chronic condition. The full list of chronic conditions used for inclusion of the non-AD/ADRD comparison group can be found in Supplemental Data Table 2. Patients who were admitted to the ED at their index visit from nursing homes or hospice were excluded from both the AD/ADRD and comparison groups. Those who come from a nursing home or hospice are likely to have differing outcomes compared to a community-based patient population, especially disposition from the ED with disposition unique to those populations. Therefore, we exclude them from this analysis to better understand patterns that are unique to the community-based patient population.

Measures

We used Medicare’s Master Beneficiary Summary File, Inpatient, Outpatient, Vital Status, and Hospice files to monitor ED disposition at the index visit, as well as healthcare utilization and mortality for up to 12 months after the index ED visit. An ED index visit was defined as a patient’s first visit to the ED within 12 months of identification as a PLwD. We measured ED disposition at the index ED visit as a categorical variable, defined as admission to acute care (or intensive care as a subset variable) or discharge to home health, hospice, home, or another location. 16 If a patient did not have an acute care admission but did have a hospice visit within three days of the ED index visit, the ED disposition was determined to be to a hospice setting.

We measured healthcare utilization in the 12 months following the index ED visit as: 1) ED revisits (count); 2) the number and percent with one or more ED revisits; 3) inpatient visits (count); 4) the number and percent with one or more inpatient visits; and 5) inpatient days (count). Our measures of healthcare utilization were developed based on the Dartmouth Atlas Decedent Cohort Care Intensity Measures as a surrogate for quality of end-of-life care in Medicare patients with serious chronic illness that were identified through revenue codes in each site’s administrative data.17

We measured hospice use as a dichotomous variable (Yes/No) in the 12 months following the index visit, where we included any hospice visit that occurred at least three days after the index visit. Death was measured in two ways: 1) the number and percent of deaths in the 12 months following that index visit; and 2) median days (count) from the index ED visit to death for those who died within 12 months. Patient variables for age, gender, and race/ethnicity were measured using the Master Beneficiary Summary File. The 19 chronic conditions were measured as separate, dichotomous variables (Yes/No) and were coded based on the presence or absence of ICD-9s (January 2014-September 2015) or ICD-10s (October-2015–2018) from inpatient and ambulatory claims in the prior year. The diagnosis codes used to identify specific chronic conditions were drawn from publicly available SAS code used to create the Gagne index16, though we did not calculate a Gagne index score for this analysis.

Statistical Analyses

We used descriptive statistics to characterize demographic variables, index ED visit disposition, as well as healthcare care utilization and survival the 12 months following an index ED visit. The selection criteria for our AD/ADRD and comparison samples are depicted in Figure 1. All analyses were conducted using SAS Version 7.1 (SAS Institute, Cary NC). To estimate the association of our AD/ADRD sample and other predictors with our outcome measures, we used mixed effects generalized linear models. The GLIMMIX procedure of SAS, version 7.15, was used for analysis to estimate a site-level random effect. All tests of statistical significance were two-tailed, and p &lt;0.05 was considered significant.

Results

Table 2 shows the characteristics of the AD/ADRD and comparison samples. There were 29,626 patients meeting inclusion criteria for the AD/ADRD sample, and 317,046 in the comparison sample. The AD/ADRD group was older, 82.4 years old (SD: 8.2) versus 76.0 years old (SD: 7.7) and the AD/ADRD group had a substantially higher proportion of patients &gt;85 years old (43.6%) compared to the comparison group (16.5%). The AD/ADRD group also had a higher percentage of female patients (59.9% versus 54.7%). The AD/ADRD group in contrast to the comparison group also had a higher percentage of patients with concomitant hypertension (84.9% versus 79.2%), cardiac arrhythmias (46.1% versus 32.3%), anemia (44.7% versus 27.3%), peripheral vascular disease (39.9% versus 22.9%), and electrolyte disorders (37.6% versus 15.8%). The AD/ADRD group had a greater number of non-AD/ADRD chronic conditions (mean 4.8, SD: 2.8) in contrast to the comparison group (mean 3.3, SD: 2.1).

Figure 2 shows the baseline comparisons of ED disposition, healthcare utilization and mortality in the 12 months following an index ED visit between the AD/ADRD and the comparison group. The AD/ADRD group in relation to our comparison group had a higher percentage of patients admitted to acute care (55.2% versus 43.8%) and to the ICU (6.8% versus 4.1%). The AD/ADRD group had slightly more patients with ED disposition to home health (1.4% vs. 0.6%), and nursing home (2.3% vs. 0.2%). Disposition to home was lower for the AD/ADRD group (37.9%) compared to the comparison group (53.6%), and disposition to hospice slightly higher for the AD/ADRD group (0.4% versus 0.2%). We also considered ED disposition to hospice at subsequent or post-index ED visits, and the frequency of hospice disposition remained negligible (0.06% for AD/ADRD). Disposition to another location was 2.7% for the AD/ADRD group and 1.6% for the comparison group. ED Disposition, Healthcare Utilization, and Mortality among Patients with AD/ADRD Compared to Non-AD/ADRD Patients can be found in Supplemental Data Table 3.

The AD/ADRD sample had higher healthcare utilization compared to the non-AD/ADRD group, including one or more ED visits post-index visit (43.1% of patients versus 35.4%), greater number of inpatient stays post-index visit (mean 0.8 visits versus 0.5 visits) and ED visits post-index (mean 0.9 visits versus 0.7 visits), one or more inpatient stays post-index visit (43.4% of patients versus 28.0%), and longer length of inpatient stays (mean 6.5 days versus 5.9). The AD/ADRD group also had a greater percentage of patients admitted to hospice post-index visit (17.4%) compared to our comparison group (7.5%). The percent of patients in the AD/ADRD group who died within the 12 months following their index visit (31.9%) was nearly double the comparison group (15.3%), with the median days from index visit to death being 84.0 days for the AD/ADRD group versus 83.0 days for the comparison group.

When adjusting for age, gender, and comorbid conditions, the AD/ADRD group was more likely to experience ED disposition to acute care (OR 1.039, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI 1.029 – 1.050) home health (OR, 1.008 p&lt;0.001, 95% CI 1.006 – 1.009), hospice (OR 1.003, p&lt;001, 95% CI 1.002 – 1.004), and nursing homes (OR 1.021, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI 1.020 – 1.023) and more likely to have a post-index ED visit (OR 1.077, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI 1.066 – 1.087), a post-index inpatient stay (OR 1.085, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI 1.075 – 1.095), be admitted to hospice (not direct from the ED) in the 12 months following their index ED visit (OR 1.071, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI 1.066 – 1.077), and were more likely to die (OR 1.099, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI 1.091 – 1.107). The AD/ADRD group was less likely to experience direct ED disposition to home (OR 0.924, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI 0.915 – 0.933).

Discussion

Improving emergency care for PLwD has become a national public health concern and a top priority in the field of emergency medicine.18 Over the past few years, new initiatives have been developed to improve ED care for PLwD, such as developing research agendas via both New Frontiers in Geriatrics Research19 and the Geriatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network20, as well as recognizing geriatric emergency medicine as a core educational priority in academia.21 Prior research has focused on preventing unnecessary ED visits among PLwD22–24 and improving the experiences and outcomes for PLwD within the ED and inpatient units.25 Previous studies indicate up to 44.2% of hospitalized patients with dementia receive some form of post-acute care, and 71.7% of those who receive post-acute care receive their care in a skilled nursing facility.26 However, this study is not specific to the ED, and few studies have addressed the unique role of emergency providers in disposition decisions for PLwD and the trajectory of care after an ED visit.

Broadening our understanding of the ED care trajectory and outcomes for PLwD is critical when considering future interventions that target the role of emergency medicine providers in improving care for this vulnerable population. To our knowledge, this is the first study combining: 1) a conservative approach to identifying community dwelling PLwD; 2) using Medicare claims to document ED disposition, healthcare utilization, and mortality of PLwD; and 3) compare outcome measures against a comparison group with non-AD/ADRD chronic conditions.

Our results are congruent with previous findings that PLwD have high rates of inpatient admissions, revisits to the ED, and mortality after an index ED visit.8,9,11,27,28 The high percentage of inpatient admission observed in our study, 55.2%, is similar to previous reports for PLwD (40% - 64%).8,11 The proportion of patients with at least one subsequent ED visit was also similar in our study (43.1%) compared to prior work (58%)8, as well as a high rate of acute mortality within 12 months.11 While it is meaningful to confirm previous reports of high healthcare utilization and mortality for PLwD, comparing outcomes to a similar cohort of older adults with non-AD/ADRD conditions provides an opportunity to highlight the excess healthcare burden for this population and motivates consideration of just how PLwD are being treated within the ED and how this may impact post-ED outcomes.

Hospice use among PLwD is high, with approximately 45% of those in hospice having either primary or co-morbid dementia.29 In our study, ED disposition to hospice for both the AD/ADRD and the comparison group was quite low, 0.4% and below for both, despite higher AD/ADRD short-term mortality (31.9% within 12 months). Furthermore, our adjusted models indicate those in the AD/ADRD sample are equally as likely to be admitted to hospice directly from the ED compared to those without AD/ADRD, but more likely to receive hospice care within the 12 months following their ED visit. Possible explanations for the low percent of hospice referral include inadequate access to hospice, ED physician discomfort with referring to hospice, limited time available within an ED visit to coordinate hospice referral, or lack of systems in place to initiate a hospice referral. Prior studies indicate multiple barriers exist regarding accessing hospice for PLwD, including determining prognosis, education, finances, and communication challenges.30,31 Low hospice referral from the ED may be another barrier to consider when optimizing end-of-life care for PLwD. This presents opportunities to develop ED-based palliative care delivery models to discharge PLwD directly from the ED to hospice as well as to address these barriers of direct referral.32

Our mortality analysis indicates those with AD/ADRD are more likely to die within 12 months of their index ED visit after adjusting for age, gender, and risk of mortality. We adjusted for risk of mortality by adjusting for 19 different comorbidities experienced between these groups, which are the same comorbidities used to calculate the Gagne Index score, which is a validated score predicting mortality.16 As mentioned above, previous studies report a 1-year mortality for those with AD/ADRD of 19.5%8, while our study reports a 1-year mortality of 31.9%. This difference may be due to methodological differences in identifying patients with AD/ADRD.

Using claims data to identify a dementia population is an established strategy for conducting health services research, and studies indicate Medicare claims can provide a reasonably accurate tool to identify PLwD and can correctly identify 85% of PLwD.33 Our method of identifying PLwD uses more conservative criteria to reduce inclusion of patients who have been incorrectly classified as having AD/ADRD. Previous methods to identify PLwD often do not include all types of dementia, such as Lewy Body Dementia, and may lack specificity since they only require one Medicare claim for inclusion.15 The criteria used for this paper to identify PLwD may create a sample of patients with more advanced impairment, but this population is more likely to benefit from palliative care, and thus, appropriate for the focus of our study.

Multiple challenges exist that are unique regarding the management of patients with advanced AD/ADRD, and must be kept within context of interpreting the results of our study, or other studies in patients with advanced AD/ADRD. Dementia under-detection is an issue in the field, and previous reports indicate those with dementia experience symptoms for on average 2.8 – 4.4 years before being diagnosed.34 A recent systematic review summarizes the numerous barriers to receiving a dementia diagnosis, including, “denial, stigma and fear, lack of knowledge, normalization of symptoms, preserving autonomy, lack of perceived need, unaware of changes, lack of informal network support, carer difficulties, and problems accessing help.”35 Communication and shared decision making is also difficult in advanced AD/ADRD care, and multiple interventions are being tested to help prevent and reduce challenges with important healthcare decisions for those with advanced AD/ADRD.31 In addition, recent studies indicate up to 58.7% of older adults with dementia are undiagnosed and 19.2% are unaware of their diagnosis.36 However, a lack of diagnosis, or lack of awareness of a diagnosis, does not increase the risk of acute care utilization, so other factors which may influence acute care use, such as factors specific to ED disposition, are important to consider.37 Our method for identifying PLwD may not be appropriate for those interested in earlier stage AD/ADRD or identifying methods for early detection of AD/ADRD.

Our study has notable limitations. In performing an aggregate analysis we are unable to determine differences in utilization by region or race/ethnicity. Additional work is needed to understand regional and between-facility differences in utilization. Also, it is important to note that our regression models produced numerous statistically significant outcomes, due in part to our large sample size. However, our results do support concerning differences in ED disposition, healthcare utilization, and mortality for our AD/ADRD cohort at the population level, which should raise attention from the vantage point of public health and health care systems.

Conclusion:

As the population of PLwD who require emergency care continues to grow, it is vital to understand ED disposition and the subsequent healthcare trajectory. PLwD who visit the ED have higher short-term mortality than those without AD/ADRD. Despite this, disposition to acute care, ED revisits, and inpatient stays, rather than hospice, remain the predominant mode of care delivery. Transition directly from the ED to hospice for PLwD is rare. This could present an opportunity for future patient-centered interventions that align ED treatment and discharge plans with the clinical status and preferences of PLwD and their care partners.

Key Points

As the population of persons living with dementia (PLwD) who require emergency care continues to grow, it is vital to understand emergency department (ED) disposition and the subsequent healthcare trajectory.

Our study found that patients with Alzheimer’s disease/Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) who visit the ED have higher short-term mortality than those without AD/ADRD; however, disposition to acute care, ED revisits, and inpatient stays, rather than hospice, remain the predominant mode of care delivery.

Hospice use among PLwD is high, with approximately 45% of those in hospice having either primary or co-morbid dementia. In our study, ED disposition to hospice for both the AD/ADRD and the comparison group was quite low, only 0.2% for both, despite higher AD/ADRD short-term mortality (31.9% within 12 months).

Why does this matter?

Our findings present an opportunity for future patient-centered interventions that align ED treatment and discharge plans with the clinical status and preferences of PLwD and their care partners.
