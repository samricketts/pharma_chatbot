The 24-h rotational period of the earth has driven evolution of biological systems that serve to synchronize organismal physiology and behavior to this predictable environmental event. In mammals, the circadian (circa, “about” and dia, “a day”) clock keeps 24-h time at the organismal and cellular level, optimizing biological function for a given time of day. The most obvious circadian output is the sleep-wake cycle, though countless bodily functions, ranging from hormone levels to cognitive function, are influenced by the circadian clock. Here we discuss the regulation of metabolic pathways by the circadian clock, discuss the evidence implicating circadian and sleep disruption in neurodegenerative diseases, and suggest some possible connections between the clock, metabolism, and neurodegenerative disease.


pmc1. Introduction to the circadian clock

The mammalian circadian system is hierarchical, with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus serving as the master clock of the body. The SCN is a complex nucleus that receives direct input from the retina, and where light exposure is transduced into patterns of clock gene expression and ultimately neuronal firing (Colwell, 2011; Herzog et al., 2017). Light-sensitive retinal ganglion cells, including unique non-image forming melanopsin-expressing cells (Gooley et al., 2001; Hattar et al., 2002), synapse on SCN neurons and synchronize oscillation of a molecular circadian clock which drives organized firing of the SCN with a 24-h rhythm that is entrained to the external light-dark cycle (Mohawk et al., 2012). The molecular clock that maintains cellular circadian activity is present not only in SCN neurons, but in most cells of the body, and regulates the expression of 10–50% of all transcripts, depending on cell type (Mohawk et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014). Rhythmic SCN activity serves to synchronize the molecular clocks of cells throughout the body, which then regulate cell- and tissue-specific functions in circadian synchrony.

The molecular circadian clock is transcriptional-translational feedback loop consisting of conserved clock proteins. The basic helix-loop helix PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) transcription factor brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1) is the primary positive transcriptional mediator of the clock, though it must heterodimerize with circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) or neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) in order to bind to E-box motifs throughout the genome, driving transcription. BMAL1 drives transcription of its own several negative feedback regulators, including PERIOD 1–3 (Per1, 2, and 3), CRYPTOCHROME 1 and 2 (Cry1 and Cry2), and REV-ERBα and β (Nr1d1 and Nr1d2) proteins, which inhibit BMAL1-mediated transcription via multiple mechanisms (Mohawk et al., 2012). This feedback loop is tuned to a 24-h period by a complex set of posttranslational regulatory events (Herzog et al., 2017). Once synchronized, cells can sustain near 24-h rhythms in clock gene expression and transcription with no external stimuli. Clock proteins themselves have functions outside of their immediate function in maintaining rhythms. For example, BMAL1 can directly regulate protein translation (Lipton et al., 2015) and mediates developmental effects (Yang et al., 2016), while PERIOD and CRYPTOCHROME genes can regulate carcinogenesis (Fu et al., 2002; Huber et al., 2016). Thus, disrupting clock genes is associated with a variety of striking phenotypes in rodents that are highly dependent on the particular clock gene manipulated (Yu and Weaver, 2011).

Notably, the timing of sleep is strongly influenced by circadian clock genes, as mutations in clock genes in humans often manifest as familial sleep syndromes (Hsu et al., 2015). In mice, deletion of Bmal1 leads to arrhythmic, fragmented sleep, though the total amount and relative abundance of sleep stages are relatively normal (Laposky et al., 2005). Conversely, sleep deprivation can decrease DNA binding of BMAL1 and CLOCK (Mongrain et al., 2011), and can modestly blunt circadian oscillation in some clock genes, though rhythms in melatonin generally persist (Ackermann et al., 2013; Cedernaes et al., 2015; Lech et al., 2016; Möller-Levet et al., 2013). In the brain, sleep deprivation can cause long-lasting alteration in circadian transcription and blunting of clock gene expression (Hor et al., 2019), and profoundly reduces rhythmic protein expression and phosphorylation at synapses (Brüning et al., 2019; Noya et al., 2019). Thus, the circadian clock appears to function upstream of sleep, though sleep may exert critical mild feedback on the clock function, particularly in the brain outside the SCN.

2. Evidence of sleep and circadian disruption in neurodegenerative diseases

Changes in the sleep-wake pattern and in circadian function seem to be common, conserved symptoms of many neurodegenerative diseases. This issue has been reviewed in detail previously (Leng et al., 2019; Videnovic et al., 2014a), but we will present an overview of the evidence for sleep and circadian disruptions in several neurodegenerative conditions below.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in people older than 65, though early-onset and familial forms can strike much earlier. It is characterized by gradual, progressive hippocampal and cortical neurodegeneration, leading to dementia. Pathologically, the aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide into extracellular amyloid plaques is an early event, followed years later by intraneuronal aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, yielding neurofibrillary tangles.

Several studies have shown fragmentation of sleep-wake behavior and circadian activity rhythms in AD dementia patients, who exhibit increased wakefulness and activity at night and increased napping during the day (Harper et al., 2008; Hatfield et al., 2004; Ju et al., 2013; Satlin et al., 1995; Vitiello and Prinz, 1989). Alzheimer’s disease patients also have suppressed rhythmic release of melatonin, a circadian hormone critical for sleep timing (Mishima et al., 1999; Skene and Swaab, 2003; Uchida et al., 1996). In addition to this decrease in the amplitude of the overall circadian rhythm, a shift in the time of peak activity toward later hours (phase delay) has been described (Ancoli-Israel et al., 1997; Gehrman et al., 2005), and is hypothesized to potential explain the phenomenon of “sundowning,” when dementia patients become more confused and agitated in the evening hours (Volicer et al., 2001).

Several studies show that AD patients have decreased amounts of both deep, restorative non-REM, as well as dream-related REM sleep (Martin et al., 1986; Peter-Derex et al., 2014). People with presymptomatic AD pathology report poor sleep (Benedict et al., 2015; Hahn et al., 2014; Spira et al., 2013; Sprecher et al., 2017) and exhibit decreased sleep efficiency and increased napping (Ju et al., 2013). Mild fragmentation of the circadian activity rhythm can also be detected in presymptomatic AD patients, suggesting that sleep and circadian changes begin very early in the disease process (Musiek et al., 2018). Moreover, poor sleep efficiency (Diem et al., 2016), blunting of circadian rhythms (Tranah et al., 2011) and sleep fragmentation (Lim et al., 2013) are associated with increased risk of incident dementia, suggesting that sleep-wake fragmentation may be an indication of the impending transition from preclinical to symptomatic AD.

On a pathological level, post-mortem studies of AD reveal significant loss of critical neurons in the SCN (Stopa et al., 1999; Swaab et al., 1985; Wang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 1995). Degeneration of other sleep-related nuclei, including the ventrolateral preoptic area/intermediate nucleus (Lim et al., 2014) and the locus coeruleus (Oh et al., 2019) also occurs, suggesting that AD impacts both the circadian and sleep circuitry. Altered methylation of the Bmal1 promoter may also play a role in AD-related circadian deficits (Cronin et al., 2017). Finally, AD patients have a loss of melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells (La Morgia et al., 2016). These cells relay circadian light information from the retina to the SCN, suggesting that there may be a loss of proper synchronizing input to the SCN in AD.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by extrapyramidal motor symptoms, including bradykinesia, resting tremor, shuffling gait, and postural instability. The presence of Lewy bodies, pathological aggregations of α-synuclein protein, as well as degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, are hallmarks of disease (Obeso et al., 2017).

However, PD may begin with degeneration of brainstem nuclei. The most striking sleep symptom of PD, and its fellow synucleinopathy, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), is REM behavior disorder (RBD). This is characterized by the absence of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep, which leads to patients acting out their dreams, often violently (St Louis and Boeve, 2017). REM behavior disorder has been strongly linked to PD/DLB, with over 80% of RBD patients eventually developing PD or DLB on one cohort (Schenck et al., 2013). However, RBD can precede PD/DLB by decades in some cases, suggesting that RBD is a very early marker of brainstem neurodegeneration in these diseases (Borghammer and Van Den Berge, 2019).

Aside from RBD, PD/DLB patients often experience changes in sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness (Chahine et al., 2017; Videnovic and Golombek, 2013). Parkinson’s disease-related changes in circadian rhythms are also prominent, including dampened amplitude of activity and melatonin secretion (Breen et al., 2014; Videnovic and Golombek, 2013; Videnovic et al., 2014b; Whitehead et al., 2008). Rhythmic expression of circadian clock genes in blood has also been described in PD patients, with dampened amplitude of several transcripts and decreased Bmal1 expression (Breen et al., 2014; Cai et al., 2010). Pathologically, Lewy bodies have been reported in the SCN of PD patients, suggesting possible SCN degeneration as a mechanism of circadian dysfunction (De Pablo-Fernandez et al., 2018).

Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Huntington’s disease is characterized by progressive degeneration of the striatum in early middle age, causing choreiform movements, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and dementia (Roos, 2010).

Several studies have shown sleep and circadian disturbances in patients with HD. Decreased sleep quality (as assessed by sleep questionnaire) and sleep-wake fragmentation (as assessed by actigraphy) occur very early in the disease (Bellosta Diago et al., 2017; Lazar et al., 2015) and worsen with disease progression (Morton et al., 2005). Circadian melatonin rhythms are also blunted in HD (Kalliolia et al., 2014).

While human studies are limited, mouse models of HD, which express CAG-expanded human huntingtin, recapitulate the circadian dysfunction. These mice experience nearly total arrhythmicity as they age, with disrupted SCN function (Kudo et al., 2011; Morton et al., 2005). Importantly, re-establishing a day-night rhythm in HD mice by inducing sleep with the benzodiazepine alprazolam each morning was sufficient to improve cognitive function (Pallier et al., 2007), while daily blue light therapy to stimulate the SCN mitigated pathological transcriptional changes (Wang et al., 2017). Time restricted feeding in a mouse HD model during the active phase only, which helps align circadian and metabolic function, also improved rhythms in behavior and clock gene expression, as well as motor function (Whittaker et al., 2018).

3. Does circadian disruption influence the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases?

While sleep and circadian disruption is a well-established symptom of neurodegenerative disease, the evidence that sleep and or circadian disruption causes or accelerates the neurodegenerative process is less firm. The strongest evidence comes from the AD field. In mice, levels of Aβ peptide in the interstitial fluid of the hippocampus exhibit clear diurnal rhythms which correspond closely with the sleep-wake cycle, as Aβ levels increase during wake and decrease during sleep (Kang et al., 2009). This is consistent with data showing that Aβ is released from neurons during synaptic activity (Cirrito et al., 2005). Sleep deprivation in mice keeps Aβ levels elevated, while disruption of the circadian clock abrogates these rhythms in both sleep-wake cycle and Aβ (Kang et al., 2009; Kress et al., 2018). Sleep deprivation in mouse models of AD which express human APP and PS1 transgenes, and thus develop amyloid plaque pathology, greatly accelerates the accumulation of plaques. Conversely, sleep enhancement using the orexin receptor antagonist drug almorexant, or by genetic deletion of the sleep-modulating neuropeptide orexin, decreases plaque accumulation (Kang et al., 2009; Roh et al., 2014).

In humans, diurnal rhythms in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ can be observed, and acute sleep deprivation causes increases in CSF Aβ over the course of the night (Huang et al., 2012; Lucey et al., 2017; Ooms et al., 2014). Positron emission tomography imaging of amyloid plaques in humans suggests that a single night of sleep deprivation may slightly increase amyloid deposition (Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018). Sleep in mice is also associated with striking increases in glia-mediated fluid flow through the brain, termed “glymphatic” flow, which appears to mediate increased bulk clearance of Aβ from the brain (Xie et al., 2013). In humans, non-REM sleep is associated with waves of CSF movement which are coupled to vascular oscillations and may serve to remove metabolites and other waste products from the brain (Fultz et al., 2019).

Like Aβ, tau protein levels in the interstitial fluid also show diurnal oscillations and are increased by sleep deprivation in mice (Holth et al., 2019). Tau is also released from neurons during synaptic activity (Yamada et al., 2014), and sleep deprivation exacerbates tau pathology in human tau transgenic mice (Di Meco et al., 2014; Holth et al., 2019; Rothman et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2018). Moreover, acute sleep deprivation in humans causes increases in CSF tau levels, while chronic fragmented sleep is also associated with higher CSF tau (Holth et al., 2019; Ju et al., 2017).

Thus, sleep and the circadian system have striking effects on both Aβ and tau levels in humans and mice, and on plaque and tangle pathology in AD mouse models, strongly suggesting that decreased or fragmented sleep may influence AD pathogenesis.

Evidence of a role for the circadian system in disease pathogenesis in other neurodegenerative conditions is less clear, and generally restricted to mouse experiments. Circadian disruption by exposure to altered light: dark cycles (20h:4h light:dark) increases α-synuclein pathology in a mouse PD model (Lauretti et al., 2017). Similarly, exposure of mice expressing human mutant SOD1, which causes familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to 20h:4h light:dark cycle accelerated motor deficits, gliosis, and death (Huang et al., 2018). The ALS-associated gene fused in sarcoma (FUS), which encodes an RNA binding protein, shows strong circadian oscillation in the brain, is regulated by the clock protein REV-ERBα, and can inhibit PERIOD 2 expression, thereby altering core clock function (Jiang et al., 2018). Rats expressing mutant FUS also show marked circadian and sleep deficits which occur very early in the disease course (Zhang et al., 2018), though a causative role for circadian dysfunction has not been proven.

Epidemiological data is sparse, with one study suggesting that shift work (which causes circadian disruption and sleep abnormalities, among other things) during middle age may increase risk of late-life dementia (Bokenberger et al., 2018), but not PD (Chen et al., 2006; Schernhammer et al., 2015). A few small studies have suggested associations between polymorphisms in the circadian gene CLOCK (Chen et al., 2013a, 2013b; Yang et al., 2013) or BMAL1 (Chen et al., 2015) and risk of AD. Polymorphisms in BMAL1 or PER1 have also been associated with PD risk (Gu et al., 2015).

Thus, while current data is suggestive, particularly for AD, definitive evidence that sleep/circadian disruption is a causative agent in neurodegeneration is still lacking. Furthermore, specific cellular mechanisms linking the clock to neurodegeneration are still poorly understood. Circadian regulation of metabolism may represent such a link.

4. Circadian rhythms orchestrate cellular metabolism and bioenergetics in the periphery

It is well known that the circadian clock orchestrates cellular metabolism in peripheral cells thereby allowing oxidative and reductive cycles to synchronize with the sleep-wake cycle (Bass, 2016). The bidirectional relationship between the clock and metabolism has been reviewed extensively elsewhere (Bass and Takahashi, 2010; Eckel-Mahan and Sassone-Corsi, 2013; Panda, 2016). One major mechanism is through control of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which is canonically known as a coenzyme that mediates many cellular redox reactions. For example, cellular NAD+ levels in mouse hepatocytes oscillate as a result of clock-mediated transcriptional control of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in NAD+ biosynthesis (Nakahata et al., 2009; Ramsey et al., 2009). NAD+ deficiency is implicated in the aging process, and increasing NAD+ levels remains a major therapeutic anti-aging strategy (Imai and Guarente, 2014; Imai and Johnson, 2018).

Sirtuins, which are highly conserved NAD+-dependent deacetylases, have also been implicated in the regulation of many metabolic pathways influencing aging and neurodegeneration, and have strong interaction with the circadian clock (Houtkooper et al., 2012; Imai and Guarente, 2014). Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), the most studied sirtuin protein, regulates transcription of multiple core clock genes (Bmal1, Rorγ, Per2, Cry1) in mouse hepatocytes or fibroblasts (Asher et al., 2008; Nakahata et al., 2008). SIRT1 positively regulates circadian clock function via deacetylation of the clock protein PERIOD 2, as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis (Foteinou et al., 2018), and may influence chromatic remodeling (Nakahata et al., 2008).

Mitochondrial function exhibits circadian regulation at multiple levels, some of which are NAD+ dependent. For example, alterations in SIRT3 activity in mouse liver cells, regulated by NAD+ levels, results in an oscillatory pattern of mitochondrial oxidative function at the appropriate times in the solar cycle (Peek et al., 2013). Additionally, mitochondrial fission and mitophagy have been shown to be regulated by the clock protein BMAL1 in mouse hepatocytes (Jacobi et al., 2015) and by the clock protein and nuclear receptor REV-ERBα in mouse muscle (Woldt et al., 2013). While we know that autophagy and mitophagy are critical in neurodegeneration (Menzies et al., 2015), direct links to the circadian clock remain less well defined. Mitochondrial enzymes responsible for carbohydrate and lipid metabolism appear to accumulate in a diurnal manner dependent on clock proteins PER1/2 (Neufeld-Cohen et al., 2016). It is also noteworthy that the circadian clock machinery is also implicated in mouse mitochondrial regulation via reversible acetylation, reinforcing the notion that circadian machinery also governs through post-translational mechanisms (Masri et al., 2013).

The nutrient sensor mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) also interacts with the circadian clock. Insulin signaling and other nutrient-related pathways regulate mTOR activation, which is turn controls numerous cellular metabolic processes, including autophagy, oxidative stress responses, and protein synthesis (Liu and Sabatini, 2020). In the SCN, mTOR regulates entrainment of neuronal firing to light and helps to maintain synchrony of circadian output, as mTOR-deficient mice have a longer circadian period when kept in constant darkness (Cao et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2018). At a cellular level, mTOR regulates transcription of multiple clock genes, thereby directly influencing core clock function (Ramanathan et al., 2018). Insulin itself can alter core clock function by inducing PERIOD proteins via an mTOR-dependent mechanism (Crosby et al., 2019). Additionally, adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK), another nutrient-sensing kinase which functions upstream of mTOR, regulates the circadian clock via phosphorylation of CRYPTOCHROME (Lamia et al., 2009). Thus, nutrient sensing and cellular metabolism are intertwined with circadian clock function.

5. Circadian rhythms orchestrate cellular metabolism and bioenergetics in the CNS

While many studies demonstrate that the circadian clock regulates many aspects of metabolism in peripheral tissues, a smaller but growing body of literature suggests that the interplay between the circadian clock machinery and metabolism translates to the CNS. In the mouse cortex and hippocampus, deletion of BMAL1 results in age-dependent astrogliosis, synaptic degeneration, neuronal oxidative damage and decreased expression of several redox defense genes (Lananna et al., 2018; Musiek et al., 2013). Other lines of evidence support the concept that synaptic gene expression and protein phosphorylation are strongly influenced by the clock and sleep. In mice, circadian gene expression patterns are present in neuronal cell bodies, while striking rhythms in protein expression and phosphorylation are observed only in synapses (Brüning et al., 2019; Noya et al., 2019). Rhythmic proteins expressed in synapses during the mouse active phase (dark) were generally involved in neuronal metabolism, and these rhythms were abrogated by sleep deprivation (Noya et al., 2019), suggesting that sleep and the circadian system interact to support synaptic metabolic function.

Circadian regulation of NAD+, sirtuins, mTOR, and PGC-1α function may also play a significant role within the CNS, although this must still be inferred. Deletion of PGC-1α promotes neurodegeneration, while over-expression is protective (St-Pierre et al., 2006). Genetic or pharmacological activation of SIRT1 is neuroprotective in mouse AD and HD models, while SIRT1 deletion exacerbates degeneration (Jiang et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2007). Interaction between the clock and SIRT1 has also been demonstrated in the mouse SCN, where SIRT1 directly regulates central circadian control by activating BMAL1 and CLOCK via deacetylation of PGC-1α (Bonda et al., 2011; Chang and Guarente, 2013). Furthermore, aging was associated with decreased SIRT1 levels and decreased activation of BMAL1 and PER2, resulting in weakened circadian control (Chang and Guarente, 2013). Moreover, inhibition of mTOR in the brain is linked to autophagy and degradation of pathogenic proteins (Caccamo et al., 2013; Ravikumar et al., 2004; Tsvetkov et al., 2010), and mTOR inhibition has been proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases (Bové et al., 2011). Inhibition of mTOR has also been shown to increase lifespan in mice (Harrison et al., 2009). Taken together, these studies suggest metabolic regulation in the brain by the circadian clock could influence brain aging and neurodegeneration.

The circadian clock has been shown to interact with a number of other metabolic pathways, which are critical for brain health and neurodegeneration. The clock controls redox homeostasis through regulation of the Nrf2 pathway (Pekovic-Vaughan et al., 2014), glutathione homeostasis (Beaver et al., 2012), and interaction with the pentose phosphate pathway (Rey et al., 2016). Autophagy is also influenced by clock proteins, including REV-ERBα (Huang et al., 2016; Woldt et al., 2013). Circadian regulation of glial function could have profound effects on brain metabolism and neurodegeneration (Lananna et al., 2018; Marpegan et al., 2011). Thus, metabolic regulation by the circadian clock could influence neurodegeneration via many mechanisms, although at this point few have been thoroughly explored in the brain.

6. Conclusion and future directions

A deep understanding of how sleep and circadian clocks influence the panoply of brain metabolism and neurodegeneration could illuminate new therapeutic strategies. However, much is still unknown. The exact molecular pathways controlled by the circadian systems in different cell types of the brain, as well as the effects of clock perturbation in disease models are not well understood. Optimizing circadian function with clock-targeted drugs could, in theory, synergize multiple processes, including brain metabolism, inflammation, redox defenses, proteostasis, and synaptic function, to fight neurodegeneration on multiple fronts. Only with continued discovery can we potentially reach this goal and advance from initial efforts such as morning light exposure and melatonin supplementation to more nuanced strategies, harnessing specific clock-controlled pathways to protect the brain.
