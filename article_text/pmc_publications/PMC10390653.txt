INTRODUCTION:

We sought to characterize the timing of changes in cognitive trajectories related to genetic risk using the apolipoprotein E (APOE) score, a continuous measure of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk. We also aimed to determine if that timing was different when genetic risk was measured using an AD polygenic risk score (PRS) that contains APOE.

METHODS:

We analyzed trajectories (N≈1135) for four neuropsychological composite scores using mixed effects regression for longitudinal change across APOE scores and PRS of participants in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention, a longitudinal study of adults aged 40–70 at baseline, with a median participant follow-up time of 7.8 years.

RESULTS:

We found a significant non-linear age-by-APOE score interaction in predicting cognitive decline. Cognitive trajectories diverged by APOE score at approximately 65 years of age. A 0.5 SD difference in cognition between extreme percentiles of the PRS was predicted to occur 1–2 years before that of the APOE score.

DISCUSSION:

Cognitive decline differs across time and APOE score. Estimates did not substantially shift with the AD PRS.

pmc1. Introduction

Understanding the timing and order of cognitive changes preceding the clinical manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is critical for developing treatment and prevention strategies. Current theory suggests that pathological markers and cognition shift from normal to abnormal levels in a sigmoidal fashion over the 20 years preceding AD diagnosis.1 It is still unclear what controls the timing of these changes.

Numerous genetic variants are associated with overall risk of AD and cognitive decline, but their interaction with age and how they affect timing of preclinical cognitive decline remains poorly understood. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is a major factor that increases risk of AD, with homozygotes relative to APOE ε3/ε3 having an approximately 11-fold increased risk of clinically diagnosed AD and a 31-fold increased risk in neuropathologically confirmed AD.2 It is associated with lower cognitive function, earlier onset of AD proteinopathy and clinical syndrome, and cognitive decline in people who were later determined to have clinical or autopsy-confirmed AD.3–6 Although APOE is the strongest common genetic factor affecting risk of dementia due to AD, it is not the only one. AD is a genetically complex disease, and other variants are associated with AD clinical syndrome risk and dementia-related cognitive changes.7,8 Mixed results have been reported for the effect of AD polygenic risk scores (PRS) on cognitive function and decline preceding AD onset, and some of the PRS findings have been mainly from the effects of APOE 7. Although we know that genetics play an important role in overall cognitive function, AD risk, and cognitive decline post diagnosis, we know relatively little regarding how genetics influence the temporal evolution of cognitive decline preceding AD diagnosis.

Some evidence suggests that differences in decline by APOE ε4 carrier status can be detected around age 60.9,10 In contrast, other studies looking at APOE ε4 carrier status and specific APOE allele combinations have suggested that the difference is detected after 65 or 70 depending on the cognitive domain.11 While studies have evaluated the association between an AD PRS or variants besides those in APOE with the rate of cognitive decline,12–15 to our knowledge, no studies have examined at what age cognitive function and decline differs by an AD PRS in a preclinical cohort. Understanding the interactions of genetic factors and time with respect to cognitive function and decline will contribute to mapping the preclinical mechanistic changes leading to the clinical manifestation of AD. This not only contributes to our temporal understanding of the biology of AD and related dementias, but it also informs us of the proper timing for clinical trial and lifestyle interventions that target cognitive decline.

Using data from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP),16 we estimate the age when individuals with different genetic risk of AD clinical syndrome diverge in their cognitive function and in their rate of cognitive decline. We use two genetic measures, the APOE score and an AD PRS. We expand on previous research by (1) using cognitive composite scores from multiple domains as a measure of cognition instead of individual scores because composites have been shown to have lower intraindividual variability compared to single tests17; (2) representing APOE not as a count of ε4 alleles but as a numeric score, which we call the APOE score, that accounts for all six APOE allele combinations and models non-linear risk of AD; (3) analyzing additional AD risk variants in the form of a PRS; and (4) analyzing these genetic factors in relation to non-linear age in a cohort with a relatively long follow-up time.

2. Methods

2.1. Study population

Participants for this study came from the WRAP, an ongoing longitudinal study of 1662 people.16 WRAP is a convenience sample of people who were non-demented (preclinical) and 40 – 70 years old at baseline, who were fluent in English, and who had sufficient visual and auditory ability to participate in neuropsychological testing. It allows for the enrollment of siblings and is enriched for people with a parental history of AD, defined as a biological parent with autopsy-confirmed AD (~8%), probable AD dementia per medical record review (~83%), or dementia presumed due to AD based on the Dementia Questionnaire (~9%). Participants are followed up approximately every two years until a dementia diagnosis is made, or until drop out or death. Individuals provided signed informed consent, and this study was approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board.

The WRAP sample as of the May 2020 data release contained 1662 participants. Of those, 1344 people were genotyped and 1282 people’s samples passed quality control; 84 people of non-European genetic ancestry, as determined by principal component analysis of genome-wide data, were removed resulting in 1198 individuals.18 We use a sample with European genetic ancestry because the weights for genetic variants were derived in that population. We excluded individuals who reported having a parent with an age of memory loss onset before 60 years (individuals more likely to have early-onset AD, 52 people) and individuals with missing outcome and covariate data (11–17 people, depending on outcome). No additional exclusions were made for events that could affect cognitive performance including incident stroke or traumatic brain injury. Because missing data varied by the outcome variable, the final sample sizes also varied slightly ranging from 1129 to 1135 (Supplemental Table 1).

2.2. Measures

2.2.1. Cognition

We used one global and three domain-specific cognitive composite scores as our measures of cognition. Cognitive composite scores were generated as previously described.17 Each composite is the unweighted average of three psychometric test scores that were standardized (mean = 0, standard deviation [SD] = 1) prior to being averaged. The Trailmaking Test Part B (TMTb) score was multiplied by −1 before being included in a composite score so that higher values represent better performance, which is consistent with other tests. The immediate learning composite score is composed of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) total of five learning trials,19 the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) Logical Memory-I immediate memory (total of stories A and B),20 and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) total of three learning trials.21 The delayed recall composite score is composed of the RAVLT delayed recall, the WMS-R Logical Memory-II delayed memory subtest (total of stories A and B), and the BVMT-R delayed memory subtest. The executive function composite score is composed of the TMTb,22 the Stroop Color-Word Interference test,23 and the Digit Symbol Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised test.24 The modified preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite (PACC3), a measure of global cognition, was based on the test constructs described in Donohue et al.25 and is composed of the RAVLT total of five learning trials, the WMS-R Logical Memory-II delayed memory subtest, and the Digit Symbol Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised test.

2.2.2. Genetics

DNA was extracted from whole blood samples and genotyped using competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based KASP™ genotyping assays (LGC Genomics, Beverly, MA). DNA extraction and quality control were previously described.26 DNA was also genotyped using the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array and taken through quality control as previously described.18 For variants assessed with both technologies, we used values from the competitive allele-specific PCR-based technology instead of the array-based technology because of the higher quality of the allele-specific PCR genotyping (Supplemental Table 2).

The APOE score was derived from the rs429358 and rs7412 APOE variants. Because modeling APOE using ε4 count does not account for non-linear AD risk between combinations of ε2, ε3, and ε4 alleles,27 we created and used the APOE score as our main measure of APOE risk. The APOE score is a continuous measure that is the natural logarithm of the odds ratio (OR) of the APOE genotype (ε2/ε2, ε2/ε3, ε3/ε3, ε2/ε4, ε3/ε4, ε4/ε4) with AD case control status, with higher values indicating higher genetic risk of AD.26 APOE genotypes were derived from the two mentioned variants. Crude ORs for each genotype were calculated based on counts of AD cases and controls from the “Caucasian” population from the Alzgene database28,29 using the ε3/ε3 genotype as the reference category. The ORs for each APOE genotype were logarithm transformed to create the APOE score (Supplemental Table 3).

The PRS for AD was constructed based on a set of variants and summary statistics published by de Rojas et al.30 in their “supplementary data 4” table. To calculate the PRS for a given individual, the number of risk alleles for a variant were weighted by the effect size of that variant’s association with AD. Then all weighted variants were summed to form the PRS.31 Higher PRS values indicate higher genetic risk of clinical AD. The polygenic risk score from de Rojas et al. has 39 variants, of which our data had 36 (Supplemental Table 2). Unlike de Rojas et al., we also included the APOE score and rs145999145 (PLD3) in the PRS, the latter of which was weighted using the log of the OR reported by Cruchaga et al.32 This PLD3 variant is rare, present in our study participants, and strongly associated with AD.33

2.2.3. Covariates

Covariates in the analyses included education (years, maximum 20 years), sex (binary, 1 = female), and cognitive assessment practice effects. Practice effects quantified how much cognitive testing practice a person had at each visit and was measured as the number of previous tests a person took, which was equivalent to visit number – 1. To adjust for potential population stratification, genetic principal components were generated as previously described18 and were added in a sensitivity analysis.

2.3. Statistical analyses

2.3.1. Regression model building

To evaluate whether age-related cognitive trajectories differ by genetic risk, we used mixed effects regression as follows. For each of four cognitive outcomes, we built models stepwise and tested if additions improved model fit using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and an F-test with the “anova” function in R.34 We started with a null model to determine if the individual (repeated measures correlation) and family-cluster (sibling correlation) random intercepts, and the random slope for age at the participant level significantly improved model fit. We then added fixed effects starting with the crude association of the APOE score. In the following step, we added linear age (centered at 65) along with covariates (sex, education, and practice effects). Next, based on recent WRAP publications showing that non-linear patterns of cognitive decline are beginning to emerge as the sample ages,35,36 we evaluated if orthogonal polynomial terms for age (“poly” function in R), up to a cubic term, would improve the model fit. In the final modeling step, we added interactions between the APOE score and all age terms and compared that full model to the one without any interactions. If the full model was a better fit than the one without interactions, all interaction terms were retained even if one was not significant. For the PRS analysis, the fullest model for the APOE score was used replacing the APOE score with the AD PRS that contains the APOE score. For both the APOE score and AD PRS models, we conducted a sensitivity analysis adjusting the final model for the first five principal components of ancestry. All models used an unstructured variance-covariance structure; estimates were obtained using restricted maximum likelihood; the Kenward-Rodger approximation was used to determine degrees of freedom; and an alpha of 0.05 was the significance criterion. Regression diagnostics were performed for all models. This included evaluating mean structure and heteroscedasticity using residual versus fitted value plots and normality using quantile-quantile plots.

2.3.2. Estimate age of cognitive divergence by genetic risk

When there were significant age by APOE score interactions, we used the interaction model derived above to calculate adjusted means of cognitive scores and 95% confidence intervals (CI) at several genetic risk levels across the age range in our sample. The means and CIs were extracted using the “emmeans” package37 in R and used to estimate the age when cognitive function began to differ between APOE scores. The age of divergence was the approximate 5-year age range when confidence intervals for the highest (2.54) and middle (0.00) APOE score mean cognitive levels no longer overlapped. To estimate the rate of cognitive change (i.e., simple APOE score slopes at various ages), we calculated the slope and 95% CI of the mean cognitive values extracted in the previous step. The Kenward-Rodger approximation was used to determine degrees of freedom. Similar steps were applied to estimate the mean cognition for the analyses with an age by PRS interaction.

2.3.3. Post Hoc: Compare APOE score and AD PRS with APOE age of cognitive divergence

To evaluate how additional genetic variants change the age when differences in cognitive trajectories are observed, we compared the APOE score to an AD PRS—composed of the APOE score and additional variants. Using the estimates from the interaction models, we calculated the difference in mean cognition across age between high and low risk groups of each respective score. For each genetic measure, we extracted and compared the age when there was a 0.5 SD difference in the predicted cognition. A 0.5 SD difference is more clinically meaningful than the simple point when differences are statistically significant. The high and low values were 2.56 (ε4/ε4) and −0.7 (ε2/ε2) for the APOE score and 3.37 (100th percentile) and −1.78 (0 percentile) for the PRS. We used extreme percentiles of the PRS because they are the closest conceptual equivalent to the two extreme APOE score risk levels. In addition, the extremes for the APOE score and the AD PRS with APOE were used to provide a best-case scenario comparison, the maximum extent of each score. However, we also plot mean cognitive differences relative to the 0.00 APOE score (ε3/ε3) and the 50th percentile of the AD PRS for readers who wish to see estimates corresponding to commonly used reference points.

3. Results

3.1. Sample characteristics

The WRAP analytic sample contains data from up to 6 study visits per person, with a median of 4 visits. This covers up to 13 years of follow-up, with a median participant follow-up time of 7.8 years and a mean time between visits of 2.5 years. At baseline (visit 2, as composite scores are not available for visit 1), the sample was mostly composed of females and people with the equivalent of a college degree, with a mean age of 59 years (Table 1). This sample includes individuals across all APOE genotypes (Supplemental Figure 1).

3.2. Association of the APOE score and age with cognitive composite scores

The final model for each cognitive outcome included random intercepts for individual and family, and a random slope for age at the participant level. Covariates included sex, education, practice effects (number of tests taken previously), and age (centered at 65 years). Age was modeled as a cubic polynomial for all outcomes except executive function where a quadratic polynomial provided the best fit. All final models included interactions between the APOE score and each age term.

The APOE score by age interaction was significant for all cognitive composite outcomes (Table 2). People with higher APOE scores have lower mean cognitive function at age 65 and higher rates of decline at older ages compared to people with lower APOE scores (Table 2, Figure 1). A sensitivity analysis adjusting for the first five principal components negligibly affected estimates (results not shown). Note that the APOE score was included as a continuous measure in the regression analyses. For ease of interpretation, estimates in figures are provided for APOE scores that correspond to APOE genotypes as opposed to whole units or percentiles of the APOE score.

3.3. Age of cognitive divergence by APOE score

We identified the approximate 5-year age range when confidence intervals no longer overlapped for mean predicted cognitive levels between high (2.56) and middle (0.00) APOE score risk levels based on estimates from the interaction models (Table 2). For all cognitive composites, the age of detectable cognitive trajectory differences occurs very close to 65 years based on the models of our sample (Figure 1, Table 3). For executive function and PACC3 (global cognition), the divergence in trajectories occurs between 60 and 65 years. For immediate learning and delayed recall, the divergence occurs between 65 and 70 years.

3.4. Post-hoc: Difference in age of cognitive divergence between APOE score and AD PRS with APOE

We compared the age of cognitive divergence for the APOE score and an AD PRS (including the APOE score) to evaluate if additional genetic variants associated with AD shift the age when differences in cognitive levels between genetic risk categories are detected. For both the APOE score and AD PRS models (Supplemental Table 4), we calculated the age when the difference in cognition between the highest and lowest risk level of each genetic score reached 0.5 SD. For the APOE score, there was a 0.5 SD difference between an APOE score of −0.7 (ε2/ε2) and 2.56 (ε4/ε4) at age 69, 70, 70, and 69 for immediate learning, delayed recall, executive function, and PACC3, respectively (top row, Figure 2). For the AD PRS, there was a 0.5 SD difference between a PRS of −1.78 (0th percentile) and 3.37 (100th percentile) at age 68, 69, 68, and 67 for immediate learning, delayed recall, executive function, and PACC3, respectively (bottom row, Figure 2). In this descriptive assessment, the 0.5 SD difference in cognition between extreme values of each genetic measure is a year earlier for the PRS relative to the APOE score for immediate learning and delayed recall and two years earlier for executive function and PACC3.

4. Discussion

This project’s goal was to evaluate the temporal relationship between genetic risk of dementia due to AD and cognitive decline in WRAP, a preclinical cohort with over 13 years of longitudinal cognitive assessment. We aimed to build on existing evidence that genetic factors are tied to cognitive decline rates by estimating the age when differences in cognition among genetic risk levels for AD emerge. We used a relatively novel measure, the APOE score, to model genetic risk of AD from APOE and found that APOE interacts with age non-linearly to affect four composite cognitive measures. For immediate learning, delayed recall, executive function, and global function (PACC3), higher APOE scores were associated with lower cognitive function at the centered age of 65 and increasing rates of cognitive decline over age. This is consistent with findings that APOE affects the age of clinical and pathological AD onset and is associated with cognitive decline not just overall cognitive function (i.e., associated with the rate of change in cognitive function not just cross-sectional cognitive differences).42,43 Interestingly, similar analyses with slightly different cognitive measures in the WRAP sample a few years ago did not yield any effect of APOE or the APOE by age interaction on cognition.16 Additional follow-up time or the use of more sensitive composites may have led to these new findings. This kind of discrepancy in findings over age is highlighted in a meta-analysis of APOE’s effects on several cognitive domains in mid-life (35–60 years).44 No combined APOE effects across studies were significant for any cognitive domain. However, the authors noted that several studies did demonstrate cognitive differences by APOE in participants older than 55 years.

We applied the regression models to estimate the age when differences between genetic risk levels would emerge in our sample. Across the four cognitive composite scores, predicted cognition began to diverge at approximately age 65 (Figure 1). Executive function and PACC3 changes occurred slightly earlier than those of immediate learning and delayed recall. Recent work examining the association of β-amyloid (Aβ) (which is influenced by APOE45) and cognitive function found that Aβ was associated with executive function but not measures of delayed recall.46 Aβ is the first discernable pathological change to occur in AD,47 so this association could explain why changes in executive function occurred earlier. PACC3 and the executive function composite score both include the Digit Symbol Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised test, which could explain why PACC3 changes also occurred earlier. Our findings using the APOE score are a little later than what was reported by Caselli et al.9,10,48 for memory domains and APOE ε4 count, for which cognitive function differences were detectable around age 60. However, Caselli et al. did not find significant differences in cognitive performance across age by APOE ε4 count for measures of executive function, whereas we did. The estimates in our sample are approximately the same as those reported by Gharbi-Meliani et al.11 in the Whitehall II study. They reported that APOE ε4 homozygotes performed worse compared to non-carriers on a composite measure of global cognition starting at age 65. Cognition for APOE ε4 heterozygotes compared to non-carriers became worse between 70 and 75 years and was better before age 55. Any inconsistencies across studies could be due to the use of different cognitive measures, slight differences in modeling covariates, and population sample differences.

When we extended this analysis to evaluate how additional genetic variants added to the APOE score (in the form of an AD PRS with APOE) influence the age when cognitive differences emerge, we found that differences in cognition by PRS occurred one to two years earlier than by the APOE score alone. This difference is minimal in the context of making decisions about lifestyle interventions or clinical trial recruitment. This also implicates APOE as the main driver of these cognitive differences in the WRAP sample, which has also been reported in other samples.13 In addition, a recent cross-sectional analysis of the UK Biobank,49 which also evaluated the age of cognitive divergence by an AD PRS that included APOE and was composed of similar variants as ours, found in sensitivity analyses that the interaction between the PRS and age was not significant if APOE was taken out of the PRS and included as a separate term in the models. Our results as well as others that use a PRS could fluctuate with the addition of variants to the PRS. Many AD PRS exist, which were built on different principles. For measure reproducibility, we used a PRS30 that included a specific set of variants instead of one based on a p-value threshold, whose variant composition can differ depending on a particular sample’s linkage disequilibrium structure and other factors. Also, we chose PRS values at extreme high and low percentiles in this estimate, which may not be stable across populations. However, using them illustrates the maximum extent the PRS could influence the age when cognitive differences emerge in this sample. Despite this, we only observed a difference of one year in immediate learning and delayed recall and two years in executive function and PACC3.

Relatively few studies have examined the specific timing of genetic effects on cognition in a preclinical cohort beyond the main effect of genetics on cognitive function and decline. Our study delves into this by using cognitive composite scores that are sensitive to aging related changes. We also add to existing research operationalizing APOE risk with the APOE score. Typically, APOE risk is modeled by ε4 allele carrier status (carrier or non-carrier) or count (0, 1, 2), which have the disadvantage of masking risk variation by collapsing the six APOE allele combinations (ε2/ε2, ε2/ε3, ε3/ε3, ε2/ε4, ε3/ε4, ε4/ε4). When modeling all six allele combinations is desired, the APOE score also avoids power loss because it is a continuous instead of categorical variable. This approach to modeling APOE is relatively new but has been applied in a few other contexts.2,26,50 Another strength of this study is that we model age non-linearly. Although including non-linear age in cognition models is not new, it is not standard practice. When possible, we recommend modeling age non-linearly to capture variation in the genetic effect on cognition. Several studies have shown the effects of PRS on AD, cognition, and cognitive decline, with mixed results.7 To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the specific timing of cognitive changes related to an AD PRS in a preclinical longitudinal cohort. The additional variants captured by a PRS could provide more insight on the biology of AD relating to the order of pathological changes in the preclinical stage. However, the PRS used in this study may not be directly comparable to that used in other studies because of variant composition.

Because WRAP is a convenience sample enriched for individuals with a family history of AD, these results should be interpreted as a preliminary step in understanding the temporal role of genetic factors in AD biology. Our age estimates may be biased towards an earlier age compared to estimates from a population-based sample because individuals in our sample may be more likely to experience earlier cognitive change resulting from their family history. However, convenience samples can have healthier volunteers than a population-based sample, which could result in better cognitive performance estimates for the former.51 Because of model complexity and limited sample size, we were also not able to account for interactions or differences among sex, age, and APOE, which have been important in other analyses of cognition.52,53 The inclusion of these terms may have provided more nuance to the sample estimates especially because our sample is predominantly female. The sample being predominantly white and female limits the generalizability of our findings. For example, the association between APOE ε4 carrier status and learning decline and verbal memory is stronger in females than in males,54 which means that the age estimates from our study may be earlier than studies with more balanced proportions of males and females. Likewise, the APOE association with risk of AD and age of AD onset has been inconsistent and more often lacking in African-American populations.55 Social and structural factors like more disadvantaged neighborhood environments can modify and even mask the effects of APOE on cognition.56 Therefore, our estimates of age-related differences in APOE’s effects on cognition may not be generalizable to populations with higher proportions of historically disadvantaged racial background groups, where the effects of APOE are potentially attenuated.

Future work in this area would benefit from evaluating cognitive trajectories among individuals who go on to develop dementia. Very few WRAP participants in our analytic sample had dementia, so we were not able to carry out analyses to understand how our findings relate to dementia-specific cognitive changes compared to non-dementia related ones. In addition, future research could investigate the temporal relationship between genetics and biomarkers of AD proteinopathy in relationship to cognitive decline. It is still not fully understood how these biomarker changes interact with each other. Investigating the timing of these effects can lead to better understanding of the order of the biomarker cascade1 and insight about what risk factors initiate changes in other risk factors.

Figure 1: Predicted mean cognitive levels (left column) and slope of cognitive levels (right column) for APOE score groups across age from the APOE score by age interaction models.

The predicted mean cognitive level in SD (left) and the difference in SD across age (right) for each composite score is on the y-axis, and age in years is represented on the x-axis. Estimates come from regression models for immediate learning, delayed recall, executive function, and PACC3 that include the APOE score, age, age2, age3 (all except executive function), APOE score by age[1−3] (inclusive of all polynomial terms), sex, education, practice effects, random intercepts for individual and family, and random slope for age. Bands represent 95% CIs. For these estimates, sex was set to female, education to 16 years (sample mean), and practice effects to 2 tests. Estimates are truncated to be within the age range of participants for a particular genetic group. Sample sizes for each genetic group are provided in the legend. Sample size varies slightly by cognitive outcome (see Supplemental Table 1). Values presented are for the outcome with largest sample size.

Figure 2: Difference in predicted mean cognition across age by genetic group and comparison of APOE score to AD PRS with APOE.

Immediate learning, delayed recall, executive function, and PACC3 differences (y-axis) across age (x-axis) are shown for APOE score groups (top row, blue) and the AD PRS with APOE (middle row, green) from a given genetic reference group (APOE score of 0 [e3/e3] and PRS of −0.03 [50th percentile]). A positive difference indicates better cognition than the reference, and a negative difference indicates worse cognition than the reference. Vertical lines mark the age when the difference in cognition is 0.5 SD between the extreme genetic risk categories (APOE score −0.7 and 2.56, and PRS of −1.78 and 3.37) is 0.5 SD. The bottom row shows the numerical value of those ages. Bands represent 95% CIs for the difference value. For these estimates, sex was set to female, education to 16 years (sample mean), and practice effects to 2 tests.

* Select APOE scores and ages are presented in this table, whereas the corresponding figure includes estimates for all APOE values.

† Estimates come from regression models for immediate learning, delayed recall, executive function, and PACC3 that include the APOE score, age, age2, age3 (all except executive function), APOE score by age[1−3] (inclusive of all polynomial terms), sex, education, practice effects, random intercepts for individual and family, and random slope for age. For these estimates, sex was set to female, education to 16 years (sample mean), and practice effects to 2 tests.

‡ The slope is of the line tangent to the predicted mean curve at the specified age.
