BACKGROUND:

Obstructive sleep apnea, characterized by sleep fragmentation and chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression. Recent epidemiological studies point to CIH as the best predictor of developing cognitive decline and AD in older adults with obstructive sleep apnea. However, the precise underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of CIH on pathological human tau seeding, propagation, and accumulation; cognition; synaptic plasticity; neuronal network excitability; and gene expression profiles in a P301S human mutant tau mouse model of AD and related tauopathies.

METHODS:

We exposed 4- to 4.5-month-old male P301S and wild-type mice to an 8-week CIH protocol (6-min cycle: 21% O2 to 8% O2 to 21% O2, 80 cycles per 8 hours during daytime) and assessed its effect on tau pathology and various AD-related phenotypic and molecular signatures. Age- and sex-matched P301S and wild-type mice were reared in normoxia (21% O2) as experimental controls.

RESULTS:

CIH significantly enhanced pathological human tau seeding and spread across connected brain circuitry in P301S mice; it also increased phosphorylated tau load. CIH also exacerbated memory and synaptic plasticity deficits in P301S mice. However, CIH had no effect on seizure susceptibility and network hyperexcitability in these mice. Finally, CIH exacerbated AD-related pathogenic molecular signaling in P301S mice.

CONCLUSIONS:

CIH-induced increase in pathologic human tau seeding and spread and exacerbation of other AD-related impairments provide new insights into the role of CIH and obstructive sleep apnea in AD pathogenesis.


pmcAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, profoundly compromising cognitive abilities of affected individuals and representing an enormous socioeconomic burden (1). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, is an important risk factor in the development and progression of AD (2,3). OSA is characterized by sleep fragmentation and chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), and recent epidemiological studies point to CIH as the best predictor of developing cognitive decline and AD dementia in the elderly with OSA (2–4). However, there is an important gap in knowledge surrounding the mechanism(s) by which CIH leads to exacerbation of AD pathology and cognitive dysfunction.

Misfolded, abnormally hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau accumulate as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD (5). Tau pathology is a major neuropathological hallmark of AD besides amyloid-β and is known to correlate better with cognitive impairment in AD than amyloid-β pathology (6). In recent years, tau spread has been identified as a critical process in AD progression (7–9). Tau spread was demonstrated in AD mouse models (7,9,10) and in human patients with AD (11). Higher cerebrospinal fluid levels of total tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were reported in cognitively normal individuals and individuals with mild cognitive impairment with OSA compared with those without OSA (12). CIH was also reported to increase p-tau in C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice (13). However, it remains to be evaluated how CIH affects tau propagation and other AD-related physiological and molecular deficits in a relevant mouse model. This study was undertaken to analyze CIH’s effect on pathological tau seeding, propagation, and accumulation; cognition; synaptic plasticity; neuronal network excitability; and gene expression profiles in a mutant human tau mouse model of AD and related tauopathies (P301S mice).

METHODS AND MATERIALS

Study Outline

The study was conducted with P301S mice (14) and WT mice in three batches. In the first batch, P301S mice were injected intrahippocampally with human AD tau (AD p-tau) or saline and subjected to 8-week CIH (P301S-CIH and WT-CIH) or normoxia (P301S-N and WT-N) exposure for evaluation of pathological tau seeding and spread (Figure 1A). In the second batch, P301S/WT mice were exposed to 8-week CIH (P301S-CIH and WT-CIH) or normoxia (P301S-N and WT-N) for behavioral, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses. In the third batch, P301S/WT mice were exposed to 8-week CIH or normoxia for pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure susceptibility and electrophysiological studies.

CIH Exposure

CIH exposure paradigm is depicted in Figure 1B. Briefly, CIH apparatus, which consists of InVivo O2 cabinets, O2 controller and sensor, and circulating fans, was purchased from Coy Laboratory Products (Grass Lake, MI). CIH was induced by exposing mice for 8 hours per day during daytime for 8 weeks in a commercially designed chamber.

Preparation of Tau Seeds From Human AD Brain Tissue

Oligomeric AD p-tau was isolated from the cerebral cortex of a frozen autopsied AD brain as described previously (15–18).

Stereotaxic Intrahippocampal Injection of AD p-tau

AD p-tau seeds were unilaterally injected into the hippocampus of P301S mice (Figure 1C), as described previously (16,17).

Immunohistochemical Staining and Quantification of p-tau and NFTs With AT8+ High-Intensity Staining for Tau Seeding and Spread Evaluation

Immediately after 8 weeks of CIH or normoxia exposure, brain tissue was harvested and processed as described previously (16,17,19). The details of immunohistochemical staining (AT8 and thioflavin-S) and quantification of NFTs for tau seeding/ spread are provided in the Supplemental Methods.

Behavioral Procedures

Elevated Plus Maze.

Elevated plus maze task was used to evaluate anxiety-/disinhibition-like behavior, as described previously (19).

Open Field.

Exploratory activity was evaluated by allowing the mice to individually explore an open field arena in a single 10-minute session (19).

Object Recognition/Discrimination Task.

Long-term episodic recognition memory performance was evaluated in an object recognition/discrimination (ORD) task in open field arena, as described previously (19,20).

Immunoblotting for tau Evaluation

Western blotting for p-tau, human tau, and total tau was performed, as described previously (19).

RNA-Seq Analysis

Whole hippocampal mRNA was extracted from flash frozen tissue. RNA-Seq analysis was performed as described previously (21) and is detailed in Supplemental Methods.

PTZ-Induced Seizures

PTZ-induced seizure susceptibility was evaluated by seizure severity scoring (22).

In Vitro Hippocampal Slice Electrophysiology

Coronal brain slices containing the hippocampal formation were prepared immediately after CIH/normoxia exposure, and electrophysiological studies were performed, as described previously (23–26) and detailed in Supplemental Methods.

Statistical Analysis

The RNA-Seq and electrophysiology data analyses are described in their relevant sections in Supplemental Methods. For behavioral and immunohistochemical experiments, data were analyzed using one-way or two-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post hoc test.

RESULTS

CIH Enhances Pathological Human Tau Seeding and Spread in P301S Mice

At 8 weeks after AD p-tau injection, we found robust high-intensity AT8+ staining in the ipsilateral CA1 region of AD p-tau–injected P301S mice (Figure 1D). The seeded AT8+ high-intensity somatodendritic tau profiles were also positive for thioflavin-S (Figure 1E). These data confirmed that AD p-tau has seeding activity and led to NFTs as early as 8 weeks after injection in 4-month-old P301S mice. Remarkably, CIH exposure significantly increased NFTs in the ipsilateral hippocampus of the AD p-tau–injected mice compared with normoxia-reared control mice (Figure 1F), suggesting enhancement of tau seeding by CIH.

To quantify pathological tau spread to distant brain regions from the injection site, we compared tau pathology between the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus and whole brain. We found only a few AT8+ NFTs in the mice injected with saline and no differences between the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus and whole brain in the saline-P301S-normoxia group (Figure 1D, F). Comparatively, a larger number of AT8+ NFTs were observed in both normoxia- and CIH-exposed AD p-tau–injected mice, and a higher number of NFTs were noted on the ipsilateral side as compared with the side contralateral to the AD p-tau injection, suggesting successful seeding of pathological tau (Figure 1D, F, G). Significantly higher AT8+ NFTs were found in the contralateral hippocampus of the mice injected with AD p-tau than in saline-injected mice (Figure 1D, F). The number of NFTs in the mice injected with AD p-tau was several-fold higher than mice injected with saline in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus (Figure 1F) and in the ipsilateral whole brain (Figure 1G), suggesting that AD p-tau was taken up by neurons at the injection site and that tau pathology from the seeded neurons of the ipsilateral hippocampus spread to the contralateral hippocampus. The number of AT8+ NFTs was significantly higher in the contralateral hippocampus in the CIH-exposed, AD p-tau–injected P301S mice than in normoxia-reared, AD p-tau–injected P301S mice. While we observed a significant increase in tau spread to the contralateral hippocampus after CIH exposure, the increase in the contralateral hemisphere did not reach significance, which could be attributed to the shorter time duration from human tau injection to the evaluation of tau spread (8 weeks). We also found significantly increased intensity of AT8+ neurons in the ipsilateral and contralateral dentate gyrus of CIH-exposed P301S mice when compared with normoxia-reared P301S mice (Figure 1H, I). Overall, CIH exposure not only increased AD p-tau seeding but also facilitated pathological tau propagation in P301S mice.

CIH Exacerbates Cognitive Impairment in P301S Mice and Induces Cognitive Deficit in WT Mice

In the ORD memory task, all groups of mice, on average, spent equal time exploring the two similar objects during the training phase (Figure 2A, B). In the test phase (intertrial interval, 24 hours; long-term memory [LTM]), CIH-exposed 6- to 6.5-month-old WT mice exhibited a significantly impaired novelty preference (discrimination index [DI], 58.5%) as compared with normoxia-reared age-matched WT control mice (DI, 75.2%) (Figure 2B), suggesting an LTM deficit in these mice. As reported previously (27), the P301S-N mice exhibited a significant episodic LTM deficit (DI, 59.5%) as compared with the WT-N group (Figure 2B). Remarkably, P301S-CIH mice exhibited a below chance–level performance, spent more time in the familiar object zone (DI, 44.03%), and were significantly impaired compared with the P301S-N group (Figure 2B). We did not observe significant differences in behavior in elevated plus maze and open field tasks in P301S-CIH mice (Figure S4A–H in Supplement 1). WT-CIH mice weighed significantly less than WT-N control mice at the end of 8-week exposure (Figure S4K in Supplement 1).

CIH Induces an Increase in p-tau Burden in P301S Mice

We further evaluated the effect of CIH on p-tau in P301S and WT mice (Figure 2C–F). Tau is a neuronal microtubule-associated protein that plays essential roles in microtubule assembly, stabilization, and axonal transport. In AD and related tauopathies, there is abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau, which leads to reduced binding of tau to microtubules and subsequent accumulation as NFTs and neurodegeneration (5). We investigated the effect of CIH on p-tau and total tau using phosphorylation-specific antibodies, AT8 (Ser202/Thr205), PHF1 (pSer396/pSer404), AT180 (pThr231), and pSer199; Tau5, which recognizes both human and murine tau; and a human tau–specific antibody, HT7. We observed a significantly higher amount of total tau (Tau5) in P301S-N mice than in WT-N mice (Figure 2C, D), as expected for a mutant human tau overexpression mouse model (14). This was further confirmed by the presence of human tau in P301S mice and complete absence in WT mice (Figure 2C, D). CIH exposure did not affect total tau and human tau levels in P301S mice (Figure 2C, D). As expected (14), we found an increase in p-tau (AT8) in 6- to 6.5-month-old P301S mice as compared with WT control mice (Figure 2C, D). CIH did not affect expression level of p-tau in WT mice (Figure 2C, D); however, CIH-exposed P301S mice showed a significant increase in p-tau expression as compared with P301S-N mice (Figure 2C, D). We also observed a significant increase in p-tau expression in CIH-exposed P301S mice as compared with P301S-N mice by immunohistochemistry (Figure 2E, F). However, we did not observe any significant differences in p-tau levels with PHF1 (pSer396/ pSer404), AT180 (pThr231), and pSer199 (Figure 2C, D) and in the levels of total tau in soluble and insoluble fractions with CIH exposure (data not shown).

CIH Exacerbates Microglial Activation in P301S Mice and Induces Activation of Microglia in WT Mice

Several studies have shown that the microglia are in close proximity to NFTs in AD (28,29) and are capable of phagocytosing pathological tau (30–32) to undergo activation. We evaluated the effect of CIH on microglial activation in P301S and WT mice (Figure 3A, B). We observed a significant increase in CD68 expression in CIH-exposed WT and P301S mice when compared with WT-N and P301S-N mice, respectively (Figure 3B). Microglial morphophenotypes have been shown to be associated with microglial activation status (33–35). We also performed Sholl analysis to measure microglial cellular complexity (Figure 3C) and found a significant reduction in microglial cell complexity in CIH-exposed P301S mice when compared with P301S-N mice (Figure 3C).

CIH Exacerbates Short- and Long-term Synaptic Plasticity Deficit in P301S Mice

We next investigated the effect of CIH on synaptic plasticity in P301S and WT mice (Figure 4A–D). Synaptic plasticity impairment in P301S mice at 6 months of age was reported previously (14). First, we examined the effect of CIH on a presynaptically mediated, short-term form of synaptic plasticity, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). PPF was deficient in P301S mice as compared with WT control mice (Figure 4C) (100-ms interstimulus interval, p = .048); CIH exposure further exacerbated this deficit in P301S mice (Figure 4C) (100-ms interstimulus interval). Long-term potentiation (LTP), a persistent form of synaptic plasticity, induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) of the Schaffer collateral synapses in CA1, showed a trend toward impairment in P301S-N mice as compared with WT-N mice, with regard to both induction and maintenance (Figure 4D) (LTP induction, immediately after TBS, time = 0–10 min; LTP maintenance, time = 50–60 min after TBS). CIH further exacerbated the deficit in LTP maintenance in P301S mice (Figure 4D). These data suggested exacerbation of synaptic plasticity deficit in P301S mice by CIH exposure.

CIH Does Not Affect PTZ-Induced Seizure Susceptibility and Hippocampal Neuronal Network Excitability in P301S or WT Mice

In recent years, network hyperexcitability has been recognized as an important pathophysiological feature of AD (36). Neuronal activation has also been reported to enhance the propagation of tau pathology (10). We thus asked whether the increase in tau spread induced by CIH could be due to enhanced network excitability. We evaluated the effect of CIH exposure on PTZ-induced seizure susceptibility (Figure S1 in Supplement 1). While P301S-N mice exhibited higher susceptibility to PTZ-induced seizures than the WT-N cohort, CIH had no effect on seizure severity in either genotype (Figure S1A–C in Supplement 1). We further studied, in field recordings in hippocampal slices, the effect of CIH on epileptiform activity on CA1 pyramidal cell layer stimulus-evoked bursts after bicuculline application (50 mM, GABAA [gamma-aminobutyric acid A] blocker) (Figures S2 and S3 in Supplement 1). Longer-duration discharges were observed in P301S mice slices (irrespective of CIH/normoxia exposure) than in WT slices. These data further corroborated our in vivo seizure susceptibility data that P301S mice have enhanced network excitability that is not altered by CIH.

CIH Exacerbates AD-Related Molecular Signatures in P301S and WT Mice

CIH exposure in WT mice altered the expression of 158 genes (adjusted p value &lt; .05, |fold-change| ≥ 1.5) (Figure 5Aa). Top pathways identified from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were related to unfolded protein response, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, CDK5 signaling, and glutamate receptor signaling pathways (Figure 5Ab). CIH exposure in P301S mice altered the expression of 334 genes (adjusted p value &lt; .05, |fold-change| ≥ 1.5) (Figure 5Ba). Top pathways identified from DEG analysis were related to mitochondrial dysfunction, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, ERK5 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5) signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, and sirtuin signaling (Figure 5Bb). To measure the similarity of genome-wide expression changes between DEGs from P301S and WT mice exposed to normoxia and CIH in a threshold-free manner, we used rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (37). The stratified heatmap shows four quadrants, which show the enrichment overlap between two datasets among all combinations of up-and downregulated genes. Upper right quadrant shows overlap in genes downregulated in both studies. Lower left quadrant shows overlap in genes upregulated in both studies. Lower right and upper left quadrants represent overlap in genes downregulated in one and upregulated in the other and upregulated in one and downregulated in the other, respectively. Significant overlap was observed only in concordant gene expression changes (Figure 5C, D). Genes from this overlap also mapped to pathways regulating proteostasis and mitochondrial function that are responsible for pathogenic signaling in P301S mice (Figure 5E). These data indicated that CIH exposure in WT mice caused dysregulation of the same genes that are responsible for pathogenic signaling in P301S mice; strikingly, CIH exposure exacerbated this pathogenic signaling in P301S mice.

Gene expression pathways enriched in CIH-exposed P301S mice when compared with CIH-exposed WT mice (Figure 6Ba, b) were similar to the pathogenic signaling pathways found in P301S mice when compared with WT mice under normoxic conditions (Figure 6Aa, b). This shows that CIH exacerbated pathogenic signaling in the hippocampus of P301S mice. Furthermore, evaluation of threshold-free overlap from DEGs of WT mice and P301S mice exposed to CIH also resulted in significant overlap only in concordant gene expression changes (Figure 6C, D). Genes from this overlap mapped to pathways regulating proteostasis, mitochondrial function, and synaptogenesis, similar to overlap observed in CIH exposure in WT and P301S mice (Figure 6E). These results further highlight the similar gene expression changes occurring in WT mice, which are responsible for the pathogenic signaling in P301S mice, and CIH exposure exacerbated this signaling in P301S mice.

In addition, to identify significant overlap with human AD, we used MEGENA (38) to generate expression modules and identified significant overlaps with the Mount Sinai Brain Bank human AD dataset (39,40) in the P301S hypoxia versus P301S normoxia and WT hypoxia versus WT normoxia comparisons (Figures S5 and S6 in Supplement 1; Table S1 in Supplement 2). The role of driver genes from overlapping modules in hypoxia and tau spread will be the subject of future work.

DISCUSSION

This study provides important new insights regarding how CIH contributes to AD’s cellular, molecular, synaptic, and ultimately cognitive dysfunction. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the enhancement of pathological human tau seeding and propagation by CIH exposure in a relevant tau mouse model. Tau spread is believed to be a critical process in the progression of AD pathology (7–11,41). Spread of tau from the medial temporal lobe to other neocortical areas coincides with the appearance of cognitive dysfunction (8,42). Thus, our data showing enhancement of pathological tau seeding and spread by CIH carry great translational significance. Furthermore, we report that CIH exacerbates synaptic plasticity and memory deficits without affecting neuronal network excitability and enhances AD-related gene expression in P301S mice. Overall, these data provide important preclinical rodent model experimental evidence across multiple parameters of the risk and progression of AD linked to OSA in humans.

It is imperative to mention here the limitations of modeling OSA in mice that must be taken into account when interpreting our data. First, OSA is not frequently observed naturally in nonhuman animals and must therefore be induced (43). CIH induction in mice does not take obesity into account. As OSA in humans is characteristically associated with obesity, this may be an important difference between natural and induced CIH. Second, patients with OSA develop hypercapnia, with elevated blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels (44,45). However, animals exposed to induced CIH develop reduced levels of CO2 in the blood (hypocapnia) (44). Different blood CO2 levels may affect other aspects of hypoxia and OSA, or they may be indicative of an underlying distinction between the two conditions. Third, we exposed mice to CIH during daytime, because mice are nocturnally active, to mimic human OSA by inducing CIH during sleeping hours of mice. However, this CIH during sleeping hours might have induced some degree of sleep deprivation/fragmentation (46,47). Fourth, CIH induction was performed at room temperature and the effect of hypoxia-induced hypothermia on tau phosphorylation has not been measured.

CIH-induced increase in tau spread could be via multiple mechanisms. Tau hyperphosphorylation was previously shown to determine tau spread (17). Here, we observed a significant increase in p-tau in CIH-exposed P301S mice. This increase in p-tau could be a possible mechanism by which CIH induced enhancement of human tau spread. Neuronal hyperexcitability was reported to enhance propagation of tau (10). While in congruence with a previous study in mutant human tau mice (48), we observed neuronal network hyperexcitability in P301S mice; CIH did not affect it. Thus, this study suggests that other pathogenic mechanisms apart from neuronal network hyperexcitability might be involved in tau spread.

Microglia, the brain-resident immune cells, adapt their shape and function on brain insults and play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD (49–51). Although the microglia response to pathological tau is not completely understood, tau engulfed by microglial cells has been shown to enhance tau propagation through exosome secretion (52). Microglia in P301S mice have been shown to have a strong inflammatory response to neuronal p-tau aggregates by retracting ramifications and swelling of lysosomes (32,53). Microglial depletion has been shown to reduce tau pathology and neurodegeneration in P301S mice (54). We found that CIH exposure increased expression of CD68, a marker of activated microglia, in both WT and P301S mice and induced retraction of processes reminiscent of activated microglia in CIH-exposed P301S mice. These data indicate that CIH induces microglial activation not only in P301S but also in WT mice. The role of these inflammatory microglia in tau spread from CIH will be explored in future studies.

We found that CIH exacerbates deficit in P301S mice and induces impairment in WT mice in the ORD task for episodic LTM. This test is thought to critically depend on the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (55). As reported previously in P301S mice (27), we found an impairment in P301S-N mice as compared with WT-N control mice in the ORD task. In rodents, CIH exposure replicates many of the neurocognitive features of OSA in humans, such as learning and memory deficits and impaired vigilance, suggesting impairments in the hippocampus and/or prefrontal cortex (56,57). Our data corroborate hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex–dependent LTM impairment in CIH-exposed WT rodents. We also observed an exacerbation of LTM deficit in CIH-exposed P301S mice; in fact, these mice depicted a below chance–level performance. This enhanced attraction for familiarity rather than novelty in CIH-exposed P301S mice could be due to deficit in encoding, storage, or retrieval of episodic LTM (55).

Synaptic plasticity is the cellular substrate of learning and memory (58). Accordingly, we found exacerbation of both episodic LTM deficit and maintenance phase of LTP in CIH-exposed P301S mice. Impairment in LTP, the major mediator of synaptic plasticity, is well documented in AD and its animal models (14,27,59,60). The differential exacerbation of LTP maintenance deficit in contrast to LTP induction in CIH-exposed P301S mice hints at impairment of the stable, protein synthesis–dependent phase of LTP (61). Thus, CIH-induced worsening of impairments in LTP and cognition in P301S mice could also be because of the increase in tau pathology.

Our data further corroborate impairment in PPF previously reported in P301S mice (14). A recent study failed to find an effect of 30-day CIH on PPF in WT mice (62). In accordance, we also did not find any effect of 56-day CIH on PPF in WT mice. However, we found an exacerbation of PPF induced by CIH in P301S mice. These data suggest that in addition to postsynaptic potentiation impairment (evidenced by increase in LTP deficit), CIH also impaired presynaptic neurotransmitter release leading to PPF deficit exacerbation in P301S mice.

The top pathways affected by CIH exposure in P301S mice included mitochondrial dysfunction, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, ERK5 signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, and sirtuin signaling. P301S mice were reported to have increased mitochondrial oxidative stress before NFT formation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (63). In addition, mitochondrial oxidative stress was found to cause tau hyperphosphorylation (64). Previously, CIH was reported to induce oxidative stress in brain regions of WT mice associated with neurodegeneration (65). Thus, increased oxidative stress could be a possible mechanism of CIH-induced progression of tau pathology, synaptic plasticity, and memory impairment.

Top pathways affected by CIH exposure in WT mice were related to unfolded protein response, ER stress, CDK5 signaling, and glutamate receptor signaling pathways. Activation of ER stress and increased reactive oxygen species production were shown to play a critical role in accumulation of misfolded proteins and cognitive deficits after exposure to CIH (66). The unfolded protein response pathway is also activated in pre-NFT neurons of the hippocampus in AD brains (67) and is strongly correlated with early stages of p-tau accumulation in other tauopathies (67). CDK5 is a well-known mediator of tau aggregation and tangle formation (68). Glutamatergic neurotransmission is particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of various assemblies of amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau (69). Previously, CIH was reported to alter NMDA- and AMPA-evoked currents in nuclei of solitary tract neurons (70). Thus, alteration of glutamatergic neurotransmission could be another possible mechanism of CIH-induced deficits observed in this study.

We found that CIH exposure in WT mice caused dysregulation of the same genes that are responsible for pathogenic signaling in P301S mice, and CIH exposure exacerbated this pathogenic signaling in P301S mice. We thus provide evidence of dysregulation of gene pathways overlapping with AD-related molecular signaling by CIH exposure.

To summarize, we found that CIH enhances pathological human tau seeding, spread, and accumulation and exacerbates AD-like memory/synaptic plasticity deficits and gene expression profiles in a tau mouse model. CIH-induced tau hyperphosphorylation could be a possible mechanism for CIH-associated increase in tau spread (17). Furthermore, increase in p-tau and tau spread could have contributed to synaptic plasticity and memory deficits. These findings have high translational significance. In recent years, sleep disturbances including sleep deprivation, sleep-wake cycle dysfunction, and OSA have been identified as important contributors to AD risk/ progression (2,46,47). In this context, this study provides some important data regarding the role of OSA-associated CIH in exacerbating AD-like neurofibrillary pathology and associated deficits. More importantly, we have identified several molecular mediators and signaling pathways related to the effect of CIH. These molecular targets need to be further evaluated in efforts to further understand their role in the shared pathogenesis of OSA-associated CIH and AD dementia and to develop potential therapeutic strategies.

(C) Scheme of the intrahippocampal injections of AD p-tau or saline as a vehicle control is depicted. Injection coordinates are also shown. Diagram also shows commissural axons crossing the midline via the corpus callosum, which may explain increased number of tangles in contralateral hippocampus and cortex. (D) Representative images of AT8 staining of the contralateral and ipsilateral CA1 areas of hippocampus from saline or AD p-tau– injected P301S mice exposed for 8 weeks to CIH or normoxia. CA1 area is marked by dashed lines. High-magnification images are shown as insets. (E) Colocalization of AT8 and thioflavin-S staining in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of an AD p-tau–injected P301S mouse. These data suggest that seeded pathology is thioflavin-S positive. Scale bar = 100 mm. (F, G) The number of neurofibrillary tangles (AT8+, high-intensity, somatodendritic profiles) in CA1 region of the hippocampus (F) and in whole brain (G) was counted from 18–20 serial coronal sections per mouse (every fourth section of the brain) at×40 and ×10 magnifications, respectively.

Figure 2. CIH exacerbates impairment in episodic long-term memory and increases p-tau load in P301S mice. (A) Design of study batch 2 is depicted. This cohort of mice included WT-N, n = 14; WT-CIH, n = 12; P301S-N, n = 11; and P301S-CIH, n = 12. (B) In the training phase of the object recognition/discrimination task, all animal groups similarly explored both objects. In the test phase (intertrial interval, 24 hours; long-term memory), the CIH-exposed 6- to 6.5-month-old WT mice exhibited a significantly impaired novelty preference (DI, 58.5%) as compared with normoxia-reared age-matched WT control mice (DI, 75.2%). The P301S-N mice exhibited a significant episodic long-term memory deficit (DI, 59.5%) as compared with the WT-N group. Remarkably, the CIH-exposed P301S mice exhibited a below chance–level performance, spent more time in the familiar object zone (DI, 44.03%), and were significantly impaired compared with the P301S-N group. The data in panel (B) are presented as mean ± SEM, and based on WT-N, n = 12; WT-CIH, n =12; P301S-N, n = 9; and P301S-CIH, n = 11. The DI data were analyzed using one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. (C, D) CIH increases p-tau burden without affecting total and human tau levels in P301S mice. Western blots (C) and quantification data (D) are shown. As expected for 6- to 6.5-month-old P301S mice, the expression level of total tau Tau5 (C, D) was significantly higher in P301S mice than WT mice. Human tau HT7 was only detectable in P301S mice (C, D). The p-tau AT8 (pSer202, pThr205) was significantly higher in the P301S-N group as compared with WT-N (C, D). CIH exposure significantly increased p-tau expression in P301S mice (C, D). No significant differences in p-tau levels were observed with PHF1 (pSer396/pSer404), AT180 (pThr231), and pSer199 (C, D). (E) Representative images of AT8 staining of the prefrontal cortex of P301S mice exposed for 8 weeks to CIH or normoxia. (F) CIH exposure significantly increased p-tau expression in P301S mice. The data depicted in panel (F) are presented as mean ± SEM, and based on WT-N, n = 5; WT-CIH, n = 5; P301S-N, n = 5; and P301S-CIH, n = 5. *p &lt; .05; ***p &lt; .001.

(A) Representative images of P2RY12 and CD68 staining of the CA1 region of the hippocampus of WT and P301S mice exposed for 8 weeks to CIH or normoxia. (B) CIH exposure significantly increased CD68 expression in WT and P301S mice. (C) Sholl analysis showing a significant reduction in microglial cell complexity in CIH-exposed P301S mice when compared with P301S-N mice. The data are presented as mean ± SEM and based on WT-N, n = 5; WT-CIH, n = 5; P301S-N, n = 5; and P301S-CIH, n = 5. Data were analyzed using one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni correction; **p &lt; .01; ***p &lt; .001; ****p &lt; .0001. CIH, chronic intermittent hypoxia; N, normoxia; WT, wild-type.

Figure 4. CIH exacerbates synaptic plasticity deficits in P301S mice. (A) Design of study batch 3 is depicted. This cohort included WT-N, n = 12; WT-CIH, n = 12; P301S-N, n = 12; and P301S-CIH, n = 12 mice. (B) Scheme of paired-pulse facilitation and LTP evaluation in Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. (C) P301S-N mice showed significantly reduced paired-pulse facilitation as compared with WT-N mice (100-ms interstimulus interval); CIH exposure further reduced paired-pulse facilitation in P301S mice. (D) LTP of the fEPSP following TBS showed significant differences between groups. During the induction phase of LTP (immediately after TBS, time = 0–10 min), P301S-N showed a trend toward reduction in LTP induction as compared with the WT-N group; the P301S-CIH group was significantly impaired compared with WT-CIH mice in LTP induction, again suggesting a genotype effect. No significant effect of CIH was found in LTP induction in either WT or P301S mice. During the maintenance phase of LTP (time = 50–60 min after TBS), again a trend toward a deficit was observed between P301S-N and WT-N mice; however, a more significant genotype effect was observed between the P301S-CIH and WT-CIH groups. P301S-CIH mice exhibited an exaggerated deficit in LTP maintenance as compared with the P301S-N group. The data in panels (C) and (D) are presented as mean ± SEM and based on WT-N (n = 9 slices from n = 6 mice), WT-CIH (n = 8 slices from 6 mice), P301S-N (n = 8 slices from 6 mice), and P301S-CIH (n = 9 slices from 6 mice). Data were analyzed using one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. *p &lt; .05; **p &lt; .01; ***p &lt; .001.

Adjusted p value ≤ .05, |fold-change| ≥ 1.5. (Bb) Canonical pathways derived from IPA for significantly dysregulated genes in the hippocampus of P301S mice exposed to CIH in comparison with P301S mice exposed to normoxia. Signaling pathways known to be pathogenic in P301S are exacerbated by CIH. Orange bars predict an overall increase in the activity of the pathway, while blue bars indicate a prediction of an overall decrease in activity. (C) Rank-rank hypergeometric overlap heatmaps of threshold-free comparisons between differentially expressed genes from WT mice and P301S mice under CIH. The stratified heatmap shows four quadrants, which show the enrichment overlap between two datasets among all combinations of up- and downregulated genes. Upper right quadrant shows overlap in genes downregulated in both studies. Lower left quadrant shows overlap in genes upregulated in both studies. Lower right and upper left quadrants represent overlaps in genes downregulated in one and upregulated in the other and upregulated in one and downregulated in the other, respectively. Significant overlap is seen only in concordant gene expression changes. CIH induces similar gene expression changes in P301S and WT mice. (D) Venn diagrams displaying the extent of overlap between genes upregulated and downregulated in both comparisons. (E) Canonical pathways derived from IPA of most co-dysregulated genes in the overlap between P301S and WT under CIH in the hippocampus. Analysis shows that enrichment of genes in pathways that are dysregulated in P301S mice under normoxic conditions is induced in WT mice exposed to CIH. RNA-Seq data are based on WT-N, n = 6; WT-CIH, n = 6; P301S-N, n = 5; and P301S-CIH, n = 6.
