As Alzheimer Disease (AD) pathology accumulates, resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) within and between brain networks decreases, and fluctuations in cognitive performance known as intra-individual variability (IIV) increase. Here we assessed relationship between IIV and anti-correlations in rs-fc between the default mode network (DMN)-dorsal attention network (DAN) in cognitively normal older adults and symptomatic AD participants. We also evaluated the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD (amyloid beta [Aβ42] and tau) and IIV-anticorrelation in rs-fc. We observed that cognitive IIV and anti-correlations between DMNxDAN were higher in individuals with AD compared to cognitively normal participants. As DMNxDAN relationship became more positive, cognitive IIV increased, indicating that stronger anti-correlations between networks support more consistent cognitive performance. Moderation analyses indicated that continuous CSF Aβ42, but not CSF total tau, moderated the relationship between cognitive IIV and DMNxDAN, collectively demonstrating that greater amyloid burden and alterations in functional network dynamics are associated with cognitive changes seen in AD. These findings are valuable, as they suggest that amyloid affects cognitive functioning during early stages of AD.

1. Introduction

Alzheimer Disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is one of the most prevalent pathologies as the population ages and is the most common cause of dementia (Alzheimer’s Association, 2015). Neuropathological biomarkers that define AD include amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, with the former being detected up to two decades before the onset of cognitive symptoms (Bateman et al., 2012; Jack et al., 2013; Petersen et al., 2010). Due to the discrepancy between pathological accumulation and clinical symptom onset, it is important to establish reliable methods to detect differences occurring in the earliest stages of AD.

Cognitive intraindividual variability (IIV), or within-person fluctuations in cognitive and behavioral performance, is a preclinical marker that holds great promise for detecting early pathological processes (Anderson et al., 2016; Duchek et al., 2009; Holtzer et al., 2008; MacDonald et al., 2006). One way to estimate IIV is to measure individual differences in reaction time and accuracy across trials within a task, or between multiple cognitive tasks at one time point (e.g., dispersion; (Christensen et al., 1999; MacDonald et al., 2006). Greater fluctuations in IIV may reflect dysfunction and instability within the central nervous system (CNS), and have been observed in conditions where sustained attention is compromised, including normal aging, mild cognitive impairment, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and traumatic brain injury (Anderson et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2012; Kelly et al., 2008; MacDonald et al., 2006, Tse et al., 2010) Critically, increases in cognitive IIV are observed even in cognitively normal older adults carrying genetic markers associated with increased risk of developing AD (i.e., ApoE 4 positive) compared to those without increased risk (Duchek et al., 2009).

Another informative tool for detecting AD-related changes is resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fc) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which captures the intrinsic neural properties of the brain, and can aid in detecting changes in brain networks. Spontaneous low frequency fluctuations of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal (&lt; 0.1 Hz), which define the resting state, are specific to gray matter and thought to reflect the inherent organization of the brain (Buckner et al., 2008; Damoiseaux et al., 2006; Fox et al., 2005; Mennes et al., 2010; Sheline and Raichle, 2013). Studies examining the brain at rest have revealed that spontaneous activity is highly correlated among regions that are functionally related, even in the absence of external stimuli (Fox et al., 2005), making this approach highly advantageous for detecting abnormalities in clinical populations.

The most pronounced division between functional networks is between the dichotomized “task-positive” and “task-negative” networks (Fox et al., 2005). Recruitment of task-positive networks increases in response to attention-demanding cognitive tasks compared to during wakeful rest. Conversely, task-negative networks, particularly the default mode network (DMN), exhibit less activity during attention-demanding tasks, and are more active during wakeful rest and during introspective and unconstrained thought or mind-wandering (Fox et al., 2005; Mennes et al., 2010; Spreng et al., 2016, 2013). The dorsal attention network (DAN) is one of the most extensively researched task-positive networks and is composed of a group of regions involved in short-term and working memory processes and sustained attention (Posner and Petersen, 1990; Vossel et al., 2014). The anti-correlative nature between the DAN and DMN likely reflects efficient competition for cognitive resources and, we conjecture, supports more consistent cognitive performance (i.e., lower cognitive IIV). For example, healthy younger adults with stronger anti-correlations between the DMN and task-positive network (including DAN) demonstrate less behavioral variability on attention tasks compared to those with weaker anti-correlations (Duchek et al., 2013; Kelly et al., 2008). The presence of strong anti-correlations between networks suggests that individuals are able to successfully activate and deactivate networks independently rather than simultaneously activating them. Thus, between-network correlation strength indexes the degree of regulation between functional networks and reflects intact functional connectivity, which is needed for maintaining consistent cognitive performance.

Increasing AD severity is associated with breakdowns in within- and between-network correlations. Comparisons of functional connectivity within and between networks in older adults ranging from cognitively normal (clinical dementia rating [CDR] 0) to very mild AD (CDR= 0.5) to mild AD (CDR=1; Morris, 1997), demonstrated that from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5, within-network correlations significantly decreased in 4 out of the 5 functional brain networks assessed including the DAN (Brier et al., 2012). By CDR 1, all within-network correlations were attenuated. Anti-correlations between the DAN and DMN, as well as between the DMN and several other task-positive networks, also consistently weakened with increasing AD severity (Brier et al., 2012). Similar findings have been reported in other studies where individuals with mild AD demonstrated decreased functional connectivity within the DMN, in addition to decreased anti-correlations between the DMN and DAN (Grajski and Bressler, 2019; Klaassens et al., 2017; López-Sanz et al., 2017; Sorg et al., 2007; Zhong et al., 2014). Notably, the DMN is typically one of the first major networks to display elevated pathological levels of amyloid, tau deposition, synaptic dysfunction (Buckner et al., 2008; Palmqvist et al., 2017; Schultz et al., 2017; Sheline and Raichle, 2013), and abnormalities in functional connectivity (Brier et al., 2014, 2012; Klaassens et al., 2017; Palmqvist et al., 2017; Sheline and Raichle, 2013). It has been hypothesized that the degradation of functional connectivity is due to reduced white matter integrity, which is further degraded by the accumulation of pathophysiological biomarkers such as amyloid and tau (Chhatwal et al., 2018).

Review of the literature on resting state networks in relation to the accumulation of pathologic biomarkers leads to the conclusion that the development of AD is associated with changes in brain functional network connectivity, and that those changes most likely arise in a systematic pattern. For example, with abnormal levels of amyloid and tau, IIV increases on attention tasks (Duchek et al., 2009), and functional connectivity both within and between brain networks breaks down (Brier et al., 2012; Palmqvist et al., 2017; Sheline and Raichle, 2013). Past research highlights that assessment of relationships not only within functional brain networks, but also between networks at rest, is essential for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying increased cognitive IIV in mild AD. However, although there is a strong relationship between variability in behavioral performance and between-network anti-correlations broadly with aging (Kelly et al., 2008; Spreng et al., 2016), research demonstrating the manifestation of this relationship in AD is still lacking. It is additionally unknown how AD biomarkers, such as amyloid and tau, affect the IIV-anti-correlation relationship.

The primary aim of the present study was to address gaps in knowledge of the mechanisms of individual variability in cognitive performance in symptomatic AD. To do so, we assessed the well characterized DMNxDAN between-network correlation in relation to cognitive IIV in cognitively normal individuals (CDR 0) and those with very mild and mild AD (CDR 0.5 and 1.0, respectively). Exploratory moderation analyses were also conducted to determine if the IIV-anti-correlation relationship varies as a function of amyloid or tau. It was hypothesized that, compared to cognitively normal adults (CDR 0), individuals with very mild (CDR 0.5) and mild AD (CDR 1) would demonstrate A) increased IIV across cognitive domains (i.e., attention/executive functioning, processing speed, verbal fluency, and episodic memory) on neuropsychological assessments; and B) a weaker anti-correlation strength between the DAN and DMN. It was additionally hypothesized that anti-correlations and cognitive IIV would be correlated such that as the DMNxDAN relationship weakens, cognitive performance becomes more variable. Lastly, it was expected that the IIV-DMNxDAN relationship would weaken from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5 to CDR 1. Given that most research on early AD focuses primarily on declining memory ability, characterizing how the IIV-DMNxDAN relationship is disrupted in mild AD across multiple domains of cognition will lead to new insights about the behavioral and neural profile of individuals undergoing pathophysiological changes due to AD. Investigating the IIV-DMNxDAN relationship is critical to determining the influence of large-scale functional brain networks on cognitive changes, and in turn, to identifying possible preclinical cognitive markers of pathological aging.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Participants

Data were obtained from the Washington University Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC). Participants were at least 40 years old and classified as either CDR 0 (n=355), 0.5 (n=103), or 1 (n=20). To be included in the present analyses, participants’ neuroimaging and neuropsychological data had to be collected within two years or less of one another. The mean interval between neuropsychological measures and MRI was 33.23 days (SD = 109.97 days) and the mean interval between collection of all neuropsychological, MRI, and CSF data was 323.43 days (SD= 716.81 days). Individuals with a history of stroke or traumatic brain injury were excluded from the analyses. The resulting sample included 479 participants. One individual was removed from all analyses for extreme outlier cognitive IIV score (described in section 2.3), providing a final sample of n=478. See Table 1 for participant characteristics by CDR group.

2.2 Clinical Assessment

All CDR scores were obtained from assessments by experienced clinicians trained in the use of the CDR. The CDR is used to determine whether dementia is present and, if so, to stage its severity. When using global scores, a CDR of 0 indicates that the individual is “cognitively normal”, while CDR 0.5 and CDR 1 indicate very mild and mild AD, respectively (Morris, 1997). All participants with a CDR &gt; 0 had a clinical diagnosis of Dementia of the Alzheimer's type in accordance with the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (Brier et al., 2012; Buckner et al., 2009; McKhann et al., 1984; Sperling et al., 2009).

2.3 Computation of Cognitive IIV

Although there are several methods that can be used to determine IIV, the most common and simple way is to calculate the individual standard deviation (ISD). The ISD is computationally similar to traditional standard deviation calculation except that the mean of values is derived from all of the cognitive test scores for each individual, rather than the group as a whole. ISD is computed as (Zik−Ai)2K−1 where Zik is the k th cognitive test score for the i th subject, K is the number of cognitive tests, and Ai is the individual’s mean z-transformed score based on the tests relative to the entire sample (Holtzer et al., 2008). Cognitive IIV was computed from 7 raw scores representing a broad variety of cognitive domains: Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory immediate and delayed recall (episodic memory; Wechsler, 1997); verbal fluency to categories each for animals and for vegetables, total number of words minus repetitions, intrusions, or rule violations (verbal fluency; Goodglass and Kaplan, 1983), verbal fluency to letters F+L, total number of words minus repetitions, intrusions, or rule violations (verbal fluency; Goodglass and Kaplan, 1983); and total time for Trails A (processing speed) and Trails B (attention and executive functioning; Armitage, 1945). These measures were selected because they represented a variety of cognitive domains and were available for all individuals described in the present analyses. The neuropsychological tests were z-scored based on the distribution of the sample. After z-scores were calculated, an ISD value was computed across all standardized variables for each participant. Higher ISD values indicate increased cognitive IIV. One individual from CDR 0.5 group was removed from analyses for extreme outlier ISD value (z=7.48).

2.4 Image Acquisition

Imaging was performed using a 3.0 Tesla Trio Siemens (Erlangen, Germany) MRI scanner equipped with a 12-channel head coil. For atlas registration, high-resolution 3-dimensional sagittal T1 MP-RAGE anatomical images were acquired with the scanning parameters of TR = 2400 ms, TE = 16 ms, flip angle = 8°, 176 slices, slice thickness = 1.00 mm, acquisition matrix = 256 x 256, and 1 x 1 x 1 mm voxels. For rs-fcMRI atlas registration, T2-weighted fast spin echo structural images were acquired using slice tilts and positions computed by slice pre-registration with the scanning parameters of TR = 3200 ms, echo time TE = 455 ms, acquisition matrix = 256 x 256, and 1 x 1 x 1 mm voxels. Functional images were collected using a gradient spin-echo sequence (TR = 2200 ms, TE = 27 ms, flip angle = 90°, 36 slices, voxel matrix = 64 x 64, field of view = 256 x 256, and 4 mm isotropic voxels) sensitive to the BOLD contrast (T2* weighting). Two 6 minute rs-fc MRI runs (164 volumes per run) were acquired during which participants were instructed to fixate on a visual crosshair and not fall asleep. Further image acquisition details were reported by Brier and colleagues (2012, 2014).

2.5 rs-fc MRI Preprocessing and Quality Assurance

During rs-fc MRI preprocessing, the first frame was discarded, and all remaining volumes were adjusted for slice timing and realignment. Functional images were intensity scaled to acquire a mode value of 1000 (Ojemann et al., 1997), to facilitate assessment of voxel-wise variance for quality assurance. Registration to structural images was performed using composition affine transforms to align the rs-fc MRI volumes with the T2-weighted and MP-RAGE images. Normalization was performed in Washington University Talairach atlas space, and images were resampled to a voxel size of 3 mm isotropic followed by spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). Data were also temporally filtered to remove linear trends over each run and to retain frequencies below 0.1 Hz. Finally, the global signal -- the average timeseries of the intensity of all brain voxels -- was included as a covariate of no interest to reduce variance related to or arising from global physiological confounds like respiratory or cardiac cycles (Ciric et al., 2017; Fox et al., 2009; Millar et al., 2020). Nuisance signals from CSF and white matter were additionally included as regressors. Further preprocessing details were reported by Brier and colleagues (2012, 2014).

2.6 Quality Assurance

Although global signal regression (GSR) can mitigate the impact of motion and physiological noise, additional steps are needed for quality assurance, as the effects of motion can persist after regression of the movement covariate (Power et al., 2012). To address this issue, several quality checks were implemented. Volumes with excessively high (0.4 mm framewise displacement) whole-brain root mean squared movement over time were removed without replacement (Power et al., 2012). Only individuals with &lt;20% excluded frames were retained. Structural and functional images were assessed for proper registration and segmentation.

2.7 ROIs and Networks

We used Power and colleagues’ (2011) 58 regions of interest (ROIs) for the DMN and 11 ROIs for the DAN (5 mm radius). The selected ROIs were previously validated as adequately sampling these resting state networks and sufficiently cover cortical structures (see Supplemental Materials for DMN and DAN ROI coordinates). Within network correlations for each individual were computed by taking the Pearson correlation between every pair of ROIs within a network, z-transforming the resulting matrices, and then averaging the z- transformed ROI-to-ROI correlations among all ROI’s for that given network. Between network correlations for each individual were computed in the same manner except correlations were based on ROI pairs between DMN and DAN.

2.8 rs-fc MRI Post Processing

To compute group level results, the correlation values within DMN, within DAN, and the correlation value between DMN and DAN networks were each averaged among the participants within each CDR group, yielding 3 composite values for each CDR group: a within DAN composite, a within DMN composite, and a DMNxDAN correlation composite (see Table S1 in Supplemental Materials for the mean DAN and mean DMN composites by CDR group).

2.9 CSF Collection and Analysis

CSF data were available for a subset of the full participant sample. Only CSF data collected within 2 years of neuroimaging and neuropsychological data collection were used in analyses (n=266; CDR 0 n=203, CDR 0.5 n=54, CDR 1 n=9). CSF (20-30 mL) was collected by lumbar puncture using a 22-gauge Sprotte spinal needle (Geisingen, Germany). Lumbar punctures were performed in the morning after overnight fasting by a trained neurologist. CSF was aliquoted (500 ul) into polypropylene tubes and was free of visible blood contamination. After collection, samples were gently inverted and frozen at −84°C. CSF was analyzed for Aβ42 and total tau (t-tau) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Innotest; Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium; for additional details see Fagan et al., 2006).

2.10 Analyses

All statistical tests were conducted in RStudio (version 1.2.5042). Given the differences in sample sizes between groups, we first tested for homogeneity of variances of IIV and DMNxDAN among the sample using Levene’s test. If either variable had inhomogeneity of variances among CDR groups, as indicated by significant results of Levene’s test, then that measure was examined with Welch’s ANOVA, which does not have Fisher’s ANOVA’s assumption of homogeneity of variance. To assess whether cognitive IIV increases with increasing CDR status, we ran a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with CDR status as the independent variable (IV) and cognitive IIV as the dependent variable (DV). To assess whether the DMNxDAN anti-correlation weakens with increasing CDR status, a one-way ANOVA with CDR status as the IV and DMNxDAN correlation as the DV was conducted. Tukey’s HSD post-hoc tests were conducted for significant main effects in Fisher’s ANOVAs. Games-Howell post-hoc tests were conducted for significant main effects in Welch’s ANOVAs. ANOVAs with age and education included as a covariate indicated that age did not affect results (reported in Supplemental Materials). The linear relationship between cognitive IIV and DMNxDAN was computed using one-tailed Pearson’s correlation. Correlation values (r) were then entered into a one-tailed Fisher’s r to z transformation and compared by CDR status.

An exploratory moderation analysis was conducted to determine whether the relationship between DMNxDAN and cognitive IIV varies as a function of CSF Aβ42 or t-tau. For this model, DMNxDAN was included as the predictor variable, CSF Aβ42 and CSF t-tau were the moderators, and cognitive IIV was the outcome variable. Moderation analysis was conducted by adding two interaction terms to a regression model where the interaction represents the relationship between DMNxDAN and CSF Aβ42 and DMNxDAN and CSF t-tau, respectively. The moderation model is therefore represented as: Cognitive IIV∼DMNxDAN+Aβ42+t-tau+DMNxDAN∗Aβ42+DMNxDAN∗t-tau

In this context, moderation is indicated by a significant interaction between DMNxDAN and either amyloid or tau.

3. Results

3.1 Cognitive IIV is greater in very mild and mild AD than in cognitively normal adults

Levene’s Tests of equality of variances indicated that the sample did not violate assumptions of homogeneity in IIV variability between CDR groups (F(2,475)=2.38, p=.09). The ANOVA of cognitive IIV by CDR status showed that there was a main effect of CDR status on cognitive IIV (F(2,475)= 13.99, p&lt;.0001, η2 = .06; see Figure 1 and Table 2). Post-hoc tests indicated that the CDR 1 group had significantly greater IIV than the CDR 0 group (p&lt;.0001, d=1.10) and the CDR 0.5 group (p=.002, d =0.90). The CDR 0.5 group had greater cognitive IIV than the CDR 0 group (p=.03, d = 0.29).

3.2 The DMNxDAN anti-correlations break down in mild AD compared to cognitively normal and very mild AD

Levene’s tests of equality of variances indicated that differences in homogeneity of DMNxDAN anti-correlation between CDR groups passed threshold for significance (F(2,475)=3.07, p=.047). Welch’s ANOVA identified a main effect of group on DMNxDAN (F(2,48.64)=7.70, p=.001, η2 =0.03). Post-hoc tests indicated that the DMNxDAN anti-correlation weakened from CDR 0 to CDR 1 (p=.001, d =0.86) and from CDR 0.5 to CDR 1 (p=.001, d =0.79). The CDR 0 and 0.5 groups did not differ (p=.87, d =0.06).

3.3 As the DMNxDAN relationship becomes more positive, cognitive IIV increases

The sample as a whole showed a significant relationship between DMNxDAN and cognitive IIV (see Table 2). As the DMNxDAN relationship became more positive (i.e., less anti-correlated), cognitive IIV increased. Although numerically the correlation strengths increased with increasing CDR status, Fisher’s z tests directly comparing the strength of the relationship between CDR groups demonstrated that correlation strength between DMNxDAN and cognitive IIV did not differ by CDR (zs&lt; ∣0.81∣, ps&gt;.21; Figure 3).

3.4 CSF Aβ42 but not t-tau moderates the IIV-DMNxDAN relationship

Exploratory moderation analysis investigated whether CSF Aβ42 or t-tau moderate the relationship between DMNxDAN and cognitive IIV. As Table 3 illustrates, DMNxDAN and CSF Aβ42 individually predicted cognitive IIV, as did the interaction term between DMNxDAN and CSF Aβ42. Conversely, neither CSF t-tau nor the interaction between DMNxDAN and t-tau predicted cognitive IIV. Collectively these results indicate that CSF Aβ42 moderates the relationship between DMNxDAN and cognitive IIV, while CSF t-tau does not. Specifically, the results demonstrate that the relationship between DMNxDAN and cognitive IIV varies by CSF Aβ42 levels such that decreasing levels (i.e., reflecting greater amyloid accumulation in the brain) are associated with a weaker relationship between DMNxDAN and cognitive IIV while increasing levels (i.e., reflecting less amyloid accumulation in the brain) are associated with a stronger relationship between DMNxDAN and cognitive IIV.

4. Discussion

The purpose of the present study was to investigate a) across-domain cognitive IIV by CDR status; b) the DMNxDAN anti-correlation by CDR status; and c) whether the relationship between cognitive IIV and DMNxDAN differs by CDR. We also explored the moderating effects of amyloid and tau (as measured by CSF Aβ42 and t-tau) on the IIV-DMNxDAN relationship. Results indicated that as CDR status increases, cognitive IIV increases and also the DMNxDAN relationship weakens (i.e., networks become less anti-correlated). Comparisons of the IIV-DMNxDAN relationship as a whole revealed that as the DMNxDAN relationship weakens, cognitive performance becomes less consistent, and this relationship does not differ by CDR status. Collectively these results show that as AD severity increases, overall cognitive performance becomes more variable, and engagement of key brain networks become less distinct.

Increased cognitive IIV in mild AD is a well-validated finding within aging and AD literature (Anderson et al., 2016; Duchek et al., 2009; Hilborn et al., 2009; Holtzer et al., 2008; Kliegel and Sliwinski, 2004). Fluctuations in task performance across cognitive domains are an important behavioral pattern to recognize, as they demonstrate that there are cognitive changes across several domains, in addition to the well-known memory declines that characterize AD. Measurement of cognitive IIV may aid in detecting evidence of early pathology in individuals with mild AD who have seemingly well-maintained cognitive performance. Evaluation of cognitive IIV may be especially relevant for older adults with high levels of cognitive reserve (Stern, 2002) in whom cognitive performance has declined but not yet to a degree detectible on standardized tests of memory. Results from the present study converge with prior work (Duchek et al., 2009) demonstrating that cognitive IIV differs between cognitively normal individuals (CDR 0) and those with very mild AD (CDR 0.5), and also extend the literature to illuminate the relationship between IIV and underlying brain networks. Moreover, considering each participant’s overall cognitive performance (i.e., mean of the 7 z-scored neuropsychological measures) as a covariate variable of no interest in each of the primary analyses did not change interpretation of the results; the main effect of CDR on IIV, main effect of CDR on DMNxDAN, and correlation between IIV and DMNxDAN all remained significant after accounting for each individual’s mean cognitive performance (results reported in Supplemental Materials). These supplemental results confirm that IIV distinguishes between CDR levels even after partialing out overall cognitive performance. We have identified that the IIV-DMNxDAN relationship is not merely reflective of overall cognitive performance, but instead reliably identifies a relationship between older adults’ within-person variability in cognitive performance and their brain network functioning.

Negative correlations between the DMN and DAN support consistent cognitive performance (Kelly et al., 2008; Spreng et al., 2016). Compared to younger adults, cognitively normal older adults demonstrate attenuated DMNxDAN connectivity at rest and during tasks, which is also associated with increasing cognitive IIV with aging (Spreng et al., 2016). Results from the present study demonstrated that breakdown in connectivity between the DMN and DAN is greater in older adults with mild AD compared to their cognitively normal counterparts, and that this breakdown in brain network connectivity is also associated with increasing cognitive IIV. Deterioration of rs-fc within and between networks with increasing AD symptom severity is a well-established finding (Brier et al., 2012) and likely reflects accumulation of biomarkers such as amyloid-beta and tau (Wang et al., 2013). Notably, in the present study, we identified that between network connectivity was more sensitive than within network connectivity (within network results reported in Supplemental materials) at detecting differences between CDR groups.

Results from the exploratory moderation analysis demonstrated that amyloid-beta, but not tau, moderates the relationship between the DMNxDAN correlation and cognitive IIV. Elevated levels of amyloid-beta and tau are present years before the onset of cognitive decline in AD (Andreasen and Blennow, 2002; Hardy and Selkoe, 2002). According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of amyloid and tau also precedes changes in structural and functional integrity of the brain (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Jack et al., 2013). In the present study, DMNxDAN between network correlation interacted with amyloid but not tau. Evidence suggests that amyloid accumulation begins in regions of the DMN across several regions of the cortex, while tau deposition occurs mainly in the medial temporal lobe (MTL; (Buckner et al., 2008; Grajski and Bressler, 2019; Klaassens et al., 2017; Maass et al., 2018; Sperling et al., 2009; Tosun et al., 2017). Accumulation of amyloid in DMN may render it less able to flexibly deactivate as needed to enable DAN to effectively activate and support cognition (Chhatwal et al., 2018). This spatial distribution pattern may explain why accumulation of amyloid predicts cognitive IIV and is associated with functional connectivity of DMN. Taken together these results suggest that individuals with greater amyloid accumulation and weaker functional connectivity between the DMN and DAN have less consistency in cognitive performance. Although increasing tau burden is also typically associated with declining cognition, it may be exerting effects through a different set of brain networks other than the DMN and DAN (Maass et al., 2018; Tosun et al., 2017).

4.1 Limitations and Future Directions

There are several limitations to consider when interpreting results from the present study. First, although the measure of across-domain cognitive IIV differentiated between cognitively normal individuals and those with very mild and mild AD, it is possible that there is a combination of tasks that would be even more sensitive to detecting preclinical changes. Future studies should test multiple combinations of tasks and compare results against other ways to compute IIV (e.g., trial to trial). Secondly, individuals with greater cognitive reserve may have stronger functional connectivity despite CDR status (Franzmeier et al., 2017), potentially obscuring differences between individuals within and between CDR groups. Hyperconnectivity can occur in individuals with elevated amyloid before cognitive decline is detectable (Schultz et al., 2017). Other possible limitations include individual differences in variability of the time interval between measures (up to two years) and uneven sample sizes between CDR groups. It is currently unknown what frequency of data collection is most appropriate for capturing disease staging and progression. Shortening the timespan between study events (i.e., neuroimaging, cognitive tests, and CSF collection) may reveal even stronger relationships among cognition, functional brain networks, and AD biomarkers; future studies could shed light on this question.

4.2 Conclusions

In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that variability in cognitive performance is greater and DMNxDAN between-network correlations are weaker in individuals with mild AD compared to those with very mild AD and cognitively normal older adults. Results also show that the relationship between the breakdown in networks and cognitive variability varies by increasing amyloid (but not tau) deposition. Given the prevalence of AD across the global community, it is imperative to make strides toward understanding and characterizing its neural and clinical manifestations. This study further illuminates how amyloid burden and alterations in the dynamics of functional networks are associated with behavioral changes arising in AD.

Figure 1. Comparison of mean intraindividual variability (IIV) by Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) status

IIV increases with CDR status severity. **** = p&lt;.0001, **= p&lt;.01, *= p&lt;.05.

Figure 2. Comparison of Default Mode Network (DMN) x Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) anti-correlation by Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) status

DMNxDAN anti-correlation weakens (becomes more positive) with CDR status severity. **=p≤.01.

Figure 3. As the Default Mode Network (DMN) x Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) relationship becomes more positive, cognitive intra-individual variability (IIV) increases.

The sample as a whole showed a significant relationship between DMNxDAN and cognitive IIV, and the correlation strength did not differ between CDR groups (zs&lt; ∣0.81∣, ps&gt;.21). As network anti-correlation weakens, cognitive performance becomes less consistent.

% ApoE 4 negative	60.59	65.07	49.51	35.00	
Note. Age was operationalized as age on date of MRI scan. Age differed by CDR group (F(2, 475)=6.05, p=.003, η2 =.03). Specifically, the CDR 0.5 group (p=.04) the CDR 1 group (p=.02) were older than the CDR 0 group. Age mean did not differ between CDR 0.5 and CDR 1 groups (all p=.35). Years of education attained also differed by CDR group (F(2, 475)=6.45, p=.002, η2 =.03), such that the CDR 0 group was more educated than the CDR 1 group (p=.003). Education mean did not differ between CDR 0 and CDR 0.5 (p=.16) or between CDR 0.5 and CDR 1 (p=.07).

Highlights:

Cognitive intra-individual variability (IIV) increases in symptomatic Alzheimer disease

Increased IIV is associated with breakdowns in resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc).

Amyloid burden moderates the relationship between IIV and rs-fc.
