It is well known that cardiovascular disease and related vascular risk factors are associated with cognitive decline and worse brain health outcomes among aging adults. Recently, subtle age-related changes in cardiac hemodynamics have been proposed as an emerging risk factor for abnormal brain aging, even in the absence of cardiovascular disease. Changes in cardiac function, vital for determining the total amount of blood available for perfusing the body, and arterial stiffness, important for regulating blood flow delivery, have been associated with compromised brain structure and function among older adults. Such alterations in cardiac output and arterial stiffening may directly affect brain health through blood-brain barrier breakdown or oligemia, or may interact with Alzheimer’s disease and concomitant pathologies common in aging adults to accelerate cognitive decline. This review examines how age-related alterations in cardiovascular integrity contribute to abnormal brain aging, emphasizing that changes in systemic hemodynamics may compromise brain health before or concurrently with the development of neurodegenerative processes that are common in aging.

Introduction

Cardiovascular dysfunction is emerging as an important yet modifiable risk factor for abnormal cognitive aging and dementia.1 Although prevalent, cardiovascular disease and related vascular risk factors are well established correlates of adverse brain outcomes (cf, Tariq et al2), evidence now suggests age-related changes in cardiovascular integrity (defined here as the ability of the heart and vasculature to regulate blood flow and pressure to downstream organs) also impact brain health. Age-related variations in cardiovascular function, including subclinical cardiac dysfunction and changes to the arterial architecture, are associated with compromised brain health3–6 and may play a larger role in precipitating abnormal cognitive aging than previously recognized. Notably, a recent clinical trial showed that aggressive blood pressure management reduces incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI),7 suggesting treatment of vascular risk factors or their downstream consequences may be a viable therapeutic approach to Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias.

Given the growing prevalence of AD accompanied by the lack of effective therapeutics,8 a better understanding of the contribution of systemic hemodynamics to dementia risk could have major public health implications. Characterizing the pathways through which cardiovascular function impacts brain structure and function may provide an additional avenue for novel therapeutic target discovery focusing on concomitant pathways to AD that accelerate clinical trajectory or symptom progression. Here, we review the emerging connection linking cardiovascular integrity and systemic hemodynamics to abnormal brain aging, emphasizing age-related, subtle changes in cardiac dysfunction and arterial stiffness. We review potential pathways accounting for these associations, focusing on how systemic hemodynamic changes may affect brain integrity with cognitive consequences before the onset of dementia.

Cardiovascular Function

Severe Cardiac Dysfunction and Abnormal Brain Aging

The volume of blood leaving the heart and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) work in equilibrium to maintain mean arterial pressure, such that normally SVR increases as cardiac output decreases. Arterioles constrict and dilate to manipulate SVR and distribute blood proportionately throughout the body based on metabolic demand. Thus, changes in cardiac output and SVR would presumably have the greatest effect on organs that are the most metabolically active, thus requiring larger proportions of systemic blood volume. Although the brain only accounts for 2% of total body weight, it receives 12% of cardiac output due to a large metabolic demand.9 Therefore, the brain would hypothetically be particularly susceptible to subtle changes in systemic perfusion and blood flow delivery. Despite long-standing evidence that cerebral blood flow (CBF) is always maintained because of innate autoregulatory processes,10 evidence over the last 15 years leveraging sophisticated cerebral perfusion methods suggests CBF is not always fully preserved.3,4,11,12 Specifically, aging3 and cerebral small vessel disease13 may disrupt autoregulatory processes (eg, vasoconstriction, endothelial signaling), placing the brain at risk in the setting of reduced systemic perfusion.

Prevalent cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, has been associated with compromised brain structure and function in late life. Patients with heart failure have extensive structural gray and white matter changes (cf, Alosco et al14), as well as cognitive impairment, particularly in episodic memory and executive function domains (cf, Leto et al15), as compared to cardiac healthy peers. Heart failure patients are also at an increased risk for ischemic stroke (cf, Kim et al16). Even in midlife, adults with heart failure have compromised white matter integrity17 and smaller gray matter volumes18 compared with adults without heart failure,17,18 yet they show improvement in cognitive performance with restoration of normal function following cardiac transplantation.19 In patients with prevalent cardiovascular disease or heart failure, lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is associated with smaller total brain volumes20 and worse episodic memory,21–23 executive function,22 and global cognition.22 LVEF reflects the fraction of blood pumped from the left ventricle with each contraction. Among individuals with prevalent cardiovascular disease or heart failure, lower cardiac output (ie, the total amount of blood in liters exiting the heart each minute) is associated with structural brain changes20,24 and worse cognitive performances.22,25,26 Thus, it is well established that clinically relevant changes in heart function, regardless of whether they occur in mid or late life, are risk factors for both abnormal brain and cognitive aging. However, the mechanisms behind these associations remain unclear. Heart failure is often comorbid with chronic hypertension or other cardiovascular risk factors, and initial reductions in cardiac output in early stage heart failure result in an increase in SVR to maintain peripheral blood delivery. As heart failure worsens, both cardiac output and SVR decline. Thus, it is unclear if associations between heart failure and brain health are primarily driven by reductions in cardiac output or changes in SVR. Increasing evidence suggests that reductions in cardiac output and changes in vascular stiffness independently affect brain health through overlapping pathways.

It should be noted that hypotension may also play a critical role in mediating associations between heart and brain health, especially in the setting of heart failure. In heart failure, hypotension is relatively common27 and often the consequence of long-term antihypertensive medication utilization.28–30 Among older adults, hypotension is associated with worse cognition31–33 and conversion to dementia.34 These associations are thought to be due to hypoperfusion and subsequent small vessel disease, as hypotension is associated with reduced CBF35 and increased risk of stroke,36 cerebral infarcts,37 and white matter hyperintensities.37 Although this review will primarily focus on the effects of cardiac output and arterial stiffness on brain health, hypotension is an important mechanism to consider when examining associations between heart health and brain health.

Subclinical Cardiac Dysfunction Contributions to Brain Health

Recently, even suboptimal changes in cardiac output, without significant changes in SVR, have been implicated in abnormal brain aging, supporting the hypothesis that the brain is vulnerable to subtle changes in cardiac output. According to epidemiological evidence from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort, one-third of the general adult population meets clinical criteria for low cardiac output,1 an observation that could not be explained by prevalent cardiovascular disease. In the absence of cardiovascular disease, lower cardiac output is associated with smaller gray matter volume among community-dwelling middle aged5 and older adults,5,6,38 but not markers of small vessel disease, including white matter hyperintensities,5 infarcts,6 or microbleeds.6 Lower cardiac output is also associated with worse cognitive performances,6,39 and though findings have been inconsistent, 6 some epidemiological evidence suggests lower cardiac output is associated with a nearly 3-fold risk of developing clinical dementia over a 7.7 year followup period.1 Although these studies seem to suggest that associations between lower cardiac output and worse clinical outcomes are driven by neurodegenerative changes rather than small vessel disease, more work is needed to determine how cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes or coronary artery disease, may obscure associations between cardiac function and small vessel disease. Importantly, associations between lower cardiac output and smaller gray matter volumes are driven by individuals with normal cognition, not MCI,40 suggesting subclinical cardiac dysfunction may play a larger role in precipitating neuropathology and subsequent cognitive decline than previously recognized.

Additional evidence suggests other measures of subclinical cardiac dysfunction are also associated with brain changes. In the absence of heart failure, reduced LVEF is associated with structural brain changes41 and worse cognitive performance23,42 among both middle-aged23,42 and older adults.23,41 Cardiac strain, which measures the percent shortening of subendocardial fibers during the cardiac cycle,43 has emerged as a potentially more sensitive marker of cardiac contractility than LVEF.44–46 Emerging evidence suggests in the absence of heart failure, compromised strain is associated with worse cognitive performance42,46 and small vessel disease, including white matter hyperintensity volume and infarcts,45 in the absence of any similar associations with LVEF. Additionally, older adults with MCI, a prodromal phase of dementia, have compromised strain compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals.47 Even in young adulthood or midlife, compromised strain is associated with adverse structural brain changes48 and worse cognition.42 Thus, subclinical changes in cardiac contractility and pumping efficiency may affect brain health, even among younger individuals before the onset of age-related cognitive impairment or neurodegeneration.

Neurobiological Pathways

The precise pathways through which cardiovascular dysfunction affects brain health remain elusive, but it is possible that the associations are partially mediated by changes in CBF delivery (see Figure). Patients with heart failure have reduced CBF compared with adults without heart failure.49 This association is likely due to compromised contractility, as reduced LVEF is associated with decreased CBF in older adults with heart failure,50 and CBF returns to normal levels after successful heart transplantation and restored cardiac function.51 Interestingly, suboptimal cardiac output is also associated with decreased CBF among older adults in the absence of heart failure.4 Suboptimal cardiac output and subsequent CBF changes may not be robust enough to cause frank ischemia, which is supported by the aforementioned absence of associations between cardiac output and white matter changes.5,6 However, given lower cardiac output consistently relates to gray matter volumes, a marker of neurodegeneration, subclinical cardiac dysfunction, and corresponding CBF reductions may be sufficient to initiate dysmetabolism and apoptosis within neurons. Small reductions in CBF can lead to blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability,52 extracellular matrix remodeling, 53 and synaptic dysfunction.54 In animal models of cerebral ischemia, transport across the BBB is increased,52 proteases inducing neuronal death are upregulated,53 and synaptic transmission is depressed.54 These processes may lead to toxin build-up and neuronal death, aligning with reported associations between cardiac output and neuroimaging markers of neurodegeneration.5,6 Notably, associations between suboptimal reductions in cardiac output, reduced CBF,4 and smaller gray matter volumes40 are all driven by individuals with normal cognition, and BBB breakdown in the hippocampus occurs before Aβ (amyloid-β) and tau pathology accumulation.55 Thus, BBB disruption due to suboptimal cardiac output may be one pathway through which reductions in cardiac output precipitate brain aging, before overt cognitive impairment. However, it should be noted that subclinical reductions in cardiac contractility, such as compromised cardiac strain, may not be robust enough to lead to cerebral hypoperfusion. Although the pathways connecting subtle changes in contractility to brain health remain unknown, it is possible that severe reductions in cardiac contractility may increase the risk for blood stasis within the heart and subsequent microemboli,56 leading to microcirculatory damage57 and cognitive decline.58

Cardiovascular dysfunction could contribute to neurodegeneration and cognitive outcomes through tau pathology (see Figure). Among older adults with normal cognition, lower LVEF is associated with increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of tau,59 reflecting greater cerebral tauopathy. Tau is one of the hallmark neuropathologies that accumulates in AD, along with Aβ. Additionally, some evidence suggests that cardiovascular dysfunction may contribute to Aβ accumulation.60 However, studies examining neuropathological associations with heart failure suggest cardiac dysfunction may primarily affect brain health through pathways independent of AD. Compared with individuals without heart failure, individuals with heart failure have milder AD neuropathology61 and are less likely to have Tar DNA binding protein 43 postmortem.62 Recent animal evidence also suggests inflammation may account for cardiac dysfunction connections to adverse brain outcomes. After myocardial infarction, mice show increased microglia activation, which is specific to cerebral inflammation.63 However, additional studies are needed confirm associations between cardiac dysfunction and neuroinflammation in humans. Thus, more work examining neuropathological correlates of cardiovascular dysfunction is needed to better understand how subclinical cardiac dysfunction leads to compromised brain structure and function, independently or through mechanisms that intersect with AD pathology.

Arterial Aging

Arterial Stiffness and Abnormal Brain Aging

Changes to brain health may also be due to changes in SVR, which is primarily regulated by the arteries and arterioles. Blood flow is pulsatile throughout the cardiac cycle, as a large pressure wave of blood moves forward after the heart contracts during systole and the wave gradually decreases throughout diastole. After blood leaves the left ventricle, the vascular tree (including the aorta) has varying levels of resistance to ensure proper blood delivery to target organs during these normal changes in pulsatility. During systole, a healthy, compliant aorta expands and absorbs some of the forward pressure wave,64 ensuring that harmful energy is not transferred to smaller, distal (and more fragile) blood vessels. However, as the architecture of the vessel wall changes with age and smooth muscle cells adapt,64 aortic expansion becomes compromised. In normal aging, elastin concentrations decrease,65 collagen concentrations increase,66 and advanced-glycation end products infiltrate the vessel walls,67 resulting in a stiffer morphology. Thus, the aorta becomes less compliant, cannot absorb the excess energy of blood leaving the heart, and greater pulsatile energy is transmitted to the periphery. This transmission is particularly detrimental to high flow organs, such as the kidneys and presumably the brain.

Initial evidence suggesting that arterial stiffness could affect brain health focused on the contributions of hypertension. As vessels cannot adequately expand to absorb pulsatile energy of blood flow, endothelial cells are damaged and vasoconstriction occurs, resulting in increased pressure on the vessel wall and hypertension.68,69 Additionally, increases in arterial stiffness have been associated with blunted baroreflex sensitivity70 and decreased kidney function,71 which also contribute to elevated blood pressure. Hypertension is prevalent among 72% of older adults72 and associated with white matter alterations,73–76 reduced gray matter volume,75,77 worse cognitive performance,77,78 and an increased incidence of MCI.79 Even in midlife, increased blood pressure is associated with greater white matter damage,80 faster hippocampal atrophy, 80 steeper midlife cognitive decline,81 and an increased late life risk of dementia.82,83 These data underscore how early vascular changes, even in midlife, may precede common etiologies of cognitive decline in late life.

Subclinical Arterial Stiffness Contributions to Brain Health

Even before overt hypertension, subclinical increases in arterial stiffness affect brain health. Early arterial stiffness changes can be measured with pulse wave velocity (PWV). Increased PWV is thought to precede hypertension69 and can be measured using tonometry, calculating the time elapsed between blood pulses through large peripheral arteries (most commonly the carotid and femoral arteries) that cross the aortic arch.84 Among older adults, increased carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV) is associated with smaller total brain volumes85 and regions susceptible to neurodegeneration due to AD pathology.85,86 Consistent associations have been reported between cfPWV, stroke,87 and neuroimaging markers of small vessel disease, including microbleeds,86,88,89 infarcts,88,90,91 and compromised white matter macrostructure85,86,90,91 and microstructure92 among older adults. Notably, these associations have also been reported in middle-aged adults,89,93–95 suggesting that arterial stiffness might be an early driver of abnormal white matter changes seen in late life before cognitive decline.

Extensive evidence suggests arterial stiffness is associated with worse cognitive outcomes. Among older adults, increased cfPWV is cross-sectionally associated with worse memory performance,90,91,96,97 and at least one study suggests similar associations exist in midlife.90 Additionally, individuals with MCI and AD have higher cfPWV compared with individuals with normal cognition. 98 Among older adults, baseline arterial stiffness predicts faster cognitive decline over time,99 specifically executive function100 and memory performance,101 and increased cfPWV is associated with an increased conversion rate from MCI to dementia.102 Collectively, these data suggest associations between arterial stiffness and cognitive decline may occur through neurodegeneration, small vessel disease, or white matter damage. However, it should be noted that a majority of arterial stiffness studies rely on tonometry-based measurements at distal arterial sites meant to approximate blood flow that crosses the aortic arch, but these assessments are thought to be confounded by the tortuous architecture of arteries found in aging. Aortic PWV provides a noninvasive direct measurement of blood flow in the thoracic aorta with substantially reduced measurement error compared with other available tools and is thus an accurate measurement of the central path accounting for vessel stiffening.103 Although some studies have utilized this measurement,4,104–106 more studies directly assessing aortic stiffness are needed to understand the effects of aortic stiffening on brain outcomes.

Neurobiological Pathways

Although the mechanisms underlying associations between arterial stiffness and abnormal brain aging remain elusive, existing evidence supports multiple pathways. First, arterial stiffness and the consequential pulsatile energy of blood transmitted to the periphery may directly affect brain structure and function (see Figure). As the vasculature stiffens, there is increased transmission of pulsatile energy to downstream arteries, including the cerebral circulation.3 Increased arterial stiffness leads to increases in blood flow pulsatility, specifically within the carotid arteries,91 which are primary suppliers of the cerebral circulation. Increased forward wave intensity in the carotid arteries is associated with cognitive decline,107 further suggesting that increases in arterial stiffness may directly affect brain health. Increased transmission of pulsatile energy to the cerebral vessels likely leads to microcirculatory damage and remodeling,108 resulting in reduced CBF3 or cerebral ischemia.87 However, even oligemia, reflecting subtle reductions in CBF, can disrupt the BBB.109 Endothelial cells are necessary to preserve the integrity of the BBB, and these cells must be maintained by an optimal shear stress of blood flowing through the vessel.109 Increased pulsatility and reduced CBF result in intermittently higher shear stress, damaging the endothelial cells and downregulating proteins needed to maintain critical BBB properties.109 BBB disruption can compromise transport mechanisms,110 causing the build-up of toxins, such as thrombin111 and fibrinogen,112 and waste products that are normally trafficked through the BBB. These toxins can alter protein synthesis113 and synaptic dysfunction,112 possibly accounting for the aforementioned associations linking arterial stiffness to neurodegeneration85,86 and cognitive decline.90,91,96,97 Additionally, increased pulsatility may incite an inflammatory cascade, including astrocyte114 and microglia115 activation, damaging both gray and white matter. Although speculative, these hypotheses are supported by unpublished work from our group105 showing that higher PWV is associated with higher concentrations of CSF neurogranin, reflecting synaptic dysfunction,116 and higher levels of CSF YKL-40, a marker of inflammation,117 among older adults.

Second, arterial stiffness could influence brain outcomes by interacting with AD pathology, including Aβ and tau (see Figure). Among older adults, greater systemic cardiovascular risk,118 primarily driven by hypertension, 119 is associated with greater in vivo levels of positron emission tomography118 and CSF tau.119 Our unpublished data also suggest that higher PWV is associated with greater CSF tau concentrations among older adults.105 Although the molecular mechanisms behind these associations are unknown, increased arterial stiffness and the subsequent transmission of pulsatile energy to cerebral circulation may lead to decreased CBF,3 as described above. Multiple animal120 and human121 studies suggest that decreased CBF modulates tau expression and leads to tau hyperphosphorylation, possibly accounting for reported associations between arterial stiffness and tau pathology.105,122 Less evidence suggests arterial stiffness may affect Aβ pathology. Among older adults, higher cfPWV is associated with greater in vivo cerebral Aβ deposition measured on positron emission tomography.123 Although arterial stiffness results in cerebral oligemia,3 hypoxia increases amyloidogenic Aβ processing,124 and BBB integrity125 is necessary for Aβ clearance. Thus, as arteries stiffen and more pulsatile energy is transmitted to the cerebral circulation, Aβ may accumulate at a faster rate. By contrast, other studies have not found arterial stiffness associations with in vivo Aβ levels.105,118,119 In summary, these findings suggest that arterial stiffness likely affects brain structure and function through at least tau pathology, but whether that is independent of or in conjunction with Aβ pathology remains to be seen. Clearly, there is a major need for robust, future work examining the consequences of increased arterial stiffness and brain health in the presence or absence of AD pathology.

Furthermore, it is noteworthy that arterial stiffness associations with decreased CBF3 and increased in vivo tau levels are driven by individuals with normal cognition, not MCI.105 Recent studies support the hypothesis that vascular changes precede AD pathology development,126 midlife vascular risk factors are associated with increased Aβ deposition 20 years later,127 and a recent meta-analysis suggests that vascular dysregulation precedes abnormal protein accumulation, structural brain changes, and cognitive decline.128 Thus, it is plausible that early changes in arterial stiffness and vascular hemodynamics, even at midlife, precede and lead to subtle changes in CBF, BBB disruption, chronic inflammation, or exacerbation of AD pathology that leads to worsening symptom progression in late life.

Conclusion

Emerging evidence suggests changes in cardiovascular integrity are related to worse brain health outcomes, even in the absence of prevalent cardiovascular disease. Age-related subclinical cardiac dysfunction and arterial stiffness have been associated with compromised brain structure and function and seem to exert the greatest effect before the onset of any clinical manifestations of cognitive impairment. These early cardiac hemodynamic changes may contribute to reduced CBF and BBB disruption, directly impacting brain integrity or exacerbating downstream consequences of AD pathology, ultimately contributing to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. It is critical to gain a better understanding of the pathways through which systemic hemodynamics affect brain health before symptom onset to aid in the discovery of new therapeutic strategies focused on these concomitant pathologies through which age-related changes in cardiovascular integrity and AD pathology interact to worsen clinical trajectory among middle-aged and older adults.

Subclinical reductions in cardiac function result in reduced total cerebral blood flow (CBF). Though this reduction may not be enough to cause frank ischemia, it may lead to disruptions in metabolite delivery and clearance, resulting in neuronal dysmetabolism. Neuronal misfiring and metabolic insufficiency may spur the development of tau and synaptic dysfunction, eventually causing neurodegeneration detectable on neuroimaging. As arteries stiffen in older age and are less able to buffer the pulsatile energy of blood, harmful energy is transmitted to the cerebral microcirculation. This increased energy damages the blood-brain barrier, inciting an inflammatory response and possibly compromising amyloid-β clearance mechanisms, resulting in white matter damage. Capillary damage also may lead to reduced CBF over time, resulting in tau upregulation, synaptic dysfunction, and subsequent neurodegeneration.

Highlights

Subtle age-related changes in cardiac hemodynamics have been proposed as an emerging risk factor for abnormal brain aging, even in the absence of cardiovascular disease.

Reduced cardiac output and increased arterial stiffness may cause oligemia and blood-brain barrier breakdown, leading to neurodegeneration, small vessel disease, and cognitive decline.

Age-related subclinical cardiac dysfunction and arterial stiffness seem to exert the greatest effect prior to the onset of cognitive impairment, suggesting cardiovascular changes may play a larger role in precipitating neuropathology and subsequent cognitive decline than previously recognized.
