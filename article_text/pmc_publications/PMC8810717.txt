Aims.

To illuminate the pathological synergy between Aβ and tau leading to the neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), here we have performed a comparative neuropathological study utilizing three distinctive variants of human tau (WT tau, P301L mutant tau and S320F mutant tau). Previously, in non-transgenic mice, we showed that WT tau or P301L tau does not form NFT while S320F tau can spontaneously aggregate into NFT, allowing us to test the selective vulnerability of these different tau conformations to the presence of Aβ plaques.

Methods.

We injected recombinant AAV-tau constructs into neonatal APP transgenic TgCRND8 mice or into 3 month old TgCRND8 mice; both cohorts were aged 3 months post injection. This allowed us to test how different tau variants synergize with soluble forms of Aβ (pre-deposit cohort) or with frank Aβ deposits (post-deposit cohort) respectively.

Results.

Expression of WT tau did not produce NFT or altered Aβ in either cohort. In the pre-deposit cohort, S320F tau induced Aβ plaque deposition, neuroinflammation and synaptic abnormalities, suggesting that early tau tangles affect the amyloid cascade. In the post-deposit cohort, contemporaneous expression of S320F tau did not exacerbate amyloid pathology, showing a dichotomy in Aβ-tau synergy based on the nature of Aβ. P301L tau produced NFT-type inclusions in the post-deposit cohort, but not in the pre-deposit cohort, indicating pathological synergy with pre-existing Aβ deposits.

Conclusions.

Our data shows that different tau mutations representing specific folding variants of tau synergize with Aβ to different extents, depending on the presence of cerebral deposits.

pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive accumulation of extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) deposits and intracellular inclusions or neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau). A long-standing hypothesis that reconciles this stereotypical and staged appearance of Aβ and tau across different brain regions was first proposed by Dr Hardy (1) and revised in later years (2). Based on the evidence that Aβ presages tauopathy and neurodegeneration, this hypothesis argues that Aβ triggers NFT pathology leading to cognitive impairment and related pathologic sequelae.

Several mouse modelling studies have shown that Aβ leads to exacerbated tau pathologies in mouse models expressing a tauopathy-related mutant tau gene (3, 4). Since these early studies, several additional combinatorial models expressing human mutant APP and human [P301L] MAPT have been reported. In one of these combinatorial transgenic models, reducing Aβ was sufficient to clear early stage tauopathy (5). Another study has shown that presence of cortical Aβ plaques accelerates the development of tauopathy along the perforant pathway and synergizes with tau-related neurodegeneration (6). Interestingly, Aβ plaque accumulation does not exacerbate human WT tau pathology (7), though overexpression of a seed-competent tau fragment can induce the pathological conversion of WT mouse tau in mice with neuritic Aβ plaques (8). Taken together these studies demonstrate that human Aβ and tau show pathological cooperativity in transgenic models, but questions remain as to which species of Aβ and tau synergize with each other.

Most, if not all, of these studies have examined the synergy between Aβ and tau using the tauopathy-associated P301L mutant tau (9). Whether WT tau is also amenable to transition readily into inclusion pathology in the presence of pre-existing Aβ deposits remains uncertain. Another critical question that is relevant to understanding the Aβ-tau synergy is whether Aβ plaques per se are required for maturation of ptau into NFT inclusions. To address these questions, we utilized our recently published suite of AAV-tau constructs, which show distinct functional and folding properties when expressed in non-transgenic (nonTG) mice (10). Human WT tau and P301L tau does not form NFT tau following 6 months of sustained expression in mice, whereas the S320F tau showed self-aggregating properties in cell culture (11) and in nonTG mice (10). To test the hypothesis that presence of Aβ plaques is necessary for the accelerated transition of soluble ptau to insoluble NFT, we delivered these AAVs either in neonatal TgCRND8 mice before the initiation of cerebral amyloidosis (pre-deposit cohort) or in 3 month old TgCRND8 mice with pre-existing Aβ plaques (post-deposit cohort). We found that AAV-P301L tau formed misfolded NFTs only when expressed in adult mice with pre-existing Aβ plaques but not when expressed in neonatal mice that lack cerebral Aβ plaques. WT tau did not form NFTs in either of the two cohorts tested. As expected, S320F tau induced NFT pathology in both cohorts but accelerated amyloid deposition in the pre-deposit group but not in the post-deposit group. In summary, using a combinatorial approach of AAV transgenesis and transgenic mice, we demonstrate a unique neuropathological synergy between Aβ plaques and P301L tau recapitulating AD-type neuropathology.

Materials and Methods

Mice:

Mouse experimental procedures and husbandry were in line with the policies set forth by the University of Florida and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. TgCRND8 mice were bred in house under a 12 hour light/dark cycle with unlimited access to food and water. TgCRND8 mice (heterozygous for APPswe/ind) express the AD-associated human APP bearing the Indiana (V717F) and Swedish (K670N/M671L) mutations under the control of the hamster prion promoter (12). These mice were maintained by breeding with nonTG B6/C3H mice (Envigo). The nonTG cohorts used in the experiments are the wild type littermates resulting from breeding TgCRND8 males with B6.C3H females. The sex distribution in the post-deposit TgCRND8 cohort were: 5 females (Control), 3 females and 2 males (AAV- WT tau), 4 females and 1 male (AAV-P301L tau), and 5 females (AAV-S320F tau). The sex distribution in the pre-deposit mice were: 2 females and 3 males (Control), 2 females and 3 males (AAV-WT tau), 2 females and 3 males (AAV-P301L tau) and 2 males and 3 females (AAV-S320F tau).

AAV packaging and injections:

Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (capsid 1) expressing human 0N/4R WT tau or tauopathy-associated mutant tau variants (P301L or S320F) (13, 14) under the control of the cytomegalovirus enhancer/chicken β-actin (CMV/CBA) promoter were packaged as described earlier (10). Mice were injected bilaterally with 1×1010 vector genomes per hemisphere in two cohorts: in the pre-deposit cohort, AAVs were delivered into the cerebral ventricles of neonatal TgCRND8 mice and aged until 3 months of age; in the post-deposit cohort, AAVs were delivered in the hippocampus of 3 month old TgCRND8 mice and aged until 6 months of age. Control mice received injections of AAV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The EGFP transgene was expressed from the same promoter (CMV/CBA) as the AAV-tau constructs. Brains were harvested following intra-cardiac perfusion and the left hemisphere flash frozen while the right hemisphere was fixed in normal buffered formalin and paraffin embedded.

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence:

Immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded brain sections was done as described in detail in Supplementary Methods (Data S1) using antibodies listed under Table S1.

Quantification of DAB-stained slides:

Three slides were chosen from each mouse (at least 30 μm apart), images captured using an Aperio scanner, and Aβ immunoreactivity was quantified using the Positive Pixel Count program (Aperio). Results were averaged across the three slides. Data is presented as mean immunoreactivity ± sem.

Neuritic plaque (NP) quantification:

Fluorescent images were obtained using an Olympus BX51fluorescence microscope mounted with a DP71 digital camera (Olympus) or Keyence BX-Z8000 microscope. The slides were then coded, and an experimenter blindly counted total number of plaques associated with ptau and total number of plaques without ptau. Two sections per animal were quantified and added together. Averaged data is presented as mean± sem.

Sequential extraction of brain lysates, Aβ ELISA and immunoblotting:

Frozen hemibrains were pulverized, weighed and homogenized sequentially in RIPA buffer, 2% SDS and 70% formic acid as described earlier (15). Aβ levels were quantified by ELISA assay using end-specific antibodies (capture antibody for Aβ40 and Aβ42: 13.1.1 and 2.1.3; detection antibody: 33.1.1 conjugated to HRP). The colorimetric reaction was visualized using SpectraMax device (Molecular Devices) and results analysed using SoftMax software (Molecular Devices). For immunoblotting, 30 μg of RIPA lysates or SDS lysates were separated on 4–20% Tris-glycine gel (Novex, Invitrogen), transferred to PVDF and immunoblotted for indicated antibodies (Table S1). Membranes were scanned using the multiplex Li-Cor Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) and data quantified using ImageJ Software (NIH).

RNA isolation from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue, nCounter assay and data analysis.

RNA was isolated from formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections using High Pure FFPET RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer’s protocols. RNA samples were diluted to 20 ng/μl and allowed to bind to the nCounter Neuropathology panel codeset (NanoString). Data was normalized and analysed using the nSolver software. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed with goseq, v1.42.0 within R v4.0.3. Co-expression network plots were constructed with igraph v1.2.6 and drawn with ggraph v2.0.4 in R. p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons.

Statistical Analysis:

Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism (Version 7) and statistical tests used are specified in the figure legends.

Results

Expression of recombinant AAV-tau leads to differential induction of NFT pathology in TgCRND8 mice

The main objective of this study was to examine how the pathologic synergy between Aβ and tau is modulated by (a) conformational variations in tau and (b) presence of Aβ deposits. Towards this, we selected a suite of 0N/4R human tau constructs - WT tau (associated with AD), P301L tau (a widely-studied mutation associated with FTD) and S320F tau (a Pick’s disease associated variant) - based on their differential properties to self-aggregate (reviewed in (16)). We have previously reported that neonatal injection of adeno-associated viruses (AAV) expressing WT tau or P301L tau in nonTG mice resulted in robust accumulation of ptau without NFTs following 6 months of sustained expression, while expression of the S320F tau resulted in NFT tau pathology localized to the area of injection within 3 months of expression (10). In this study, we further tested a small cohort of nonTG animals at 9 months of age that were injected with AAV-WT tau or AAV-P301L tau on neonatal day P0. We confirmed human tau expression in these mice by using human tau specific CP27 antibody (Fig. S1). Using Alz50 antibody indicative of NFT pathology, we found that AAV-P301L tau mice developed cortical NFT tau at this age while the WT tau expressing animals still had no discernible NFTs even at this age (Fig. S1). This suggested that simple overexpression of tau does not always produce AD-typical NFT but other factors, including aging and type of tau sequence variant, play a deterministic role.

As AD pathogenesis typically starts with cortical Aβ deposits (17), our next goal was to examine whether the presence of Aβ deposits can accelerate the misfolding of ptau into AD-typical NFT inclusions. The suite of AAV vectors that encode different tau sequence variants having differential neuropathological properties ((10) and Fig. S1) allowed us to examine the whether there is a potential pathologic synergy between different types of tau variants and Aβ deposits. The 0N/4R tau AAV constructs and the control AAV-EGFP construct were generated and packaged in AAV serotype 1 as described previously (10). The first ‘post-deposit’ cohort involved injecting these AAV constructs in the hippocampus of 3 month old TgCRND8 mice (transgenic for human APP K670N, M671L, V717F, APPswe/ind) with pre-existing Aβ deposits and aging them until 6 months of age. This represents a contemporaneous tau expression paradigm in the presence of existing Aβ deposits (Fig. 1A–D). In the second ‘pre-deposit’ cohort, these AAVs were delivered to neonatal TgCRND8 mice and aged to 3 months, representing a scenario where AAV-tau expression and resulting tau pathology precedes the onset of frank Aβ deposits (Fig. 1E–H).

We first confirmed the expression levels of human tau in the post-deposit cohort and pre-deposit cohort using the CP27 antibody and quantifying the immunoreactivity burden as a measure of tau overexpression. In the 6 month old post-deposit cohort, hippocampal delivery of AAV-tau initiated at 3 months of age resulted in widespread expression of human tau in the hippocampus (Fig. 1B–C; WT tau: p&lt;0.01; P301L tau: p&lt;0.05; S320F tau: p&lt;0.05 relative to EGFP) and to a lesser extent in the overlying cortex (Fig. 1B,D; P301L tau: p&lt;0.05 relative to EGFP). Compared to endogenous mouse tau, the levels of WT tau, P301L tau and S320F tau were upregulated by 5.1x, 4.8x and 2.2x respectively (Fig. S2A–B). In the pre-deposit cohort, neonatal delivery of AAV-tau resulted in tau being uniformly distributed throughout the hippocampus (Fig. 1F–G; WT tau: p&lt;0.05; P301L tau: p&lt;0.05; S320F tau: p&lt;0.05 relative to EGFP) as well as the cortex (Fig. 1F,H; WT tau: p&lt;0.05; P301L tau: p&lt;0.01 relative to EGFP) at 3 months of age. Compared to endogenous mouse tau, the levels of WT tau, P301L tau and S320F tau were upregulated by 8.5x, 4.8x and 5.8x respectively (Fig. S2C–D).

Next, we assessed the induction of ptau and misfolded NFT-type tau in these cohorts by measuring immunoreactivity burden of CP13 antibody and counting MC1 antibody-stained immunopositive cells respectively. In the 6 month old post-deposit cohort (Fig. 2A–E), we observed that CP13 immunostaining burden (indicative of pSer202 tau) was robustly upregulated in the hippocampus and cortex in both P301L tau and WT tau (Fig. 2A–C; P301L tau: p&lt;0.05 relative to EGFP in hippocampus; WT tau: p&lt;0.05 relative to EGFP in hippocampus). The CP13 immunoreactivity burden in the cortex and hippocampus of S320F tau expressing mice was limited relative to WT tau and P301L tau expressing mice (Fig. 2A–C). To confirm the presence of pretangle tau, we used the MC1 antibody, which is representative of conformationally altered misfolded tau forming NFT-type inclusion pathology (18). We observed MC1 positive somatodendritic pretangle inclusions in the P301L tau expressing mice and S320F tau expressing mice, but not in WT tau expressing mice (Fig. 2D–E; P301L tau: p&lt;0.01 relative to EGFP; S320F tau: p&lt;0.01 relative to EGFP). We also confirmed that a small proportion of these MC1 immunopositive pretangle inclusions observed in the AAV-P301L tau expressing mice stained with Gallyas silver, indicating the presence of NFT (Fig. S3A). When we normalized the number of MC1-positive pretangle inclusions to ptau burden, we found that both P301L tau and S320F tau, but not WT tau expressing mice, showed induction of NFT (Fig. S3B).

In the 3 month old pre-deposit cohort, we found that CP13 staining was upregulated in the hippocampus and cortex of AAV-P301L tau mice and AAV-WT tau mice (Fig. 2F–H; hippocampus - WT tau: p&lt;0.01, P301L tau: p&lt;0.01 relative to EGFP; cortex - WT tau: p&lt;0.05, P301L tau: p&lt;0.01 relative to EGFP). The levels of ptau were considerably lower in the AAV-S320F tau expressing mice (Fig. 2F–H), as expected from our previous data in nonTG mice (10). When we quantified MC1-immunopositive inclusion pathology, we observed pretangle pathology exclusively in the AAV-S320F tau expressing mice but not in the AAV-WT tau or AAV-P301L tau mice (Fig. 2I–J; S320F: p&lt;0.001 relative to EGFP). Normalizing the MC1 inclusion numbers to the ptau burden confirmed that only S320F tau showed self-aggregation properties in the pre-deposit cohort (Fig. S3C), also consistent with our previous data in nonTG mice (10).

To confirm if the induction of silver-positive tangles in AAV-P301L tau mice is dependent on the presence of Aβ deposits, we delivered AAV-P301L tau in the hippocampus of nonTG mice that are littermates of TgCRND8 mice (Fig. S4). The injections in nonTG mice were done under the same experimental conditions as their transgenic littermates. We observed robust tau expression (Fig. S4, CP27 immunostaining) and induction of hyperphoshorylated tau (Fig. S4, CP13 immunostaining), but we did not observe any silver positive tangles in these mice. Together, this data suggests that presence of Aβ induces tau misfolding and tangle-type features in the P301L tau expressing mice.

We next investigated the presence of the TauC3 epitope which is generated by caspase cleavage of tau at Asp421 and is indicative of NFT and neurodegeneration (19). In the 6 month post-deposit group, we found robust levels of TauC3-immunopositivity in the cortex and hippocampus of S320F tau expressing TgCRND8 mice (Fig. 3A–B; p&lt;0.01 relative to EGFP, WT tau and P301L tau). We also found sparse TauC3 immunopositive cells in the hippocampus and cortex of AAV-P301L tau expressing TgCRND8 mice (Fig. 3A–B). Neither AAV-EGFP nor AAV-WT tau expressing mice showed any TauC3 staining (Fig. 3A–B). Despite increased TauC3 levels, we did not observe any gross changes in total levels of neuronal-specific proteins, NeuN and CaMKII in the post-deposit cohort (Fig. S5A–D). In the pre-deposit cohort, we observed Tau C3 only in the S320F tau expressing mice (Fig. 3C–D; p&lt;0.001 relative to EGFP, WT tau and P301L tau). None of the other mice in this pre-deposit cohort - AAV-EGFP, AAV-WT tau or AAV-P301L tau mice - displayed TauC3 immunoreactivity (Fig. 3C–D). The presence of TauC3 epitope only in the post-deposit cohort, but not in the pre-deposit cohort of the P301L tau mice underscores the pathologic synergy between P301L tau and Aβ plaques.

The relationship of tau expression to Aβ levels in TgCRND8 mice

We next examined Aβ levels in mice expressing different AAV-tau variants in the two cohorts. In the 6 month old post-deposit cohort, we observed that AAV-tau expression slightly lowered total Aβ plaque burden relative to AAV-EGFP mice (Fig. 4A–B). We also assessed the biochemical levels of Aβ following serial fractionation of brains. The biochemical levels of insoluble Aβ42 and Aβ40 (formic acid extracted, detergent insoluble fraction) were unchanged across all the tau expressing groups (Fig. 4C–D), consistent with the plaque burden analysis. Detergent-soluble Aβ42 and Aβ40 (SDS extracted fraction) were reduced in some of the AAV-tau expressing mice – WT tau expression reduced detergent soluble Aβ42 (p&lt;0.01 compared to EGFP mice) while AAV-S320F tau mice showed reduced Aβ40 (p&lt;0.01 compared to EGFP mice) (Fig. 4E–F). We wanted to examine further whether expression of AAV-tau led to changes in plaque morphology or neuritic changes (Fig. S6). Upon counting Aβ plaques based on diameter, we found that the distribution of plaque sizes in AAV-EGFP, AAV-WT tau, AAV-P301L tau and AAV-S320F tau groups were uniformly similar across the treatment groups (Fig. S6A). However, we noticed the appearance of a very small proportion of large diameter plaques (&gt;150 μm) only in the AAV-S320F tau mice (Fig. S6A). We also examined dystrophic pathology by counting CP13 immunopositive axonal processes or phosphorylated neurofilament H (pNF-H) decorated axonal processes surrounding Aβ plaques. Referring to these as neuritic plaques (NP), we found that both ptau-immunoreactive and pNF-H-immunoreactive NP counts were similar in all AAV-tau expressing animals (Fig. S6B–E).

In the 3 month old pre-deposit cohort, we found that AAV-S320F tau mice had significantly higher Aβ plaque burden relative to the other AAV-tau mice and control mice (Fig. 4G–H; p&lt;0.05 compared to AAV-P301L tau mice). There were no significant differences between AAV-EGFP, AAV-WT tau and AAV-P301L tau mice (Fig. 4G–H). In terms of biochemical levels of insoluble plaque associated Aβ, the S320F tau expressing mice showed increased Aβ42 and Aβ40 (Fig. 4I–J; p&lt;0.01 for insoluble Aβ42 and p&lt;0.05 for insoluble Aβ40 relative to AAV-P301L tau mice). In the detergent soluble fraction, the S320F tau mice also showed higher biochemical levels of Aβ42 (Fig. 4K–L; p&lt;0.01 relative to AAV-EGFP and p&lt;0.05 relative to AAV-P301L tau). Neither the P301L tau mice nor the WT tau (Fig. 4I–L) expressing mice showed any significant changes in biochemical Aβ levels relative to control mice. We also examined NP pathology using ptau specific CP13 antibody colocalizing with Thioflavin S reactive plaques and observed that all the groups had similar levels of NPs (Fig. S7).

Altered gene expression in the post-deposit cohort of AAV-tau expressing TgCRND8 mice

We were interested in understanding how pathological synergy between AAV-tau and Aβ deposits influences gene expression in the post-deposit cohort. We used the 770-gene NanoString nCounter Mouse Neuropathology panel which was designed to assess gene expression changes related to AD-associated co-expression modules identified from the AMP-AD module data. We observed that relative to AAV-EGFP, the three AAV-tau constructs showed distinctive gene expression patterns (Fig. 5A), especially in pathways related to neuroinflammation, cell structure integrity, neurotransmission and neuroplasticity. The WT tau expressing mice showed the largest changes in differential expression of genes (DEG) when compared to EGFP controls, with the top affected genes being Slc6a3 (Log2FC=4.38; p=0.0174), Ddc (Log2FC=1.54; p=0.007) and Mutyh (Log2FC=0.59; p=0.0458) (Fig. 5B–C; Table S2). The robustly downregulated genes include Atp6v0e2 (Log2FC= −3.52; p=0.0001), Ntf3 (Log2FC= −1.09; p=0.0357) and Gdnf (Log2FC= −0.929; p=0.0401) (Fig. 5B–C; Table S2). GO analysis of upregulated genes showed that AAV-WT tau expression resulted in genes enriched for regulating endothelial permeability across tricellular tight junctions, including blood brain barrier (p=0.008), lipoprotein transport (p=0.012) and dopamine biosynthesis (p=0.002) (Fig. 5D). Co-expression analysis shows that genes related to catecholamine synthesis and blood brain barrier integrity were upregulated (Fig. 5E). Enrichment analysis of downregulated genes revealed that WT tau expression is associated with negative regulation of lipid catabolism (p=0.0003), regulation of amine transport (p=0.0008) and inflammatory response (p=0.0002) (Fig. 5F). Protein-protein network analysis also revealed consistent gene expression patterns (Fig. 5G). Overall, WT tau expression predominantly affected pathways related to cellular metabolism and transport.

The S320F tau expressing mice showed a uniquely distinctive DEG, with the top upregulated genes being Slc6a3 (Log2FC=3.82; p=0.031), Ret (Log2FC=1.44; p=0.044), Ddc (Log2FC=1.28; p=0.0188) (Fig. 5H–I; Table S3). Among the downregulated genes include Itgax (Log2FC= −1.39; p=0.0186), Npas4 (Log2FC= −1.15; p=0.005) and Ntf3 (Log2FC= −1; p=0.0475) (Fig. 5H–I; Table S3). The pattern of upregulated genes was consistent primarily with enrichment in pathways related to immune response (p=0.001), actin polymerization (p=0.001) and response to cAMP (p=0.0005), which was reflected in the protein-protein expression network analysis (Fig. 5J–K). In the AAV-S320F tau mice, the downregulated DEGs were associated with pathways related to actin cytoskeleton reorganization (p=0.003), immune response (p=0.0031) and regulation of protein phosphorylation (p=0.002) (Fig. 5L–M). On the whole, AAV-S320F tau expression induced changes related to altered actin dynamics and immune response.

Comparison of gene expression patterns in mice expressing AAV-P301L tau relative to AAV-EGFP revealed that genes that are maximally induced include Slc6a3 (Log2FC=3.5; p=0.044), Fas (Log2FC=0.80; p=0.0404) and Lsr (Log2FC=0.51; p=0.001) (Fig. 5N–O; Table S4). Among the genes that were downregulated were Slc18a3, also known as Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (Log2FC= −1.3; p=0.015), Itgax, an integrin involved in immunity (Log2FC= −1.22; p=0.0282) and Des, an intermediate filament (Log2FC= −0.903; p=0.0488) (Fig. 5O; Table S4). Genes that were exclusively altered in AAV-P301L mice were Cxcl12, Des, Slc18a3, Tie1, Fas, Mapt and Notch 3 (Table S5). Gene enrichment analysis of upregulated genes revealed several affected pathways in the P301L tau mice, such as tricellular tight junction assembly which is associated with blood brain barrier (p=0.008), Fas signalling pathway (p=0.008) and lipoprotein transport (p= 0.008) (Fig. 5P–Q). Analysis of downregulated genes revealed co-expression networks related to induction of antigen presentation (p=0.0135), dendritic cell apoptosis (p=0.009) and chemokine signalling (p=0.001) (Fig. 5R–S). Based on such consistent changes in immune gene co-expression networks and because we observed that Trem2 was downregulated in AAV-P301L tau mice (Log2= −0.659; p=0.0143), we next generated a damage associated microglia (DAM) score based on a subset of immune genes characteristic of microglia shifting from homeostatic to DAM phenotype (20). While the mice did not show any alterations in Stage 1 DAM score (Fig 5T), the AAV-P301L tau expressing mice displayed significantly reduced Stage 2 DAM score compared to control mice (Fig. 5U; p&lt;0.05).

There were some genes that were commonly altered in all the cohorts of AAV-tau (Table S6). Three of these – Lsr, Pqbp1 and Slc6a3 - were upregulated while Trem2 was downregulated. In addition to these genes, there were some common patterns observed in dual comparisons. The P301L tau mice had limited similarities with the S320F tau in spite of shared neuropathological features. Only one gene – Itgax – was identified to be commonly altered in a comparison of the DEG in P301L tau and S320F tau mice (Table S6). Further only two genes – Ryr1 and Taf10 – were identified in the DEG comparison of P301L tau mice and WT tau mice (Table S6). Surprisingly, a larger number of genes were identified to be commonly altered between WT tau and S320F tau – Cdc27, Cx3cr1, Npas4, Ntf3, Ptprr, Ddc and Gad2 (Table S6).

Neuroinflammatory alterations in AAV-tau expressing TgCRND8 mice

We next examined neuroinflammatory alterations in AAV-tau expressing TgCRND8 mice. We used a GFAP antibody to examine astrogliosis and Iba-1 and Tmem119 antibodies to examine microgliosis. The Iba-1 antibody detects all types of microglia and macrophages, including activated microglia, whereas Tmem119 is specific for mature microglia, especially those performing homeostatic function (21). In the 6 month old post-deposit cohort, none of the AAV-tau mice were associated with altered GFAP, Iba-1 or Tmem119 immunoreactivity relative to AAV-EGFP control mice (Fig. 6A–I).

In the 3 month old pre-deposit cohort, the astrogliosis pattern in AAV-tau mice correlated with the increased Aβ burden found in S320F tau expressing mice. GFAP immunostaining in both cortex and hippocampus was consistently upregulated in S320F tau mice (p&lt;0.0001 compared to control CRND8 mice) while there were no significant differences between control, WT tau and P301L tau mice (Fig. 7A–C). In both hippocampus and cortex, the S320F tau mice showed high levels of Iba-1 immunoreactivity (p&lt;0.001 in hippocampus, p&lt;0.01 in cortex relative to control CRND8 mice) (Fig. 7D–F). AAV-P301L tau mice showed significantly upregulated Iba-1 staining in the cortex (p&lt;0.05 compared to control CRND8 mice) respectively (Fig. 7D–F). AAV-WT tau mice showed increased Iba-1 staining in the hippocampus (p&lt;0.05 compared to control CRND8 mice) (Fig. 7D–F). Tmem119-reactive microglial population showed subtle lowering trend in the cortex and hippocampus of AAV-P301L tau and AAV-S320F tau expressing mice relative to control transgenic mice (Fig. 7G–I). Overall, while tau expression induced gliosis in the pre-deposit cohort (Fig. 7), there were no similar changes in the post-deposit cohort when tau was expressed contemporaneously with Aβ plaques (Fig. 6).

Differential synaptic alterations in AAV-tau expressing TgCRND8 mice

We next examined whether expression of AAV-tau alters synaptic protein levels differentially in the post-deposit and pre-deposit cohorts. Following up on our previous publications (10, 22), we broadly examined the levels of post-synaptic (spinophilin and PSD95) and pre-synaptic markers (synaptogyrin and synaptophysin) that are associated with proteinopathy (Fig. 8A–H). In the 6 month old post-deposit cohort, we found that the post-synaptic marker, spinophilin, is upregulated in the AAV WT tau mice relative to control (p&lt;0.05), AAV-P301L tau (p&lt;0.01) and AAV-S320F tau (p&lt;0.01) mice (Fig. 8A). Another post-synaptic marker, PSD95, was upregulated specifically in AAV-P301L tau mice relative to control mice (p&lt;0.01) (Fig. 8D). None of the pre-synaptic proteins (synaptophysin and synaptogyrin 3) showed significant changes (Fig. 8B,C).

In the 3 month old pre-deposit cohort, the changes in synaptic proteins levels correlated generally with the increase in misfolded tau levels and neuroinflammation found in AAV-S320F tau mice (Fig. 8E–H). The S320F tau mice had higher levels of spinophilin (p&lt;0.05 relative to P301L tau) (Fig. 8E). Interestingly, PSD95 was upregulated in WT tau mice compared to control, AAV-P301L tau and AAV-S320F tau mice (Fig. 8H; p&lt;0.05 compared to control; p&lt;0.01 compared to P301L tau and S320F tau) while there were no inter-group differences between AAV-P301L tau, AAV-S320F tau and control mice. The S320F tau mice had reduced levels of synaptophysin and synaptogyrin 3 (p&lt;0.05 relative to control mice) at this age (Fig. 8F,G).

Discussion

The overall goal of our study was to examine the potential synergy between Aβ and tau in the context of AD pathologic cascade. Previous studies have shown that either co-expressing APP and MAPT genes (3, 6, 23) or using prion-like seeding paradigms (4, 24, 25) led to exacerbated Aβ and tau pathologies. However, two critical questions remained - whether pre-existing Aβ plaques are necessary for this pathogenic synergy and whether distinctive variants of tau would show selective vulnerability to Aβ. In this study, we delivered three different tau sequence variants with distinctive pathological properties into APP transgenic mice either prior to or following onset of Aβ deposition to test the hypothesis that presence of Aβ plaques is necessary for the accelerated transition of soluble ptau to insoluble NFT. Our results indicate that P301L tau represents a uniquely folded variant that is vulnerable to misfolding into NFT readily in the presence of Aβ deposits. We also show that S320F derived NFTs, occurring before the onset of Aβ deposition, can accelerate development of Aβ pathology but this interaction was lost when the tangles develop concurrently with Aβ deposits. The pathologic link between Aβ and tau is specific to the P301L variant of tau as neither WT tau nor the self-aggregating S320F tau showed similar levels of cooperativity. Indeed, the ratio of NFT tau (MC1) to ptau (CP13) in the S320F tau cohorts is higher in the pre-deposit cohort than the post-deposit cohort, indicating that presence of Aβ deposits does not amplify the inherent self-aggregation properties of S320F tau. More importantly, since expression of P301L tau in the hippocampus of adult nonTG mice did not produce NFT, our data confirms that the presence of Aβ deposits is necessary to induce P301L tau to form tangles. Together, our data shows a synergistic relationship between P301L tau and Aβ plaques, reinforcing the idea that co-occurrence of specific types of misfolded tau and Aβ pathologies can synergize and aggravate the pathologic trajectory. Indeed, our data is supported by an accompanying manuscript in which using trigenic mice, the presence of Aβ plaques was shown to worsen concurrent as well as emerging tauopathy in rTg4510 mice (Xu et al. TAPPing into the potential of inducible tau/APP transgenic mice). This study uses multiple transgenic models to show that the Aβ-tau pathological synergy is not necessarily dependent on age or maturity of Aβ deposits but instead is induced by intersecting pathological processes facilitated by the presence of pre-existing Aβ plaques. Together, our manuscripts report multiple combinatorial models that recapitulate AD-type pathologies, thus providing new tools to mechanistically examine the trajectory of AD pathogenesis and establishing disease-relevant experimental platforms to test therapeutics.

The observation that P301L variant of tau is sufficient to overcome the threshold for conformational change and induce NFT formation in the presence of Aβ within 3 months is intriguing. This may be related to the fact that this specific type of folded tau could be energetically more favourable for accelerated transformation of ptau to NFT tau in the presence of additional proteinopathy such as Aβ (26, 27). It is also possible that Aβ deposits or its associated proteins can somehow help in seeding and neuroanatomic transmission of a specific type of misfolded tau or its derivatives (28). This idea is consistent with an earlier report which showed that presence of seed-competent tau fragment is a major determinant required to trigger pathological conversion of soluble WT mouse tau into misfolded aggregates in the presence of neuritic plaques (8). The identity and biological relevance of seed-competent tau species, derived from P301L tau maturing in the presence of Aβ plaques in our study, remains to be characterized.

We observed that synaptic proteins were increased in the post-deposit cohort, which is somewhat inconsistent with the observations of synapse loss in AD patients (reviewed in (29)). It is possible that our model may be consistent with early phases of the disease and thus does not align with the changes observed in AD brain. While the biological significance of our observations is unclear given the small effect size, a parsimonious interpretation is that the overproduction of tau is stabilizing post synaptic structures or leading to synaptic remodelling in the presence of Aβ. The dichotomy that is observed in the levels of synaptic protein changes could also be attributed to recent observations that Aβ and tau affect neuronal activity in different manner (9). This study showed that Aβ production leads to neuronal hyperactivity while mutant tau expression leads to silencing (9). The synaptic levels in the post-deposit cohort data, where Aβ is abundant, would be in agreement with Aβ-induced hyperactivity effects, as we generally observed increased levels of synaptic proteins. When Aβ is relatively low as in the pre-deposit cohort, we would expect that the effect of tau would dominate the synaptic landscape, which is probably reflected in reduced levels of synaptogyrin 3, synaptophysin and PSD95.

The three different tau variants induced distinctive gene expression patterns, even though all of them led to accumulation of ptau and at least two shared features consistent with NFTs in the presence of Aβ deposits. It is worth stressing that because we used a limited number of mice in this transcriptome analysis, our study is powered to detect only large changes in gene expression. Our neuropathology focused transcriptome analysis identified Slc6a3 as an upregulated gene and Trem2 as downregulated gene commonly shared in all the AAV-tau expressing TgCRND8 mice. Slc6a3, also known as dopamine transporter 1 (DAT1), regulates dopamine neurotransmission by facilitating dopamine re-uptake from synaptic clefts. Interestingly, a SNP associated with increased DAT1 expression (30) is predictive of higher brain atrophy and associated with increased dementia (31). Though recent data suggests that dopamine surges in the extracellular space increase ptau (32), the physiological relevance of tau-induced increased levels of DAT1 in the context of AD-type amyloidosis will need further study. Loss in Trem2 function underlies neurodegenerative pathology in AD and is associated with a specific microglial phenotype associated with neuritic changes in amyloid models (20). This is referred to as the DAM or MGnD phenotype, characterized by phenotypic conversion of microglia from a homeostatic to a neurodegenerative state as the Aβ pathology worsens (20). Trem2 is generally induced in amyloid models (20), but its interaction with tau, especially Aβ-driven tauopathy, remains less known. While Aβ induces immune activation and Trem2 expression in CRND8 mice (33), we show here that in the presence of Aβ, tau might be suppressing immune function as evident from reduced Trem2 expression and downregulation of immune pathways. This is reminiscent of transition of microglial response from the neuroimmune activation state (NAct) to an immunosuppressed state (NSupp) in the context of tau-associated neurodegeneration networks (34). Interestingly, in our study, we observed that the P301L tau, but not self-aggregating S320F tau or WT tau, induced significant changes in DAM score, showing that Aβ-triggered misfolded P301L tau triggers changes in brain immunity associated with this particular phenotype. Overall, gene enrichment analysis and protein-protein co-expression analysis showed robust changes in immunity in the AAV-P301L tau mice, especially in pathways related to antigen presentation and leukocyte activation. Of future interest would be to characterize the temporal progression of this immune phenotype in different brain regions in the spatial context of Aβ deposits and Aβ-induced NFT pathology.

In spite of changes in DAM phenotype in the post-deposit cohort, we did not observe significant alterations in activated microglial (Iba-1) or mature microglial (Tmem119) burden in the P301L tau expressing TgCRND8 mice. This suggests that other factors, such as aging-related factors, are required for this DAM-related gene expression signature to cause morphological changes. It is noteworthy that tau expression did not increase Aβ burden in the post-deposit cohort, and there was a non-significant trend towards Aβ reduction in all the cohorts. Interestingly, when tau expression was initiated prior to onset of Aβ deposition, S320F tau expression increased the abundance of activated microglia. Both WT tau and P301L tau showed high levels of hyperphosphorylated tau but did not show significant changes in immune activation. Since the S320F tau cohort showed higher amyloid burden than the other tau-expressing mice, this is suggestive that Aβ could be the primary driver of neuroinflammation, at least in the early disease phases. While the absence of glial morphological changes is unexpected given the pathological synergy between Aβ and tau, it is possible that Aβ has a relatively more powerful and direct effect on microglial morphological changes, thus essentially masking the effect of the tau overexpression on microglial phenotypic alterations in the post-deposit cohort.

None of the AAV-tau led to extensive changes in Aβ burden or plaque morphology when expressed in the presence of pre-existing Aβ deposits. There is an insignificant reduction in Aβ burden and detergent-soluble Aβ oligomers in these mice, which is similar to a previous report showing reduction of Aβ plaques in a bigenic PS19 x PDAPP mice (35). Surprisingly, S320F tau expression initiated at birth, before the onset of Aβ deposition, accelerates amyloid plaque deposition. Whether this is related to the proteinopathy stress leading to reduced clearance or increased amyloidogenic processing of APP or other mechanisms (9) remains to be investigated. While this is somewhat incongruous with the observations from primary tauopathy patients who do not generally have substantial Aβ burden in their brains (36), whether tau tangles and associated neurotoxicity (such as neuroinflammation and oxidative stress) in specific brain areas drive amyloid deposits could be examined in the future.

There are some limitations in our model system. One of the caveats is that we are using mutant tau to explore the relationship between Aβ and tau to model the AD scenario. As shown by other groups (37, 38), WT tau is not generally amenable to form NFT. Thus, these mutations, that have confirmed prion properties (11), were selected by us as exemplars of different tau conformers that could form tau tangles in an accelerated manner. This was based on the premise that structural properties of these tau variants will result in faster nucleation and elongation rates (39), or the stabilization of particular molecular fold that can favour amyloidogenicity to produce unique pathologic properties when combined with Aβ pathology. Another limitation is the extent of overexpression of the tau genes, which could potentially lead to non-physiological outcomes. Since expressing physiological levels of tau transgene has been shown to be overall benign and only produces pathology very late in life (37, 38), our reasoning could be justified as this was a comparative neuropathologic study of three different variants of tau, all of which had equivalent expression levels. The levels of tau expression in our study, while higher than endogenous levels, were equivalent to the levels of tau transgene in the PS19 mice which are widely used for studying tauopathy (40). Another limitation is that our post-deposit cohort data is reflective of a single time point. Whether aging-related factors could regulate the evolution of Aβ-tau co-pathologies in distinct ways for the different tau variants could provide additional information regarding the pathological chaperone properties of different tau conformers. In our post-deposit cohort, we did not observe frank neurodegenerative features (reduced neuronal markers and synaptic markers) at this time point, and it remains a testable hypothesis that aging would exacerbate neurodegeneration in the P301L tau expressing TgCRND8 mice.

In summary, we provide evidence that the pathological synergy of Aβ and tau is dependent on the type of tau variant that is overexpressed as well as the timing of tau expression vis a vis the extent of amyloid plaque pathology. Interestingly early NFT pathology can induce Aβ deposition but does not exacerbate concurrently occurring Aβ pathology. Future work will need to focus on understanding the effect of aging in such combinatorial models to fully elucidate the inter-relationship between Aβ and tau proteinopathy and how this contributes to AD-typical dyshomeostasis.
