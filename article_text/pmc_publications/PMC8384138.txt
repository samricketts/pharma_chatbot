Objective:

Exposure to negative life events (NLEs) and neuroticism are associated with dementia. It is unknown whether neuroticism explains or modifies the association of NLEs with dementia in older Black and White Brazilians.

Methods:

A total of 1747 decedents 65 years and older White and Black (11% Black and 23% Mixed) Brazilians, 53% women, were included in the analyses. Data were obtained in a face-to-face interview with an informant (71% their children) who knew the decedents for 47 years on average. Dementia was classified using the Clinical Dementia Rating. NLEs were assessed with a 10-item scale involving common problems (e.g., death, illness, alcoholism, and financial). Neuroticism was assessed with a 6-item neuroticism scale adapted from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Models adjusted for age, sex, and education. Black and mixed-race were combined in the analyses.

Results:

NLEs (median of 2) were more common in Blacks than Whites (2.04 vs.1.82, p = 0.007). More NLEs increased the odds of dementia (OR = 1.112, β = 0.106, p = 0.002), similarly in Blacks and Whites (βinteraction = 0.046, p = 0.526). More NLEs were also associated with higher neuroticism (β = 0.071, p &lt; 0.0001), in Whites but not in Blacks (βinteraction = −0.048, p = 0.006). Neuroticism was associated with higher odds of dementia (OR = 1.658, β = 0.506, p=&lt;0.001), in Whites but not in Blacks (βinteraction = −0.420, p = 0.040). Overall, 34% of the effect of NLEs on dementia was associated with the underlying neuroticism trait in Whites (65%, Indirect OR = 1.060, p &lt; 0.001) but no association was evident in Blacks (6%, Indirect OR = 1.008, p = 0.326). Neuroticism did not moderate the association of NLEs with dementia (OR = 0.979, β = −0.021, p = 0.717).

Conclusion:

The association of NLEs and dementia is partially explained by neuroticism in older White but not in Blacks Brazilians.

1 | INTRODUCTION

A total of 56 million persons are aged 65 years or over in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the number is projected to double to about 1.5 billion in 2050.1 Brazil is the largest and one of the most diverse countries in Latin America. According to the latest Brazilian Census, the population is comprised of 9% Blacks, 47% Mixed, and 44% Whites; with 7% being 65 years of age and older.2

Negative life events (also termed psychosocial stressors) have been shown in a recent systematic review to be consistently associated with a higher risk of dementia,3 including Alzheimer’s disease (AD).4 Most of the studies, however, are from the United States, Europe, or Asia. We are aware of only one study of negative life events and dementia in South America, and it focused on a single event, widowhood in Brazil.5 Given the well-documented differences in life circumstances and social factors associated with race,6 Brazil with all of its rich diversity represents an ideal setting to investigate the interplay of life events, psychological factors, and dementia across race.

Neuroticism is a personality trait that denotes a tendency to experience negative emotions particularly in response to negative life events.7 A higher level of neuroticism has been associated with a higher level of cognitive impairment, dementia8–11 and stress-triggered memory failures.12 It is possible, therefore, that neuroticism might either explain (e.g., mediate) or modify (e.g., moderate) the association of negative life events with dementia. To our knowledge, these hypotheses have not been previously tested, although there is some evidence that neuroticism may mediate the association of negative life events with other outcomes, like resilience.13

In the present study, we examined neuroticism, negative life events, and dementia in a large sample of Black, Mixed, and White Brazilians enrolled at autopsy by their legal representative in the Pathology, Alzheimer’s, and Related Dementias Study (PARDoS). Specifically, we test the hypothesis that (1) the effect of negative life events on dementia is either partially associated with neuroticism (mediation, e.g., part of the effect of negative life events on dementia is associated with the inability to deal with negative life events, a hallmark of neuroticism) or differs by neuroticism (moderation) and (2) the effect will differ by race.

2 | METHODS

2.1 | Decedents

PARDoS enrolls deceased subjects aged 18 years or older who died from non-violent causes of death in the state of São Paulo, with priority to (a) Black/Mixed 65 or older at death, (b) White 65 or older at death who have fewer than 8 years of education, and (c) individuals not from Southern states of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul that are regions primarily of European extraction. Representatives of eligible deceased were identified and approached by interviewers (all nurses) soon after registering at the Autopsy Services and the Hospital while waiting for funeral arrangements. Consent and face-to-face interviews were obtained within 36 h of death. Only deceased persons whose representatives understood the consent and who were not too overly distraught were included in PARDoS. Consent and face-to-face interviews were obtained within 36 h of death. This study includes proxy-declared Whites, Blacks, or Mixed Brazilians age 65 years and older who died from natural causes in the state of São Paulo, enrolled from September 2016 to the date of submission.

The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), neuroticism scale, and negative life events scale were administered to 1856 decedents’ informants (72% child, 9% grandchild, 5% sibling, 4% spouse, and 10% other family or friends). Among these, 1747 decedents had complete data and were included in the analysis, those not included were two years older than the included (t [1985] = 2.33, p = 0.020), but did not differ in education (t [1840] = −1.53, p = 0.126), sex (X2 [1] = 2.491, p = 0.115) or race (X2 [1] = 1.662, p = 0.197). Their informants had similar age at interview (t [1850] = 0.41, p = 0.684), education (t [1840] = −0.37, p = 0.711), sex (X2 [1] = 2.686, p = 0.101), and knew the deceased similar number of years (t [1434] = −0.006, p = 0.951). The study was approved by all local ethics committee and by the Brazilian national ethics committee (Comissão Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa). Because the index cases were decedents, the study was determined to be of nonhuman subjects and IRB exempt.

2.2 | Measures

Neuroticism traits of personality were adapted from the Revised NEO Personality Inventory.14 The scale represents the average of six questions: (1) “he/she was not a worrier,” (2) “he/she often felt inferior to others,” (3) “he/she often felt tense or jittery,” (4) “he/she often was angry at the way people treat him/her,” (5) “too often, when things go wrong, he/she would get discouraged and feel like giving up,” and (6) “he/she often felt helpless and wanted someone else to solve his/her problems”. Each question had 5-Likert options scored from 0 to 4 in the direction that represents an undesired trait: strongly disagree, disagree, do not agree nor disagree, agree, and strongly agree. The polychoric alpha coefficient of the neuroticism scale was 0.71.15,16

Negative life events were examined with the 10-item questionnaire adapted from Johansson et al.4 The scale represents the number of negative life events and includes: divorce, death of a spouse, serious problems with the children (physical illness, death, or abuse), a child out of marriage, serious mental illness of spouse (husband/wife) or relative of the first degree, alcohol abuse of spouse (husband/wife) or first-degree relative, physical illness or serious social problems related to a spouse (husband/wife), need help from the government (social security), work-related issues self or the spouse (husband/wife), and restricted social network. Using a longitudinal cohort in the United States, we assessed the stability and temporal reliability of negative life events.17 For the Brazilian sample in this study, the tetrachoric alpha coefficient of the negative life events scale was 0.73. The scale was positively correlated with depression (X2 = 87.46, p &lt; 0.001), supporting the validity of the measure.

The diagnosis of dementia proximate to death was obtained through the CDR.18 We used the informant section of the CDR structured questionnaire questionnaire from the face-to-face interview performed at the time the families identified and claimed the body for burial. The CDR questions used post-mortem were previously validated using informants of living cases and controls19 in Brazil. The informant was asked to consider the status of the decedent 3 months before death. Answers were used to rate the six domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home, and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain was scored on a 5-point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment (personal care was scored on a 4-point scale without a 0.5 rating available). The dementia status was computed via an algorithm that evaluated the combination of the level of impairment and domains affected with a final score of 1 and above considered as demented, and 0 and 0.5 considered as non-demented. A recent meta-analysis including studies with Brazilian informants20 found that the CDR detected dementia with an adequate pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.94) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.96, 0.99), respectively. For the Brazilian sample in this study, as expected, the scale was positively correlated with depression (X2 = 25.44, p &lt; 0.001), further supporting the validity of the measure.

In addition to these measures, socioeconomic status was obtained using the Brazilian Association of Market Research Companies (Associação Brasileira de Empresas de Pesquisa) scale.21,22 This scale considers different household goods and services that are relevant to the Brazilian culture including the number of maids working in the household and the number of color TVs, radios, bathrooms, cars, washing machines, VHS/DVD players, fridges, freezers in the household. It also considers the level of education of the head of the household. The socioeconomic status classes were also (E, D, C2, C1, B2, B1, A2, and A1 using respectively the cut-offs 7, 13, 17, 22, 28, 34, 41, and 46).21,22 We also obtained major depression through the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.23

2.3 | Statistical analyses

The race of the decedent was obtained from informants as Whites, Blacks, or Mixed but in the analyses, Blacks and Mixed were combined in the Black group. Initial analyses included a careful examination of the variables’ distribution and testing differences between races using t-tests and chi-square tests. To examine the effect of race, neuroticism, and negative life events on dementia we used logistic regression models. Neuroticism and negative life events were associated with dementia and were tested for moderation and mediation. Moderation was tested by adding an interaction term between neuroticism and negative life events on the logistic regression models with dementia as the outcome. Mediation was evaluated to calculate direct and indirect effects as well as the percent of the effect mediation.24,25 We also a fit linear regression model with neuroticism as the outcome and a term for negative life events and repeat the model with an interaction term between race and negative life events. Finally, we stratified the mediation analyses by race and socioeconomic status. All models adjusted for age-at-death, education, and sex. Age and education were centered at the mean for ease of interpretation. We employed standard diagnostic methods and graphical examination of residuals to verify that assumptions underlying the statistical models were adequately met. All analyses considered an alpha of 0.05 and were conducted using SAS/STAT software, Version 9.4 of the SAS® system for Linux.

3 | RESULTS

Table 1 shows a comparison of Black versus White decedents on key demographic characteristics. Black decedents were on average about two years younger at death and had one year less education than White decedents and tended to have lower socioeconomic status. The frequency of dementia was similar between Black, Mixed, and White decedents (Table 1), and this did not change after controlling for age at death, sex, and education (OR = 0.995, β = −0.005, SE = 0.121, p = 0.964). The informants of Black decedents were about two years younger and had one year less education than informants of White decedents. Informants knew the decedents for more than 47 years on average with a difference of about two years between informants of Black versus informants of White.

Negative life events and neuroticism scores and items are available in Tables 2 and 3. The number of negative life events overall was slightly higher (on average less than one event more) in Black decedents compared to White decedents (Table 2). According to the informants, Black decedents tended to have more serious problems with their children, children outside the marriage, and alcoholism in the family. The levels of neuroticism were similar in Black/Mixed, and White decedents (Table 3) and this did not change after controlling for age at death sex, and education (β = 0.002, SE = 0.023, p = 0.937). The frequency of endorsement for “angry at the way people treat them” was higher among Black decedents than among White decedents.

Neuroticism was a strong predictor of dementia (Table 4). Each one point higher in neuroticism was associated with 72% higher odds of dementia. This association was different in Blacks versus Whites (βinteraction = −0.420, SE = 0.204, p = 0.040). Negative life events were also strongly associated with dementia (Table 4). This association was similar in Blacks and Whites (βinteraction = 0.046, SE = 0.072, p = 0.526). One life event was associated with 11% higher odds of dementia. The effect of negative life events on dementia was associated with neuroticism (Table 4, model 3). There was, however, no interaction between neuroticism and negative life events (Table 4, model 4).

Figure 1 illustrates the mediation of neuroticism on the effect of negative life events on dementia. It shows that negative life events are associated with neuroticism and neuroticism is associated with dementia. Negative life events are also associated with dementia (total effect). Part of the effect of negative life events on dementia is indirect through neuroticism. In other words, a total of 34% of the effect of negative life events on dementia was explained by neuroticism.

More negative life events were also associated with higher neuroticism differentially in Blacks versus Whites (βinteraction = −0.048, SE = 0.018, p = 0.006). Analyses were repeated with the sample stratified to examine mediation by race. Figure 2 illustrates the mediation of neuroticism on the effect of negative life events on dementia by race. Neuroticism was associated with dementia in White but not in Black decedents. In White decedents, there was a predominantly indirect effect of negative life events on dementia through neuroticism, but this was not observed in Black decedents. While 65% of the effect of negative life events on dementia was explained by neuroticism in White decedents, only 6% was explained in Black decedents.

Analyses were also repeated with the sample stratified by socioeconomic status: above the average versus below the average. For reference, the average socioeconomic status of 21 is categorized as class C1, representing a lower class in Brazil. There was a smaller proportion of the effect of negative life events mediated through neuroticism in the lower than the higher socioeconomic status (28% vs. 41%), but both socioeconomic status have significant and similar indirect effects (indirect OR and 95% CI respectively 1.036 [1.013, 1.061] and 1.035 [1.011, 1.058]).

Because there were more Blacks in strata of socioeconomic status below average than in the strata above the average (43% vs. 26%) and we found some difference in the percent mediated in different socioeconomic status strata, we repeated the analyses stratified by race but only including those socioeconomic classes that had a good representation of both races. The included classes were classes C1 and C2 (n = 490) that were represented by socioeconomic status score values from 14 to 22. These classes included 45% of Blacks and 55% of Whites. While 39% of the effect of negative life events were mediated through neuroticism in Whites, only 13% was mediated in Blacks (indirect OR and 95% CI respectively 1.047 [1.001, 1.095] and 1.022 [0.988, 1.058]).

4 | DISCUSSION

Using a large sample of older Black and White Brazilians decedents, we interviewed informants, mostly family members, about the decedents’ history of major life events, levels of neuroticism, and assessed the presence of dementia proximate to death using CDR. We found that neuroticism and negative life events were each associated with dementia. We demonstrated that the effect of negative life events on dementia was largely indirect through neuroticism. Further inspection showed that the effect of neuroticism on dementia and its mediation of negative life events on dementia was present only in Whites but not in Blacks persons.

Although studies of personality in older adults are limited in South America,26,27 we are aware of one study in Brazil that found that neuroticism was associated with dementia.11 However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined racial differences in the effects of neuroticism on odds of dementia in Black versus White Brazilians, although it has been studied in Blacks and Whites in the United States. The odds of dementia did not differ between Black and White Brazilians. In the United States, the risk of dementia in Blacks is higher than in Whites.28,29 Consistent with our results, some studies, but not all,9,30 found that neuroticism had a less substantial effect on dementia and level of cognition among Blacks.8,31 Variations in results can occur for different reasons. For example, while some studies use Black participants from one study and White from another, PARDoS recruited Blacks and Whites from the same location. We also minimized demographic differences by enhancing the sample of Whites with Whites with lower education, so that the entire educational spectrum is well-represented in both Blacks and Whites. Another reason why findings with Brazilians may differ from findings with Americans is that all of the Black and White Brazilians would be classified as Latinos in the United States (Latin American descent or origin, including those from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Central and South America). Latinos in the United States have a lower risk of dementia than Blacks and a higher risk of dementia than non-Latino Whites. In addition, there is great heterogeneity among Latinos and Blacks.32 More studies with comparison of races within ethnicities are needed to understand racial differences in Latinos of different origins. Even on often studied populations, we are not aware of previous studies linking negative life events and neuroticism on the risk of dementia in, and the reasons for the race difference are unknown.

Previous research has shown that although marginalized communities tend to experience more negative life events,6 as in the current study, the psychological impact or health outcome is often less perhaps due to differences in coping strategies, social support, or resilience (Barnes et al., 2008). Future research is needed to explore potential factors that may lie on the path between negative life events and dementia in diverse populations.

This study has several strengths including the large sample size of both Black/Mixed and White Brazilians. It uses informants that knew the deceased for many years. Because self-report personality constructs are not always an accurate representation of reality, some authors suggest that through participant’ overt behaviors, an informant that knows the participant well is better able to judge the participant’s personality33 especially overt traits like neuroticism.

The study, however, has limitations. This is not a population-based study and there was a disproportionate representation of individuals with low income. Results may be different in a population with a broader range of socioeconomic status. Another limitation is that negative life events were assessed retrospectively. Recall bias creates inaccuracies in retrospective assessments.34 There are also potential biases of using family members as a proxy to assess negative life events, including the tendency to recall more extreme events. This type of recall bias can affect items differentially, with a higher recall of events such as a death in the family and a lower recall of events such as work-related issues. Also, although these informants are very knowledgeable, it is always possible that some information was not shared by the deceased. Similar bias can occur in the CDR, although the window of reference is shorter (3 months before death, instead of lifetime). However, the CDR is commonly obtained using informants, including in research with Brazilians.20 In aging research, an informant, is commonly employed to obtain information concerning a person with cognitive impairment and after death. Also, this study is cross-sectional, and therefore we cannot test temporal order. However, using longitudinal data on neuroticism from the Finnish Twin Cohort, researchers found that baseline neuroticism was associated with subsequent negative life events and although the stability of longitudinal neuroticism was high, exposure to negative life events increased neuroticism causing “dynamic fluctuations around a person’s set point of neuroticism”.35 In our work, we find a stronger association of neuroticism and dementia, after controlling for negative life events. By contrast, negative life events have much of the effect on dementia reduced when controlling for neuroticism consistent with partial mediation. In fact, research on the origin of neuroticism includes theories on multiple vulnerabilities that dynamically contribute to the early development of neuroticism and later expression of neuroticism itself,36 and point to the personality trait as a mediator for the development of many emotional disorders.37 Biologically, although there is a genetic component to neuroticism, recent studies suggest a “complex and dynamic etiology” that involves the life-span gene-environment interactions.37 Therefore, further studies can help confirm and further understand these findings, including prospectively collected data or studies including brain pathology.

Key Points

Negative life events increased the odds of dementia and were more common in Black Brazilians than White Brazilians

Neuroticism increased the odds of dementia in White Brazilians, but not in Black Brazilians

Neuroticism did not moderate the association of negative life events with dementia in Brazilians

The effect of negative life events on dementia was associated with neuroticism in White Brazilians, but not in Black Brazilians
