Background:

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) concentrations are 34% to 47% heritable. Larger −2518 G/A (rs1024611) genotypes differences are reported for: 1) MCP-1 production in stimulated vs. basal cells; and 2) MCP-1 concentrations in diseased (sepsis, brain abscess, hepatitis B virus, Alzheimer’s disease, Behcet’s disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus) vs. healthy patients. Those results suggest that the −2518 G/A effect size may depend on whether the phenotype is high or low relative to its distribution (quantile-dependent expressivity).

Method:

To test whether quantile-dependent expressivity applies more broadly to genetic influences on MCP-1 concentrations, quantile-specific offspring-parent (βOP) and full-sib regression slopes (βFS) were estimated by applying quantile regression to the age- and sex-adjusted serum MCP-1 concentrations of Framingham Heart Study families. Quantile-specific heritabilities were calculated as h2=2βOP/(1+rspouse) and h2={(1+8rspouseβFS)0.5-1}/(2rspouse)).

Results

Heritability (h2±SE) of MCP-1 concentrations increased from 0.15±0.05 at the 10th percentile of the MCP-1 distribution, 0.23±0.04 at the 25th, 0.32±0.05 at the 50th, 0.43±0.07 at the 75th, and 0.44±0.07 at the 90th percentile, or an 0.0041±0.0009 increase for each one-percent increment in the MCP-1 distribution (Plinear trend=2.4×10−5) when estimated from βOP, and (Plinear trend=7.7×10−9) when estimated from βFS. Compared to the 10th percentile, βOP-estimated h2 was 3-fold greater at the 90th percentile (Pdifference= 0.0003), and 6.9-fold greater when estimated from βFS (Pdifference=3.3×10−6). Re-analyses of in vivo comparisons of MCP-1 concentrations in controls vs. patients with MCP-1-elevating conditions, and in vitro studies of MCP-1 production in basal vs. stimulated cells, show rs1024611 genotypes differences that are consistent with quantile-dependent expressivity.

Conclusion:

The heritability of circulating MCP-1 concentrations is quantile-dependent.

pmcIntroduction

The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, (MCP-1, aka chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2 or CCL2) is a chemoattractant of the CC chemokine sub-family that is produced primarily by endothelial and smooth muscle cells, but also other cells including monocytes and fibroblasts [1]. Its primary function is the recruitment of monocytes and macrophages to sites of inflammation [1]. MCP-1 is involved in both acute and chronic inflammatory response [1]. Higher circulating MCP-1 levels have been associated with older age [2], adiposity, hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency [3], cigarette smoking, triglycerides [4], polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [5], osteoarthritis [6], cardiovascular disease [7], non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [8], bipolar disorder [9], systemic lupus erythematosus [10,11], lupus nephritis [11], stroke [12], Alzheimer’s disease, and cognitive impairment [13,14]. It is also overexpressed in solid and hematologic neoplasms [15] including myeloproliferative neoplasms [16].

Published estimates of log MCP-1 heritability range from 0.34 to 0.47 [2] for plasma concentrations and 0.45 for serum concentrations [17]. These estimates are assumed to apply throughout the MCP-1 distribution, however, it has been suggested that different portions of the MCP-1 distribution may include different genetic controls [18]. Specifically, basal MCP-1 level appears to be regulated by a proximal region responsive to cytokines such as TNF-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interferon-γ [19,20]. However, cytokine induction of MCP-1 expression appears to be under the control of a putative distal regulatory region located 1.8 through 2.7 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site and containing the −2518 G/A polymorphism (rs1024611) whose G-allele appears to increase both IL-1β induced transcriptional activity and monocyte MCP-1 production [18]. The −2518 G-allele has been associated with accelerated progression of AIDS and death [21], end-stage renal disease with chronic periodontitis [22], premature kidney graft failure [23], coronary artery disease [24], myocardial infarction [4], hypertension [25], rheumatoid arthritis [26], systemic lupus erythematosus [27], lupus nephritis [27], infectious diseases [28], and asthma [29]. The allele has also been associated with adverse presentation [30] and outcome [31] in myelofibrosis.

Heritability in the narrow sense (h2) provides an estimate the proportion of the phenotype variance attributable to additive genetic effects, which is traditionally assumed to be constant throughout the trait distribution [32]. Quantile-dependent expressivity postulates that the effect of genetic variants on the phenotype is not constant, but rather may depend upon whether the value of the phenotype (e.g. MCP-1) is high or low [33]. This has been demonstrated for other inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [34], plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 [35]), other blood constituents (lipids and lipoproteins [36–39], adiponectin [40], leptin [41]), adiposity [42], pulmonary function [43], and behaviors such as coffee and alcohol consumption [44,45]. An important consequence of quantile-dependent expressivity is that the selection of subjects by characteristics that distinguish high and low phenotype values can lead to the interpretation of gene-disease interactions when a simpler explanation of quantile-dependence may suffice [46].

To assess whether different portions of the MCP-1 distribution are under different genetic control (i.e., quantile-dependent), quantile-regression [47,48] was applied to offspring-parent and full-sibling pairs from the Framingham Heart Study [49,50] to test whether MCP-1 heritability (h2) differs by whether its concentrations are high or low. Quantile-regression does not require normally distributed data and therefore provides a robust estimate of offspring-parent (βOP) and full-sibling (βFS) regression slopes for untransformed MCP-1 concentrations as originally measured, from which quantile-specific h2 can be calculated using Falconer’s formula [32]. Additional analyses examine whether quantile-dependence is consistent with the gene-disease interactions reported by others (sepsis [51], brain abscess [52], hepatitis B virus [53], Alzheimer’s disease [54], Behcet’s disease [55], systemic lupus erythematosus [11]). The family-based heritability estimates (this report), gene-disease interactions [11,51–55], and in vitro experiments [23,27,56–58], present consistent evidence for quantile-dependent expressivity of circulating MCP-1 concentrations.

Methods

The Framingham Study data were obtained from the National Institutes of Health FRAMCOHORT, GEN3, FRAMOFFSPRING Research Materials obtained from the National Heart, lung, and Blood (NHLBI) Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center [59]. The hypothesis tested is not considered as part of the initial Framingham Study design and is exploratory. Subjects used in the current analyses were at least 16 years of age and were self-identified as non-Hispanic white. Phlebotomy was performed on fasting participants (typically ten hours) who had rested for 5 to 10 minutes in a supine position, typically between 7:30 and 9 AM. Serum blood collection tubes sat for 30 minutes after venipuncture to allow for complete clotting. Specimens were stored at −80°C without freeze-thaw cycles until assay. The inflammatory marker manual at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007) describes the measurements of the inflammatory markers in detail. Serum MCP-1 concentrations for examinations 7 and 8 of the Offspring Cohort and examination 1 of the Third Generation Cohort were measured in duplicate with commercially available ELISA kits from R&amp;D Systems with an intra-assay coefficient of variation of 3.1% [60].

Our analyses of these data were approved by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Human Subjects Committee (HSC) for protocol “Gene-environment interaction vs. quantile-dependent penetrance of established SNPs (107H021)” LBNL holds the Office of Human Research Protections Federal wide Assurance number FWA 00006253. Approval number: 107H021–13MR20. All surveys were conducted under the direction of the Framingham Heart Study human use committee guidelines, with signed informed consent from all participants or parent and/or legal guardian if &lt;18 years of age.

Statistics.

The statistical methodology has been described in detail elsewhere [33,36–40] and is summarized here briefly for completeness. The only eligibility requirement for inclusion in the analyses was MCP-1 values for offspring, parents and siblings. Age and sex adjustment was performed in each cohort separately using standard least-squares regression with female (0,1), age, age2, female × age, and female × age2 as independent variables. Offspring-parent regression slopes (βOP) were computed using parents from the Offspring Cohort and their children from the Third Generation Cohort. Sibships were identified from the Offspring and Third Generation Cohorts. Full-sibling regression slopes (βFS) were obtained by forming all ki(ki-1) sibpair combinations for the ki siblings in sibship i and assigning equal weight to each sibling [61]. Simultaneous quantile regression was performed using the sqreg command of Stata (version. 11, StataCorp, College Station, TX). One thousand bootstrap samples were drawn to estimate the variance-covariance matrix for the 91 quantile regression coefficients between the 5th and 95th percentiles of the offspring’s distribution [48]. Post-estimation procedures (test and lincom) were used to test linear combinations of the slopes after estimation with Σki-2 degrees of freedom for offspring-parent regression slopes and Σ(ki-1) degrees of freedom for sibship regression slopes [61]. Quantile-specific expressivity was assessed using orthogonal polynomials [62]. Falconer and Mackay’s formula [32] equates heritability in the narrow sense (h2) to h2= 2βOP/(1+rspouse), where rspouse is the spouse correlation and to h2={(1+8rspouseβFS)0.5-1}/2rspouse under specific restrictive assumptions. “Quantile-specific heritability” refers to the heritability statistic, whereas “quantile-dependent expressivity” is the biological phenomenon of the trait expression being quantile-dependent.

A PubMed search using MCP-1 and genetics keywords was used to identify published reports of gene-disease interactions to assess their consistency with quantile-dependent expressivity. The means, medians, and geometric means were extracted from these reports and their weighted averages were used to approximate average MCP-1 concentration by condition and genotype. These were used to graphically represent the reported results from the perspectives of precision medicine (i.e. histograms of the genotype-specific differences between diseased and healthy subjects) and quantile-dependent expressivity (i.e., line graphs showing MCP-1 difference between genotypes by disease condition), along with the significance levels provided in the original reports or calculated from the standard errors. In some cases the genotype-specific mean MCP-1 concentrations were obtained from published histograms [23,27,51,52,53,54,55], whose quantitative values were extracted using the Microsoft Powerpoint formatting palette (version 12.3.6 for Macintosh computers, Microsoft corporation, Redmond WA) as previously described [39]. Our interpretations of these previously published reports are not necessarily the same as those of the original authors.

Results

Seventy-six and a third percent (76.3%) of the 2878 subjects from the Offspring Cohort had two MCP-1 measurements, 18.1% were measured at examination 7 only, and 5.6% were measured at examination 8 only. Fifty four percent were female. Their average (SD) age was 63.7 (9.1) years, average BMI was 27.4 (5.7) kg/m2, and average serum MCP-1 concentration was 353.9 (130.8) pg/ml if female. For males, the average age was 63.7 (9.2) years, average BMI was 28.6 (4.5) kg/m2, and average serum MCP-1 concentration was 354.7 (119.3) pg/ml. The 3788 subjects from the Third Generation Cohort were 53.3% female. Their average age was 39.8 (8.8) years, BMI was 26.0 (6.1) kg/m2, and serum MCP-1 concentrations was 343.6 (128.0) pg/ml if female, and an average age was 40.3 (8.7) years, BMI was 28.0 (4.7) kg/m2, and serum MCP-1 concentrations was 378.6 (308.3) pg/ml if male.

Traditional estimates of familial concordance and heritability.

The 5127 parent-offspring pairs consisted of 1659 offspring with one parent and 1734 offspring with both parents. Sibship correlations were computed on 4996 siblings in 1811 sibships. Spouse correlations were rspouse=0.0727 for untransformed MCP-1 serum concentrations and rspouse=0.0931 for log MCP-1. As traditionally estimated by Falconer’s formula, the overall estimate of heritability for untransformed MCP-1 was h2=0.2621±0.0459 (P=1.0×10−8) when estimated from offspring-parent pairs and h2=0.1830±0.0351 (P=1.5×10−7) when estimated from sibships. The corresponding estimates for log MCP-1 were h2=0.3829±0.0316 and h2=0.4292±0.0345 (both P&lt;10−15), respectively.

Quantile-dependent expressivity.

Figure 1A shows that the offspring-parent regression slopes at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of the offspring’s serum MCP-1 distribution got progressively greater with increasing percentiles of the MCP-1 distribution. The corresponding heritability estimates show that heritability at the 90th percentile was 0.4408±0.0738 or 3-fold greater than the heritability at the 10th percentile (Pdifference=0.0003). Figure 1B, which presents the offspring-parent derived estimates of heritability for all percentiles between the 5th and 95th percentiles, shows heritability increased linearly with increasing percentiles of the offspring’s distribution (i.e., slope±SE: 0.0041±0.0009, Plinear=2.4×10−5). There was no statistically significant evidence of nonlinearity (i.e., Pquadratic=0.45; Pcubic=0.87). Quantile-specific heritability was individually significant (P≤0.0001) for all percentiles between the 13th and 95th percentiles of the offspring’s distribution. If the heritabilities over all quantiles were constant, then the line segments in Figure 1A would be parallel, and Figure 1B would show a flat line with zero slope, which they weren’t. Figure 1C, which displays the quantile regression analysis for h2 estimated from full-sib regression slopes (βFS), shows each one-percent increment in the MCP-1 distribution was associated with a 0.0066±0.0011 increase in heritability and a 0.0033±0.0006 increase in the full-sib regression slope (Plinear=7.7×10−9). Quantile-specific heritability was individually significant (P≤0.0001) for all percentiles between the 38th and 95th percentiles of the sib’s distribution.

Logarithmically transformed MCP-1 concentrations exhibited a concave relationship with the percentiles of the offspring distribution when estimated from quantile-specific offspring-parent (Pquadratic=0.05) and full sib regression slopes (Pquadratic=0.06) in the absence of any significant linear (Plinear=0.80 and 0.13, respectively) or cubic trend (Pcubic=0.47 and 0.51, respectively, results not displayed).

In vivo observations Figure 2 presents six published in vivo comparisons of MCP-1 concentrations in healthy and disease subjects by −2518 G/A genotypes. Whereas the original authors primarily emphasized that the MCP-1 elevating effects of sepsis, Alzheimer’s disease, hepatitis B virus, Behcet’s disease, and brain abscess were greatest in carriers of the G-allele (histograms), the line graphs show the difference between genotypes was greater at the higher concentrations of the affected patients.

For example, He et al. [51] reported significantly higher plasma MCP-1 concentrations (P&lt;0.001) and significantly higher MCP-1 mRNA expression levels (P&lt;0.01) in sepsis patients than healthy controls. The AG/GG genotype was associated with a greater patient-control difference in plasma MCP-1 concentrations than AA homozygotes (Figure 2A histogram). Consistent with quantile-dependent expressivity, the line graph shows a greater difference between genotypes at the higher average plasma MCP-1 concentrations of the patients with sepsis (P&lt;0.05) as compared to controls (NS). Figure 2B shows mRNA expression data that are consistent with the hypothesis that rs1024611 up-regulates MCP-1 expression through enhanced transcription, and that this effect was more pronounced at the higher MCP-1 concentrations of the patients.

Xu et al. [54] reported that average serum MCP-1 concentrations were significantly higher in Alzheimer patients than matched controls (230 vs. 194 pg/ml, P&lt;0.001), with Figure 2C showing the greatest case-control difference for the GG-homozygotes (histogram). Consistent with quantile-dependent expressivity, the rs1024611 polymorphism significantly affected serum MCP-1 concentrations at the higher average concentrations of the patients (P&lt;0.05 for AA vs. GG) but not at the lower average concentrations of controls (line graph).

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic virus that can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer and death. Moudi et al. [53] reported that mean serum MCP-1 concentrations were 2.5-fold greater in HBV patients than healthy controls. From a precision medicine perspective, the Figure 2D histogram suggests the HBV effect was significantly greater in GG homozygotes (HBV minus healthy: 157.43±3.12 pg/ml) and AG heterozygotes (152.15±2.79 pg/ml) than AA homozygotes (142.07±3.17 pg/ml, PGG-AA=0.0006, PGA-AA=0.02). Correspondingly, the line graph shows a greater MCP-1 difference between genotypes in HBV patients than healthy controls when GG and AA homozygotes are compared (MCP-1GG-MCP-1AA in patients vs. controls: 17.94±4.36 vs. 2.58±0.90 pg/ml, PHBV-Healthy=0.0006) and when GA heterozygotes and AA homozygotes are compared (MCP-1GA-MCP-1AA: 10.37±4.20 vs. 0.29±0.48 pg/ml, PHBV-Healthy=0.02).

Behcet’s disease is a chronic systemic inflammation affecting mucous membranes, skin, eyes, gastrointestinal tract, joints, blood vessels and the neurologic system [63]. Cho et al. [55] reported that mean serum MCP-1 concentrations were 2.4-fold greater in Behcet’s patients than controls (approximately 221 vs. 77 pg/ml). The histogram in Figure 2E shows that the MCP-1 difference between patients and controls was least in AA homozygotes (123 pg/ml), intermediate in heterozygotes (137 pg/ml) and greatest in GG homozygotes (147 pg/ml). The line graph shows this corresponded to a larger difference between GG and AA homozygotes in patients (54 pg/ml) than controls (31 pg/ml).

Brain abscess increases MCP-1 production by macrophages, endothelial cells, and astrocytes [64]. Mishra et al. [52] reported that average serum MCP-1 concentrations were significantly higher in brain abscess patients than controls (945±154 vs. 141±4.0 pg/ml), and that serum MCP-1 concentrations were higher for GG homozygotes than AG heterozygotes and AA homozygotes in both patients (P&lt;0.001) and controls (P&lt;0.005). Figure 2F shows the patient vs. control difference in serum MCP-1 was greatest in GG homozygotes (histogram), and that the difference between genotypes was substantially greater at the substantially higher mean concentrations of the patients (line graph).

In vitro experiments Figure 3 presents four published in vitro studies of MCP-1 production in stimulated cells by −2518 G/A (rs1024611) genotypes. The histograms present the differences in MCP-1 production between basal and stimulated cells by genotype, the associated line graphs emphasize the greater differences between genotypes at the higher stimulated concentrations than at the lower pre-stimulated concentrations. For example, Mori et al. [56] reported that relative to un-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), MCP-1 production for IL-1β stimulated cells from healthy controls was greatest for GG-homozygotes, intermediate for AG heterozygotes, and least for AA homozygotes (Figure 3A histogram). Correspondingly, there were greater cross-sectional genotype differences at the higher mean concentrations of the stimulated cells than the lower concentrations of the unstimulated cells (Figure 3A line graph).

Similarly, as shown in Figure 3B, Krüger et al. [23] reported a greater cross-sectional difference in PBMC MCP-1 production between G-allele carriers and AA homozygotes after recombinant IL-1β stimulation (7857 vs. 3229 pg/ml, P&lt;0.05) than before (543 vs. 305 pg/ml, P=0.10) corresponding to a higher post-stimulation than basal MCP-1 mean concentration (5433 vs. 418 pg/ml).

Figure 3C presents Karrer et al. [57] report on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced MCP-1 expression in skin fibroblasts from patients with systematic sclerosis, a predisposing condition for high MCP-1 concentrations. The histogram shows that the increase in MCP-1 expression in fibroblasts was greater in GG-homozygote (9469 pg/ml, P&lt;0.05) and AG (9367 pg/ml, P&lt;0.05) than AA donors (1625 pg/ml, NS). Again, consistent with quantile-dependent expressivity, the line graph shows that these post-stimulation genotype differences were greater than those observed for basal MCP-1 expression between GG and AA donors (post vs. pre-stimulation differences: 14,941 vs. 7097 pg/ml, P=0.02) and between AG and AA donors (10,126 vs. 2384 pg/ml, P&lt;0.001).

Figure 3D depicts Tucci et al.’s data from systemic lupus erythematosus patient cells [27]. It shows the net difference in MCP-1 production between lipopolysaccharide-stimulated and unstimulated adherent PBMC was greater from donors with the AG and GG genotypes than from AA genotype donors (histogram). Again cross-sectional genotype-differences were greater at the higher MCP-1 production level of the stimulated cells (line graph).

Discussion

Our analyses of the Framingham family sets show that estimated heritability of serum MCP-1 concentrations increased linearly with increasing percentiles of their distribution. Specifically, each one-percent increment in the MCP-1 distribution was associated with a 0.0041±0.0009 increase in heritability when estimated from βOP (Plinear=2.4×10−5), and a 0.0066±0012 increase when estimated from βFS (Plinear=7.7×10−9). Compared to heritability at the 10th percentile, βOP-estimated heritability was 3-fold greater at the 90th percentile (Pdifference= 0.0003), and 6.9-fold greater when estimated from βFS (Pdifference=3.3×10−6). These quantile-dependent effects can manifest themselves as gene-environment interactions when genetic effects are compared between disease states that distinguish high vs. low MCP-1 concentrations, and as genetic markers of disease risk [46].

Heritability (h2) has the advantage measuring the cumulative genetic effects of multiple loci, but lacks the specificity of genetic variants measured directly. The strongest genetic determinant of MCP-1 concentrations is the Asp42Gly polymorphism (rs12075) in the Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC) gene [65,66]. However, the most widely reported genetic variant affecting MCP-1 concentrations is rs1024611 (MCP-1 −2518 G/A) in the distal promoter region of the MCP-1 gene, whose G-allele is associated with higher MCP-1 concentrations [18].

Support for quantile-dependent expressivity is provided by the larger genotype differences in diseased patients with elevated MCP-1 concentrations than healthy controls. Whereas the authors primarily emphasized that the MCP-1 elevating effects of sepsis, Alzheimer’s disease, hepatitis B virus, Behcet’s disease, and brain abscess were greatest in carriers of the G-allele (histograms), our analysis shows that the difference between genotypes was greater at the higher concentrations of the disease state, consistent with Figure 1. In addition, data reported by Brown et al. [11] (not displayed) suggested that MCP-1 concentration in recently diagnosed cases of systemic lupus erythematosus were higher than healthy controls (51.97±0.84 vs. 24.76±0.14 pg/ml), and correspondingly, the difference between G-allele carriers and AA homozygotes was greater in cases than controls (51.81±1.4 pg/ml, P=0.03 vs. 2.43±0.31 pg/ml, P=0.25).

Analyses of in vitro studies of MCP-1 production in stimulated cells are consistent with quantile-dependent expressivity (i.e., greater genotype differences at higher MCP-1 production). In addition to these examples, the dose-dependent MCP-1 raising effect of the G-allele was suggested by Rovin et al.’s report of greater MCP-1 production for IL-1β-stimulated PBMC that were harvested from −2518 GG homozygotes than from GA heterozygotes [18]. Moreover, Muhlbauer et al. [58] reported a 4-fold induction in MCP-1 secretion after recombinant human TNF-α stimulation in activated hepatic stellate cells donated from G-allele carriers vs. 2-fold induction when from AA-donors (PDifference=0.04). This necessarily requires larger genotype differences at the higher MCP-1 levels of the stimulated cells and smaller genotype differences at the lower MCP-1 levels of the basal cells.

Limitations:

Exception to quantile-dependent expressivity are to be expected due to statistical uncertainity or because the phenomenon might vary by disease condition, for example: Zakharyn et al. report of somewhat smaller differences in plasma MCP-1 concentrations between rs1024611 genotypes in paranoid schizophrenia patients than controls despite the higher means concentration in the patients [67].

Because it is a novel concept, it is unsurprising that the information required to assess quantile-dependent expressivity is often lacking (i.e., genotype-specific MCP-1 concentrations by disease status). Many studies report significant elevating effects of the -2518 G-allele on MCP-1 concentrations in patients with high overall mean MCP-1 concentrations while ignoring the genotype effect in controls. For example, relative to AA-homozygotes, mean MCP-1 concentrations were reported to be higher in: 1) GG-homozygotes (GG vs. AA: 1976±72 vs. 1109±98 pg/ml, P=0.0001) and AG-heterozygotes (AG vs. AA: 1424±78 vs. 1109±98 pg/ml, P=0.05) in tuberculosis patients having higher overall mean plasma MCP-1 concentrations than controls (1607±55 vs. 372±31 pg/ml, P=0.00001) [68]; 2) G-allele carriers (590.2±27.9 vs. 363.5±27.0 pg/ml, P&lt;0.0001) in systemic lupus erythematosus patients with lupus nephritis who had higher mean serum MCP-1 concentrations than those without lupus nephritis (507.1±22.9 vs. 399.5±25.9 pg/ml, Pdifference =0.002) [69]; 3) GG-homozygotes (163 vs. 138 pg/ml, P=0.03) and AG-heterozygotes (160 vs. 138 pg/ml, P=0.05) in psoriasis patients having higher overall mean MCP-1 serum concentrations than controls (157±4 vs. 116±5 pg/ml, P=0.0001) [70]; 4) GG-homozygotes (P=0.02) in patients with Japanese encephalitis virus having higher overall higher MCP-1 serum concentrations than healthy controls (P=0.03) [71]; and 5) GG-homozygotes (P&lt;0.05) and G-allele carriers (P&lt;0.05) in enterovirus 71 patients [72]. The absence of genotype-specific plasma MCP-1 concentrations for controls [68,70,71,72] and non-lupus nephritis patients [69] may be due to their lack of significant difference or their perceived unimportance.

Heritability lacks the specificity of directly measured genetic variants. Nevertheless, estimated heritability is important because specific polymorphisms affecting MCP-1 concentrations currently explain a small percentage its estimated genetic regulation. Genome-wide association analysis by Schnabel et al. [63] showed MCP-1 concentrations to be weakly associated with rs1024611 (P=0.003) while a highly significant (P=10−323) non-synonymous Duffy blood group chemokine receptor (DARC) polymorphism rs12075 (Asp42Gly) explained 20% of the variance in serum MCP-1 concentrations. In Sardinians, Naitza et al. [64] reported that variants of DARC (rs12075), CCR2 (rs17141006), and CADM3 (rs3845624) explain 9.8% of MCP-1 phenotypic variation, whilst rs1024611 did not meet the threshold for reporting. Benjamin et al. [60] reported that rs2494250 and rs4128725 explained 7.0 and 4.4 percent of the serum MCP-1 variance, while rs1024611 showed no significant MCP-1 association (via its rs1080327 proxy). To the best of our knowledge, reports of significant interactions between MCP-1 concentrations, disease, and rs12075, rs17141006, rs3845624, rs2494250, and rs4128725 genotypes are lacking.

Finally we caution that the Framingham Heart Study included almost exclusively middle-aged to elderly White subjects and therefore the results may not extrapolate to other racial groups. The genotype frequencies of MCP-1 distal regulatory region polymorphisms have been shown to vary substantially by ethnicity [18]. Estimated heritability by Falconer’s formula may also underestimate the complexity of MCP-1 genetics. Our analyses, and those of many reported gene-disease associations [17,52–55,60,63,69,70,71], are based on MCP-1 concentrations in serum that may involve different genetic effects than the plasma MCP-1 concentrations reported by others [2,11,51,68,72]. MCP-1 concentrations measured in serum tend to be twice as high as their plasma measurements, due possibly to the release of MCP-1 bound to blood cells after coagulation [73].

Conclusion:

Heritability of untransformed serum MCP-1 concentrations appears to be quantile-dependent as originally measured. They suggest stronger genetic effects at higher circulating concentrations, a finding that is obfuscated when the data are logarithmically transformed. Most genetic analyses of MCP-1 concentrations are logarithmically transformed in order to satisfy the statistical requirements of the tests performed, yet a biological justification for has not been provided. Quantile-dependent expressivity was consistent with the larger −2518 G/A (rs1024611) genotypes differences in: 1) MCP-1 concentrations in diseases (sepsis, brain abscess, hepatitis B virus, Alzheimer’s disease, Behcet’s disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus) vs. healthy patients; and 2) MCP-1 production in stimulated vs. basal cells.

A) Offspring-parent regression slopes (βOP) for selected quantiles of the offspring’s MCP-1 concentrations from 5127 offspring-parent pairs, with corresponding estimates of heritability (h2=2βOP/(1+rspouse) [32], where the correlation between spouses was rspouse=0.0727. The slopes (βOP) increased with increasing quantiles of the MCP-1 distribution. B) The aforementioned estimates of quantile-specific heritability were included with those of other quantiles to create the quantile-specific heritability function.

Highlights

The phenotypic expression of a gene variant may depend on the phenotype distribution.

Quantile regression was applied to serum MCP-1concentrations measured in families.

Genetic effects increased with increasing percentiles of the MCP-1 distribution.

This may explain the larger −2518 G/A effect for conditions that increase MCP-1.
