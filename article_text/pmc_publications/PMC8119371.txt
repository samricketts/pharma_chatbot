INTRODUCTION:

We determined whether CSF Neurofilament light (NfL), neurogranin (Ng), and total-tau (T-tau) differentially mapped to MRI measures of cortical thickness, microstructural integrity (corpus callosum and cingulum fractional anisotropy (FA)), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH).

METHODS:

Analyses included 536 non-demented Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants with CSF NfL, Ng, T-tau, amyloid-beta42 and longitudinal MRI scans. Linear mixed models assessed longitudinal associations between CSF markers and MRI changes.

RESULTS:

Higher CSF NfL was associated with decreasing microstructural integrity and WMH. Higher T-tau was associated with decreasing temporal lobe and AD meta region of interest (ROI) cortical thickness. There was no association between Ng and any MRI measure. CSF amyloid-beta42 interacted with Ng for declines in temporal lobe and AD meta ROI cortical thickness and cingulum FA.

DISCUSSION:

CSF NfL predicts changes in white matter integrity, T-tau reflects non-specific changes in cortical thickness, and Ng reflects AD-specific synaptic and neuronal degeneration.

1. INTRODUCTION

Neurodegeneration is the pathological process most strongly associated with clinical symptoms, in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1–3]. There are many potential fluid and imaging neurodegeneration markers, some of which are described below, that may be specific or non-specific to AD and other pathologies across brain regions. It is important to understand what information different neurodegenerative biomarkers provide to aid in both diagnosis and prognosis, especially because each marker is likely to be reflective of a different composite of pathological processes.

Under the AT(N) scheme of the NIA-AA Research Framework [4], proposed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of neurodegeneration (N) now include total-tau (T-tau), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and neurogranin (Ng). Several studies have examined and compared these three CSF N markers for improving clinical diagnosis and for predicting cognitive decline [5–10]. However, few studies have directly compared CSF T-tau, NfL, and Ng for longitudinal changes in multiple neuroimaging markers of neurodegeneration, especially in a community-based population. Some studies have suggested that the effects of elevated CSF T-tau and Ng for hippocampal atrophy are amyloid-dependent whereas CSF NfL is associated with hippocampal atrophy regardless of amyloid status [5,11]. However, another study did not find the effects of CSF T-tau on cerebral atrophy to be amyloid-dependent [12]. CSF NfL has been consistently shown to be associated with white matter integrity, as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and with white matter hyperintensities (WMH), e.g., [13,14] independent of amyloid pathology. However, associations between CSF Ng or T-tau with white matter changes are less well examined. The goal of the present study was to determine whether CSF T-tau, NfL, and Ng differentially map to specific longitudinal MRI measures of cortical thickness, white matter integrity, and WMH and whether these associations differed by elevated brain amyloid in a large community based population without dementia.

2. METHODS

2.1. Study participants

The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) is a prospective population-based study examining the epidemiology of cognitive decline and risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among residents living in Olmsted County, Minnesota [15]. In 2004, Olmsted County residents between the ages of 70 and 89 were enumerated using the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records-linkage system in an age- and sex-stratified random sampling design [16]. The study was extended to include those aged 50 and older in 2012. MCSA visits include an interview by a study coordinator, physician examination, and neuropsychological testing [15]. Clinical follow-up visits occur at 15 month intervals. Participant demographics (age, sex, and years of education) and medical history were ascertained at the in-clinic examination. At each visit, participants were asked if they would be willing to undergo a lumbar puncture for the collection of CSF or to have neuroimaging. The current analyses included 536 non-demented MCSA participants who had CSF assays of NfL, Ng, T-tau, and Aβ42, and MRI measures of cortical thickness, microstructural integrity(corpus callosum fractional anisotropy (FA) and cingulum FA), or white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume. Some participants did not have all MRI measures due to changes in acquisition protocols and availability of quantified data over the course of the study. The study was approved by Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center Institutional Review Boards. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

2.2. MCI and dementia diagnostic determination

Clinical diagnoses were determined by a consensus committee of those who evaluated each participant. Cognitive performance was compared with the age-adjusted scores of cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals previously obtained using Mayo’s Older American Normative Studies [17]. Participants with scores around 1.0 SD below the age-specific mean in the general population were considered for possible cognitive impairment. The operational definition of MCI was based on clinical judgment including a history from the patient and informant and cognitive performance. Published criteria were used for the diagnosis: cognitive complaint, cognitive function not normal for age, essentially normal functional activities, no dementia [18]. A final decision was made after considering education, occupation, visual or hearing deficits, and reviewing all other participant information. The diagnosis of dementia was based on published criteria [19]. Participants who performed in the normal range and did not meet criteria for MCI or dementia were deemed CU. The consensus committee was blinded to CSF and neuroimaging results and prior clinical assessments when determining the clinical diagnosis.

2.3. Lumbar punctures and CSF measurements

Fasting lumbar punctures were performed early in the morning in the lateral decubitus position from the L3 and L4 intravertebral space using a 20 or 22 gauge Quincke needle. Two cc of CSF were used to evaluate routine markers (glucose, protein, cell count). The remainder was divided into 0.5cc aliquots and stored at −80°C. Samples had not undergone a freeze-thaw cycle prior to being pulled. As previously described [20], participants who underwent a lumbar puncture, compared to those who did not, were younger, more likely to be male, and generally healthier. However, clinical diagnosis (e.g., CU, MCI, dementia) was not associated with participation in a lumbar puncture.

CSF Aβ42 and T-tau were measured with automated electrochemiluminescence Elecsys immunoassays (Roche Diagnostics), as previously described [20]. A CSF Aβ42 level&lt;1026 pg/mL was considered amyloid positive (A+). We did not use the P-tau/Aβ42 ratio because we have previously shown a high correlation (Spearman rho=0.98, P &lt; .001) between CSF P-tau and CSF T-tau in this cohort. CSF NfL and Ng were measured using in-house ELISAs; their assay characteristics and methods have been described in detail elsewhere [8,21,22].

2.4. Structural MRI

Neuroimaging occurs at 15- or 30-month intervals. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired using standardized Magnetization Prepared – Rapid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) sequences on 3T GE scanners (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). We ran FreeSurfer (version 5.3) on the MPRAGE scans. We computed an AD-related meta region of interest (ROI) using a cortical thickness composite of entorhinal, fusiform, inferior temporal, and middle temporal ROIs [23] which includes regions that are typically impacted by aging and AD. We also used computer lobar cortical thickness measures for: temporal (entorhinal, parahippocampal, banks of superior temporal sulcus, fusiform, inferior temporal, insula, middle temporal, superior temporal, temporal pole, transverse temporal); frontal (caudal middle frontal, frontal pole, lateral orbitofrontal, medial orbitofrontal, pars opercularis, pars orbitalis, pars triangularis, rostral middle frontal, superior frontal); parietal (inferior parietal, postcentral, precuneus, superior parietal, supramarginal); and occipital (cuneus, lateral occipital, lingual, pericalcerine) lobes.

DTI sequences were processed and analyzed for fractional anisotropy (FA) of the corpus callosum and of the cingulum [24,25]. Loss of white matter microstructural integrity measured using DTI has been shown to be a good indicator of axonal injury. We used the JHU atlas to regionally measure FA from DTI scans [26]. We considered corpus callosum FA (combination of the genu, body, splenium from JHU atlas) because these interhemispheric connections are widely disrupted in aging and dementia [27]. We considered cingulum FA (combination of the cingulum in the cingulate gyrus and cingulum adjoining the hippocampus from JHU atlas) because these tracts are specifically impacted in AD [28].

White matter hyperintensities on standard 2-dimensional Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging were segmented and edited by a trained imaging analyst using a semi-automated method, as previously described [29,30]. WMH volume is presented as the percentage of total intracranial volume (TIV).

2.5. Statistics

Students t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for dichotomous variables were used to assess differences in those who had all imaging modalities compared to those who did not. CSF NfL, T-tau, and Ng were z log-transformed to normalize the distributions and to allow for comparison with neuroimaging measures. Linear regression models were used to examine the cross-sectional associations between each CSF N marker and each MRI measure after adjusting for age, sex, and CSF Aβ42. Linear mixed models were used to examine the associations between each baseline CSF N marker and longitudinal MRI measures adjusting for age, sex, and CSF Aβ42. For all analyses, higher cortical thickness and corpus callosum or cingulum FA is good whereas a higher percent of WMH is detrimental.

For both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, we examined interactions between each CSF N marker and either low CSF amyloid-beta 42 (A+) or diagnosis of MCI in relation to each MRI measure. Because several participants did not have all three neuroimaging modalities available concurrently with CSF, we ran sensitivity analyses for each of the above-described cross-sectional and longitudinal models. Specifically, we reran the models restricting the sample to the 268 participants who had all three neuroimaging modalities. To be more stringent in our conclusions, we considered P &lt; .01 as statistically significant.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Participant characteristics

The characteristics of the 536 participants with CSF and MRI are shown in Table 1. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 74.9 (7.3) years and education was 14.4 (2.8) years. There were 304 men (57%), 154 (29%) with an APOE ε4 allele, and 70 (13%) with a clinical consensus diagnosis of MCI. Of the 536 participants, 268 (50%) had all neuroimaging modalities at baseline and longitudinally. Compared to those with all three imaging parameters, those without were significantly older, more frequently male, more frequently had a diagnosis of MCI, and had higher levels of all CSF measures (Table 1). The participants had an average of 2.4 (1.8) follow-up years and 2.2 (1.0) visits. CSF Ng was highly correlated with T-tau (Spearman’s rho = 0.831, P &lt; .0001) while CSF NfL had moderate correlations with Ng (Spearman’s rho = 0.321, P &lt; .0001) and T-tau (Spearman’s rho = 0.477, P &lt; .0001).

3.2. Cross-sectional associations between each CSF N marker and neuroimaging outcomes

Higher CSF NfL levels were cross-sectionally associated with lower AD meta ROI cortical thickness and with lower cortical thickness in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes in multivariable analyses (Table 2). In contrast, there were few cross-sectional associations between either CSF T-tau or Ng with any neuroimaging measures, with the exception that higher levels of both were associated with higher corpus callosum FA. When we restricted the analyses to only include the 268 participants with all neuroimaging modalities, the results were the same (Supplementary Table 1).

We next determined whether there were cross-sectional interactions between each CSF N marker and elevated brain amyloid, defined as CSF Aβ42&lt;1026 pg/mL, for each neuroimaging measure (Supplementary Table 2). The only finding was that higher CSF T-tau levels were associated with lower temporal lobe thickness in amyloid positive participants compared to amyloid negative individuals in multivariable analyses (b(se) = −0.215 (0.081), P = .002). The results were the same in our sensitivity analyses restricting the sample to the 268 participants with all neuroimaging modalities (Supplementary Table 3).

Lastly, we determined whether there were cross-sectional interactions between each CSF N marker and a clinical diagnosis of MCI for each neuroimaging measure (Table 3). The associations between CSF T-tau or Ng and neuroimaging markers did not differ by clinical diagnosis (MCI vs. cognitively unimpaired) in multivariable analyses adjusting for age, sex, and CSF Aβ42. In contrast, higher levels of CSF NfL were associated with reduced cortical thickness among MCI participants in the frontal (b(se) = −0.524 (0.131), P &lt; .001), parietal (b(se) = −0.437 (0.125), P &lt; .001), and temporal lobes (b(se) = −0.482 (0.121), P &lt; .001) and in an AD meta ROI (b(se) = −0.653 (0.125), P &lt; .001). Again, the results were the same when the sample was restricted to the 268 participants with all neuroimaging modalities (Supplementary Table 4).

3.3. Associations between each CSF N marker and longitudinal neuroimaging outcomes

In multivariable analyses with time interactions in the mixed models, higher CSF T-tau was longitudinally associated with declines in temporal lobe cortical thickness (b(se) = −0.189(0.068), P = .006) and the AD signature region (b(se) = −0.281(0.073), P &lt; .001; Table 4). Higher CSF NfL was associated with declines in the corpus callosum (b(se) = −0.283(0.096), P = .003) and cingulum (b(se) = −0.308(0.096), P = .006) FA and WMH (b(se) = 0.149(0.055), P = .007). There were no associations between CSF Ng and longitudinal neuroimaging measures. The results were the same in our sensitivity analyses restricting the sample to the 268 participants with all neuroimaging modalities (Supplementary Table 5).

The associations between CSF T-tau or NfL and longitudinal neuroimaging markers did not differ by CSF Aβ42 status in multivariate models adjusting for age and sex (Table 5). However, higher CSF Ng was associated with greater declines in temporal lobe thickness (b(se) = −0.464 (0.140), P &lt; .001), AD meta ROI thickness (−0.471 (0.151), P = .002), and cingulum FA (−0.662 (0.240), P = .006) in amyloid positive individuals compared to amyloid negative individuals. The results of the sensitivity analyses of the 268 participants with all neuroimaging modalities were essentially the same (Supplementary Table 6). However, the interaction between CSF Ng and CSF Aβ42 for cingulum FA was no longer significant based on our a priori P-value definition (b(se) = −0.584 (0.239), P = .015).

There were interactions between MCI and both CSF T-tau (−0.579 (0.218), P = .008) and Ng (−0.664 (0.231), P = .007) such that increasing levels of these CSF markers were associated with greater reduction in AD meta ROI cortical thickness longitudinally among MCI compared to CU (Table 6). Associations between CSF NfL and all neuroimaging outcomes did not differ by diagnosis (CU vs. MCI). Again, results were similar in sensitivity analyses restricting the sample to the 268 with all neuroimaging modalities (Supplementary Table 7).

4. DISCUSSION

Within the AT(N) scheme of the 2018 NIA-AA research framework, neurodegeneration (N) can be defined by multiple CSF markers or neuroimaging modalities. However, these neurodegenerative markers may not be measuring the same aspects and some may be more specific to AD pathology than others. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to better understand how CSF T-tau, NfL, and Ng differentially associated with specific MRI measures of cortical thickness, white matter microstructural integrity, and/or WMH. We also determined whether these associations differed by elevated brain amyloid or diagnosis of MCI in a community based non-demented population. Our results suggest that CSF NfL, Ng, and T-tau differentially correspond to the MRI measures evaluated. CSF Ng was longitudinally most specific for AD-associated neurodegeneration and reflected greater declines in AD-related imaging biomarkers, especially in the presence of amyloidosis. CSF NfL was strongly associated with longitudinal cingulum and corpus callosum FA and WMH, but not cortical thickness, and the results did not differ by CSF amyloid. CSF T-tau was associated with longitudinal declines in cortical thickness, but not white matter integrity or WMH, and these associations were also amyloid-independent. These results suggest, in the context of AT(N), that CSF Ng is a more specific marker of amyloid-related neurodegeneration while CSF NfL and T-tau are more non-specific markers of neurodegeneration.

Neurogranin is a post-synaptic protein that is specific to neurons, important for synaptic plasticity, and abundant in excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus [31]. Previous studies of clinic-based samples have suggested that Ng is specific to AD by demonstrating that CSF Ng is only elevated in AD dementia patients compared to controls, but not those with frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, Parkinson’s disease or other neurodegenerative diseases [32,33]. Cross-sectionally, studies have shown that the association between hippocampal atrophy and CSF Ng is amyloid-dependent [5,12]. Further, levels of CSF Ng have been shown to steeply increase in response to significant amyloid accumulation [34,35]. Cross-sectionally, although there were trends for CSF Ng to be associated with greater reduction in temporal and AD meta ROI cortical thickness (both P &lt; .05), these associations were not significant based on our a priori P-value of P &lt; .01. However, our longitudinal results further support an amyloid-dependent prognostic effect of elevated CSF Ng for declines in temporal and AD meta ROI cortical thickness and cingulum FA. These results also extend previous research suggesting an association between CSF Ng and white matter integrity [14]. Notably, in our results CSF Ng was more strongly associated with cingulum FA than corpus callosum FA among participants with elevated brain amyloid. Disruption of the limbic white matter pathways is well known in AD, supporting these findings of the cingulum FA in the presence of amyloidosis [28,36].

Studies examining the relationship between CSF T-tau and neuroimaging markers of neurodegeneration, and whether the associations are AD-specific, are less clear. For example, one study reported that high CSF T-tau was associated with lower hippocampal volume and FDG-PET hypometabolism only among those who were amyloid positive [5]. However, another study did not find an amyloid-dependent effect of CSF T-tau on voxel-based cortical atrophy [12]. Our results are somewhat related to these previous findings that used ADNI data. Cross-sectionally, there was an amyloid-dependent effect of CSF T-tau on temporal lobe cortical thickness and a trend for AD meta ROI thickness. Longitudinally, higher CSF T-tau was associated with declines temporal lobe and AD meta ROI cortical thickness. However, these associations were amyloid-independent. Although, but there were trends of greater associations between CSF T-tau and temporal lobe cortical thickness and for cingulum FA among participants with elevated brain amyloid. The associations between CSF T-tau and AD meta ROI cortical thickness were also stronger among participants diagnosed with MCI. Thus, while CSF T-tau has some specificity for AD-associated neurodegeneration, it does not appear to be as specific as CSF Ng. The non-specificity of CSF T-tau was also reflected by the associations with corpus callosum FA which is a more general (non-specific) marker of cognitive dysfunction than cingulum FA.

CSF NfL has been consistently shown to be associated with white matter integrity, as assessed by DTI, and with WMH [13,14]. We did not find any associations between CSF NfL with white matter integrity or WMH cross-sectionally, similar to some previous studies [5,37]. However, CSF NfL was longitudinally associated with longitudinal changes in corpus collosum and cingulate FA and WMH independent of amyloid pathology.

A strength of the study is the community-based sample. Many previous studies that utilized clinic-based samples or the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) likely have less pathology and are not representative of the general community. Another strength is that we evaluated all three neurodegeneration CSF biomarkers using longitudinal imaging outcomes. There are some limitations as well. First, we considered a limited number of imaging outcomes by using specific global measures. Second, CSF Aβ40 was not assayed in our cohort. Therefore, our definition of elevated brain amyloid was based on CSF Aβ42 alone, rather than the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio which has been shown to be superior for the measurement of brain amyloid and the diagnosis of AD dementia [38,39]. It is possible that the use of CSF Aβ42 to define brain amyloid could have contributed to the lack of an interaction between CSF NfL or T-tau with CSF Aβ42 for the AD meta ROI cortical thickness measure. Third, we had limited numbers with all three sets of imaging outcomes measured longitudinally; CSF levels of Aβ42, T-tau, Ng, and NfL were lower among those with all three neuroimaging modalities compared to those without. However, when we ran sensitivity analyses for all models, restricting the analyses to those with all three neuroimaging measures, the results were essentially the same. Lastly, although this study advances our knowledge of the pathophysiology of proposed neurodegenerative biomarkers, autopsy studies evaluating the specific pathologies contributing to changes in antemortem neurodegenerative biomarkers will be an important next step.

Under the AT(N) scheme of the NIA-AA Research Framework [4], proposed CSF markers of neurodegeneration (N) now include T-tau, NfL, and Ng. The present study contributes further insight regarding information each of these three candidate CSF markers may provide and how they can best be utilized for clinical and research purposes. Of the three, CSF Ng appears to the be the best marker of AD-related pathological neurodegeneration (NfL, Ng, and T-tau) and will be most helpful for AD diagnosis and AD-related prognosis. Although CSF T-tau provides some indication of AD pathology, it appears to be less specific than Ng. Lastly, CSF NfL is non-specific to AD pathology. The measurement of CSF NfL has the added benefit of providing information regarding non-AD related pathologies, potentially due to vascular and other causes, and will add information about overall prognosis.
