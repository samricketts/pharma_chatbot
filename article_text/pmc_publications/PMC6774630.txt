Large cohort studies are commonly launched to study risk of genetic variants or other risk factors on age at onset (AAO) of a chronic disorder. In these studies, family history data including AAO of disease in family members are collected to provide additional information and can be used to improve efficiency. Statistical analysis of these data is challenging due to missing genotypes in family members and the heterogeneous dependence attributed to both shared genetic back-ground and shared environmental factors (e.g., life style). In this paper, we propose a class of semiparametric transformation models with multilevel random effects to tackle these challenges. The proposed models include both proportional hazards model and proportional odds model as special cases. The multilevel random effects contain individual-specific random effects including kinship correlation structure dependent on the family pedigree, and a shared random effect to account for unobserved environment exposure. We use nonparametric maximum likelihood approach for inference and propose an expectation-maximization algorithm for computation in the presence of missing genotypes among family members. The obtained estimators are shown to be consistent, asymptotically normal, and semiparametrically efficient. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method performs well with finite sample sizes. Finally, the proposed method is applied to study genetic risks in an Alzheimer‚Äôs disease study.

1. Introduction

Long term cohort studies are launched to study effect of risk factors, including genetic mutations, on age at onset (AAO) of a disease (e.g., Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (Tang et al., 2001)). In these studies, family history data including AAO of disease in family members are collected to provide additional information and can be used to improve efficiency of estimating associations. However, although advanced technologies have decreased cost of genotyping, ascertaining many family members and collecting their blood samples is still resource-expensive. Therefore, family history data, which can be cheaply collected from individuals participating in cohort studies (probands), remain a useful source to augment the proband data and improve the accuracy of genetic risk assessment (Whittemore, 1995; Parmigiani et al., 1998; Whittemore and Halpern, 2003).

There are several challenges when analyzing the combined family history and proband data to study genetic risks on disease AAO (Gorfine et al., 2013). First, when the disease is polygenetic, the disease onset events of the members in the same family are correlated due to the shared genetic background; second, since the family members are likely to be exposed to the same environment such as dietary and other non-genetic risk factors, their dependence can also be attributed to these unobserved environmental factors; third, since genotype information of the family members is usually not collected due to resource constraint, the exact genotypes are not observed in relatives, but their distribution can be inferred.

A number of methods have been developed to address these challenges in the analysis of the proband-family data. For example, Gorfine et al. (2009) analyzed a case-control family study for correlated failure times using a shared frailty proportional hazards model. Moreover, a class of frailty models for familial risk prediction with unknown genetic mutation status were studied in Chen et al. (2009), Graber et al. (2011), and Gorfine et al. (2013), where they assumed that a single-level of random effects were shared by the family under proportional hazards models. Garcia et al. (2017) estimated genetic risk functions from multivariate failure time data under a proportional odds model. While these works adjust for shared environmental factors using random effects, they do not account for the dependence due to the polygenetic effects. In an earlier work, Antoniou et al. (2008) applied a polygenic model by assuming that each individual had a random effect and their correlation followed the kinship correlation structure. However, this work does not consider possible dependence due to the shared environment by all family members or missing genotypes in family members.

In this paper, we consider a general class of semiparametric transformation models in Cheng et al. (1995) and Zeng and Lin (2007), which include both proportional hazards model and proportional odds model as special cases. We include multilevel random effects in the regression model and they consist of both individual-specific random effects and family-shared random effect. The former accounts for the dependence due to the shared genetic background with a kinship-structured covariance Khoury et al. (1993); while the latter represents the dependence due to the share environment effects or life style among the family members. Nonparametric maximum likelihood approach is used to handle missing genotypes for parameter estimation and inference. A fast numeric integration is used to perform multi-dimensional integration. We prove semiparametric efficiency of the proposed estimators, including establishing the invertibility of the information operator in a proper metric space. We also derive asymptotic variance formulae of the parameters, which avoids computationally intensive bootstrap procedure to compute variances. In the simulations and real data analysis, we show substantial reduction in bias, efficiency gain, and improvement in power of testing association, by properly accounting for hierarchical correlation structure among event times. We also demonstrate an improved efficiency for estimating cumulative risk of dementia by including both probands data and family history data on their relatives in a long-term, real world study of aging and dementia.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present the proposed model and the detail of an expectation-maximization algorithm for estimation in Section 2. In Section 3, the derived estimators are shown to be asymptotically efficient. Extensive simulation studies are conducted in Section 4. Finally, we apply the proposed method to study association between a causal mutation and AAO of dementia from an ongoing, large cohort study with structured family history data. Theoretical proofs are given in Supplementary Materials S.1.

2. Method

2.1. Model and likelihood function

Assume there are n i.i.d families. For the jth member in the ith family of size ni, let Tij denote the event time of age at onset, Cij be the potential right censoring time, and Xij be the baseline covariates including genetic polymorphisms and other risk factors. Furthermore, we denote Gi¬∑ = (Gi1,‚Ä¶, Gini) as the genotype vector for all family members including the proband and let Œ£i be the kinship matrix defined in accordance with family i‚Äôs pedigree structure.

To study the genetic risk on the age at onset, we assume the following transformation model: given a family-specific random effect bi and individual-specific random effects rij, the cumulative hazard function for Tij follows (2.1) Œõij(t|Gij,Xij,bi,rij)=H{Œõ(t)¬†exp(Œ≤Gij+Œ≥TXij+bi+rij)},

where H(¬∑) is a given transformation function, and both Œõ(t) and (Œ≤, Œ≥) are unknown. Here Œ≤ is the genetic association parameter of interest, and Œ≥ is a vector of parameters for other baseline covariates including confounders. Moreover, bi is the family-specific random effect representing the family-shared environment and is assumed to follow N(0,œÉb2), and (ri1,‚Ä¶, rini)T denotes the individual random effects for the shared polygenic effects (genetic background) and follows a multivariate normal distribution MV N(0,œÉr2‚àëi). In model (2.1), transformation function H(¬∑) is chosen from the class {Œ±‚àí1log(1+Œ±x),Œ±&gt;0,x,Œ±=0,

so Œ± = 0 yields the proportional hazards model and Œ± = 1 yields the proportional odds model. Additionally, we assume that Mendelian transmission holds for Gij.

In cohort studies involving family history data, Gi¬∑ are often not available except for the probands who are the original participants. Instead, we observe a set ùí¢i containing all possible genotypes (including the proband‚Äôs genotype) that are consistent with the ith family‚Äôs pedigree structure and proband‚Äôs genotype. Thus, the observed data from n families consist of Oi = {(Yij, Œîij, Xij, ùí¢i), j = 1,‚Ä¶, ni}, i = 1,‚Ä¶, n, where Œîij = I(Tij ‚â§ Cij) is the censoring indicator, and Yij = min(Tij, Cij) is the observed event.

Assume that the censoring times (Ci1,‚Ä¶, Cini)T are independent of (Ti1,‚Ä¶, Tini)T and (bi, ri1,‚Ä¶, rini)T conditional on (Xi1,‚Ä¶, Xini)T. Then the observed likelihood function of the parameters in (2.1) takes form ‚àèi=1n‚à´‚àëgi¬∑‚ààùí¢i{pi(gi¬∑)‚àèj=1ni[Œª(Yij)¬†exp(Œ≤gij+Œ≥TXij+bi+rij)√óH‚Ä≤{Œõ(Yij)¬†exp(Œ≤gij+Œ≥TXij+bi+rij)}]Œîij√óexp¬†[‚àíH{Œõ(Yij)¬†exp(Œ≤gij+Œ≥TXij+bi+rij)}]}√ó(2œÄœÉb2)‚àí1/2exp(‚àíbi22œÉb2)(2œÄœÉr2)‚àíni/2|‚àëi|‚àí1/2exp(‚àíri¬∑T‚àëi‚àí1ri¬∑2œÉr2)dbidri¬∑,

where Œª(t) = dŒõ(t)/dt and H‚Ä≤(¬∑) denotes the derivative of H(¬∑). Here, pi(gi¬∑) is the conditional probability of Gi¬∑ = gi¬∑ given the proband‚Äôs genotype. Note that pi(gi¬∑), i = 1,‚Ä¶, n, can be computed under the Mendelian transmission and the family pedigree, so they are assumed to be known in the rest of this work.

2.2. Nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation

We use the nonparametric maximum-likelihood estimation (NPMLE) approach for parameter estimation of Œõ(t). Specifically, we estimate Œõ(t) as a step function with jumps only at the observed failure times and replace Œª(t) by the corresponding jump size of Œõ at t in the likelihood function. We then maximize the following function over Œ∏=(Œ≤,Œ≥T,œÉb2,œÉr2)T and all the jump sizes of Œõ(¬∑): (2.2) ‚àèi=1n‚à´‚àëgi¬∑‚ààùí¢i{pi(gi¬∑)‚àèj=1ni[Œõ{Yij}¬†exp(Œ≤gij+Œ≥TXij+bi+rij)√óH‚Ä≤{Œõ(Yij)¬†exp(Œ≤gij+Œ≥TXij+bi+rij)}]Œîij√óexp¬†[‚àíH{Œõ(Yij)¬†exp(Œ≤gij+Œ≥TXij+bi+rij)}]}√ó(2œÄœÉb2)‚àí1/2exp(‚àíbi22œÉb2)(2œÄœÉr2)‚àíni/2|‚àëi|‚àí1/2exp(‚àíri¬∑T‚àëi‚àí1ri¬∑2œÉr2)dbidri¬∑,

where Œõ{Yij} is the jump size of Œõ at Yij.

Computationally, the above maximization can be carried out using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. First, we notice that the transformation H(x) satisfies exp{‚àíH(x)}=‚à´0‚àûexp(‚àítx)œà(t)dt,

where œà(t) is a gamma density with shape 1/Œ± and scale Œ±. Therefore, if we introduce another random variable Œæij ~ Gamma(1/Œ±), then the proposed model (2.1) is equivalent to assuming the conditional hazard rate of Tij given Œæij, bi, ri¬∑, Xij and Gij to be (2.3) ŒæijŒª(t)¬†exp(Œ≤Gij+Œ≥TXij+bi+rij).

Treating Œæij, bi, ri¬∑, Gi¬∑ as missing data, the observed likelihood function in (2.2) is equivalent to the likelihood arising from the complete data consisting of Œæi¬∑ = (Œæi1,‚Ä¶, Œæini)T and Oi‚àó=(Gi¬∑,bi,ri¬∑,Oi) for i = 1,‚Ä¶, n, whose joint density is f(Œæi¬∑,Oi‚àó)=‚àèj=1ni[{ŒæijŒõ{Yij}¬†exp(Œ≤Gij+Œ≥TXij+bi+rij)}Œîij√óexp[‚àíŒæijŒõ(Yij)¬†exp(Œ≤Gij+Œ≥TXij+bi+rij)}Œ±‚àí1/Œ±Œì(1/Œ±)Œæij1/Œ±‚àí1exp(‚àíŒæij/Œ±)]√ó|‚àëi|‚àí1/2(2œÄœÉb2)‚àí1/2(2œÄœÉr2)‚àíni/2exp¬†(‚àíbi22œÉb2‚àíri¬∑T‚àëi‚àí1ri¬∑2œÉr2)pi(Gi¬∑).

Each iteration in the EM algorithm consists of the following E- and M-steps. In the E-step, we calculate the conditional expectation of some integral function Q(Œæi¬∑,Oi‚àó) given Oi, denoted by E^(Q(Œæi¬∑,Oi‚àó)|Oi), using the following equation E^{Q(Œæi¬∑,Oi‚àó)|Oi}=‚àëgi¬∑‚ààùí¢i‚à´Œæi¬∑,bi,ri¬∑Q(Œæi¬∑,Oi‚àó)f(Œæi¬∑,Oi‚àó)I(Gi¬∑=gi¬∑)dŒæi¬∑dbidri¬∑‚àëgi¬∑‚ààùí¢i‚à´Œæi¬∑,bi,ri¬∑f(Œæi¬∑,Oi‚àó)I(Gi¬∑=gi¬∑)dŒæi¬∑dbidri¬∑.

The multi-dimensional integration to compute the above conditional expectation can be challenging due to multiple level of random effects (both family level and individual level), especially when the family size is large. We propose to use numeric approximation with a multi-dimension adaptive Gaussian quadrature approach (Abramowitz and Stegum, 1972; Liu and Pierce, 1994; Evants and Swartz, 2000) to evaluate the above integral, where we apply a sparse grid technique (Heiss and Winschel, 2008) to generate nodes for the quadratures with dimension larger than four.

In the M-step, we maximize the conditional expectation of the complete data log-likelihood function, which is given by ‚àëi=1n‚àëj=1ni{Œîij(log¬†Œõ{Yij}+log¬†Œæij+Œ≤Gij+Œ≥TXij+bi+rij)‚àíŒæijŒõ(Yij)¬†exp(Œ≤Gij+Œ≥TXij+bi+rij)}+‚àëi=1nlog{pi(Gi¬∑)}‚àí12‚àëi=1n{log(2œÄœÉb2)+bi2œÉb2+ni¬†log(2œÄœÉr2)+log|‚àëi|+1œÉr2ri¬∑T‚àëi‚àí1ri¬∑},

given the observed data and the current parameter values. By simple algebra, we update œÉb2 and œÉr2 by œÉb2=1n‚àëi=1nE^(bi2|Oi),œÉr2=1‚àëi=1nni‚àëi=1nE^(ri¬∑T‚àëi‚àí1ri¬∑|Oi).

We then update Œ≤ and Œ≥ by solving 0=‚àëi=1n‚àëj=1nŒîij{(E^(Gij|Oi),XijT)T‚àí‚àëk=1n‚àël=1niI(Ykl‚â•Yij)E^{(Gkl,XklT)TŒæklexp(Œ≤Gkl+Œ≥TXkl+bk+rkl)|Oi}‚àëk=1n‚àël=1niI(Ykl‚â•Yij)E^{Œæklexp(Œ≤Gkl+Œ≥TXkl+bk+rkl)|Oi}}

using one-step Newton-Raphson method. Based on the updated values for Œ≤ and Œ≥, we calculate the jump size of Œõ at Ykl as (2.4) ‚àëi=1n‚àëj=1niŒîijI(Yij=Ykl)‚àëi=1n‚àëj=1niI(Yij‚â•Ykl)E^{Œæijexp(Œ≤Gij+Œ≥TXij+bi+rij)|Oi}.

We iterate between the E- and M-steps till convergence, and denote the final estimators for Œ∏ and Œõ as Œ∏ÃÇ and ŒõÃÇ, respectively.

3. Asymptotic Properties

To establish the asymptotic distribution of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (Œ∏ÃÇ, ŒõÃÇ), we assume that the family size ni is a bounded random variable and that conditional on ni, the pedigree structure of the family, denoted by ùí¶i, has a discrete distribution with finite choices so Œ£i, the kinship matrix, is also random. Denote the true values for Œ∏ and Œõ(t) as Œ∏0 and Œõ0(t), respectively. We need the following assumptions. A.1 The true value Œ∏0 lies in a known compact set Œò in the interior of the domain for Œ∏. Moreover, the true function Œõ0 is continuously differentiable with Œõ0‚Ä≤(t)&gt;0 in [0, œÑ], where œÑ is the study duration assumed to be finite.

A.2 With probability one, X is bounded and there exists a positive constant Œ¥ such that P{‚àëj=1niI(Yij‚â•œÑ)‚â•1|Xij,j=1,‚Ä¶,ni,ni}‚â•Œ¥.

A.3 There exists a constant n0 such that the family size ni satisfies P(1 ‚â§ ni ‚â§ n0) = 1 and P(ni ‚â• 2) &gt; 0.

A.4 Conditional on ni, let eij = (1, 0,‚Ä¶, 0, 1, 0,‚Ä¶, 0)T be a (ni+1)√ó1 vector with only the first and the jth elements equal to 1 for j = 1,‚Ä¶, ni. If (Œ≤, Œ≥, c1, c2) is a constant vector and ŒΩ(t) is a deterministic function satisfying ŒΩ(t)+Œ≤gij+Œ≥TXij+eijT(c100c2‚àëi)eij=0,eijT(c100c2‚àëi)eij‚Ä≤=0

for j ‚â† j‚Ä≤, j, j‚Ä≤ = 1,‚Ä¶, ni, gij, and t ‚àà [0, œÑ] with probability 1 (note that both Xij and Œ£i corresponding to the pedigree ùí¶i are random), then Œ≤ = 0, Œ≥ = 0, ŒΩ(t) = 0 for t ‚àà [0, œÑ], and c1 = c2 = 0.

A.5 Conditional on ni, if Œ£(g1,‚Ä¶, gni) q(g1,‚Ä¶, gni)pi(g1,‚Ä¶, gni)I((g1,‚Ä¶, gni) ~ ùí¶i) = 0 with probability one for some function q(¬∑), where the summation is over all genotype vectors (g1,‚Ä¶, gni) and (g1,‚Ä¶, gni) ~ ùí¶i means that (g1,‚Ä¶, gni) is compatible with the pedigree ùí¶i, then q(g1,‚Ä¶, gni) = 0.

Conditions (A.1)‚Äì(A.2) are standard assumptions for clustered survival data. Condition (A.3) assumes that the family size is bounded and that there exist at least some families with at least two members. Both conditions (A.4) and (A.5) are used to obtain parameter identifiability in the presence of multilevel random effects. In particular, (A.4) holds if (1, Xij, gij) has a full rank with positive probability and Œ£i has non-zero off-diagonal elements with a positive probability. In (A.5), we require that for a fixed family size, the matrix from the joint probabilities of {pi(gi¬∑)} across all possible pedigree structures is a full rank matrix. Under the above assumptions, we obtain the following asymptotic results.

Theorem 1

Under (A.1)‚Äì(A.5), we have |Œ∏ÃÇn ‚àí Œ∏0|‚Üí0 and ‚ÄñŒõÃÇn ‚àí Œõ0‚Äñ‚àû‚Üí0 almost surely, where |¬∑| is the Euclidean norm and ‚Äñ¬∑‚Äñ‚àû is the supremum norm in the interval [0, œÑ].

The proof of Theorem 1 is given in the Supplementary Materials S.1. The key idea of the proof is to first show that ŒõÃÇ is bounded so is weakly compact, and then show any convergence sequence of (Œ∏ÃÇ,ŒõÃÇ) should converge to the true parameters. The latter makes use of the Glivenko‚ÄìCantelli theorem for empirical processes and the identifiability results under conditions (A.4) and (A.5) to be established in the proof.

To establish the asymptotic distribution, let ‚Ñí = {h(t) : h(t) ‚àà BV[0, œÑ], ‚Äñh‚ÄñBV ‚â§ 1}, where ‚Äñh‚ÄñBV denotes the total variation of h, then by defining Œõ^n(h)=‚à´0œÑh(s)dŒõ^n(s) for h ‚àà ‚Ñí, ŒõÃÇn(t) is considered as a bounded linear function in l‚àû(‚Ñí). Hence, (Œ∏ÃÇn ‚àí Œ∏0, ŒõÃÇn ‚àí Œõ0) is viewed a random element in the metric space ‚Ñùd √ó l‚àû(‚Ñí), where d is the dimension of Œ∏0. Then the asymptotic distribution of the estimators is given as follows.

Theorem 2

Under (A.1)‚Äì(A.5), it holds that n(Œ∏^n‚àíŒ∏0,Œõ^n‚àíŒõ0) converges weakly to a mean zero Gaussian process in the metric space ‚Ñùd √ó l‚àû(‚Ñí). In addition, the asymptotic covariance matrix of n(Œ∏^n‚àíŒ∏0) attains the semiparametric efficiency bound.

Theorem 2 concludes that Œ∏ÃÇn is an efficient estimator for Œ∏0. The proof of Theorem 2 mostly follows the standard arguments for the semiparametric transformation models in Zeng and Lin (2007). One key challenge in the proof is to establish the invertibility of the information operator under the proposed multilevel random effect models. Furthermore, following the result of Theorem 4 in Zeng and Lin (2007), the asymptotic covariance for Œ∏ÃÇ can be estimated as the inverse of the observed information matrix. The latter can be calculated using the Louis formula method (Louis, 1982). Thus, using the estimated covariance matrix, we can construct the asymptotic confidence intervals for Œ≤0 and conduct score test for the null hypothesis Œ≤0 = 0.

4. Simulation Studies

Extensive simulation studies were conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method in finite samples. In the simulations, we considered transformation H(x) = x and log(1 + x) corresponding to the proportional hazards model and proportional odds model, respectively. We generated one binary covariate Xij from Bernoulli(0.5) and random effect bi~N(0,œÉb2) with œÉb = 0.5. To generate both random effects ri¬∑ and Gi¬∑, we considered two types of family pedigree structures as given in Figure 1, namely Case I and Case II. In particular, Case I is a two-generation pedigree including four members: Father, Mother, Sibling and Proband, and Case II is a three-generation pedigree with five members: Father (F), Mother (M), Sibling (S), Child (C) and Proband (P). Corresponding to each case, the resulting kingship matrices are respectively given as ‚àë1=(FMSP1.000.000.500.500.001.000.500.500.500.501.000.500.500.500.501.00),‚àë2=(FMSCP1.000.000.500.250.500.001.000.500.250.500.500.501.000.500.500.250.250.501.000.500.500.500.500.501.00).

Using the kinship matrix, we generated ri¬∑ from a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and covariance matrix œÉr2‚àëk for k = 1, 2 with œÉr2=0.5 or 1.0. The proband‚Äôs alleles were obtained with equal probabilities. Next, we used the Monte-Carlo method to obtain pi(¬∑)s for the ith family under its given pedigree structure: assuming the minor allele frequency to be 0.02 and using the Mendelian principles of inheritance, we used the pedigree structure to simulate all genotypes for the whole family members including the proband by starting from the top level of the pedigree. We repeated this simulation 30,000 times and retained those relatives‚Äô genotypes for which the proband‚Äôs genotype matched with his or her observed genotype. Then pi(¬∑) was calculated as the proportion of the relatives‚Äô genotypes in the retained samples. Finally, the disease onset time, Tij, was generated from model (2.1) with Œ≤ = 0.4, Œ≥ = ‚àí0.5 and Œª(t) = 1/2. The censoring time was simulated from the uniform distribution in [0, 6] to yield around 30‚Äì35% censoring rates. In the simulations, we considered sample size n = 300 and 500 and conducted simulations with 1,000 replicates.

For each simulated data, we used the proposed EM algorithm with multi-dimension adaptive Gaussian quadrature to calculate the NPMLEs. In the EM algorithm, the initial values of Œ≤ and Œ≥ were set to be 0, the initial values of œÉb2 and œÉr2 were set to be 1, and the initial values of Œõ(t)‚Äôs jump sizes were set to be 1/m, where m was the total count number of the disease events. We used the inverse of observed information matrix, computed by the Louis formula, to estimate the covariances, and used the Satterthwaite approximation (e.g., Satterthwaite, 1946; Burdick and Graybill, 1992) to construct the 95% confidence interval for œÉb2 and œÉr2:(œÖœÉ^2/œáœÖ,.9752,œÖœÉ^2/œáœÖ,.0252), where œÖ=2{œÉ^2/SE^(œÉ^2)}2,SE^(œÉ^2) is the estimated standard error of œÉÃÇ2, œáœÖ,q2 is the q-qauntile of the chi-squared distribution with œÖ degrees of freedom, and œÉ^2=œÉ^b2 or œÉ^r2. Additionally, we compared analyses under the proposed model with analyses under a misspecified model similar to (2.1) except that no rij was included. Thus, in the misspecified model, only the family-shared random effect was used to account for the dependence within the family.

Table 1 and 2 display the simulation results for Case I and II with sample size n = 300 and 500, œÉr2=0.5 and 1.0. As seen in these tables, the estimates of (Œ≤0,Œ≥0,œÉb02,œÉr02) and Œõ0(¬∑) are virtually unbiased when sample sizes increase. Because the parameter œÉr02 is non-negative, the empirical distribution of œÉ^r2 is not symmetric in practice. The estimated standard errors (SE) of œÉr02 are slightly larger than the standard deviations (SD) with small sample sizes. However, as the sample size increases, the performance can be significantly improved. Overall, the estimated standard errors accurately reflect the true variability. Furthermore, when comparing to the misspecified model which ignores the dependence due to the shared genetic background, the estimates from our multilevel method are more accurate and reliable than the estimates from the misspecified model, especially for estimating the genetic association parameter Œ≤. The coverage probabilities obtained under the misspecified model are much lower than the nominal level. Table 3 further presents the root mean of integrated squared error for estimating the cumulative hazard functions under both proposed model and misspecified model. Clearly, we observe that the misspecified model can lead to estimates with large bias and variability. The above conclusion is also reflected in Figure 2, where the relative bias of the estimated Euclidean parameter Œ∏ is defined as |(Œ∏ÃÇn ‚àí Œ∏0)/Œ∏0| and the relative efficiency improvement of the proposed model over the misspecified model in terms of the root mean integrated squared errors (abbreviated as MSE) is defined as |(MSE(ŒõÃÇn) ‚àí MSEmissp(ŒõÃÇn))/MSE(ŒõÃÇn)|. For example, the relative bias under misspecified single level model can be up to 20% and the relative efficiency gain of multi-level model can be up to 30%.

Finally, we compare the type-I errors of the score test under the true model and misspecified model, where Œ≤ = 0 and the other parameters remain the same. Our simulation results show that, for both proportional hazard model and proportional odds model, the type-I errors of misspecified model are heavily inflated. Specifically, for the Cox proportional hazard model, when the sample size is 300, the type-I error of misspecified model is around 0.112 with œÉr2=1.0, and it becomes 0.094 when the sample size is 500. The type-I error rates are 0.120 and 0.109 for the proportional odds model. The type-I error rates from our approach are mostly around the significance level of 0.05.

5. Application

The Washington Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP) is a prospective, community-based cohort study of aging, dementia, and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) in Northern Manhattan, New York City (Tang et al., 2001). The ongoing, decades-long study collected rich information on neuropsychiatric measures, environmental exposures, and genetic risk factors in thousands of participants. Incidence of dementia in proband participants was carefully monitored. The familial aggregation of dementia and AD is well established. First-degree relatives of AD patients have approximately twice the expected life time risk of dementia compared with persons without an affected first-degree relative (Devi et al., 2000). Among African Americans, increased relative risk of AD among first-degree relatives of patients was also observed (ranges from 1.4 in a community based sample to 2.6 in a clinic based sample). These findings suggest a substantial heritable contribution to AD and dementia, as well as non-genetic pathways due to shared environmental risk factors or life styles.

A structured family history interview (Maestre et al., 1995) was administered to the probands. The family history interview collected pedigree structure, birth order, vital status, level of education, family history of cognitive impairment, dementia, and AAO among first-degree relatives, including the non-WHICAP parent and among siblings. In our analysis, 1705 probands and 1342 relatives from 692 families were included in data analysis. The censoring rates of probands‚Äô and relatives‚Äô observations were 89.6% and 91.99%, respectively. Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotypes were obtained for each proband. Of interest is to estimate the cumulative incidence of dementia for APOE-Œµ4 mutation carrier group and non-carrier group adjusting for two potential confounders, gender and education.

To select the best transformation, we varied Œ± in H(¬∑) from 0 to 4 and chose the optimal model which gave the largest likelihood function. The optimal value of Œ± is 2 (see Figure 3), the variance calculated using the negative inverse of the curvature of the log profile likelihood function at the estimated Œ± is 0.249, and the 95% confidence interval is [1.02, 2.98]. The analyses results based on the transformation model with Œ± = 2 are presented in Table 4. From the table, the estimated log hazard ratio for the APOE-Œµ4 is 0.930 with p &lt; 0.0001, indicating a significant higher risk of the dementia occurrence in the APOE-Œµ4 carrier group. Gender is not significant in either analysis. The table also shows that the lower education has a significant effect of an increased risk of dementia.

In Table 5, we report the estimated cumulative distribution functions for carrier and non-carrier groups with other covariates fixed at the sample mean level. Furthermore, to demonstrate the usefulness of the family history data on relatives, we also report the estimates from the best transformation using the proband data only, in which no random effects were used and the best transformation was Œ± = 0.6. Interestingly, for the carrier group, both analyses give similar results, but in the non-carrier group, using both proband and family data gives slightly lower estimates of cumulative risk of dementia with a smaller variability (also see Figure 4). This analysis demonstrates the efficiency gain of including the family history data on relatives.

6. Discussion

In this article, we studied a class of transformation models with multilevel random effects for the correlated disease age at onset. The proposed method incorporated multilevel random effects to explain polygenic heterogeneity and shared environment within the family and accounted for missing genotype information in the relatives in a family. The NPMLE has been shown to perform well in small sample. Our application shows that using family history data can increase accuracy of disease risk estimation in non-carrier group. It can be conjectured that adding family history data will lead to improved power to detect the genetic association in genome wide association studies.

Although the proposed model is described for time-invariant covariates, it can be easily generalized to incorporate time-varying covariates for which model (2.1) becomes (6.1) Œõij(t|Gij,Xij(s),bi,rij;s‚â§t)=H{‚à´0tI(s‚â§Tij)¬†exp(Œ≤Gij+Œ≥TXij(s)+bi+rij)dŒõ(s)}.

The approaches dealing with time-varying covariates in (Zeng and Lin, 2007) can be adapted to make inferences for model (6.1). However, if bi or rij is also time-varying, the estimation would become more complicated. Currently, there is a lack of efficient method for handling such scenario.

When the family size is large, a computational challenge is how to handle multidimensional integral in the proposed method, since the dimension of quadratures in the EM algorithm increases as the family size increases. One alternative is to consider sampling manageable number of family members from the families with a big size. The proposed method can then be applied to this subset of the data. This process can be repeated for multiple times and proper combination of the results, after accounting for sampling weights and data overlapping, will be used to obtain the final estimates. Moreover, using the data from relatives should always improve efficiency in theory, but with a large œÉb2, such efficiency gain may not be significant. Thus, we would also recommend randomly selecting a small pedigree from each family for analysis, which greatly reduces computation cost without much efficiency loss.

In some cases, disease prevalence in the non-carrier group is available on the entire population (e.g., age-specific population risk of dementia). Thus, such information can be used to further increase efficiency and numeric stability in the analysis of the familial data. As a future work, we will calibrate the parameter estimation and prediction using information available from the population.

Supplemental Materials Proof of Theorem 1 and additional simulation studies mimicking the real data are presented in the supplemental file. The simulations show an adequate performance of selecting transformation parameter based on the profile likelihood method and little efficiency loss of our method as compared to the standard frailty model when true œÉr2=0.
