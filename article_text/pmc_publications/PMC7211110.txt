Background:

A meaningful and purpose-driven life is associated with better health outcomes. We test whether meaning in life is associated with risk of cognitive impairment using data from a large, multi-national study.

Methods:

Participants (N=22,514) were from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Participants from 14 countries reported on their meaning in life. Cognitive impairment was derived from performance on cognitive tasks administered at baseline and at up to three follow-up waves (waves 2–6 assessed between 2010–2015).

Results:

Lack of meaning in life was associated with a more than 20% increased risk of incident cognitive impairment over the up to 9-year follow-up (Hazard Ratio=1.24; 95% Confidence Interval=1.17–1.31). Further, compared to participants who reported often feeling meaning in life, participants who reported never feeling meaning in life were at an approximately 75% increased risk of impairment (Hazard Ratio=1.75, 95% Confidence Interval=1.19–2.57). The association between meaning in life and risk of cognitive impairment was apparent across four regions of Europe (Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western) and in Israel and was not moderated by sociodemographic characteristics.

Conclusions:

Reporting lower meaning in one’s life is associated with risk of incident cognitive impairment. Meaning may be a potential target of intervention for healthier cognitive aging.

1. Introduction

A meaningful life is defined as one that has purpose, significance, and coherence (Steger, 2009).1 Such assessments are subjective and not judgments by others of what should (or should not) be meaningful. Meaning in life first gained traction as a component of well-being: Individuals who report higher meaning in life report that they are satisfied with their lives, experience more happiness and positive affect, and have lower psychological distress and negative affect (Zika &amp; Chamberlain, 1992). Its importance, however, is not limited to well-being. Individuals who perceive their lives to have meaning and a coherent sense of direction tend to have better physical health outcomes (Czekierda, Banik, Park, &amp; Luszczynska, 2017), including greater longevity (Krause, 2009). These associations may be due, in part, to health behaviors. In particular, one component of meaning in life – purpose in life – has been associated with healthier sleep patterns (Turner, Smith, &amp; Ong, 2017), more physical activity (Hooker &amp; Masters, 2016), and better physical function (E. S. Kim, Kawachi, Chen, &amp; Kubzansky, 2017) that may drive the associations with better health.

This aspect of meaning (purpose) has also been implicated in healthier cognitive aging. When measured cross-sectionally, for example, individuals who perceive their lives as purposeful perform better on tests of memory and executive function in middle adulthood (Lewis, Turiano, Payne, &amp; Hill, 2017). When measured longitudinally, individuals with higher purpose maintain their overall cognitive function over time in older adulthood (G. Kim, Shin, Scicolone, &amp; Parmelee, 2019). Purpose is also protective against cognitive impairment, with greater purpose associated with lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease (Boyle, Buchman, Barnes, &amp; Bennett, 2010) and dementia (Sutin, Stephan, &amp; Terracciano, 2018), independent of other aspects of psychological functioning. That is, the association between purpose and dementia risk remains significant after controlling for satisfaction with life, positive affect, optimism, and mastery, as well as psychological distress (Sutin et al., 2018). This emerging body of research suggests that purpose in life, and, by extension, meaning in life, may help maintain cognitive function with aging.

The present research builds on this critical foundation to test whether an overall judgment of meaning in life is associated with risk of cognitive impairment (defined as scoring at least 1.5 standard deviations [SD] below the age-graded mean on two cognitive tasks) and whether this association can be found in the European cultural context. Previous studies on purpose and cognitive impairment have relied on samples from the United States. We seek to replicate and extend this literature by examining whether an overall judgement of meaning in life is associated with risk of cognitive impairment in Europe. There is evidence that meaning in life, measured in Europe, has similar correlates to what has been found for purpose in life in the United States for health behaviors (e.g., physical inactivity; Gomes et al., 2017). We address this relation between meaning and cognitive impairment in the largest sample to date that has been followed for up to 9 years. Consistent with the literature on purpose in life and dementia (Boyle et al., 2010; Sutin, Stephan, &amp; Terracciano, 2018), we hypothesize that lower meaning in life will be associated with greater risk of cognitive impairment over time. We further examine whether the association is apparent across regions of Europe and whether it varies as a function of age, sex, education, or marital status.

2.0 Method

2.1 Participants and Procedure

Data were from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), a cross-national panel study on health, socioeconomic status, and social and family networks of individuals aged 50 and older and their spouses (Börsch-Supan et al., 2013). SHARE is a prospective longitudinal study. We used data from Wave 2 (fieldwork completed between 2006–2010) as the baseline assessment because it was the first wave where meaning was included in the main survey administered to all participants. We used Wave 4 (2011–2012), Wave 5 (2013), and Wave 6 (2015) for the follow-up assessments of cognition. Wave 3 of SHARE was excluded because it assessed life history but not cognition. Participants were selected for analysis if they reported on meaning in their lives and had no cognitive impairment (see below) at the baseline assessment. A total of 22,514 individuals had data on meaning, cognition and basic covariates (Table 1) at baseline and at least one follow-up cognitive assessment. This analytic sample was from 14 national samples from Northern (Denmark, Sweden), Eastern (Czech Republic, Poland), Western (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands), and Southern (Greece, Italy, Spain) regions of Europe and Israel. Note that Ireland participated in wave 2 of SHARE but not in waves 4, 5, or 6 and thus could not be included in the analyses.

Supplemental Figure S1 shows a flow diagram for why and how many participants were excluded from the analysis. Of 10,904 SHARE participants who had baseline data but with no follow-up, 2,945 were reported dead after baseline. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the remaining participants with no follow-up data (n=7,959) were less likely to be married and scored lower on the delayed recall and verbal fluency tasks compared to the participants in the analytic sample. There was no difference in meaning, immediate recall, age, education or gender between the two groups.

SHARE was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Mannheim and the Ethics Council of the Max Planck Society (the letter of ethics approval can be found here: http://www.share-project.org/fileadmin/pdf_documentation/SHARE_ethics_approvals.pdf ). SHARE obtained consent from all participants included in the study (see http://www.share-project.org/fileadmin/pdf_documentation/Methodology/Methodology_2005.pdf ). Information on assessment, sampling, and how to obtain the data can be found at: http://www.share-project.org .

2.2 Measures

Meaning in life.

Participants rated a single-item measure of meaning (“How often do you feel that your life has meaning?”) on a 4-point scale from 1 (Often) to 4 (Never) that was from the original control-autonomy-pleasure-self-realization scale (CASP-19) that assesses quality of life in older adulthood (Hyde, Wiggins, Higgs, &amp; Blane, 2003).

Cognitive impairment.

Participants completed a memory recall task (immediate and delayed recall of 10 common words) and an animal fluency task (the number of animals named in 60 seconds). Participants who performed at least 1.5 SD below the age-graded mean on either or both recall tasks were coded as 1; all others were coded as 0. Likewise, participants who scored at least 1.5 SD below the age-graded mean on verbal fluency were coded as 1 and all others coded as 0. Participants who reported, “don’t know” for a task were coded 1 on that task. Participants were classified as having cognitive impairment (coded as 1) if they scored 1.5 SD below the age-graded mean on both the memory and verbal fluency tasks. We classified cognitive impairment with this approach to be consistent with previous studies on cognitive impairment in SHARE (Lugo-Palacios &amp; Gannon, 2017).

Covariates.

Age in years, sex (1=male, 0=female), marital status (1=married, 0=non-married) and educational level (from 0=Pre-primary education to 6=Secondary of tertiary education) were drawn from the baseline assessment. SHARE used the 1997 International Standard Classification of Education to categorize and harmonize education statistics across European countries (UNESCO, 2003). SHARE does not collect information on race/ethnicity (Börsch-Supan et al., 2013). Some analyses also used imputed data on monthly household income provided by SHARE. Income was measured with a question on the total household income received by all household members in an average month as in the last year. Fifty-seven percent of participants provided this information, and SHARE imputed average income for the remaining 43% of the sample (for more information on imputation methodology, refer to the user guide, pp. 45–50 and De Luca, Celidoni, &amp; Trevisan, 2015).

2.3 Statistical Approach

We used Cox regression to test whether meaning in life measured at baseline was associated with incident impairment over the follow-up. Cox regression was used because it evaluates time-to-event from baseline predictors. It thus evaluates the occurrence of an event (such as cognitive impairment) considering the time from the predictor of interest (such as meaning in life) to the first instance of the event. Baseline meaning was entered as a predictor of incident impairment, controlling for the covariates. Time was coded in years from the month and year of baseline assessment. Cases were censored at the last available cognitive assessment at which the participant did not score impaired. The strata function was used to account for the nested nature of the data (i.e., participants within country). Interaction terms between meaning and the sociodemographic characteristics tested whether the associations varied by age, sex, education, or marital status. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the robustness of the association: we repeated the analysis (1) limiting the sample to participants aged 65 and older to ensure that the association was not masked by the lower prevalence of cognitive impairment between 50–64 , (2) excluding participants who became impaired within 5 years of baseline to reduce the probability of reverse causality (i.e., the development of cognitive impairment leads to lower meaning), (3) including only countries that participated in all waves of SHARE (10 countries participated in all waves: Denmark, Sweden [Northern Europe], Czech Republic [Eastern Europe], Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland [Western Europe], Italy, and Spain [Southern Europe]) to evaluate whether the association holds among the countries with the most data in the analysis, (4) controlling for income to rule out that the association could be due to higher income rather than meaning, and (5) testing the association by region of Europe. All analyses were done using SPSS version 25.

3.0 Results

Descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1. Across the follow-up period (Meanfollow-up=7.13 years, SD=1.55, range=3–9 years for a total of 160,463 person years), 883 participants (4%) developed incident impairment. The results of the main and sensitivity analyses are in Table 2. Lower meaning in life was associated with greater impairment risk: Every standard deviation increase toward less meaning was associated with a more than 20% increased risk of cognitive impairment over the up to 9-year follow-up period, controlling for the covariates. Comparing the top and bottom of the scale, participants who reported never feeling meaning in life were at an approximately 75% increased risk of impairment compared to participants who reported often feeling meaning in life (HR=1.75, 95% confidence interval=1.19, 2.57; n=16,127). The relation was not moderated by any of the sociodemographic characteristics (p&gt;.05). It was similar when the sample was restricted to participants 65 years and older, when participants who became impaired within 5 years were excluded, when the sample was limited to participation in all SHARE waves, and when income was included as an additional covariate (SHARE provides income imputed in several ways; the results were the same regardless of which income imputation was included as a covariate). The association was also apparent across the four regions of Europe examined and in Israel (HR=1.47, 95% CI=1.23–1.77, p&lt;.01 (N=1,528, n=63 with cognitive impairment).

4.0 Discussion

The present research provides robust evidence that lower subjective feelings of meaning in life are associated with higher risk of cognitive impairment up to 9 years later. The association was significant across all of the sensitivity analyses and was consistent across age, sex, education, and marital status. The association was also apparent across regions of Europe and consistent with what has been found previously in the United States for purpose in life (Boyle et al., 2010; Sutin, Stephan, &amp; Terracciano, 2018). This pattern suggests that the effect is replicable and not dependent on a specific cultural context or a specific scale used to measure meaning/purpose.

Meaning in life has long been recognized as one component of subjective well-being (Ryff, 1995). Only recently, however, has its role in physical and cognitive health been addressed. Perceiving a meaningful life, for example, has been associated with lower morbidity and greater longevity (Krause, 2009). It may promote better health, including better cognitive health, through behavioral and clinical pathways (i.e., the mechanisms that link meaning to cognitive outcomes). Behavioral pathways are behaviors that individuals engage (or do not engage) in, and clinical pathways are through health-related conditions or biomarkers. Individuals who report higher meaning engage in more physical activity (Ju, 2017) and are less likely to have diabetes or high blood pressure (Czekierda et al., 2017) or suffer from depression (Disabato, Kashdan, Short, &amp; Jarden, 2017), which are risk factors for dementia (Norton, Matthews, Barnes, Yaffe, &amp; Brayne, 2014). There may be other pathways beyond these traditional mechanisms, such as through healthier interpersonal relationships (Krause, 2007) and engagement in more cognitively and socially demanding activities (Schmitter-Edgecombe, Lamb, McAlister, Vo, &amp; Robertson, 2019). In addition, meaning, defined as purpose, may promote resilience to Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology and protect against cognitive decline even in the presence of neuropathology (Boyle et al., 2012). That is, many people develop the neuropathology indicative of Alzheimer’s disease but do not show the clinical symptoms (i.e., their cognition remains intact). There is great interest in identifying factors that promote this resilience to neuropathology (Stern, Barnes, Grady, Jones, &amp; Raz, 2019; Terracciano et al., 2013); greater meaning/purpose may be one such factor.

The results of this study fit into a broader literature that demonstrates that meaning and purpose construed across different domains and levels of analysis are associated with better cognitive outcomes. Individuals, for example, who are higher in goal-oriented personality traits (e.g., Conscientiousness; Terracciano et al., 2014), who have close social connections (Sutin, Stephan, Luchetti, &amp; Terracciano, 2018), a complex job (Kroger et al., 2008), and volunteer in their communities (Infurna, Okun, &amp; Grimm, 2016) tend to have reduced dementia risk. This pattern suggests a meaningful and purpose-driven life, regardless of domain, supports cognitive health. One possibility that arises from this literature is the potential for meaning as a target of intervention for healthier cognitive aging. In fact, one pathway through which volunteerism may protect against dementia (Infurna et al., 2016) is through increasing feelings of purpose (one component of meaning). There may also be other ways to directly increase meaning and purpose. Indeed, experimental evidence indicates that meaning and purpose can be increased and is often a target of intervention for cancer survivors (Henry et al., 2010; Park et al., 2019). The next step is to test whether such interventions for purpose lead to better cognitive performance and healthier cognitive outcomes in older adulthood. An effective behavioral intervention that promotes healthier cognitive aging and protects against dementia would be of great value. Since meaning is defined by the individual, and the results of this study suggest that the association is similar in different regions of Europe, it may be expected that an intervention based on meaning would be able to be disseminated broadly across Europe. Such evidence would be of interest to policymakers and healthcare professionals to help reduce the prevalence and burden of dementia.

The present research had several strengths, including a large overall sample with participants from 14 countries and a relatively long follow-up period. There were, however, limitations in measurement of meaning in life and cognitive impairment. Single-item measures of meaning have been found to be valid (Oishi &amp; Diener, 2014), as have performance measures of cognitive impairment (Langa et al., 2017). Still, future research should use multi-item measures of meaning and a clinical diagnosis of dementia. It is of note that the association observed in this study is consistent with findings from research on purpose that used a clinical diagnosis of dementia (Boyle et al., 2010). It would also be useful to have a measure of meaning in life that assessed all three of its components (significance, coherence, purpose) to determine whether any one component is more or less predictive than the others. It would also be useful to test this association in other parts of the world. The current research indicates that the association between meaning in life and cognitive impairment is apparent across countries in Europe and Israel, which is consistent with the evidence for purpose in life found in the United States. Future research needs to be done in other parts of the world, particularly in lower income countries, to determine whether meaning has protective effects in other cultural contexts. Lower income countries also face a great burden of dementia (Feigin et al., 2019), and, similar to higher income countries, it would be worthwhile to evaluate whether meaning in life is a protective factor that could be leveraged as a target of intervention. Despite these limitations, the present study indicates a robust association between meaning in life and risk of cognitive impairment. Given its malleability (e.g., Henry et al., 2019; Park et al., 2019), meaning may be a useful intervention target to support healthier cognitive aging and reduce dementia risk.

Highlights

This prospective study included 22,514 participants from 14 countries

Lack of meaning in life is associated with risk of cognitive impairment over 9 years

This association was apparent across four regions of Europe

Education and wealth did not account for all of the association

Meaning in life may be a worthwhile intervention target for healthier cognitive aging

1 These components of meaning are sometimes considered distinct constructs that make up a meaningful life and are sometimes terms used interchangeably with meaning in life. Throughout this paper, we refer to overall judgments of meaning in life (also referred to as meaning) but also describe the relevant literature on purpose in life (also referred to as purpose).
