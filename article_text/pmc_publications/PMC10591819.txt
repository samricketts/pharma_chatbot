The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a critical role in determining the effectiveness of systemic treatments for brain diseases. Over the years, several innovative approaches in BBB opening and drug delivery have been developed and progressed into clinical testing phases, including focused ultrasound (FUS) with circulating microbubbles, mannitol-facilitated delivery of anti-neoplastic drugs, receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) by antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and viral vectors for gene therapy. We provided a comprehensive review of the most recent clinical applications of these approaches in managing brain tumors and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), two major devastating brain diseases. Moreover, the spatial-temporal molecular heterogeneity of the BBB under disease states emphasized the importance of utilizing emerging spatial systems biology approaches to unravel novel targets for intervention within BBB and tailor strategies for enhancing drug delivery to the brain.

pmc1. BBB heterogeneity in brain tumors and Alzheimer’s disease

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly regulated neurovascular unit. A multitude of specialized cells, including endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes, and astrocytes control this regulatory unit. The integrity of BBB is easily disrupted during primary brain tumor progression and the development of brain metastasis, named as blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB). However, the BBTB is highly heterogeneous between different tumor regions within one tumor such as primary glioblastoma, or metastatic lesions, or even across different subtypes of brain tumors or metastasis [1,2]. Emerging studies, including ours, demonstrated that metastatic tumor cells express specific cell-surface proteins that facilitate their extravasation and colonization into the brain parenchyma [3–7]. By using intravital two-photon microscopy imaging, we observed that tumor cells with overexpression of the protocadherin7 (PCDH7) protein, upon extravasating and colonizing in the mouse brain, promoted the leakage of dextran dye through the blood vessels, and induced remodeling of the vessels to be more tortuous and formed new loops or branches (Fig. 1) [3]. In addition, using patient-derived brain metastasis samples, we identified high expression of PCDH7 in mediating the interaction between astrocytes and tumor cells promoted in vivo tumor growth through activating PCDH7-PLCβ-S100A4 signaling [3]. There are many more similar proteins reported to mediate tumor interactions with astrocytes, ECs, and pericytes. How the cell-cell interactions contribute to the heterogeneous phenotypes of BBTB in different tumor types or tumors at different parenchymal locations warrants exploration.

In contrast to brain tumors, the breakdown of the BBB initiated by amyloid deposition in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is less heterogeneous [8]. However, the BBB breakdown in neurodegenerative regions of the brain is characterized by functional and structural changes in the blood vessels, including endothelial degeneration, reduced expression of tight and adherens junctions, increased endothelial bulk flow transcytosis, disrupted BBB transporter expression, pericyte degeneration, perivascular accumulation of toxic products, inflammation, and immune responses. These changes create significant barriers that hinder the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain [8]. New strategies that can selectively target affected brain regions while bypassing the BBB are needed to improve the efficacy of treatments for AD.

In this review, we focused on brain tumors and AD, and provided a comprehensive overview of the clinical advancements in BBB opening strategies and BBB drug delivery approaches that have been applied in these diseases. Moreover, the review emphasized the emerging spatial systems biology approaches in facilitating the discovery of novel targets or strategies in regulating the BBB penetrant for effective treatment of the diseases.

2. Therapeutic strategies in BBB opening and delivery

Over the past five decades, many innovative strategies have been applied to open or bypass the BBB for delivering drugs into the central nervous system (CNS). Most of them were in preclinical experimental settings and have been reviewed by other groups [2, 9–11]. Here, we highlight approaches that have recently been evaluated in clinical trials (Fig. 2).

2.1. Focused ultrasound (FUS)

FUS uses focused ultrasound waves to temporarily disrupt the BBB in a controlled and localized manner, allowing drugs or other therapeutic agents to cross into the brain [12]. FUS could be categorized into high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU). HIFU guided by magnetic resonance (MR) has been applied in neurosurgical tumor ablation through its precise targeted thermal lesion [13]. LIFU, together with microbubbles, has shown promising clinical application in BBB opening by its low-energy pulsed waves [14]. Acoustically, the wave intensity ranging from 0.125 to 3 W/cm2 is defined as LIFU [15]. Microbubble, which functions to concentrate LIFU wave power and reduce the exposure level, is composed of lipids, proteins, or polymers with gas as the ultrasound contrast agent. In the LIFU field, microbubble contraction and expansion could add pressure to the vessel wall [16], which, under optimal conditions (pressure, wavelength, type of microbubble, etc.), could safely disrupt tight junctions (TJs) and open the BBB temporarily for enhanced drug delivery. Recently, many FUS devices for BBB opening have entered clinical trials for safety and efficacy testing (Table 1).

Among the ongoing FUS clinical trials, the techniques employed can be categorized into three primary groups: implanted ultrasound devices, MR-guided FUS devices (MRgFUS), and neuronavigation-guided devices. In the case of implanted ultrasound devices, a surgical procedure is undertaken to implant an ultrasound disk in close proximity to the tumor or targeted region within the patient’s skull. Subsequently, an external unit, activated by a transdermal needle, is used to regulate the process of BBB opening [17]. This approach was initially explored in one of the earliest clinical trials involving patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Specifically, a first-in-human clinical trial (NCT03744026) employing the SonoCloud-9 unfocused ultrasound device with microbubbles (SonoVue) was completed in June 2022 [18]. This phase I/IIa clinical trial confirmed the safety of reproducible BBB opening and an enhanced quality of BBB disruption at a dose of 1.1 MPa in the brain. In addition, it quantified that an acoustic pressure equal to or higher than 0.8 MPa showed stable and significant BBB opening compared to lower dosages [18]. This team conducted a follow-up trial (NCT02253212), where they designed a semiautomatic algorithm for the evaluation of significant ultrasound-induced signal enhancement (SUISE) using Gd-enhanced MR images acquired before and after ultrasound treatments. The team observed an increase in the median overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with successful BBB opening, compared to no or poor BBB opening patients [19]. They also confirmed a correlation between SUISE and local pressure in the brain (R2 = 0.98) [20].

Compared to the invasive implanted technique, MRgFUS and neuronavigation guided devices represent non-invasive methods that eliminate the need for device insertion. Both techniques have gained significant attention and have devices available on the market that are under clinical trials. In contrast to MRgFUS, which commonly employs real-time MRI for guiding BBB opening procedures, neuronavigation guided devices rely on scanned MRI images to locate the targeted area [21]. While preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated the significance of neuronavigation guidance devices [22,23], the results of clinical trials employing this method (NCT03626896, NCT04804709, NCT05762419) have not yet been released [24]. MRgFUS is employed in most ongoing clinical trials focused on BBB opening and offers the highest level of precision among the three categories [25]. The first-in-human phase I MRgFUS trial has been completed on five patients with early AD (NCT02986932) and confirmed the safety of MRgFUS for repeated and reversible BBB opening, which enabled future studies to further test the efficacy of drug delivery [26]. The safety of MRgFUS was also validated by another trial (NCT03321487) on the ExAblate ultrasound device when treating patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [27]. Furthermore, the efficacy of BBB opening was confirmed in a phase IIa trial (NCT03739905), in which a statistically significant increment of circulating biomarkers (plasma cfDNA, neuron-derived extracellular vesicles, and brain-specific protein S100b) in the brain was examined after BBB opening with the ExAblate instrument [28]. Currently, BBB opening with the ExAblate FUS device has entered a phase III randomized clinical trial (NCT05317858) on non-small cell lung cancer brain metastasis with pembrolizumab treatment [29] to evaluate the overall treatment effect, survival, and life quality.

FUS provides a promising method to non-invasively open the BBB and precisely target the brain tumor with MRI guidance. However, several concerns should be addressed to achieve its clinical potential. Using non-standard parameters in FUS instrumentations and evaluations is one concern [30]. Asquier et al. proposed an algorithm to estimate the degree of BBB opening [20], which could promote the standardization of this protocol. Besides standardizing the degree of BBB opening, the treatment process should be further regularized in terms of the dose and timing of microbubble injection. FUS would also cause inflammatory response, which could negatively impact the treatment effect and, at worst, cause damage to the neurovascular unit. Studies showed local neuroinflammation occurred one hour after BBB opening, and the intensity of response was positively related to the dose of microbubbles [31]. Moreover, while numerous studies have focused on the application of microbubbles as clinical contrast agents, an evident gap exists concerning the extended and consequential impacts of microbubbles following the disruption of the BBB through FUS. Lastly, there could still be a loss of BBB function adjacent to the opening point, creating a potential for other pathogens to enter the cerebral space. Such risk should be evaluated in future studies. Identification and optimization of drugs in combination with FUS and microbubbles is a critical next step for evaluating their therapeutic efficacy. Integration of quantitative imaging, correlative molecular analysis, and mathematical modeling would help realize this goal.

2.2. Mannitol-facilitated delivery of anti-neoplastic drugs

The BBB is highly selective towards its permeability; for example, the delivery of therapeutic antibodies into CNS is only 0.01–0.1% of the plasma concentration [32]. In the 1970 s, Rapoport et al. pioneered the use of hyperosmolar mannitol through intra-arterial (IA) injection to osmotically open the BBB. The technique induced elevated intravascular osmotic pressure, resulting in the decomposition of the TJs, and this stretch leads to larger gaps in BBB, which enables a higher BBB permeability [33]. The efficacy of mannitol has been validated. In a study on canines by Neuwelt, et al., mannitol-facilitated IA injection of the chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate showed a 100-fold increase in its delivery into CNS. Until now, mannitol was still the top choice in BBB opening and intensively tested in clinical trials.

Super-selective intra-arterial cerebral infusion (SIACI) of chemotherapeutic drugs has become the predominant treatment strategy under clinical testing for opening the BBB with mannitol. Boockvar’s team contributed to most of the trials, with a focus on bevacizumab (BV) and cetuximab. Chakraborty et al. conducted a phase I clinical trial (NCT01238237) on patients with recurrent GBM to test the maximum tolerated dose of cetuximab after opening the BBB with mannitol, then a phase II clinical trial (NCT02800486) to further test the efficacy of mannitol-cetuximab with hypo-fractionated radiation on recurrent GBM. Besides the application to recurrent GBM, this team designed two trials (NCT02861898, NCT01811498) for newly diagnosed GBM. They tested the safety and efficacy in a phase I/II clinical trial (NCT01811498) with three doses of mannitol-BV followed by 6 weeks of standard chemoradiation [34]. The studies demonstrated the safety of repeated use of mannitol-BV and showed encouraging results in prolonging progression-free survival and overall survival in GBM patients. In addition, they conducted a phase I trial (NCT01884740) for children (&lt;22 years old) with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma and high-grade glioma receiving one dose of BV and cetuximab followed by BBB opening with mannitol [35]. No acute toxicities were found in all thirteen patients. Of the ten symptomatic patients, 6 exhibited subjective improvement while 92% showed decreased tumor enhancement on the first day after treatment using MRI.

Overall, the safety and efficacy of BBB opening with mannitol are confirmed in clinical settings. The short-term safety of delivered chemotherapeutic drugs followed by mannitol has also been confirmed in several trials. However, due to the limited number of participants and the absence of phase III trials, although individual improvements were reported, the statistical significance of the combination treatment (mannitol + chemotherapeutic drug) has not yet been verified. Some studies also reported that BBB opening with mannitol was unstable since no standard dosing limit or injection rate exists, and this opening lacks selectivity both for the site of the opening and for the substance that could bypass after opening [33]. Furthermore, the inherent toxicity of mannitol introduces an element of instability to its effects. Preclinical investigations have revealed that administering high doses of mannitol and subjecting patients to repeated treatments may result in its buildup within the cerebral region [36,37]. This accumulation, in turn, has the potential to induce a range of adverse consequences, including vascular damage from the crystallization of residual substances, exacerbation of cerebral edema, precipitation of cardiac failure, and other associated dysfunctions [9,37].

Recent pre-clinical studies on mouse models showed improved consistency achieved by mannitol injection under MR imaging guidance [38]. Comprehensive studies towards a standard mannitol BBB opening procedure, especially dose usage, should be emphasized in future clinical trials. Furthermore, mannitol could induce a sterile inflammatory response [39]. This side effect should be monitored and could potentially be utilized in neuroimmunomodulation [39].

2.3. Receptor-mediated transcytosis of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)

Transporting macromolecules into the CNS requires specific passages, such as the insulin receptor and transferrin receptor as they express at a high level at the BBB and mediate insulin or iron delivery to the brain. Research has highlighted the potential to use these receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) of ADCs for non-invasive drug delivery [11,32]. RMT entails several steps that are initiated by ligand-receptor binding and endocytosis and then guided by intracellular trafficking and vesicle fusion to arrive at the targeted location [32,40]. In clinical trials, the most common targets including transferrin receptor, insulin receptor, and members of low-density lipoprotein receptor related proteins (LRP).

RMT through the LRP family has been applied in treating brain metastatic tumors. The receptor, especially low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, is highly expressed on the surface of BBB cells, and pre-clinical research showed peptide angiopep 2 as a key facilitator in this transcytosis [32]. ANG1005 is a drug conjugate composed of angiopep 2 and paclitaxel. Kurzrock et al. tested its safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in a phase II clinical trial (NCT02048059). The study involved 56 patients, who exhibited good drug tolerance, with patient benefits seen in 77% of participants [41,42]. A prolonged median overall survival (8.0 months) was also reported compared to the 4.6 months with high-dose methotrexate and the 7.3 months with pemetrexed treatment [42]. Interestingly, as a peptide-based drug conjugate, there was no evidence of antibody generation after the therapy, showing potential for repeated treatment in future studies [41]. However, the preset exclusion criteria had been changed in this study, which involved 28 patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis [42]. Although the results from this subset of patients showed the most significant benefit, due to the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria for this group, its evaluation was done by using a self-defined criterion [42]. Presently, this team has launched a phase III clinical trial (NCT03613181) to evaluate the efficacy of ANG1005 in a larger cohort.

In contrast to FUS and mannitol, both induce generalized and temporary disruption in the BBB structure, RMT offers a non-invasive and exceptionally selective avenue for facilitating drug transport across the BBB [43]. It relies on the interaction between drug-loaded particles and specific receptors on endothelial cells. This can result in higher precision in drug delivery. RMT has the potential to be safer and more precise, as it leverages natural cellular transport mechanisms. FUS and mannitol, on the other hand, involve more direct mechanical or osmotic disruption, which might lead to unintended effects or damage. However, RMT might face challenges related to designing appropriate drug carriers that can effectively target specific receptors and navigate the complex cellular environment. There are approved drugs like aducanumab and lecanemab, along with ongoing clinical trials investigating antibody-based medications targeting amyloid beta and tau proteins for addressing AD [44]. These drugs aim to prevent the buildup of these proteins and slow the progression of the disease, and their efficacy might be increased with optimized RMT-based delivery.

Since a substantial proportion of RMT-associated medications are constructed using antibody-based conjugates, while one trial has reported no adverse reactions linked directly to antibodies [45], it is imperative to acknowledge that antibody drugs have been implicated in triggering cerebral hemorrhaging and swelling, particularly concerning anti-amyloid beta antibody drugs [46,47]. This warrants a meticulous exploration through further clinical investigations. Moreover, the selection of treatments must be accorded to the variance in receptor expression levels and binding capacities for ADCs across different medical conditions, thereby necessitating a judicious assessment in the choice of RMT pathway and ADC for therapeutic intervention.

2.4. Viral vectors with gene therapy

Gene therapy carried by the viral vector is a non-invasive method to penetrate the BBB for targeted treatment in order to achieve an efficient transduction rate of the viral vector. Besides not being limited by the BBB penetrance, viral vectors could benefit the treatment through gene editing, including gene silencing and gene replacement, to precisely control the treatment effect [48]. We described here the clinical trials of two major viral vector categories in brain tumors.

2.4.1. Adenoviruses (Ad)

Ad vectors are one of the most widely tested viral vectors because of their high transfection efficiency, long viral longevity, and potential for mass production [48,49]. Most methods insert transgenes by editing the five early regions (E1A, E1B, E2, E3, E4) on the human Ad genome [50]. Ad vector is employed in treating brain cancers due to its high tumor selectivity [51]. A recent report from a phase II clinical trial (NCT02798406) for GBM justified the safety of Ad vector DNX-2401 (recombinant serotype 5 strain Ad) with pembrolizumab with an encouraging clinical outcome [52,53]. This ongoing study will monitor tumor control and survival. Another phase I trial (NCT03714334) is testing the safety, overall response, and overall survival of DNX-2440, an immunomodulatory recombinant Ad vector that could induce T-cell responses in recurrent GBM.

Gene delivery of nerve growth factor (NGF) using adeno-associated viral vector (serotype 2) (AAV2-NGF), in a dose-escalating phase 1 clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate AD, demonstrated the long-term safety [54]. However, in a subsequent randomized phase II placebo-controlled (sham surgery) 24-month study (n = 49) (NCT00876863), AAV2-NGF therapy did not affect clinical outcomes evaluated by the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–cognitive subscale [55]. Despite this early failure, there are numerous additional applications in the gene-therapy pipeline for AD.

2.4.2. Lentivirus-based vectors

Lentivirus is a special type of retrovirus with the unique ability to integrate into slow-proliferating cells’ genomes, such as stem cells. Most current clinical-grade lentivirus-based vectors originated from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [56]. Although there is no current clinical studies using lentivirus in AD treatment, in the phase I/II trial (NCT00627588), the lentivirus-based vector ProSavin was developed from transfection to treat Parkinson’s disease. Evaluating the treatment effect with the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), statistically significant improvement in the mean score was confirmed in both 6-month and 12-month data with tolerable adverse effects. Another phase III trial for treating cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (NCT03852498) is ongoing using Lenti-D lentiviral vector transduced hematopoietic. No results have been made publicly available yet.

Although viral and non-viral vectors could effectively cross the BBB and keep the BBB intact, toxicity remains a challenge. For viral vectors, although they are supposed to have a deficient replication function, there could be gene mutations within these vectors, which can lead to danger, especially for HIV-originated lentivirus-based vectors. For non-viral vector liposomes, studies indicated they could induce hepatotoxicity by raising the level of liver enzymes [57]. Additionally, because both types of vectors could directly target the disease area, the instability of the tumor genome could cause less efficient transduction in targeted cells. In the worst scenario, inaccurate targeting could lead to apoptosis in normal cells [53]. Lastly, besides pharmacology challenges, the safety and feasibility of mass production should be considered in its application.

3. Systems biology approaches to delineate the BBB

Regardless of the ongoing clinical efforts in applying the aforementioned BBB opening and delivery approaches to treat brain tumors and AD, new brain targeting approaches are urgently needed. For AD, almost 300 experimental drugs have been tested in more than 1000 clinical trials over the past 10 years, while 99.6% of these trials failed, in part because the drugs could not reach their optimal concentration in the brain. Even in breast cancer, one-third of patients treated with Herceptin die due to brain metastases that are inaccessible to the drug. The intricate multicellular composition and complex molecular signaling networks within the BBB and BBTB perfectly fit the scope of systems biology investigation to identify specific targets for intervention and tailor treatments to individual patients’ needs. Systems biology is an interdisciplinary approach that aims to understand complex biological systems by considering the interactions among various components, such as genes, proteins, cells, and signaling pathways. Applying systems biology principles and methods such as network analysis, molecular profiling, spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, integrative modeling, single-cell (sc) sequencing, and cell-cell communication modeling, hold the highest potential to discover novel targets and strategies for effective BBB and BBTB drug delivery. The Harvard Wyss Institute’s brain targeting program initiative focuses on using novel systems proteomics and transcriptomics techniques to identify specific proteins that are highly expressed on the BBB endothelial cell surface and are unique to the BBB compared to other organs. These proteins are being evaluated for their potential to transport therapeutic cargoes across the BBB, potentially leading to improved drug delivery to the brain (https://wyss.harvard.edu/collaboration/brain-targeting-program/).

Munji et al. [58], performed an RNA sequencing analysis of enriched ECs in different neurological disease models that display BBB dysfunction. They found that the ECs exhibit strikingly similar gene expression changes during BBB disruption in different models and identified a core BBB-dysfunction gene signature that shifts the CNS ECs into a peripheral endothelial cell-like state. Orsenigo et al. [59] combined scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and RNAscope techniques to investigate changes in ECs’ functions in the cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) model. The authors identified four EC subpopulations with altered BBB properties in the mouse model with deletion of Pdcd10 (Ccm3), a hallmark gene for CCM. These results suggest that identifying therapeutic agents to limit the BBB dysfunction may provide benefits for controlling CNS diseases.

Spatial transcriptomic and proteomics platforms can provide molecular profiling of the BBB in primary and metastatic brain tumors [60] and neurodegenerative diseases [61]. Further computational modeling for region-specific cell-cell-communication and signaling pathway prediction [62] would facilitate the identification of potential targetable strategies for opening or stabilizing the BBB for drug delivery. Zhang et al. applied the Nanostring GeoMX to study brain metastasis-associated astrocytes in non-small cell lung cancer patients [60]. Compared to the normal astrocytes, the study found the reprogramming of the reactive astrocytes to an “immature” state, confers a compromised physiological function. The “immature” astrocyte population was clustered into three subgroups associated with different fibrous states in the brain metastasis microenvironment. The fibrosis-high subgroup correlated with a poorer clinical outcome as therapeutic agents are assumed to be hindered in the metastatic lesions [60]. Batiuk et al. utilized scRNA-seq and multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization to study the heterogeneity of astrocytes in adult mice brain [63]. The authors were able to visualize spatial localizations of five different astrocyte subtypes with distinct physiological properties, measured by their Ca2+ transient signaling [63]. Reactive astrogliosis is a response of astrocytes to insults such as neuroinflammation, brain injury, and ischemia, and is commonly observed in many brain disorders associated with BBB disruption. Reactive astrogliosis with an elevation in intracellular Ca2+ levels at the astrocyte endfeet are commonly found during BBB disruption in many brain disorders to modulate cerebral blood flow, protein transporter polarization, and the secretion of chemokines, growth factors, and neurotrophins. The structural and functional changes of BBB hinder the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain [8], thus studies identifying molecular targets in diseased astrocytes may open up prospects for drug repurposing by restoring or stabilizing the BBB to enable drug delivery.

Other BBB cell types were also investigated through emerging multi-omics technologies. A recent single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) study of 80,000 nuclei in temporal cortex tissue of AD and age-matched control brains identified three distinct vascular clusters featuring activated pericytes, endothelia cells, and resting pericytes [64]. The activated pericyte cluster genes are enriched for hormone receptor binding processes, which also showed differential expression between males and females. The endothelial cluster consists of both vascular damage-associated genes and angiogenesis-related genes, of which ANGPT2 is the most significantly upregulated differentially expressed gene [64]. Another independent scRNA-seq analysis of mouse BBB concordantly revealed the important role of ANGPT2 in the development and maintenance of the tight junctions’ integrity during pericyte deficiency [65]. Similarly, the Nichenet database [66], another cell-cell interaction modeling tool, predicted strong astrocytic ligands interactions between activated pericytes and endothelial clusters, such as SMAD3 and STAT3. These findings not only uncovered new pericyte-astrocyte-endothelial interactions that may lead to a breakdown of the BBB and influence the propagation of AD neuropathology but also brought up potential targeting strategies to regulate the BBB for better treatment efficacy.

Though still in their early phases, systems biology approaches may provide an unbiased, quantitative framework for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of BBB and BBTB by combining, analyzing, and modeling substantial amounts of omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc) gathered during brain disorder diagnoses and progression. This holistic approach can provde a more complete picture of the barriers’ behavior and response to different treatments, allowing for identification of specific molecular signatures associated with disease or treatment response, providing insights into potential outcomes before actual treatment are administered, and leading to the development of more effective drugs that can penetrate the BBB and BBTB (Fig. 3).

4. Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we systematically reviewed the most recent clinical progress of various BBB opening modalities, namely, the combination of FUS and circulating microbubbles, mannitol-facilitated delivery of antineoplastic drugs, RMT by ADCs, and viral/non-viral vector-based gene therapy (Table 2) in treating brain diseases, notably brain tumor and AD. The number of clinical trials conducted using these modalities has declined in recent years, except for clinical trials using the FUS-drug combination approach as it shows more promising efficacy (Fig. 4). Most of these clinical trials have small patient cohorts and thus lack the statistical power to conclude, indicating the ongoing need to investigate these strategies. Emerging systems biology approaches are providing new insights into the regulation of the BBB and BBTB and identifying new targets for drug delivery to the brain. We pinpointed systems biology insights into molecular profiling, network analysis, and computational modeling to unravel the spatial heterogeneity and cell-cell communication complexity of the BBB in a more holistic manner, facilitating the identification of alternate effective treatment strategies.

For prospects, by combining FUS with existing drug regimens, researchers hope to enhance the delivery of therapeutic agents to specific brain regions, thereby improving treatment outcomes for brain diseases. However, the optimal strategies for combining FUS with specific drug regimens have yet to be established. Each brain disease has unique characteristics and requirements. There is no standardized approach for determining the appropriate combination of FUS and drug therapy for individual patients. To develop effective drug-device combinations using FUS, comprehensive investigations are necessary to determine the safety profiles, optimal parameters, and timing of drug administration in relation to FUS treatment. This requires careful evaluation of the specific brain disease being targeted, the characteristics of the drug being delivered, and the potential interactions between FUS and the drug.

Beyond further enrichment of the FUS approach by combining drug regimens, it would be beneficial to administer drugs that can effectively cross the BBB without the need for a device or surgical intervention. Exploring alternative targets and pathways that offer increased selectivity for the brain could potentially enhance drug delivery while minimizing off-target effects in other body organs. To achieve this goal, it is essential to continue exploring and expanding our understanding of the intricate molecular mechanisms involved in the BBB crossing and targeted drug delivery to the brain. Gaining this knowledge can help pave the way for the development of novel, effective therapies for CNS diseases.

Normal intact BBB is composed of ECs and TJs covered by astrocyte endfeet and pericytes. The structure provides a strong barrier that could block large molecules including therapeutic drugs. B. BBB opening and TJ disruption by FUS facilitated with vibrating microbubbles. C. Viral vectors-carried gene therapy through the BBB. Due to the small size of the viral vectors, they can directly cross BBB and release the transduced therapeutic gene into targeted cells. D. Gene therapy carried by non-viral vectors. Benefiting from their bilayer structure, this type of vector could interact with ECs and then pass through the BBB to deliver drugs into CNS. E. Mannitol could disrupt BBB by breaking TJs, allowing antineoplastic drugs to enter the CNS. F. Receptor-mediated transcytosis delivery is usually composed of antibody-drug conjugates, endocytosis is initiated by receptor binding, e.g., transferrin receptor (TfR).

Fig. 3. An illustration of the emerging multi-omics approaches for enabling systemic understanding of BBB and BBTB. A. RNA sequencing technique to study changes in gene expression profiles in endothelial dysfunction models such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and seizure. Deletion of Pdcd10, one of the hallmark genes for cerebral cavernous malformations model, was investigated using RNA sequencing technique. B. Multiplexed fluorescence in-situ hybridization technique to visualize RNA expression changes. C. Spatial transcriptomic techniques to visualize gene expression changes in different locations of brain to differentiate reactive astrocytes and investigate astrocyte heterogeneity. D. Single cell RNA sequencing technique to study RNA expression changes in single cell population. In the context of metastatic brain tumor, CNS-myeloid cells showed Cx3cr1 downregulation and enhanced recruitment with Cxcl10 upregulation. E. Cell-cell communication models (such as CCCExplorer, CellPhoneDB, etc.) to identify molecular targets and repurpose drugs. Afatinib suppressed proinflammatory astrocytes and could be a novel therapeutic strategy for multiple sclerosis. Figure created with BioRender.com.

Table 1 Summary of the clinically tested FUS devices for BBB opening [67,68].

Methods	Commercial Device	Treatment Time	Advantages	Disadvantages	Clinical Trials	
MR-Guided FUS	Exablate	2–4 h	Repeatable; Real time guidance with an intraoperative MRI; Incision free; Precision targeting with maximum 1024 ultrasound waves delivered by transducer array	High MR compatibility requirements of the whole system because the treatment needs to be performed in a MR suite	NCT04440358, NCT04417088, NCT03322813, NCT04728295, NCT04667715, NCT05630209, NCT03935581, NCT05317858, NCT03671889, NCT05469009, NCT03714243, NCT05383872, NCT03551249, NCT05879120, NCT03739905, NCT03616860, NCT04370665, NCT02986932, NCT05733312, NCT03321487	
Neuronavigation	NaviFUS	30 mins	Repeatable; Incision free; Relatively simple setting because this approach could utilize commercially approved neuronavigational systems	The system could be inaccurate because its neuronavigation comes from projection of beams instead of real beam deposition.	NCT04118764, NCT03626896, NCT03860298, NCT05947656, NCT04999046, NCT04446416, NCT04988750	
Implanted Ultrasound Device	SonoCloud	4 mins	Repeatable, Large, transient, and direct BBB opening	The implanted fixed ultrasound disk could limit the accuracy of targeting and induce other side effects	NCT04528680, NCT03744026, NCT04614493, NCT04021420, NCT03119961, NCT05293197	

Table 2 Comparison of the four BBB opening and delivery approaches in this review.

Methods	Advantages	Disadvantages	Notes	
FUS with microbubble	Precise targeting; non-invasive (partially open/damage BBB, but no craniotomy); repeatable and safer compared to thermoablation; transient and direct BBBO	Lack standardized evaluation for BBBO; lack the control of side effects from microbubble and ultrasound	FUS with microbubble is a relativity newly developed technique and has the largest number of ongoing clinical trials since 2019.	
Mannitol facilitated delivery of antineoplastic drugs	Induce BBBO by osmotic pressure; the efficacy of BBBO by mannitol has been confirmed and already being used in clinical settings.	The efficacy of the combination of mannitol and neoplastic are still being tested; toxicity of mannitol, especially when being used repeatedly; lack of selectivity	Mannitol related treatment has been studied most before 2010, and the number of clinical trials about it are declining after 2010. There are no new clinicals since 2016.	
RMT by ADCs	Non-invasive; Exceptionally selective; Potential to incorporate ADCs	Immune reaction towards ADCs; variance in expressional level leads to unstable outcome	RMT by ADCs starts to develop quickly since 2013. It stays popular with a slight decline since 2019.	
Viral/non-viral vector-based gene therapy	Effectively cross the BBB and keep the BBB intact; gene editing has the potential for longer treatment effects	Toxicity of viral vectors; gene editing could induce instability in both tumor area and normal tissue and lead to uncontrollable effects	Viral/non-viral vectors are popular before 2010 and stay popular till now.
