Background:

Studies suggest associations between long-term ambient air pollution exposure and outcomes related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Whether a link exists between pollutants and brain amyloid accumulation, a biomarker of AD, is unclear. We assessed whether long-term air pollutant exposures are associated with late-life brain amyloid deposition in Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study participants.

Methods:

We used a chemical transport model with data fusion to estimate ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and its components, NO2, NOx, O3 (24-hour and 8-hour), CO, and airborne trace metals. We linked concentrations to geocoded participant addresses and calculated 10-year mean exposures (2002 to 2011). Brain amyloid deposition was measured using florbetapir amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans in 346 participants without dementia in 2012-2014, and we defined amyloid positivity as a global cortical standardized uptake value ratio ≥ the sample median of 1.2. We used logistic regression models to quantify the association between amyloid positivity and each air pollutant, adjusting for putative confounders. In sensitivity analyses, we considered whether use of alternate air pollution estimation approaches impacted findings for PM2.5, NO2, NOx, and 24-hour O3.

Results:

At PET imaging, eligible participants (N = 318) had a mean age of 78 years, 56% were female, 43% were Black, and 27% had mild cognitive impairment. We did not find evidence of associations between long-term exposure to any pollutant and brain amyloid positivity in adjusted models. Findings were materially unchanged in sensitivity analyses using alternate air pollution estimation approaches for PM2.5, NO2, NOx, and 24-hour O3.

Conclusions:

Air pollution may impact cognition and dementia independent of amyloid accumulation, though whether air pollution influences AD pathogenesis later in the disease course or at higher exposure levels deserves further consideration.

Graphical Abstract


pmc1. Introduction

Identifying modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains a top priority for dementia-related research, as the failure rate for clinical trials of AD treatments remains staggeringly high 1. Specifically, assessing the potential impact of environmental exposures on AD risk has important implications for primary prevention efforts since many are regulated at the population level. Recent growth in the literature linking long-term, ambient air pollution to AD-related outcomes has been dramatic.2 While the evidence remains mixed, multiple studies have reported associations between criteria air pollutants and cognitive decline 3-5, incident dementia 6,7, progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia 8, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measures of brain morphology.9-12

The mechanisms underlying such associations remain unclear. However, the beta-amyloid plaques that characterize AD may form in response to inflammation 13 and/or oxidative stress 14, suggesting a potential mechanism linking air pollution to AD. Animal studies show that concentrated air pollution exposure and some heavy metal components of particulate matter stimulate accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 15,16 and induce oxidative stress in the brain 17. Likewise, particulate matter increases cerebral pro-inflammatory cytokines 17,18 and promotes vascular inflammation 19. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that concentrated air pollution exposure increases cerebral AB42 and AB40 (the primary components of amyloid plaques)17,20, the AB42:40 ratio 21, and amyloid plaque accumulation in rodents 21,22. Additionally, several studies report increases in oxidative stress, inflammation, and cerebral AB42 among dogs and humans living in Mexico City 23-25, where average air pollution concentrations exceed US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air quality standards.

Findings from studies examining associations between ambient air pollution exposure and brain amyloid deposition in humans 26-29 have been inconsistent, with limited consideration of criteria air pollutants other than fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Moreover, particulate matter itself is a heterogeneous mixture of components including sulfates, nitrates, organic and elemental carbon, ammonium, and trace metals that may have different toxicity and impact on AD risk. To our knowledge, no study thus far has considered whether PM2.5 components are associated with human brain amyloid deposition. Finally, existing epidemiologic studies of air pollution and brain amyloid deposition may not generalize to the broader US population because they have either enrolled persons who are already presenting with cognitive impairment 26 or those with AD predisposition 27, or are conducted in areas with ambient air pollution exposures well above those in the US 28. To address these gaps, we estimated the association between long-term exposure to criteria air pollutants, components of PM2.5, and airborne trace metals with late-life brain amyloid deposition in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study cohort.

2. Methods

2a. Sample

The ARIC study recruited 15,792 participants from four US communities: Minneapolis suburbs, MN; Jackson, MS; Forsyth County, NC; and Washington County, MD. All participants were aged 45-64 years at recruitment, and all those recruited in MS were Black. The first four clinical visits took place roughly every three years (visit 1, 1987-1989; visit 2, 1990-1992; visit 3, 1993-1995; visit 4, 1996-1998). During visit 5 (2011-2013), participants with a prior ARIC brain MRI scan or evidence of cognitive impairment or decline and an age-stratified sample of those with normal cognition were invited to complete brain MRIs. A subset of those who completed MRIs at three ARIC study centers (MS, NC, and MD) and did not have dementia, heavy current alcohol use, renal dysfunction, or heart rate-corrected QT interval prolongation were invited for florbetapir (amyloid) positron emission tomography (PET) scans as part of the ARIC-PET ancillary study. Ultimately, 346 ARIC participants underwent amyloid-PET scans in 2012-2014. Study procedures were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of each study center. All ARIC participants provided written informed consent.

After excluding participants who were not White in MD or NC (due to small numbers in other race categories at these study centers, N = 8), who were missing exposure (N = 8) or covariate data (N = 10), and who did not consent to use of genetic data (N = 1), as well as one participant who was retroactively diagnosed with dementia at the time of PET scan, our final analytic sample included 318 participants.

2b. Exposure

We considered 10-year exposure to criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide [NO2], oxides of nitrogen [NOx], 24-hour ozone [O3], 8-hour O3, and carbon monoxide [CO]), components of fine particulate matter (sulfates [SO4], ammonium [NH4], nitrates [NO3], elemental carbon [EC], and organic carbon [OC]), and airborne trace metals with prior evidence of toxicity and acceptable estimation model performance (copper [Cu], iron [Fe], mercury [Hg], nickel [Ni], lead [Pb], vanadium [V], and zinc [Zn]).

We used a chemical transport model with observational data fusion to predict annual average pollutant concentrations in nested 1.33-, 4-, and 12-km gridded rasters approximately centered on ARIC recruitment sites. We derived two separate set of exposure predictions (CMAQ-NEI and CMAQ-EDGAR) 30 for each gridded raster. Both sets were derived using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) chemical transport model, incorporating data on emissions, biogenic emissions, and weather. The two sets of predictions differed only based on which emissions inventory was used in the process, either the National Emissions Inventory [NEI] or the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research [EDGAR]). After exploratory analyses suggested minimal impact on accuracy of annual estimates, simulations were run for only four representative months (January, April, July, and October) of each year, in order to reduce computation time. For each representative month, hourly predictions from each month were aggregated to obtain monthly predictions, and then averaged again to obtain annual predictions for each calendar year. We then weighted the two sets of annual predictions (CMAQ-NEI and CMAQ-EDGAR) to maximize agreement with annual air pollution concentrations measured at US EPA regulatory monitors. Finally, each weighted average annual prediction was fused with observational data to further mitigate any systematic bias in model predictions 31,32.

We conducted validation exercises using leave-one-out cross-validation to assess model accuracy. Specifically, we used data on annual average air pollution exposures at EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) monitor sites within the spatial domains covered by the 1.33-, 4-, and 12-km gridded rasters as availale for all pollutants except trace metals. Model performance for estimated annual PM2.5 levels from 2000 to 2012 was strong (R2 for 1.33-, 4-, and 12-km grid cells of 0.82, 0.77, and 0.78, respectively). Cross-validated R2 values for annual exposure to ammonium (0.97 for 1.33-km, 0.91 for 4-km, and 0.77 for 12-km grid cells), sulfates (0.98 for 1.33-km, 0.96 for 4-km, and 0.89 for 12-km grid cells), and nitrates (0.97 for 1.33-km, 0.85 for 4-km, and 0.84 for 12-km grid cells) were similarly high. Agreement was generally fair to moderate for gaseous pollutants (R2 for NO2, NOx, and CO in 1.33-km grid cells of 0.37, 0.46, and 0.66, respectively, and R2 for 24-hour and 8-hour O3 in 4-km grid cells of 0.53 and 0.39, respectively), elemental carbon (R2 range across raster resolutions, as available: 0.19 to 0.63), and organic carbon (R2 range across raster resolutions: 0.32 to 0.51). Cross-validation procedures for trace metals in 12-km rasters were conducted among monitoring stations containing at least 12 pairs of prediction-observations after setting both predicted and observed annual averages at or below the minimum detectable limit (MDL) to the MDL value. Trace metal cross-validation R2 values were as follows: Cu, 0.71; Fe, 0.68; Hg; 0.88; Ni, 0.50; Pb, 0.86; V, 0.76; and Zn, 0.80.

Participant addresses collected at each ARIC visit and during annual telephone interviews were standardized to US postal service formats and geocoded by a commercial vendor with excellent accuracy 33,34. Geocoded participant address coordinates were then joined to grid cell-specific exposures whenever the geocoded addresses fell within the spatial domains for which 1.33-, 4-, or 12-km gridded estimates were created. Participant exposures were assigned based on the finest spatial resolution of air pollutant data available for participant residential addresses. To account for residential mobility, participant exposures were weighted by the amount of time spent at each recorded residential address within a given calendar year. Because amyloid plaque accumulates long before the onset of dementia symptoms 35, we averaged participant-specific air pollutant concentrations over ten years (from 2002 to 2011).

2c. Outcome

Brain amyloid deposition was measured with florbetapir PET scans. Detailed methods have been previously described 36. 3T MRI scans were conducted at ARIC study centers from 2011 to 2013. PET scans were conducted within one year of MRIs (from 2012 to 2014). Participants were injected with florbetapir isotope and underwent four 5-minute scans. The Johns Hopkins University PET image analysis center processed the data and calculated standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) in 34 manually drawn regions of interest using cerebellum gray matter as the reference. Global amyloid deposition was calculated as a weighted average of SUVRs in orbitofrontal, prefrontal, and superior frontal cortices; the lateral temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes; the precuneus; the anterior cingulate; and the posterior cingulate. Because global SUVR is heavily skewed, previous analyses in the ARIC-PET cohort have considered those with a global SUVR above the median of 1.2 to have elevated brain amyloid deposition 36,37. Given this prior work, and the use of multiple different cutoffs to historically define amyloid positivity in the literature 38, we also use this cutoff to define amyloid positivity.

2d. Covariates

We used self-reported data to characterize age at the time of PET scan, sex, and education (less than high school, high school or equivalent, greater than high school). We collapsed race and study center to derive a race-center variable (Black in MS, White in NC, and White in MD). Procedures for adjudicating cognitive status in ARIC have been previously described 39; briefly, participants were administered the Delayed Word Recall Test 40, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test 41, and the Word Fluency Test 42 at ARIC visits 2, 4, and 5, and an additional cognitive testing battery (including the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] 43, the Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] scale 44, and the Functional Activities Questionnaire [FAQ] 45) at visit 5. Mild cognitive impairment was adjudicated if a participant had low scores in any one cognitive domain, evidence of cognitive decline, an FAQ score less than 6, and a CDR score between 0.5 and 3 39. Diagnoses were confirmed by expert consensus. We identified those with at least one APOE e4 allele via genotyping.

We used measures from visit 4 (1996-1998), the closest visit preceding our air pollution exposure period of interest, to characterize potential confounders. Smoking and alcohol consumption were self-reported and categorized as current, former, or never. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as participants’ weight in kilograms divided by their squared height in meters. Hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease status were defined using medication data, hospital surveillance, measured blood pressure or blood glucose levels (where applicable), and self-reported medical histories. Finally, we operationalized neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) using census tract-level measures of log of median household income; log of median housing value; percent of households earning interest, dividends, or net rental income; proportion of adults with high school degrees; proportion of adults with college degrees; and proportion of adults in executive, managerial, or professional occupations 46. Z-scored versions of these variables were summed to produce a time-varying overall measure of nSES at participant addresses 46, from which we derived a 10-year average nSES for each participant (from 2002 to 2011).

2e. Statistical Analyses

We quantified characteristics of persons with and without elevated brain amyloid at visit 5. We assessed differences in continuous variables with Student’s t-tests and used chi-square tests for categorical variables. We also described distributions of 2002-2011 averages of each exposure and calculated partial correlations between each exposure, adjusting for study center.

Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to quantify the association between 2002-2011 average air pollutant exposure and elevated amyloid deposition in 2012-2014. Associations were scaled to represent the effects of different exposure contrasts for each pollutant: 1 ug/m3 for PM2.5; 1 ppb for NO2, NOx, 24-hour O3, and 8-hour O3; 100 ppb for CO; 0.1 ppb for sulfates, ammonium, nitrates, elemental carbon, and organic carbon; 10 ng/m3 for Fe; and 1 ng/m3 for Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn. We ran unadjusted models (Model 1); models adjusted for age at PET scan, sex, education, race-center, and cognitive status (normal/MCI) at visit 5 (Model 2); and a fully adjusted model additionally adjusting for APOE e4 status (Model 3).

Because APOE e4 allele status has been shown to modify the association between air pollution and risk of dementia 22 and cognitive status 47 in prior studies, we explored potential effect measure modification by including a multiplicative interaction term (i.e., pollutant * APOE e4 allele status) in Model 3. We also explored interactions with race-center, cognitive status, and number of vascular risk factors (i.e., current smoking, hypertension, diabetes, BMI&gt;=30, and total cholesterol &gt;=200 mg/dL; N = 316 for analyses of effect measure modification by number of vascular risk factors) 37.

In sensitivity analyses, we explored the effect of further covariate adjustment on resulting odds ratios for amyloid positivity. Of our remaining covariates of potential interest, only nSES and BMI were associated with at least one exposure and the outcome, thus meeting the minimum criteria as potential confounders in our sample, and were adjusted for in Model 4 (Model 3 + neighborhood SES) and Model 5 (Model 4 + BMI). For analyses of PM2.5 components, we further explored adjusting for total PM2.5 in Model 6 (Model 3 + total PM2.5); doing so changed the interpretation to the effect of a higher proportion of the component within total PM2.5 exposure on late-life amyloid burden as opposed to higher absolute concentrations of each component.

As an additional sensitivity analysis, we explored whether using exposures generated from alternate air pollution estimation approaches impacted associations given evidence from epidemiologic literature that model choice may significantly impact associations with health outcomes 48-50. Briefly, we used two additional methods to estimate PM2.5: (i) a satellite-based approach incorporating output from a chemical transport model (CTM) and monitor data 51,52, and (ii) a regionalized universal kriging approach that uses partial least squares regression (PLSR)-resolved land use regression (LUR), temporal trend back-extrapolation, and spatial smoothing 53,54. We also used the regionalized universal kriging approach with LUR and PLSR to derive exposure estimates for NO2 and 24-hour O3. Finally, we used a national log-normal ordinary kriging model 55 for additional concentration estimates of NO2, NOx, and 24-hour O3. Because data from the national log-normal ordinary kriging model were not available for every participant address, we imputed missing values as estimated exposures from the nearest residential address with available data within 1km. Those who lived farther than 1km from a residence with available data were excluded from analyses using the national log-normal ordinary kriging model (N = 13).

Further, we used inverse probability weights to better estimate what our results may look like had the ARIC-PET sample included participants with dementia. First, we obtained weights constructed by the ARIC cohort that account for the MRI study sampling strategy and study center-specific probability of participant refusal. Because inclusion in the PET sample further requires participants be free from dementia, we constructed another set of weights that, when applied to the PET sample, weighted it to better resemble the cognitive distribution of the MRI sample. A schematic for this approach is outlined in Supplemental Figure 1. Using the combined MRI and cognitive distribution weights accounts for both the systematic sampling of the MRI study and the exclusion of participants with dementia in the PET study, and therefore better reflects the distribution of cognitive status in all ARIC visit 5 participants.

Finally, to confirm our results were not driven by our definition of amyloid positivity, we transformed global cortical SUVRs into centiloids following the equation derived by Navitsky et al for Avid VOIs 56. We estimated the association between each individual air pollutant and centiloids (treated continuously) adjusting for confounders used in Model 2. All analyses were completed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC) and RStudio version 1.4.1717.

3. Results

Characteristics of all eligible participants, those with elevated amyloid burden (“amyloid positive”), and those without elevated amyloid burden (“amyloid negative”) are presented in Table 1. A significantly higher proportion of amyloid positive participants compared to amyloid negative participants were Black in MS, female, lived in areas of lower socioeconomic status, and had vascular risk factors. Amyloid positive participants were also more likely to have MCI and be APOE e4 carriers. Distributions of air pollutants at participant residential addresses are presented in Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 1, and partial correlations between pollutants are provided in Supplemental Figure 2. Notably, elemental carbon and all airborne trace metals were highly correlated with each other (Pearson’s r ≥ 0.9). Additionally, over 98% of participants were assigned to 1.33-km resolution exposures for all pollutants modeled using the primary estimation method.

Although unadjusted associations suggested protective effects, higher air pollution exposures were not significantly associated with amyloid positivity in fully adjusted models (Figure 2, Supplemental Table 2. Additional adjustment for nSES and BMI in Models 4 and 5 (Supplemental Table 2) and adjusting for total PM2.5 in analyses considering PM2.5 components in Model 6 (Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental Figure 3) did not materially change our results.

We did not see support for effect measure modification of associations between any pollutant and amyloid burden by APOE e4 allele status, cognitive status, or number of vascular risk factors (all p-values &gt;0.05). Race-center appeared to modify the association between 24-hour O3 and amyloid burden (p-value for interaction = 0.028); however, given the number of models considered in our analyses, this is likely a chance finding.

Results from sensitivity analyses were largely consistent with our main findings. Despite low to moderate correlation of PM2.5, NO2, NOx, and 24-hour O3 estimates across approaches (Supplemental Figure 4), there was little support for the hypothesized associations between average ten-year exposures and brain amyloid positivity when using alternate air pollution estimation approaches. Of note, estimates using the national log-normal kriging model had wider confidence interval (Figure 3), reflecting smaller variability in air pollution estimates using this approach. Results were materially unchanged when we weighted participants to better reflect the cognitive status distribution of all ARIC participants at visit 5 (Figure 4) and when global SUVRs were converted to centiloids (Supplemental Table 4.

4. Discussion

We did not find significant associations between 10-year exposure to criteria air pollutants, components of PM2.5, or airborne trace metals and late-life elevated amyloid deposition among older adults without dementia living in three US communities.

This study contributes to the growing literature examining potential mechanisms underlying associations between air pollution and accelerated cognitive decline or heightened dementia risk in observational studies 2. To date, similar studies of long-term (i.e. greater than one-year) exposure to air pollution and human brain amyloid burden measured in vivo have been inconsistent. Iaccarino and colleagues reported that elevated PM2.5 was associated with a 10% increase (95% CI: 5%, 15%) in odds of amyloid positivity among 18,178 Medicare-eligible adults with MCI or dementia of uncertain etiology 26. However, no significant association was found with 8-hour O3. Among a sample of 156 participants in Barcelona, 97% of whom reported a family history of AD, no effect was detected for PM2.5 27. However, higher NO2 exposure was associated with higher amyloid deposition only among the subset of participants who had decreased AB42/40 ratios measured in cerebrospinal fluid. As our sample excludes those with dementia, and we lack cerebrospinal fluid measures, direct comparison of these studies to our findings is difficult. Finally, a study of 309 cognitively unimpaired individuals in South Korea reported significantly higher odds of amyloid positivity among those in the highest tertile of 5-year exposure to particulate matter (PM10), approximately 48 to 67 ug/m3 28, which is high relative to levels found in most of the US and those experienced by the participants in our sample.

There is some evidence to suggest that air pollution exposure may influence AD primarily in later stages of the disease process, which may help explain the observed heterogeneity across studies. A recent study conducted using data from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) cohort found that the hazard ratio for air pollution exposure and progression to dementia among participants with cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND) at baseline was stronger than that for incident CIND among unimpaired participants, suggesting air pollution may exert stronger effects later in the disease process 8. If the effects of air pollution on dementia and its pathological processes are modified by clinical progression, this could explain why our findings do not support the significant findings of prior studies. The study by Alemany et al. reported that NO2 exposure was associated with amyloid-PET positivity only in those with evidence of AD pathology in cerebrospinal fluid 27, and the study by Iaccarino et al. 26 of Medicare beneficiaries included only those who had either MCI or dementia, suggesting the association may be limited to those who are farther along the disease pathway. In contrast, our sample was comprised of persons without dementia, 73% of whom had normal cognition.

Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest that the relationship between air pollution exposures and AD is nonlinear. This may also contribute to heterogeneity in findings across studies. For example, investigators reported nonlinear relationships between both PM2.5 and PM10 with incident CIND in the SNAC-K cohort 8. This is echoed by the pattern of findings linking particulate matter to markers of AD pathology. For example, a study conducted among community-dwelling residents around Seattle that reported 10-year mean PM2.5 levels of 8.2 ug/m3 29 found no association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and three measures of AD pathology at autopsy 29, mirroring our own US-based findings. On the other hand, studies on AD pathology conducted in Asia, where air pollution levels tend to be much higher, reported significant associations linking PM2.5 with AB42/40 ratios in cerebrospinal fluid 57 and linking PM10 exposure with amyloid-PET positivity 28. If the effect of air pollution exposures on AD risk is most pronounced at higher levels of exposure, this could help explain the observed pattern of findings.

We did not find evidence of effect measure modification by APOE e4 status. This is consistent with previous epidemiologic studies of air pollution and brain amyloid burden in humans 27,28. However, this contradicts findings in related work on the effect of air pollution on brain amyloid accumulation in animal and ecologic studies. For example, in an experiment conducted with mice, APOE e4 carriers exposed to particulate matter had higher amyloid deposition compared to unexposed APOE e4 carriers, while no difference was detected between exposed and unexposed APOE e3 carriers 22. Similarly, in young adults and children living in Mexico City exposed to very high levels of air pollution, those with at least one APOE e4 allele had greater AB42 accumulation compared to APOE e3 carriers 24. As there are also epidemiologic studies suggesting stronger associations between air pollution and cognitive change among APOE e4 carriers 22,47,58, it may be worth examining whether APOE e4 modifies air pollution’s effect on alternate pathological pathways known to increase risk of accelerated cognitive decline and dementia, or whether APOE e4 only modifies the effect of air pollution on amyloid accumulation at high levels of exposure.

Our study has several important strengths. We extended the scope of prior work to consider associations with multiple criteria air pollutants, components of PM2.5, and airborne trace metals. Full address histories were available, limiting the potential for exposure misclassification due to residential moves and allowing the use of a 10-year average exposure window that represents an etiologically relevant exposure window based on our current understanding of AD pathogenesis. We considered the impact of using alternate modeling approaches to estimate air pollution exposures, which confirmed that our findings were not specific to our choice of air pollution estimation approach. We also acknowledge that this study has limitations. Like prior studies, we do not account for daily mobility when estimating participant exposures; as regulation targets ambient pollutant concentrations, our results remain relevant to health policy considerations. Our limited sample size may have reduced our ability to detect significant effects; however, our sample size was similar to that of other PET imaging studies that reported significant associations 27,28. Though we used additional air pollution estimation models for four air pollutants, alternate approaches were unavailable for components of PM2.5 or airborne trace metals, and we cannot determine which air pollution method used in this study has the highest accuracy or reliability. As adjusting for study center effectively modifies the interpretation of results to looking at within-site exposure contrasts, we assume our approach here accurately captures local contrasts; however, we are unable to compare these findings with those using other approaches that may better capture small-scale variation. Amyloid positivity prevalence estimates were slightly different in our study compared to those published in a recent meta-analysis 38, possibly because Black individuals, who make up 42.5% of our study population, have higher calculated global SUVRs across categories of cognitive status 36. Finally, our sample excluded individuals with dementia, precluding investigation of associations in this potentially sensitive group. Though we conducted sensitivity analyses upweighting the small number of those who transition to dementia by visit 6 to approximate a sample including those at all disease stages, these analyses are unlikely to fully reflect the effect that would have been found in a sample that included participants with dementia.

In conclusion, we did not find evidence of associations between criteria air pollutants, components of PM2.5, and airborne trace metals and late-life brain amyloid deposition among individuals without dementia recruited from three sites in the US. While this suggests that air pollution may impact cognition and dementia independent of amyloid accumulation, whether air pollution influences AD pathogenesis later in the disease course or at higher exposure levels deserves further consideration.
