Maintaining neuronal integrity and functions requires precise mechanisms controlling organelle and protein quality. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by functional defects in the clearance and recycling of intracellular components. As such, neuronal homeostasis involves autophagy, mitophagy, and apoptosis. Compromised activity in these cellular processes may cause pathological phenotypes of AD. Dysfunction of mitochondria is one of the hallmarks of AD. Mitophagy is a critical mitochondria quality control system, and the impaired mitophagy is observed in AD. Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), a member of the pro-survival B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (BCL2) family, is a mitochondria-targeted protein that contributes to maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Mcl1 knockout mice display peri-implantation lethality. The studies on conditional Mcl1 knockout mice demonstrate that MCL1 plays a central role in neurogenesis and neuronal survival during brain development. Accumulating evidence reveals the critical role of MCL1 as a regulator of neuronal autophagy, mitophagy, and survival. In this review, we discuss the emerging neuroprotective function of MCL1 and how dysregulation of MCL1 signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. As the pro-survival BCL2 family of proteins are promising targets of pharmacological intervention with BH3 mimetic drugs, we also discuss the promise of MCL1-targeting therapy in AD.

pmc1. Introduction

1.1. Alzheimer’s disease

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for an estimated 60–80% of dementia cases [1]. AD is a slowly progressive and multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss, cognitive impairment, and changes in behavior functions [2]. Most patients develop AD after 65 years old, while below 5% of a rare number of early-onset cases occur under the age of 65. Moreover, around 1% or less of cases develop AD due to an autosomal dominant genetic inheritance, with mutations affecting gene functions for amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 (PS2), manifesting remarkably early onset and rapid progression of the symptoms [3–5]. An estimated 6.2 million American population at 65 or older was affected by AD in 2020. The number is estimated to continue rising to about 88 million by the middle of the 21st century [1]. The symptoms generally progress adversely during the disease suffering from daily activities, and eventually become fatal following the onset of AD symptoms. In the US, AD is currently ranked the 6th leading cause of death [1]. Despite the high disease rate, there is no effective cure at present because of the lack of knowledge on molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis and disease progression of AD. Therefore, the therapeutic treatment of AD is an urgent requirement. To this end, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved four drugs, cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists (memantine). Still, these drugs show only modest effects in ameliorating the symptom progression and no significant accomplishment in preventing cognitive impairment progress [6]. Therefore, a further understanding of AD pathogenesis mechanisms is essential to prevent disease development and progression and develop effective therapeutic interventions.

1.2. Pathology of Alzheimer’s disease

The characteristic neuropathological hallmark of AD is the senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which may subsequently cause neuronal degeneration and death [7, 8]. Senile plaques occur primarily through extracellular deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the medial temporal lobe and the cortical layer of the hippocampus in the brain. Aβ is produced from APP through sequential processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase [9]. Mechanistically, β-secretase cleaves APP at its N-terminus, producing membrane-bound APP fragment C99 that undergoes sequential γ-secretase-mediated processing [10]. This cleavage liberates 42- and 40-amino-acid length fragments from the C99 N-terminus portion, Aβ42, and Aβ40, respectively, into the extracellular space. Due to the Aβ42 hydrophobic disposition, Aβ42 facilitates its pathological aggregation, which causes neuronal lethality and brain amyloidosis.

Besides the Aβ42 filaments observed as senile plaques, NFTs are another neuropathological profile of AD. NFTs accumulate in the vulnerable neurons formed from twisted Tau protein fibers. Tau, primarily expressed in the brain, is a microtubule-associated protein, and its physiological function is supposed to stabilize microtubules of neuronal cells [11]. In the AD brain, the hyperphosphorylated and misfolded state of Tau protein facilitates the Tau aggregation and formation of intracellular tangles, while the underlying mechanisms leading to the pathological Tau aggregation remain to be identified. However, the Tau-neurofibrillary pathology is closely correlated with the progression of cognitive decline in AD patients [12] and the spreading of the Tau filament from the entorhinal cortex to the neocortex is supposed to causally link to cognitive impairment of AD patients [13]. Therefore, these two major pathological lesions are the primary targets for therapeutics to prevent the onset and halt of AD progression.

2. Autophagy in Alzheimer’s disease

2.1. Autophagy

Autophagy is an evolutionally conserved intracellular degradation and recycling process in eukaryote cells. Autophagy occurs in response to various stresses, such as nutrient deprivation, growth factor depletion, infection, and inflammation. Autophagy was considered to be a process of non-selective degradation and recycling of random cytoplasmic fraction, known as bulk autophagy, which occurs under nutrient or energy depletion stress conditions. Accumulating evidence revealed that autophagy also exerts critical cytoprotective roles in selectively removing unwanted and harmful cytoplasmic materials, such as protein aggregates and damaged organelles, a process currently known as selective autophagy.

Autophagy is categorized into three different types in mammalian cells, microautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and macroautophagy, based on the mechanism of how target substrates are delivered to lysosomes for degradation [14, 15]. Microautophagy is a process in which the lysosomal membrane invaginates and directly engulfs cytoplasmic cargo. On the other hand, CMA utilizes transportation of cytoplasmic proteins to lysosome with chaperones, which is further recognized by the receptor, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A), on the lysosomal membrane to promote direct engulfment into the lysosome. Macroautophagy involves the double membrane-bound intermediary vesicle called autophagosomes, which engulf cytoplasmic components and organelles, and subsequently fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes that break down the encapsulated contents. As autophagic processes are primarily mediated through macroautophagy, it is regarded as a major autophagic pathway and thus referred to as autophagy hereafter. Under normal conditions, autophagy helps maintain cell functions through specific degradation of damaged or excess organelles such as overloaded peroxisomes (perophagy) and dysfunctional mitochondria (mitophagy). Once undergoing stress conditions such as nutrient and energy starvation, cells accelerate the autophagic pathway to break down cytoplasmic materials into metabolites that can be further used for biosynthetic processes and energy production, thereby maintaining cell survival.

Mechanistically, in response to energy deprivation, activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and suppression of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) induce the transcriptional activity of transcription factor EB (TFEB) to promote TFEB-dependent transcription of autophagy-related genes (ATGs) and lysosome-related genes [16]. AMPK also activates the autophagy induction complex, Atg/Unc52-like kinase 1 (ULK1), in part through phosphorylating ULK1 [17]. The activated ULK1 complex induces nucleation of the phagophore by phosphorylating Beclin1 [18], a component of the class III PI3K (PI3KC3) complex I, also referred to as VPS34 complex (consisting of class III PI3K, Beclin1, VPS34, and ATG14) [19–21] that catalyzes PI3P formation. ULK1 also phosphorylates ATG9 that recruits PI3P-binding proteins such as WD repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting proteins (WIPIs) to the phagophore [22], leading to further recruitment of the ATG12-5-16L complex. This complex recruits the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) to PI3P positive membrane to promote LC3 lipidation and facilitate membrane elongation and target protein recognition [22]. Once the autophagosome is formed, it fuses with the lysosome to form the autolysosome, which initiates the degradation process of macromolecules (Figure 1A).

Neuronal cells are terminally differentiated, post-mitotic, and high energy and nutrition-demanded, which are distinct from non-neuronal dividing cells. Maintaining the integrity of neuronal homeostasis is critical for cells to survive during the whole individual life. To this end, autophagy serves as an effective system for the clearance and recycling of intracellular components, such as damaged organelles and aggregated proteins. Dysregulation of autophagy is considered one of the hallmarks of AD [23, 24]. Aberrant accumulation of autophagosome vacuole is observed in AD brain and transgenic mouse model, due to the compromised fusion of the autophagosome with lysosome [23, 25, 26]. However, causative molecular mechanisms of impaired autophagy function are still under in-depth investigation. A previous study indicates that Beclin1 level is decreased in AD brain, and consistent with this observation, heterozygous knockout of Beclin1 in hAPP transgenic mice results in increased Aβ pathology [27]. In addition, hyperactivation of the PI3K/mTORC1 signaling and suppressed transactivation activity of TFEB are supposed to be the primary link to the impaired autophagy in AD. Mechanistically, mTORC1 negatively regulates autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1 and AMPK [28]. In support of this notion, clinical observations indicate that the activities of mTORC1 and its downstream S6K are elevated in the brain of patients with AD [29, 30]. On the other hand, TFEB is a positive autophagy regulator that induces autophagy-related and lysosome-related gene expressions [31]. Notably, TFEB transcriptional activity is negatively controlled by mTORC1 kinase activity [32], implying that TFEB transcriptional activity is suppressed in mTORC1-activated AD neurons. Since autophagy is a critical neuronal protection system, further analyses are required to elucidate the molecular link between autophagy function and AD.

2.2. Mitophagy

In addition to toxic pathological protein aggregates, mitochondrial dysfunction is also a major cause of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD [23]. The impaired mitochondrial function increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, resulting in accumulating damages of various cellular components, including proteins, genome, and lipids. Therefore, selective removal of malfunctional mitochondria, referred to as mitophagy, is a critical protective mechanism to maintain cellular integrity. Mitophagy is driven primarily through the conserved PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)-Parkin signaling pathway in a ubiquitination-dependent manner [33, 34] (Figure 1B). PINK1 is an unstable protein kinase targeted to mitochondria, resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), surveying mitochondrial integrity. Damaged or depolarized mitochondria lead to PINK1 stabilization and translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), promoting PINK1 autophosphorylation and activation [35]. Subsequently, activated PINK1 phosphorylates both ubiquitin (Ub) on OMM and ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) of E3 ligase Parkin, leading to the recruitment and activation of Parkin [36, 37]. PINK1 and Parkin cooperatively modify OMM by PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ub (pUb) and Parkin-mediated conjugation of pUb chains on the proteins of OMM, forming a feedforward loop to enhance modification of OMM with pUb-chains, thereby building binding platforms for autophagy receptors, such as Optineurin (OPTN), Nuclear domain 10 protein 52 (NDP52), and Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) [33, 38, 39]. Biologically, the binding of autophagy receptors to OMM through its ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD)-pUb interaction subsequently leads to binding to cargo through the interaction between LC3 and LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif of the autophagy receptors to promote engulfment of the damaged mitochondria. TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) facilitates this process through phosphorylating both UBD and LIR of autophagy receptor OPTN to enhance the interaction of pUB-UBD and LC3-LIR, respectively.

The physiological and pathological importance of mitophagy was further proven by the study of Pink1 or Parkin knockout mice. The Pink1 or Parkin knockout mice are sensitive to mitochondrial stress that promote a release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [40–42], leading to innate inflammation [43]. However, further studies on the crosstalk mechanism between mitophagy and inflammation are required to further elucidate the role of inflammation in the pathology of AD. Besides the PINK1/Parkin-mediated ubiquitin-dependent pathway, mitophagy is also induced by the ubiquitin-independent pathway through OMM-targeted mitochondrial mitophagy receptors, BCL2 and adenovirus E1B 19 kDa-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and BNIP3-like protein X (NIX) (Figure 1B). These proteins contain mitochondrial targeting motif and LIR domain, thereby facilitating the recruitment of autophagic vesicles to damaged mitochondria in a ubiquitin-independent manner [44].

Mitophagy is a critical neuronal protection process [45]. A previous study shows defective mitophagy in AD patients’ hippocampus, AD patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, and the AD mouse model [46]. This report demonstrates that mitophagy induction in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice suppresses Aβ and phospho-Tau pathology, decreases inflammatory cytokine levels, and improves cognitive impairment phenotype. Another independent study shows that AD neurons of hAPP transgenic mice and AD brain display aberrant accumulation of mitophagosome [47]. Besides AD, Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD) are neurodegenerative diseases that also display progressive neuronal loss. They present the common pathogenic hallmark of misfolded protein aggregates and abnormal elimination of damaged mitochondria. Notably, genetic alterations in Pink1 and Parkin cause early-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD) [48]. PINK1 mutant forms of PD fail to recruit Parkin to damaged mitochondria [49]. In addition, Parkin mutations associated with PD show a deficit in depolarization insult-dependent translocation of Parkin to mitochondria [50]. Thus, the aberrant PINK1/Parkin signaling causes dysregulation of mitophagy, subsequently leading to PD pathogenesis. Likewise, dysregulation of mitophagy is a potential pathological feature in Huntington’s disease (HD) [51]. In this scenario, the presence of mutant Huntington (mHTT) protein causes impairment of cargo loading duing the process of mitophagy, which was confirmed in striatal cells derived from the knock-in mice carrying 111 CAG in the HTT gene [52].

2.3. Mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathology

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a characteristic feature of AD [23, 24, 53], which leads to accelerating Aβ production in the brain of the AD mouse model [23, 54]. For instance, compromising mitochondria function via toxic insult or depletion of mitochondrial components enhances pathologic phenotypes of Aβ [55, 56]. Specifically, toxin exposure that causes mitochondrial damages promotes cognitive impairment and Aβ deposition in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Heterozygous deletion of mitochondrial antioxidant manganese Superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) in the hAPP transgenic mice exacerbates AD phenotype. These data suggest that dysfunctional or damaged mitochondria are a potential target for AD therapeutic intervention.

Impaired mitochondrial function is regarded as a promoting factor for APP processing to Aβ42 and hyperphosphorylation of Tau, two main pathological hallmarks of AD. Glucose uptake, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzyme activity, and mitochondrial biogenesis, are reduced in AD, leading to decreased ATP and increased ROS levels that may facilitate Aβ and Tau pathology [9, 57]. Decreased mitochondrial activity occurs prior to accumulation of Aβ in the brain, which is shown in several studies using the AD mouse model [24, 58, 59]. Malfunctional mitochondria may result in overproduction of ROS, leading to aberrant APP processing through ROS-dependent upregulation of γ-secretase activity [60]. The ROS overproduction causes pTau and NFT formation and microtubule de-polymerization [61–64]. On the other hand, the accumulation of Aβ and pTau reciprocally affects mitochondrial dysfunction [23, 65]. Moreover, exposure of Aβ/pTau in culture neuron and ectopic expression of mutant APP/Tau in mice lead to impaired mitochondrial function [65–68], suggesting that Aβ accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation that affect mitochondrial malfunction are exacerbated by impaired mitochondrial function.

3. MCL1 signaling and Alzheimer’s disease

3.1. Regulation of MCL1 pathway

Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1) is a critical regulator of the cell survival pathway. MCL1 belongs a member of a B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (BCL2) protein family that controls cellular apoptosis through mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) [69]. According to its function and structure, the BCL2 family is divided into three subgroups; multidomain pro-survival proteins (BCL2, MCL1, BCL-XL, BCL-W, and A1), multidomain pro-apoptotic effector proteins (BAK and BAX), and BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins (BID, BIM, PUMA, NOXA, BAD, BIK, BMF, and HRK). All family members contain a common BH3 polypeptide motif to interact through this motif. In response to apoptotic stimuli, cells modulate the interaction status and protein levels of BCL2 family proteins towards releasing pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 antagonist killer 1 (BAK) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), promoting the BAK and BAX homo-oligomerization that induces mitochondrial apoptotic pore formation and cytochrome c release [70] (Figure 2A).

MCL1 exerts its anti-apoptotic function by constraining pro-apoptotic BCL2 proteins through direct interaction. Distinct from other anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins, MCL1 protein is extremely unstable, and rapid MCL1 degradation serves as a mechanism for cells to promptly switch into a pro-apoptotic condition (Figure 2B). MCL1 protein stability is tightly regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications, including, but is not limited to, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and acetylation. MCL1 has a unique extended N-terminal region with a PEST domain enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine, common among proteins with a short protein half-life. Recent studies reveal that MCL1 degradation is regulated in part through the phosphorylation in the PEST domain directed by GSK3β, JNK, p38, CK2, CDK1, and CDK5 [71–75] through proteasomal degradation. The ubiquitination of MCL1 is controlled by multiple E3 ligases including Mule [76], SCFβ-TRCP [77], APC/CCdc20 [74], SCFFBW7 [72, 73], TRIM17 [78], TRIM11 [79], FBXO4 [80], and Parkin [81, 82]. Notably, SCFβ-TRCP, SCFFBW7, and APC/CCdc20 require prior phosphorylation for MCL1 ubiquitination and degradation. On the other hand, the proteasomal degradation of MCL1 is counteracted by multiple deubiquitinase (DUBs), including USP9X [83], USP13 [84], OTUD1 [85], DUB3 [86], Ku70 [87], and JOSD1 [88]. Similar to ubiquitination, SUMOylation plays a role in regulating various cellular processes. MCL1 is a target of SUMOylation, which counteracts MCL1 ubiquitination, leading to MCL1 stabilization [79]. Furthermore, MCL1 is reported to undergo acetylation [89]. In this scenario, the acetyltransferase p300-targets MCL1 for acetylation to stabilize MCL1 protein through which acetylated MCL1 facilitates interaction with the deubiquitinase USP9X. Since genomic alterations in MCL1 have not been reported in AD, posttranslational modifications may be one of the potential MCL1 regulatory mechanisms in this disease.

3.2. MCL1 function in the regulation of mitochondrial integrity

Besides its pro-survival function, MCL1 plays an essential role in regulating non-apoptotic signaling governing mitochondrial integrity. MCL1 was reported to control mitochondrial fission and fusion during reprogramming of human pluripotent stem cells [90]. Mitochondrial fusion maintains the mitochondrial network integrity, while mitochondrial fission facilitates removing damaged mitochondria through mitophagy. MCL1 contributes to these processes by directly interacting with two GTPase, DRP-1 and OPA-1 [90]. MCL1 binding to DRP-1 stabilizes DRP-1 protein at OMM, leading to mitochondrial fission and subsequent its degradation by mitophagy. On the other hand, MCL1 destabilizes OPA-1 through interaction, repressing mitochondrial fusion. Furthermore, MCL1 function contributes to mitochondrial calcium uptake through interaction with the OMM-localized voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). This MCL1-dependent mitochondrial calcium uptake increases cell motility and mitochondrial ROS production [91]. The other roles of MCL1 in controlling mitochondrial activity are energy production and metabolism. The IMM-targeted isoform of MCL1 plays a critical role in mitochondrial bioenergetics through facilitating ATP synthase oligomerization and ATP production [92]. Moreover, IMM-localized MCL1 also regulates energy metabolism in part by promoting fatty-acid β-oxidation through binding to the very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) at IMM [93]. These emerging MCL1 non-pro-survival functions may also contribute to AD pathology since the mitochondrial function is tightly connected with neuronal cell integrity and plasticity.

3.3. MCL1-dependent regulation of neuronal cell death

MCL1 displays multiple tissue distribution, including the central nervous system. Since Mcl1 knockout in mice showed peri-implantation embryonic lethality [94], heterozygous deletion and neuro-progenitor specific deletion mice were used to interrogate the physiological role of MCL1 in protecting neuronal cell death [95–97]. Heterozygous Mcl1 knockout mice reveal elevated apoptosis in response to excitotoxic insult in hippocampal pyramidal neurons [95]. MCL1 is highly expressed in neural precursors within the ventricular zone and newly committed post-mitotic neurons within the developing cortical plate. Neuronal progenitor-specific Mcl1 conditional knockout mice show severe defects in cortical neurogenesis due to extensive cell death during nervous system development, causing embryonic lethal at E16. Cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) derived from the Mcl1 knockout mice showed increased sensitivity to DNA-damage-induced apoptosis [96].

Several studies focus on the molecular mechanisms of MCL1 regulations in a neuron. In CGN culture, serum and potassium deprivation-induced neuronal cellular apoptosis is triggered by proteasomal degradation of MCL1 in a TRIM17 E3 ligase-dependent manner [78] (Figure 3). TRIM17 is reported to promote neuronal apoptosis [98, 99] and induce the expression of alpha-synuclein [100]. Serum and potassium deprivation induces sequential phosphorylation of Thr144 and Ser140 by JNK and GSK3β, respectively. TRIM17 recognizes phosphorylated Ser140 and Thr144, corresponding to Ser159 and Thr163 in human MCL1, for proteasomal degradation. These sites comprise the recognition motif (phospho-degron) of FBW7, a tumor suppressor and a substrate adaptor of SCFFBW7 E3 ligase complex [72, 73], responsible for MCL1 degradation in various types of cancers and neuronal cells [101, 102]. This study also shows that, in the mouse primary CGN, the depletion of TRIM17 results in MCL1 stabilization. Phosphorylation-directed MCL1 degradation is also mediated by CDK5 that highly expresses in neuronal cells, and its activity is critical for neurogenesis and pathogenesis of AD [103, 104] (Figure 3). CDK5-mediated MCL1 Thr92 phosphorylation promotes proteasomal MCL1 degradation, leading to increased neuronal vulnerability and mitochondrial depolarization in glutamate-treated HT22 mouse hippocampal and primary cortical neuronal cells [75], which may in part explain molecular mechanisms of how CDK5 hyperactivation may cause neurodegeneration, besides phosphorylating Tau protein [105]. Furthermore, the critical mitophagy regulator Parkin is reported to promote MCL1 ubiquitination and degradation for inducing apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons [81]. Mitochondrial depolarization, but not pro-apoptotic stimulation, activates the PINK1/Parkin complex for MCL1 degradation. Moreover, Parkin regulates the FBW7-MCL1 pathway through Parkin-mediated FBW7 degradation in dopaminergic neurons, therefore, activated PINK1-Parkin pathway indirectly stabilizes MCL1 and consequently promotes neuronal survival [106]. These studies suggest the dual function of the PINK1/Parkin complex regulating both mitophagy and apoptosis.

While genetically-engineered animal models have revealed the vital role of MCL1 in regulating brain development, relatively little is known about MCL1’s physiological function in AD pathogenesis. Among the BCL2 family of proteins, the role of BCL2 in AD is relatively well defined. Evaluating the abundance of the BCL2 family in AD suggests that the shifting the balance between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic family proteins towards pro-apoptosis may facilitate disease progression. In support of this notion, Aβ treatment in human primary neuronal culture downregulates BCL2 protein levels and upregulates BAX levels [107]. Consistent with this notion, Aβ injection into mouse hippocampus increases Bim levels and decreases BCL2 levels, leading to BAX oligomerization and subsequent neuronal cell death [108]. In addition, Aβ deposition in AD mouse model upregulates miR-16-5p that targets BCL2 expression, thereby reducing MCL2 protein levels [109]. Consistent with the observations, MCL1 protein levels are negatively correlated with the disease severity in AD brains [75]. The previous study using the 3xTg AD mouse model reveals the critical BCL2 function in suppressing AD pathogenesis [110]. BCL2 overexpression in the mice limits caspase-9 activity and reduces NFT and Aβ plaque formation, and consequently, the mice reveal ameliorated cognition impairment, further defining the physiological pro-survival function of BCL2 in AD [110]. While MCL1 and BCL2 pro-survival functions are largely redundant, MCL1 has the unique regulatory mechanism of its activity and biological function, as discussed above. Therefore, detailed MCL1 physiological function in AD needs to be further explored using MCL1 knockout AD animal models and AD patient clinical samples.

3.4. MCL1-dependent regulation of autophagy/mitophagy

A neuronal cell is compartmentalized into three main parts; axon, dendrite, and cell body. The dysfunction of an axon is closely correlated with various neurodegenerative disorders, and degeneration of the axon is one of the pathological hallmarks and primary cause of such diseases [111]. Axon actively outgrows up to one-meter length in humans and transmits chemical and electrical information through the extended distance, which demands nutrition and energy. To this end, the axon relies on autophagy for the vast distance of outgrowth and transmittance of a large amount of information entire lifetime. Therefore, axonal autophagy is closely correlated to axonal degeneration [112–114]. By introducing injury-induced axonal degeneration, elevated GSK3β activity induces phosphorylation of MCL1 at Ser140, leading to dissociation of MCL1 from Beclin1, which in turn promotes proteasomal degradation of MCL1, thereby promoting axonal autophagy [115] (Figure 3). The elevated level of autophagy induces ATP production in the axon, leading to axonal regeneration. The phosphorylation-dependent MCL1 degradation in mitochondria is mediated by FBW7. Consistent with the FBW7-directed MCL1 ubiquitination, depletion of Fbw7 suppresses the process of axonal autophagy and subsequent axonal degeneration. Moreover, MCL1 negatively regulates axonal autophagy by inhibiting Beclin1, an autophagy receptor and component of VPS34 complex responsible for phagophore nucleation [115, 116]. As with other BCL2 family proteins, MCL1 forms complex with Beclin1 through BH3 motif for its inhibition [117–119], which is required for suppressing autophagy [120] (Figure 4A). Beclin1 level is downregulated in vulnerable neurons in AD, and heterozygous Beclin1 knockout mice display AD-like phenotypes [27]. These observations suggest that proteasomal MCL1 degradation induces autophagy through releasing the suppression of Beclin1, while Beclin1 depletion or simultaneous BAK1 activation turns autophagy into apoptosis [117, 121]. As causative signaling pathways of axonal degeneration in AD remain to be identified, further analyses on MCL1 related signaling may be beneficial to provide a clue for identifying underlying molecular mechanisms.

MCL1 is also involved in the process of mitophagy. MCL1 and other pro-survival BCL2 family proteins, BCL-XL and BCL-W, exert a suppressive role on mitophagy induction by inhibiting Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria [122] (Figure 4A). The pro-survival BCL2 family protein-dependent anti-mitophagy effects are likely through their direct binding to Parkin. Consistent with this notion, BH3-only proteins and BH3-mimetics antagonize this suppression [122]. Furthermore, in HeLa cells in which Parkin protein is absent, ectopic expression of MCL1 exerts anti-mitophagy activity through antagonizing the function of a mitophagy receptor, the activating molecule in Beclin1-regulated autophagy (AMBRA1), in mitochondria under steady-state conditions. AMBRA1 is a positive regulator of Beclin1 and its ablation leads to defect of neural tube formation during development due to impaired autophagy [123]. Under normal conditions, MCL1 suppresses AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy. Upon mitophagy induction, increased AMBRA1 expression recruits E3 ligase MULE from the cytoplasm to mitochondria to trigger OMM protein ubiquitination and subsequent mitophagy induction. MULE simultaneously promotes MCL1 ubiquitination and degradation in a GSK3 phosphorylation-dependent manner, enhancing AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy [124].

3.5. Targeting of MCL1 with BH3 mimetics in AD

MCL1 is a critical survival factor and has been a significant focus in cancer research. The strategy relies on targeting the BH3 domain of MCL1 and other pro-survival BCL2 family members. The concept comes from the antagonizing mechanism of pro-survival BCL2 family proteins by BH3 only pro-apoptotic proteins. Multiple cytotoxic stresses induce the expression of pro-apoptotic BH3 only proteins, which bind and antagonize pro-survival BCL2 proteins, leading to liberation of pro-apoptotic effector proteins BAK and BAX from the pro-survival BCL2 family proteins. This induces the release of cytochrome c from the space of IMM, resulting in the induction of apoptosis (Figure 2). The BH3-mimetic anti-BCL2 drug venetoclax, which shows a high affinity for BCL2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W, is approved by FDA and is clinically in use, while this compound has no inhibitory effect on MCL-1 due to unique structure in MCL1 hydrophobic craft [125]. On the other hand, several MCL1-targeting BH3 mimetic inhibitors have entered clinical trials [126].

BH3-mimetics are shown to induce dissociation between Beclin1 and pro-survival BCL2 family proteins, facilitating autophagy/mitophagy [119, 127] (Figure 5). MCL1 depletion, degradation, or inhibitory phosphorylation, potentially leads to both autophagy and apoptosis, depending on the balance of Beclin1 and BAK/BAX levels. Furthermore, as described above, MCL1 plays a role in suppressing mitophagy by inhibiting recruitment of Parkin to depolarized mitochondria, and the treatment of BH3 mimetics canceled this suppressive effect [122] (Figure 5).

The recent study shows that targeting MCL1 by the BH3 compound UMI-77 with a sub-lethal level induces autophagy without any effects on mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis [54] (Figures 4B and 5). This study further demonstrates that MCL1 interacts with LC3. This paradigm-shifting finding provides a unique mechanism suggesting that MCL1 exerts an autophagy receptor function. Mechanistically, UMI-77 presumably exposes the LIR motif in MCL1 protein to LC3, facilitating the interaction of LC3 and MCL1. Consistent with this model, administration of UMI-77 alleviates AD phenotypes, such as improved cognitive impairment, decreased Aβ deposition in the brain, and reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model [54]. Given the less cytotoxicity of the UMI-77 treatment, this study proposes effective therapeutic intervention of AD without damaging mitochondrial function and inducing apoptosis.

4. Conclusion

This review focused on summarizing the possible molecular link between AD and MCL1 function in regulating autophagy/mitophagy and neuronal cell death. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a characteristic hallmark of AD, which is also considered possible upstream events promoting Aβ and pTau pathology. Hence, restoring mitochondrial integrity and function is a potential and promising therapeutic approach for the intervention of the disease. Cytotoxic stresses causing mitochondrial dysfunction induce rapid MCL1 degradation, which serves as a mechanism for cells to turn into the mode of autophagy/mitophagy, and effective autophagic induction has positive effects on AD, such as neuroprotection or resorting neuronal function. Therefore, promoting MCL1 degradation or inhibiting MCL1 activity that promotes autophagy/mitophagy may be a potential approach for treating AD. Since suppressing MCL1 may, however, cause cell death in the neuron expressing pro-apoptotic effectors BAK/BAX, the MCL1 intervention may require combination treatments against the intrinsic apoptosis pathway (Figure 5). The recent finding on the beneficial effects of BH3-mimetic UMI-77 may alleviate this concern, as the UMI-77 treatment induces mitophagy without significant mitochondrial toxicity and apoptosis induction in APP/PS transgenic mouse model (Figure 5). This study shows an unexpected drug mechanism of action by which the sub-lethal level of compound induces the unique MCL1 pro-autophagic function. In conclusion, MCL1 is a potential therapeutic target, and therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms involving MCL1 signaling in mitochondria will provide an insight into a viable avenue of therapeutic intervention for AD.

Figure 1. Scheme of autophagy and mitophagy pathways.

A. Nutrition or energy stress activates AMPK and suppresses mTORC1, leading to elevated ULK1 complex activity, which in turn promotes VPS34 and ATG5-12-16L complex formation to facilitate phagophore synthesis and autophagosome formation.

B. Mitochondria depolarization stabilizes PINK1 and activates PINK1/Parkin signaling, leading to enhancing the phospho-ubiquitin conjugation of OMM. The polyubiquitin chain is recognized by mitophagy receptors, such as OPTN and NDP52, resulting in mitophagosome formation. Ubiquitin-independent mitophagy is mediated by BNIP3 and NIX mitophagy receptors. OMM: outer mitochondrial membrane

Figure 2. MCL1-mediated regulation of apoptosis.

A. Intrinsic apoptosis pathway is controlled by the interaction network of BCL2 family proteins.

B. MCL1 suppresses apoptosis by antagonizing BAX and BAK. Upon cytotoxic stimulation, MCL1 proteasomal degradation or binding with BH3-only proteins results in BAX/BAK oligomerization, leading to cytochrome c release.

Figure 3. Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of MCL1 protein in neuron.

Phosphorylation facilitates MCL1 degradation. Withdrawal of serum and potassium, introducing injury, or glutamate toxicity stimulation, induces MCL1 phosphorylation, leading to rapid MCL1 degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. GSK3β plays a major role in phosphorylation at Ser140 to facilitate a subsequent recognition of E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as FBW7 and TRIM17. MAPK, including JNK, responsible for Thr144 phosphorylation, may serve as priming kinases for GSK3β-dependent Ser140 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation at Thr92 by CDK5 also induces MCL1 proteasomal degradation by unidentified E3 ubiquitin ligase. A rapid removal of MCL1 at mitochondria results in inducing neuronal apoptosis.

Figure 4, MCL1-mediated positive and negative regulation of mitophagy.

A. MCL1 negatively regulates mitophagy through inhibiting the mitophagy activating factors, such as Parkin and Beclin1.

B. UMI-77 treatment facilitates mitophagy in an MCL1-dependent manner. MCL1 interacts with LC3 through its LC3 interacting region (LIR), implying that MCL1 may act as a mitophagy receptor in this scenario. UMI-77 enhances the binding between MCL1 and LC3, leading to mitophagy activation.

Figure 5. MCL1-mediated regulation of autophagy and mitophagy in Alzheimer’s disease

A. MCL1 interacts with and antagonizes the function of autophagy-promoting factor Beclin1 and apoptosis-promoting factors BAK/BAX through their BH3 motif.

B. Cytotoxic stresses that cause mitochondrial depolarization induce MCL1 posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, resulting in proteasomal degradation of MCL1. A rapid removal of MCL1 releases Beclin1, leading to autophagosome formation and subsequent autophagy/mitophagy activation.

C. Therapeutic potential of the MCL1 signaling in managing Alzheimer’s disease. Targeting MCL1 in combination with anti-apoptosis drugs may be beneficial for AD intervention. On the other hand, distinct from the canonical action of the pro-survival BCL2 family inhibitors, BH3-mimetic UMI-77 induces autophagy.
