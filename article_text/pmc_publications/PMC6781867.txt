Background:

Physical frailty (or loss of physiological reserve) is associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may represent early pathologic changes of dementia. The association between these disease markers is unclear.

Design:

Cross-sectional analysis.

Setting:

Community-based participants from the Vanderbilt Memory &amp; Aging Project.

Participants:

A total of 306 older adults with normal cognition (NC; n=174) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n=132).

Measurements:

Frailty was measured using standard methods, and a composite frailty score was calculated. SCD was quantified using the Everyday Cognition Scale (ECog; total score and four domain scores). Objective cognition was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Proportional odds models, stratified by sex, related the frailty composite to MoCA and total ECog score adjusting for age, education, body mass index, cognitive diagnosis, depressed mood, Framingham Stroke Risk Profile, apolipoprotein E (APOE-ε4) carrier status, and height (for gait speed models). Secondary models related individual frailty components to SCD domains and explored associations in NC only.

Results:

In women, frailty composite was related to MoCA (odds ratio [OR]=0.56; p=0.04), a finding attenuated in sensitivity analysis (OR=0.59; p=0.08). Frailty composite related to ECog total (OR=2.27; p=0.02), planning (OR=2.63; p=0.02), and organization scores (OR=2.39; p=0.03). Increasing gait speed related to lower ECog total (OR=0.06; p=0.003) and memory scores (OR=0.03; p&lt;0.001). Grip strength related to lower ECog planning score (OR=0.91, p=0.04). In men, frailty was unrelated to objective and subjective cognition (p-values&gt;0.07). Findings were consistent in the NC group.

Conclusions:

Frailty component and composite scores are related to SCD before the presence of overt dementia. Results suggest that this association is present before overt cognitive impairment. Results suggest a possible sex difference in the clinical manifestation of frailty, with primary associations noted in women. Further studies should investigate mechanisms linking early changes among frailty, SCD, and cognition.

INTRODUCTION

Frailty is a biological deterioration across multiple interrelated organ systems associated with diminished stress response resulting in an increased risk of hospital admissions, falls, disability, institutionalization, and mortality.1 It occurs in 7% to 20% of adults aged 65 years and older.1, 2 Frailty is associated with cognitive decline,2 incidence of mild cognitive impairment3 (MCI) and dementia,2 and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology.4 However, the association between frailty and cognition in the absence of cognitive impairment has yielded mixed results.3, 5, 6

Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is defined as an individual’s self-report of decline or changes to cognition.7 SCD may represent clinically important early changes in cognition.8 It is also associated with cognitive changes,9 AD pathology, and neurodegeneration including increased amyloid deposition10 and smaller brain volumes.11 The timing of the predictive value of SCD appears to be early in the neuropathologic process with declining reliability and validity once clinical dementia appears.

The association between frailty and SCD, both independent risk factors for dementia appearing early in the disease course, has not been thoroughly investigated. One prior study found that self-reported memory functioning relates to exhaustion, a component of frailty.5 Furthermore, it is unclear whether specific aspects of SCD, such as complaints specifically about memory or executive functioning, may be differentially related to frailty.

In this cross‐sectional study, we first aimed to replicate prior findings linking frailty to worse objective global cognition.12 Second, we compared a frailty composite and individual markers of frailty to the presence of SCD, hypothesizing that increasing frailty will be associated with greater SCD. We expected this association to be present in certain frailty components, including gait speed13 and grip strength,14 and relate to specific aspects of SCD, including memory,4 attention, and organization.5, 6 We examined the associations between frailty and SCD separately by sex because cut-offs of frailty criteria are different between men and women,1 women have a higher prevalence of frailty as compared to men,15 and it has been suggested that the biological drivers of frailty may be sex-specific.1,16 Lastly, we assessed whether frailty and cognitive associations exist before cognitive impairment.

METHODS

Participants &amp; Setting

Participants were drawn from the Vanderbilt Memory &amp; Aging Project (VMAP), a longitudinal study investigating vascular health and brain aging.17 Inclusion required participants to be community dwelling, age 60 years or older, speak English, have adequate auditory and visual acuity, and have a reliable study partner. At eligibility, participants underwent detailed medical history and record review, clinical interview (including functional questionnaire and Clinical Dementia Rating18) with the participant and informant, and neuropsychological assessment. Participants were excluded with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contraindication, history of neurologic disease (e.g., dementia, stroke), heart failure, major psychiatric illness, head injury with loss of consciousness longer than 5 minutes, or a systemic or terminal illness affecting follow-up participation. At enrollment, participants completed a comprehensive evaluation, including, but not limited to, a physical examination, frailty assessment, medical record and medication review, clinical interview with questionnaires, neuropsychological assessment, and echocardiography. Participants were excluded here for a cognitive diagnosis other than normal cognition (NC) or MCI19 or if they were missing covariate data (Figure 1 lists exclusion details). The Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved the protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to data collection.

Frailty Assessment

Frailty was defined as physical frailty and assessed using the Cardiovascular Health Study standardized criteria1 and quantified using previously published methods:17

Poor endurance:

Two exhaustion items from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.20

Low physical activity:

Weekly activity (measured in kilocalories) using a short version of the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire.21

Slowness:

Slow gait speed for time to complete a 15-feet walk test. Gait speed was converted to meters per second (m/sec).

Weakness:

weak dominant handgrip strength measured using a handheld dynamometer (measured in kilograms), stratified by sex and body mass index (BMI) quartiles.

Shrinkage:

Unintentional weight loss of 10 lbs or more or more than 5% body weight over the previous 12 months.

All frailty variables were recorded as continuous or ordinal (e.g., shrinkage) measurements. A continuous composite frailty score was constructed by converting raw scores from each of the first four frailty components (i.e., poor endurance, low physical activity, slowness, and weakness) into a standardized z-score using the mean and standard deviation (SD) values, stratified by sex, from all VMAP participants, and taking an average of the four z-scores. Higher composite values indicate more frailty.22

For descriptive purposes only, an independent categorical distinction of frailty was created. Categories of frailty included frail/pre‐frail (defined as positive for one or more of the frailty criteria) and not frail (defined as negative for all frailty criteria). Previously reported definitions based on sex‐specific cut points for each frailty criterion were used.1

Objective &amp; Subjective Cognitive Assessment

As part of a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment previously described,17 participants completed a brief objective cognitive screening tool, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale, as a measure of global cognition.23 Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher values indicating better cognition. SCD was defined as a self‐perceived decline in cognitive capacity as measured by the Everyday Cognition scale (ECog)24 questionnaire, consistent with published criteria.7 Participants’ total ECog score reflects overall SCD, and ECog subscales assessed SCD related to memory, planning, organization, and attention. SCD domains were assessed due to the possible preferential association of frailty with specific cognitive domains of memory,4 attention, and organization.5, 6

Covariate Ascertainment

BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms and height in meters squared (kg/m2). Systolic blood pressure was the mean of two measurements. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a current fasting blood glucose of 126 mg/dL or higher, hemoglobin A1C of 6.5% or higher, or the use of oral hypoglycemic or insulin medication. Medication review determined anti-hypertensive medication use. Left ventricular hypertrophy was defined on echocardiogram (left ventricle mass index &gt;115 g/m2 in men, &gt;95 g/m2 in women). Self‐reported atrial fibrillation was corroborated by any one of the following sources: echocardiogram, cardiac MRI, documentation of prior procedure/ablation for atrial fibrillation, or use of medication for atrial fibrillation. Current cigarette smoking (yes/no within the year before study enrollment) was ascertained by self‐report. Self‐reported prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) with medical record evidence included coronary heart disease, angina, or myocardial infarction. The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP) score was calculated by applying points by sex for age, systolic blood pressure accounting for use of antihypertensive medication, diabetes mellitus, current cigarette smoking, left ventricular hypertrophy, CVD, and atrial fibrillation.25 Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping was quantified from DNA extracted from whole blood samples. APOE ε4 carrier (APOE4) status was defined as positive (ε2/ε4, ε3/ε4, ε4/ε4) or negative (ε2/ε2, ε2/ε3, ε3/ε3).

Statistical Analysis

Clinical characteristic comparisons between cognitive diagnostic groups and by sex were conducted using Kruskal-Wallis tests (continuous variables) and Pearson’s chi-square tests (categorical variables). Histograms (for each outcome) and scatter plots (between outcomes and predictors) stratified by sex were visually assessed to facilitate choice of models. Although MoCA and ECog outcomes could be regarded as continuous variables, given the small number of observed unique values in the sample, they were treated as ordinal variables. Therefore, proportional odds models for ordinal outcomes were used where the interpretation is based on a single odds ratio (OR) assumed to apply equally to all levels of outcomes (see Supplementary Methods and Figure 1–2).

For hypothesis testing, the multivariate proportional odds models related the frailty composite to objective cognition (MoCA) and ECog total, stratified by sex. Sex‐stratified analyses were completed due to different cutoffs denoting frailty in men and women.1 Covariates included age, education, Geriatric Depression Scale26 (minus points allocated for cognitive complaint questions), cognitive diagnosis, BMI, FSRP (minus points assigned for age), and APOE4 status. For each model, the proportional odds assumption was visually assessed for predictors of interest.27

Secondary analyses stratified by sex were conducted using proportional odds models with identical covariates to relate the frailty composite to ECog domain scores of memory, planning, organization, and attention. Additionally, we assessed whether individual components of frailty were related to ECog total and domain scores. We selected grip strength14 and gait speed13 as frailty components of interest given previous research suggesting their sensitivity to predict dementia. For analyses with gait speed as the predictor, height was included as a covariate instead of BMI.

Sensitivity analyses excluding statistical outliers (defined as ≥4 SDs from the mean) of predictors and outcomes were conducted for each model. Interaction terms between cognitive diagnosis and each frailty measure on ECog outcomes were also examined to assess for differential associations by diagnosis given that greater frailty is associated with an increased risk of MCI.3,28

Lastly, we completed exploratory analyses in the NC group to assess if frailty was associated with SCD before the onset of cognitive impairment. Significance threshold was set at p&lt;0.05. Analyses were conducted using R v.3.4.2 (www.r-project.org) with the orm function in the rms package for proportional odds models.

RESULTS

Participant Characteristics

Participants included 177 men ranging from 60 to 90 years of age (72 ± 6 y). Table 1 lists the demographic, cognitive, and frailty characteristics of the sample, and Table 2 describes the frailty and cognitive measures of the sample. Within the entire cohort (n = 306), 23% of men were categorized as pre‐frail or frail compared with 46% of women (p&lt;0.001). Similarly, men had faster gait speed (p&lt;0.001) and stronger grip strength (p&lt;0.001) than women.

Frailty, Objective Cognition, and SCD in Men

In men, the frailty composite score was not associated with MoCA performance (p=0.08), ECog total (p=0.99), or any of the ECog domain scores (p-values&gt;0.21; Table 3). Gait speed was related to MoCA performance (OR=4.1; p=0.03), but this finding was attenuated in sensitivity analyses excluding one statistical outlier (OR=2.9; p=0.11; Table 3). Analyses showed that higher grip strength was associated with more SCD (ECog total: OR=1.04; P=0 .04 and ECog memory OR=1.04; p=0.02), although in analyses that were stratified by grip strength (&lt;40, &gt;40) the association was no longer significant (p values&gt;0.05).

In men, a modest frailty composite x diagnosis interaction was observed for ECog planning (p=0.04). Stratified analyses by diagnosis revealed no main effect for either the NC (OR=0.47, 95%CI = 0.21–1.02; p=0.06) or MCI (OR=1.73, 95%CI = 0.77–3.90; p=0.18) groups. The NC finding approaching significance appeared to be driven by the relationship between grip strength and cognitive complaint discussed earlier. No other interactions were noted (p-values&gt;0.06).

In analyses restricted only to the NC group, similar findings were noted (Supplementary Table 1).

Frailty, Objective Cognition, and SCD in Women

In women, the frailty composite score was associated with MoCA performance (OR=0.56, p=0.04), a finding slightly attenuated in sensitivity analysis excluding one statistical outlier (OR=0.59; p=0.08; Table 3 and Figure 2a). Frailty composite score was associated with ECog total (OR=2.27; p=0.02), ECog planning (OR=2.63; p=0.02), and ECog organization (OR=2.39; p=0.03; Table 3 and Figure 2B). Thus every unit increase in the frailty composite score resulted in two to three times greater odds of increased cognitive complaints. Among the frailty components, gait speed was not associated with MoCA (p=0.30), but it was related to ECog total (OR=0.06; p=0.003) and ECog memory (OR=0.03; p&lt;0.001; Table 3 and Figure 2C). Thus for every unit (defined as 0.1 m/s) increase in gait speed, there was a 32% to 42% likelihood of having fewer cognitive complaints. Grip strength was only associated with ECog planning (OR=0.91; p=0.04; Table 3 and Figure 2D). Findings were unchanged in sensitivity analyses.

In women, no frailty composite x diagnosis interactions were noted (p-values&gt;0.09).

In analyses restricted only to the NC group, similar findings were noted (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figures 3 and 4).

Discussion

This cross‐sectional study is among the first to evaluate relationships between objective frailty criteria and SCD, which were previously associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. In older adults free of clinical stroke and dementia, we found that greater frailty was associated with more SCD. This link was largely restricted to female participants where greater overall frailty was associated with higher SCD, characterized by SCD based on executive functioning. Frailty components appeared to relate to different aspects of SCD. This overall pattern persisted when the sample was restricted to cognitively normal older participants. These results could not be statistically explained by shared vascular risk factors.

Our findings extend the literature by describing different patterns of associations of frailty and its components with SCD while identifying potential disparate findings between men and women. The observed association between frailty composite and ECog total score, a global measure of functional abilities,24 is consistent with research relating frailty and functional abilities. 1, 29 Additionally, the frailty composite score showed a seemingly preferential association with executive functioning complaints (i.e., planning and organization). This pattern matches research suggesting that frailty is associated with objective markers of executive functioning but less so with episodic memory.28

Additionally, analysis of the frailty components revealed different associations with subjective cognition in women, a pattern not previously established. Specifically, grip strength related only to SCD based on executive functioning, whereas gait speed was related to memory‐based as well as global SCD. Gait speed has been implicated as one of the more sensitive components of the frailty phenotype30–32 and is thought to be subserved by brain structures including the striatum, substantia nigra, and motor cortices. These regions, particularly the striatum, show early signs of AD pathology including amyloid deposition33 and neurofibrillary tangles34 that are thought to interfere with gait speed. Similarly, SCD, including memory‐based SCD, is linked to the earliest pathologic changes of AD (e.g., increased amyloid deposition) in nondemented older adults.10, 35 Our results lend further support for the possibility that specific components of frailty and SCD share common underlying pathologies, including AD.28 Conversely, emerging neuropathologic evidence suggests that frailty, when quantified as a composite, is most strongly related to macroinfarcts,36, 37 as compared with other neuropathologies such as AD. In combination with behavioral data,28 this finding highlights the possibility of a shared non‐AD pathway, such as cardiovascular disease or inflammatory processes, in frailty and SCD based on executive functioning in women. Individuals presenting clinically with subtle grip strength decrements or executive-based SCD may be ideal candidates for interventions targeted at improving cardiovascular health or reducing inflammation.

Interestingly, the described frailty and cognitive patterns observed above were primarily seen in women. In contrast, frailty (composite or individual components) was generally unrelated to cognition in men. Inspection of effect sizes suggests that these differences are most notable among the association with subjective cognition as compared with objective cognition. Additionally, we documented a higher prevalence of pre‐frailty in women than in men that aligns with a large body of existing research (Collard et al15). The differential expression of early frailty in men and women, combined with the disparate associations by sex, could implicate that frailty and subjective cognition presents differently by sex. Specifically, the proposed mechanisms underlying the development of frailty and cognitive changes, such as inflammation,38, 39 oxidative stress,40, 41 and hormone levels (e.g., estrogen,42 testosterone,43 and dehydroepiandrosterone44) may differentially impact interrelated organ systems in women and men.

Conversely, others have failed to find a sex-difference in the association between frailty and cognition.6 Methodological differences could be contributing to disparate findings, such as our consideration of frailty on a continuum rather than a dichotomous (present/absent) state. One previous study employing the same continuous frailty composite found null sex interactions between frailty and longitudinal cognition.2 However, prior work calculated the frailty composite using the entire sample whereas we created sex-specific composite measures. The rationale for our derivation was driven by the sex differences in factors that underlie each of the frailty components (i.e., height, lean mass, strength)1 and could lead to sex-specific frailty interpretations. Replication is needed to further understand possible sex differences in frailty and cognitive presentations.

Overall, the patterns observed between frailty and SCD persisted in cognitively unimpaired women. Although exploratory, this novel finding aligns with work linking frailty and objective cognition in cognitively unimpaired individuals,45 suggesting these associations develop before overt impairment and are not driven by emerging pathology. Clinically, individuals with no cognitive impairment but early physical frailty represent a target population for initiating interventions to reduce the risk of further decline, particularly given frailty may be improved or reversed.46 Overall, findings highlight the potential importance of assessing frailty and SCD in clinical practice for consideration of early interventions in these potentially at-risk individuals.

Our study also failed to find an association between frailty and objective cognition in men or women, in contrast to previous literature.6, 45 One reason for this discrepant finding could be a sample size and power issue, given that associations failed to reach the significance threshold after exclusion of one statistical outlier and inspection of ORs suggested very similar effects sizes between models. Additionally, the current study included a cognitive screener as opposed to a comprehensive cognitive protocol.6, 47 Alternatively, different cohort characteristics across studies could explain these divergent findings because the current study was composed of primarily non‐frail individuals (&gt;60%).

Our study has several strengths. First, frailty was measured through a standardized and comprehensive assessment protocol. Second, our participants represent a relatively healthy cohort of community-dwelling older adults with a low prevalence of cardiovascular disease and categorical frailty, allowing examination of early frailty markers without cardiovascular disease confounders. We also utilized a composite (continuous) frailty score with inherently increased sensitivity to examine the association between early markers of aging, including frailty and SCD. Third, the consideration of multiple confounders, such as depressed mood,48, 49 APOE ε4,50 and FSRP (given the established role of vascular disease in the association between frailty and dementia51), also strengthens our findings.

Despite these strengths, several limitations must be considered when interpreting our results. First, models were cross-sectional and cannot speak to causality. Longitudinal studies are needed to understand the temporal nature of the sex-specific associations reported here. Second, the cohort is relatively homogeneous including predominantly white, well‐educated, and healthy older adults, limiting generalizability. Third, while we were sufficiently powered to detect small to medium effects (data not shown), our sample size is smaller than those studies examining frailty and objective cognitive decline. Therefore, our results should be replicated in a larger cohort. However, the inclusion of SCD, the novel findings of an association with frailty, and the differential findings by sex from this study add to prior work.

In conclusion, we report a cross‐sectional association between increasing early frailty markers and increased SCD, particularly in women and before overt or objective cognitive impairment. The association of frailty components with specific SCD domains parallels previous work relating frailty to different aspects of neuropathology and adds to knowledge about the interaction between cognition and frailty. Further work examining underlying mechanisms linking early changes in frailty with subjective and objective cognition are warranted with a specific focus on the potential for differential expression in women and men.
