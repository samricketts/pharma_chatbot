Background:

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) is one of the most expensive health conditions in the United States. Understanding the potential cost-savings or cost-enhancements of Health Information Technology (HIT) can help policymakers understand the capacity of HIT investment to promote population health and health equity for patients with ADRD.

Objectives:

This study examined access to hospital-based HIT infrastructure and its association with racial and ethnic disparities in Medicare payments for patients with ADRD.

Research Design:

We used the 2017 Medicare Beneficiary Summary File, inpatient claims, and the American Hospital Annual survey. Our study focused on community-dwelling Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who were diagnosed with ADRD. Our study focused on hospital-based telehealth-post discharge (e.g., remote patient monitoring) and telehealth-treatment (e.g., psychiatric and addiction treatment) services.

Results:

Results showed that hospital-based telehealth post-discharge services were associated with significantly higher total Medicare payment and acute inpatient Medicare payment per person per year among patients with ADRD. The associations between hospital-based telehealth treatment services and payments were not significant. The reductions of the payments associated with telehealth post-discharge and treatment services were more pronounced among Black patients with ADRD. Telehealth treatment services were associated with significant payment reductions among Hispanic patients with ADRD.

Conclusion:

Results showed that having hospital-based telehealth services might be cost-enhancing at the population level but cost-saving for Black and Hispanic patients with ADRD. Results suggested that personalized HIT services might be necessary to reduce the cost associated with ADRD treatment for racial and ethnic minority groups.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) is considered one of the most expensive health conditions, with total payments estimated at $305 billion in 2020, and projected costs estimated to reach $1.1 trillion in 2050.1 More than 5.5 million Americans suffer from ADRD. This number is expected to reach 14 million Americans by 2060. Black older adults (65 years and older) are about twice as likely, and Hispanic older adults are about 1.5 times as likely to have dementia than White older adults.2–4 Conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, which increase the risk of developing ADRD, contribute to the high prevalence of ADRD among racial and ethnic minority groups.5–6

Evidence suggests that racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to have later-stage diagnoses, experience delays in timely primary care, and lack access to coordinated care.7 Among Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD, Black patients had the highest Medicare payments, with a total average annual payment of $29,934 per person; Hispanic patients averaged a total annual payment of $23,725 per person and White patients averaged a total annual payment of $22,135 per person in 2020.8 Understanding these cost disparities is a critical step to achieving the Triple Aim of Health Care (i.e., improving care and health while lowering cost), and finding approaches that address these cost disparities are important for equity research.

Care coordination strategies can improve the quality of care and quality of life for patients with ADRD.9–11 Care coordination can be successfully achieved by leveraging health information technology (HIT) systems that encompass efficient electronic data sharing,12–15 health information exchanges (HIEs),16–17 and automatic notifications regarding care transitions.18–20 For example, evidence has suggested that automatic notifications of ED visits, inpatient admissions, and discharges to primary care providers could reduce the risk of readmissions among Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries and encourage timely follow-ups.20 A recent study suggested that patients with ADRD treated in hospitals that utilized HIT care coordination and patient engagement services reported lower rates of preventable ED visits.21

While HIT can improve efficiency, Black and Hispanic patients with ADRD have less access to HIT-integrated health care systems compared to their Non-Hispanic White counterparts.22–23 A recent study delineated a conceptual framework for racial and ethnic disparities in ADRD care and discussed how the HIT-supported care coordination model could reduce structural racism and discrimination (e.g., racial residential segregation and structural barriers in health care) for patients with ADRD.24 Building on that model, this present study provided empirical evidence on the association between the HIT infrastructure and racial and ethnic disparities in health care costs among patients with ADRD.

In particular, the study examined the association between hospital-based HIT infrastructure with Medicare payments among patients with ADRD by race and ethnicity. We hypothesized that HIT infrastructures promoting care coordination might reduce Medicare payment, especially for Black and Hispanic patients with ADRD. For instance, improved HIT-supported services can improve care coordination, identify patient needs and cultural preferences, and thus reduce overall costs for racial and ethnic minority groups. We expect that results can be helpful for future evaluations of telehealth capacity-building efforts that aim to improve HIT investment and designs for racial and ethnic minority aging populations.

METHODS

Data

We used the linked data sets of the 2017 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare (CMS) 100% inpatient claims data and Medicare Beneficiary Summary File. These data were further linked with the American Hospital Annual (AHA) survey to obtain the hospital characteristics and hospital-based HIT measures.25 Finally, we linked the American Community Survey and the Area Health Resource File to capture zip-code and county-level measures that were commonly used in the literature.

Our study focused on community-dwelling Medicare FFS beneficiaries with a diagnosis of ADRD aged 65 and older and who had at least one hospital visit in 2017. Elderly patients with Medicare Advantage or Medicare and Medicaid dual-eligible patients were not included. We used the definition of ADRD reported by the CMS chronic conditions data warehouse codes.26 We focused on non-Hispanic White (White), Black, and Hispanic patients with ADRD.

Outcome measures

To be consistent with the literature, we employed the Medicare payment measures used in the 2021 Medicare payment Alzheimer’s disease facts and figures special report, Race, Ethnicity and Alzheimer’s in America.8 Outcome measures were obtained from the Medicare Beneficiary Summary Cost and Use file. We used the “acute inpatient Medicare payments” to estimate its variation and association with hospital-based HIT. We created a “total Medicare payments per person per year” variable as the summation of Medicare payments on major services, including acute inpatient, other inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, home health, hospital outpatient, ambulatory surgery center, anesthesia, Part B drug, evaluation and management, Part B physician, other procedure, imaging, test, other Part B carrier, and Part D Medicare payments.

Key independent variables

Hospital-based HIT measures were obtained in the Facilities and Services section of the AHA Annual Survey. Seven measures were included: telehealth consultation and office visits; eICU; telehealth stroke care; telehealth psychiatric and addiction treatment; telehealth remote patient monitoring post-discharge, and telehealth remote patient monitoring ongoing chronic care management. Hospital-based HIT were grouped into two categories: 1) the telehealth-post-discharge group, which included the services of the remote patient monitoring post-discharge, or the remote patient monitoring ongoing chronic care management; 2) the telehealth-treatment group, which included services that supported telehealth consultation and office visits, eICU, stroke care, or psychiatric and addiction treatment.

In the sensitivity analysis, we tested different measures of telehealth indices. In the appendix, we presented results using (1) the total number of telehealth services adopted by the hospital, (2) any telehealth services adopted, and (3) the cross-tabulation of telehealth-post-discharge and telehealth-treatment services. Results were similar (Appendix 1).

Other independent variables

Other independent variables at the beneficiary level included race/ethnicity, age, sex, and health. We used Research Triangle Institute Race Code: Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic. Health indicators included were those considered as common co-existing chronic conditions of ADRD8: acute myocardial infarction; asthma; atrial fibrillation; heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); depression; diabetes; hyperlipidemia; and hypertension. Diagnoses of these diseases were also obtained from the CMS chronic conditions data warehouse codes.26 Covariates at the hospital level included teaching status, type of controls, and bed size. Area-level variables included rurality indices indicating three categories: rural, micropolitan, and metropolitan area. In addition, we included high school education; poverty as the percentage of people at the poverty level by the zip code; the proportion of Black people (divided by the total population) in that zip code using the ACS 5-year (2011–2015) average data; and rates of physicians per 1,000 residents at the county-level.

In the sensitivity analysis, we tested the model with different geographic specifications. We used the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), which allowed for “rankings of neighborhoods by socioeconomic disadvantage in a region of interest” (e.g., at the state or national level). ADI is a composite measure that includes population-level factors across the domains of income, education, employment, and housing quality which can be used to inform health delivery and policy, especially for the most “disadvantaged neighborhoods” 27 We categorized beneficiaries’ resident areas into three categories: ADI below the 25th percentile (the best), the 25th – 75th percentile, and the 75th percentile (the most disadvantaged areas). Results were similar (see Appendix 2).

Analysis

Our unit of analysis was at the beneficiary-hospital level. Approximately 70% of beneficiaries visited the same hospital, 22% were admitted in two hospitals, 6% were admitted in three hospitals, and 2% were admitted in more than three hospitals. We created beneficiary-hospital level data to account for situations when beneficiaries visited multiple hospitals, and we adjusted for the number of visits in the regression analyses.

We first presented the likelihood of being treated in hospitals with telehealth-post discharge and telehealth-treatment services for patients with ADRD by race and ethnicity. We then presented and compared beneficiary, hospital, and geographic characteristics. Given the skewed distributions of the payments, generalized linear models with log link and gamma distributions were used to estimate the association between telehealth measures and Medicare payments. 28–30 Interaction terms between race and ethnicity (Blacks and Hispanics) and telehealth-post discharge and telehealth-treatment services were included in the regressions to test the different associations by race and ethnicity. We then reported the marginal effects of telehealth-post discharge and telehealth-treatment services for each race and ethnicity group. Medicare reimbursement models vary by state policies (e.g., the State of Maryland uses the global budget review model, now called the total cost of care model, for hospital reimbursement). Hence, state-fixed effects were applied to all the regressions. In the sensitivity analysis, we also presented the results of clustered standard errors to help account for heterogeneity. Results were similar (see Appendix 3).

RESULTS

Compared to non-Hispanic White patients, Black patients with ADRD were less likely to be treated in hospitals with telehealth-post discharge services but were more likely to be treated in hospitals with telehealth-treatment services (Figure 1). Hispanic patients with ADRD were more likely to be treated in hospitals with telehealth-treatment services, and the likelihood of being treated in hospitals with telehealth-post discharge services was similar to that of White patients.

Table 1 presents the total Medicare and acute inpatient Medicare payment per person per year by race and ethnicity according to whether hospitals had HIT infrastructures. Results showed that the payments were significantly higher among White patients with ADRD who were treated in hospitals with telehealth-post discharge or telehealth-treatment services. However, the total Medicare payment was significantly lower among Black patients with ADRD who were treated in hospitals with telehealth post-discharge or telehealth treatment services. Acute inpatient Medicare payments were slightly higher among Black patients with ADRD who were treated in hospitals with telehealth treatment services and Hispanic patients with ADRD who were treated in hospitals with telehealth post-discharge services.

Summaries of beneficiary, hospital, and community level characteristics are presented in Table 2. Compared to White patients, Black and Hispanic patients with ADRD had significantly higher acute inpatient Medicare payments and total Medicare payments per person per year. Black and Hispanic patients, on average, were younger. Rates of coexisting ADRD comorbidities varied by race and ethnicity. Compared to White patients, Black patients were more likely to have asthma, heart failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, and less likely to have depression and COPD; Hispanic patients were also more likely to have diabetes and hypertension. Compared to White patients, Black and Hispanic patients with ADRD were more likely to live in areas with high poverty rates and low education levels.

After controlling for beneficiary, hospital, and area-level characteristics, results showed that telehealth post-discharge services were significantly associated with higher total Medicare payment (coefficient=0.034, p-value&lt;0.001) and acute inpatient Medicare payment (coefficient =0.048, p-value &lt;0.001) (Table 3). Telehealth-treatment services were associated with higher total Medicare payments (coefficient =0.007, p-value =0.34) and acute inpatient Medicare payments (coefficient =0.01, p-value =0.24), but these findings were not statistically significant. Black and Hispanic patients with ADRD had higher total Medicare payments and acute inpatient Medicare payments compared to Whites.

Coefficients of interaction terms between telehealth-post discharge services and Black patients with ADRD were significantly negative in the regressions of total Medicare payments (coefficient =−0.10, p-value &lt;0.001) and acute inpatient Medicare payments (coefficient =−0.11, p-value &lt;0.001). Coefficients of interaction terms of telehealth-treatment services and Black were also significantly negative in both payment regressions (coefficient =−0.1, p-value &lt;0.001 and coefficient =−0.07, p-value =0.03). The coefficients of the interaction terms of telehealth-treatment services and Hispanic were significantly negative (coefficient =−0.12, p-value &lt;0.001 and coefficient =−0.1, p-value =0.05).

Table 3 suggested that being treated in hospitals that offered telehealth-post discharge services was associated with reduced costs for Black patients with ADRD. Hence, we calculated the marginal effects of telehealth-post discharge services (Table 4). Results showed a decrease of $1,104 ($32,788 vs. $33,892) in the total Medicare payment and a decrease of $569 ($14,194 vs. 14,763) in the acute inpatient Medicare payment per person per year when Black patients with ADRD were treated in hospitals with telehealth-post discharge infrastructure.

Table 3 suggested that telehealth-treatment services were associated with reduced Medicare payments for Black and Hispanic patients with ADRD. Similarly, we calculated the marginal effects of telehealth-treatment services on cost (Table 4). Results showed a reduction of $1,543 ($32,318 vs. $33,860) in the total Medicare payment and a reduction of $281 ($14,432 vs. 14,714) in the acute inpatient Medicare payment when Black patients with ADRD were treated in hospitals with telehealth-post discharge infrastructure. Reductions were also found among Hispanic patients with ADRD (i.e., a reduction of $2,079 ($33,309 vs. $35,388) in the total Medicare payment and a reduction of $628 ($14,872 vs. $15,500) in the acute inpatient Medicare payment when Hispanic patients with ADRD were treated in hospitals with the telehealth-treatment infrastructure.

DISCUSSION

Building healthy and sustainable aging-friendly health care structures requires population-based integrated ADRD care initiatives at the health care system level. The 2020 National Health IT Priorities for Research report by the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology has acknowledged how HIT can bridge gaps in the continuity of care for underserved patients with complex health needs and by improving provider access to health information.31 Understanding the potential cost-saving or cost-enhancing of HIT adoption can help policymakers understand the capacity of HIT investment for population health and health equity.

The results of our study showed that hospital-based telehealth post-discharge services were associated with significantly higher total Medicare payment and acute inpatient Medicare payment per person per year among patients with ADRD. The associations between hospital-based telehealth treatment services and payments were not significant. In addition, results showed that these associations varied by patients’ races and ethnicities. The reductions of the payments associated with telehealth post-discharge and treatment services were more pronounced among Black patients with ADRD. Telehealth treatment services were associated with significant payment reductions among Hispanic patients with ADRD. Results of the study suggested that adopting HIT infrastructure might be cost-enhancing overall, but HIT can be cost-saving among racial and ethnic minority groups who could benefit from telehealth services.

Racial and ethnic group members with ADRD are at high risk for uncoordinated and low-quality care, including higher rates of hospitalizations, higher levels of impairment at the time of referral to ADRD services, and lower rates of being prescribed anti-dementia medications. By incorporating HIT in care coordination and treatment, racial and ethnic minority individuals, especially those who live in underrepresented communities dealing with complex health issues,22–23, 32–33 may receive more informed and timely follow-up health care. Telehealth services include remote patient monitoring and ongoing chronic care management, two substantial components of care coordination. Having these functions can be particularly helpful for ADRD patients with complex medical needs who require frequent medical care. Studies have shown that HIT services focused on improved patient monitoring and care management contribute to better health outcomes for chronically-ill patients who often face difficulties managing self-care regimens.8 This may be particularly beneficial for Black and Hispanic patients with a disproportionately high prevalence of ADRD who might encounter unique barriers to access care.34 This study supports the notion that HIT services may potentially assist clinicians with ADRD patient monitoring, providing early diagnosis and treatment for ADRD patients, improving the management of complex and co-existing conditions, and working towards improved communication between providers and caregivers.

More research is needed to understand how to design telehealth systems to best engage Hispanic patients with ADRD and their caregivers proactively. We speculated that HIT might be able to improve timely patient-physician communications and encourage patient empowerment. Recent surveys of patients with ADRD and their caregivers identified that Hispanic patients with ADRD and their caregivers were more likely to report having language barriers or a lack of health literacy and facing substantial social stigma compared to their White counterparts. They often perceive and experience discrimination, distrust health care providers, and have low confidence in communication.8,35 We also acknowledge that Hispanics are not one monolithic group. Patterns of health care utilization and expenditures, cultural background, immigrant and citizenship status, and patient preferences vary substantially across Hispanic subgroups (e.g., Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, etc.).36–37

Due to the cognitive decline associated with ADRD that often impacts patients’ ability to function independently, many patients must rely on families to play a caregiver role or hire caregivers. Although we were not able to incorporate caregivers’ characteristics and preferences in the analysis due to data limitations, we acknowledge that caregivers of patients with ADRD have an essential role in liaising between providers and patients. Providers using telehealth/medicine services for this patient population need to consider potential technological barriers for caregivers in terms of access to technology and their ability to utilize the software associated with the technology.38 Engaging caregivers of patients with ADRD for home-based telemedicine/health services can help patients adhere to care visits and medication management.39–40

Our study has several limitations. First, we examined broad associations between hospital-based HIT services and cost. Future studies may further investigate the impact of HIT on health care access and quality and consider patient disease severity, stages of ADRD development, and ADRD caregivers’ access to HIT when data are available. Second, our study focused on community-dwelling residents. Over 58% of older adults with ADRD are community-dwelling (i.e., remain in their residences versus living in custodial nursing facilities).41 However, individuals with ADRD often move between nursing facilities, hospitals, and homes rather than remaining solely in their residences or nursing facilities.42 Future studies on ADRD patients should examine the role of HIT in post-acute care settings (e.g., long-term care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies). Finally, our study focused on Medicare FFS beneficiaries with ADRD diagnoses. We were not able to observe the health care patterns of ADRD patients who were dual eligible, enrolled in Medicare Advantage, or other private health insurance. Due to data limitations, our measures of Medicare payments did not cover patients’ out-of-pocket payments.

Conclusion

It is an opportune time to understand barriers to implementing robust HIT systems.43 The literature suggested HIT-supported care coordination has the potential to break down longstanding silos between health care providers, community-based organizations, and social service agencies serving people with ADRD, particularly for racial and ethnic minority populations. The results of this study offer evidence of effective HIT services associated with reduced Medicare payments. Evidence suggests that HIT can be designed to make care integration and HIT implementation sustainable for underserved populations with ADRD. Results of our study also suggested that personalized HIT design (e.g., post-discharge services for Black patients and treatment services for Hispanic patients with ADRD) is critical for racial and ethnic minority populations to address heterogeneous barriers and preferences in treatment.

Note:

Data source: the linked datasets of 2017 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare 100% inpatient claims data, Medicare Beneficiary Summary File, American Hospital Annual Survey, American Community Survey, and the Area Health Resource File.

This study focused on community-dwelling Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) that were aged 65 and older and had at least one hospital visit in 2017. Elderly with Medicare Advantage or dual eligibilities were not included. ADRD was defined using the CMS chronic conditions data warehouse codes. Non-Hispanic White (White), Black, and Hispanic patients with ADRD are reported where non-Hispanic Whites were used as the reference group.

The specific telehealth-related definitions of the measures analyzed were quoted from the AHA annual survey 2017 reference guide:

• “Consultation and office visits - A broad variety of technologies and tactics to deliver virtual medical, public health, health education delivery and support services using telecommunications technologies.

• eICU: An electronic intensive care unit (eICU), also referred to as a tele-ICU, is a form of telemedicine that uses state of the art technology to provide an additional layer of critical care service. The goal of an eICU is to optimize clinical experience and facilitate 24-hour a day care by ICU caregivers.

• Stroke care: Stroke telemedicine is a consultative modality that facilitates the care of patients with acute stroke by specialists at stroke centers.

• Psychiatric and addiction treatment: Telepsychiatry can involve a range of services including psychiatric evaluations, therapy, patient education, and medication management.

• Remote patient monitoring: The use of digital technologies to collect medical and other forms of health data from individuals in one location and electronically transmit the information securely to health care providers in a different location for assessment and recommendation.”

NOTE:

• Data source: the linked datasets of 2017 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare 100% inpatient claims data, Medicare Beneficiary Summary File, American Hospital Annual Survey, American Community Survey, and the Area Health Resource File.

• This study focused on community-dwelling Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) that were aged 65 and older and had at least one hospital visit in 2017. Elderly with Medicare Advantage or dual eligibilities were not included. ADRD was defined using the CMS chronic conditions data warehouse codes. Non-Hispanic White (White), Black, and Hispanic patients with ADRD are reported where non-Hispanic Whites were used as the reference group.

• Percentages are commonly rounded; as a result, the sum of the values may not always add to 100%.
