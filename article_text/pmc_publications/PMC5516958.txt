SUMMARY

γ-Secretase, a four-subunit transmembrane aspartic proteinase, is a highly valued drug target in Alzheimer’s disease and cancer. Despite significant progress in structural studies, the respective molecular mechanisms and binding modes of γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and modulators (GSMs) remain uncertain. Here we developed biotinylated cleavable-linker photoprobes based on the BMS-708163 GSI to study its interaction with γ-secretase. Comparison of four cleavable linkers indicated that the hydrazine-labile N-1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)ethyl (Dde) linker was cleaved most efficiently to release photolabeled and affinity-captured presenilin-1 (PS1), the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase. Peptide mapping showed that the BMS-708163-based probe photoinserted at L282 of PS1. This insertion site was consistent with the results of molecular dynamics simulations of the γ-secretase complex with inhibitor. Taken together, this work reveals the binding site of a GSI and offers insights into the mechanism of action of this class of inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

γ-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartic proteinase composed of four subunits: Aph-1, nicastrin (Nct), Pen-2 and presenilin (PS) (De Strooper, 2003), which is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme (Ahn, et al., 2010). Endoproteolysis of PS, which results in the formation of PS1-NTF (N-terminal fragment) and CTF (C-terminal fragment) heterodimer, is required for γ-secretase activation (Thinakaran, et al., 1996). γ-Secretase cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP), Notch and many other substrates. Aberrant cleavage of APP contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and abnormal Notch signaling promotes tumor growth (Crump, et al., 2013). Multiple classes of small molecules that target γ-secretase have been developed, including both inhibitors (GSIs) and modulators (GSMs). These small molecules bind either to the active site or to allosteric sites (Crump, et al., 2013), but the precise locations of these binding sites have been elusive. A recent 3.4 Å cryo EM structure of γ-secretase (Bai, et al., 2015) has shed light on the way in which the enzyme’s structure may account for its highly regulated yet variable function (Gertsik, et al., 2014), but many questions about the active site of γ-secretase and its interactions with small molecules remain.

Recently, we developed a series of chemical probes based on BMS-708163 (avagacestat), an arylsulfonamide GSI that was in clinical trials for AD (Coric, et al., 2012), and characterized their interaction with γ-secretase (Crump, et al., 2012; Crump, et al., 2016). Herein, we develop cleavable BMS-708163-based photoprobes and use them to identify a probe-labeled peptide within the intracellular loop of PS1 near the endoproteolytic site. Additionally, we provide a model of the binding site for BMS-708163 within the γ-secretase complex based on the insertion site of the photoprobe and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations..

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Development of cleavable arylsulfonamide photoprobes

We synthesized four biotinylated 163-BP3-based BMS-708163 probes with various cleavable linkers (Fig. 1A) by Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) of 163-BP3 with the requisite biotin-azide (see Supplemental information). The four linkers can be cleaved through different mechanisms: Dde-, diol-, azo- and DADPS-linkers are cleaved with hydrazine (N2H4) (Yang and Verhelst, 2013), sodium periodate (NaIO4) (Yang, et al., 2013), sodium hydrosulfite (Na2S2O4) (Blum, et al., 2013) and formic acid (CH2O2) (Szychowski, et al., 2010), respectively. As a control, we also included 163-BP3-PEG-biotin, which can be eluted with heat (Crump, et al., 2016). All five probes are potent γ-secretase inhibitors with IC50 (Aβ40) in the low nanomolar range, similar to the parent compound BMS-708163 (Fig, 1A and S1A). However, the IC50s of the probes varied slightly, with 163-BP3-diol-biotin being the most potent inhibitor of Aβ40 production (IC50 = 1.1 nM) and 163-BP3-DADPS-biotin being the least potent (IC50 = 8.0 nM).

Next we performed a side-by-side comparison of the efficiency of PS1-NTF photolabeling by all probes (Fig. S1B). First, we examined labeling efficiency by photolabeling HeLa membrane with 20 nM of each probe in the presence of 0.25% CHAPSO, affinity-capturing probe-labeled proteins on streptavidin, eluting them with 2 mM biotin in 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 70°C for 10 min, and analyzing the eluate by western blot for PS1-NTF. The photolabeling efficiencies of the probes correlated with their respective IC50 values, with the more potent probes labeling PS1-NTF more efficiently (Fig. S1B). We also determined the labeling efficiency in HeLa membranes after adjusting the concentration of each probe to take into account its IC50 value (each probe was used at 50X its own IC50). We observed close to equal labeling using these IC50-adjusted concentrations, although labeling of PS1-NTF by 163-BP3-azo-biotin was weaker than that achieved with the other probes (Fig. 1B).

163-BP3-Dde-biotin is a superior probe

We used samples labeled under these IC50-adjusted concentrations to optimize elution conditions for all the cleavable probes (Fig. 2 and S2). HeLa membrane was labeled with an IC50-adjusted concentration of a photoprobe and the labeled proteins were pulled down with streptavidin beads and eluted using two rounds of treatment with probe-specific cleavage conditions (elutions I and II). We then washed samples with 0.1% SDS and eluted a third time under harsh conditions with 2 mM biotin in 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 70°C for 10 min (elution III) to recover any probe-labeled proteins that had not been cleaved from the resin. Equivalent amounts of each elution were loaded onto SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot, probing for PS1-NTF. Cleavage of 163-BP3-Dde-biotin labeled proteins from streptavidin with 2% hydrazine + 0.05% SDS (elutions I and II) resulted in exhaustive elution of PS1-NTF, such that subsequent treatment with 2 mM biotin in 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 70°C (elution III) did not result in the elution of additional target protein (Fig. 2A). In contrast, cleavage-specific elution of 163-BP3-diol-biotin, 163-BP3-azo-biotin and 163-BP3-DADPS-biotin showed partial elution of probe-labeled PS1-NTF (Figure S2A and B, elutions I and II, Figure S2C, elution I), as notable quantities of PS1-NTF were also present in the subsequent heat-eluted samples (Figure S2A and B, elution III, Figure S2C, elution II). The cleavage of 163-BP3-diol-biotin with sodium periodate resulted in a shift in the probe-labeled PS1-NTF band on the western blot, which suggested that the cleavage conditions caused modification of PS1 and that this probe is not suitable for identifying the probe-labeled peptide(s) (Fig. 2B). It should also be noted that it was necessary to add 0.01% BSA to the formic acid cleavage cocktail in order to recover probe-labeled PS1-NTF when labeled by the DADPS linker probe. Presumably, PS1 is not compatible with the formic acid conditions and BSA serves as a carrier protein to help reduce PS1-NTF aggregation/instability. Taken together, the data suggested that 163-BP3-Dde-biotin was the most efficient probe for photolabeling and eluting PS1-NTF.

To confirm this, we labeled HeLa membrane side-by-side with 163-BP3-Dde-biotin, 163-BP3-diol-biotin and 163-BP3-azo-biotin, treated each sample with appropriate cleavage-specific conditions, and ran equivalent amounts of the eluate from each sample on SDS-PAGE followed by western blot for PS1-NTF (Fig. 2B). The sample labeled by 163-BP3-Dde-biotin showed ~4 times more PS1-NTF than the 163-BP3-diol-biotin-labeled sample and ~3 times more PS1-NTF than the 163-BP3-azo-biotin-labeled sample, confirming that 163-BP3-Dde-biotin was superior to the other probes at capturing and eluting PS1-NTF. More generally, these findings suggest that the Dde linker could be a preferred choice for developing cleavable chemical probes in the studies of membrane proteins and soluble proteins.

163-BP3-Dde-biotin photoinserts into residues 279–291 of PS1

Next, we performed a large scale photolabeling experiment with 163-BP3-Dde-biotin using membrane preparations from ANPP cells, in which all four subunits of γ-secretase are overexpressed (Kim, et al., 2003), to map its binding site on PS1. The ANPP cell membrane was photolabeled with 100 nM 163-BP3-Dde-biotin in the absence and presence of 10 μM parent compound BMS-708163. Labeled proteins were captured with streptavidin, eluted by linker cleavage with 2% hydrazine containing 0.05% SDS, and concentrated ~24-fold to give 60 μL of sample. Western blot analysis using 1 μL of sample showed that the labeling of PS1-NTF was specific, as it was blocked in the presence of BMS-708163 (data not shown). The remaining sample was prepared for proteomic analysis, digested with LysC/trypsin, and analyzed by nanoLC-MS using a Q Exactive spectrometer.

When seeking modified peptides that could reveal sites of photoinsertion, we limited our proteomics search space by assembling a database containing the sequences of the four recognized γ-secretase subunits together with those of the most abundant proteins detected by LC-MS/MS, such as streptavidin, keratins and ribosomal proteins. Modification corresponding to the anticipated product of photolabeling by 163-BP3-Dde-biotin followed by hydrazinolysis was permitted in the form of a C31ClF3H32N6O5S (692.179 Da) adduct on different subsets of amino acids residues. This search strategy carried an increased risk of false positives, but reduced the risk of missing a genuine modified peptide due to low scoring caused by atypical fragmentation in the MS/MS spectrum. Searching by this method led to identification of a probe-modified semitryptic fragment of PS1 with the sequence NETLFPALIYSST (residues 279-291 of PS1) (Fig. S3A). Comparison of extracted ion traces for this peptide showed that it was present in the digest of protein labeled without competition (Fig. 3A, pane 2), but undetectable when competitor was present (Fig. 3A, pane 4). The doubly-charged precursor ion leading to the identification had m/z = 1074.460 (monoisotopic), while the theoretical value for [M+2H]2+ of the proposed modified peptide was m/z = 1074.462 (mass discrepancy 1.9 ppm). Simulation of the peptide spectrum based on the product’s proposed elementary analysis closely matched the experiment (Fig. S3B). In the tandem mass spectrum, the site of modification was confined to L282 by detection of b2, b3, y8 and y9 ions lacking any modification by hydrazine-cleaved 163-BP3-Dde-biotin (Fig. 3B and S3C). Dehydrated b5, b7, b8 and b9 ions bearing the modification were also fully consistent with modification having occurred at L282, with the prevalence of dehydration tentatively attributed to loss of water at the previously reactive carbon of the benzophenone.

Next, we performed molecular dynamics simulations utilizing the recent cryo-EM structures of γ-secretase to model the probe binding site (PDB: 5FN2; Bai, et al., 2015)., Modeling studies using a combination of MOE Site Finder for initial ligand placement, our in-house docking program (AGDOCK) and the DESMOND MD program, revealed a binding pocket and preferred ligand orientation in excellent agreement with the experimental labeling of L282 (Fig. 4 and S4, see supporting information for details). We observe that the probe forms primary hydrophobic contacts with L150, L282 and F283 of PS1, with the sulfonamide interacting primarily through water molecules to R278 and the backbone carbonyl of P284. The amino NH of the ligand makes sustained contact with the backbone carbonyl of G382 and the carbonyl of the benzophenone accepts a hydrogen bond from S170 (Fig. 4 and S4).

Based on our analysis, we suggest that the combination of experimentally determined attachment site data and computational modeling is more likely to give reliable binding site results than computational modeling and docking alone. For example, a recent docking study suggested that BMS-708163 interacts directly with the catalytic residues and the chlorophenyl moiety points away from the aspartates (Somavarapu and Kepp, 2016) which is not congruent with our results.

Mechanism of action of BMS-708163

The cleavable arylsulfonamide photoprobe, 163-BP3-Dde-biotin, developed herein led us to a novel finding that BMS-708163 engages with the inhibitory loop of PS1 within the γ-secretase complex. The probe-labeled residue, L282, is close to the site of PS1 endoproteolysis which occurs between T291 and A299 (Podlisny, et al., 1997) and is required for activation of γ-secretase. The endoproteolytic loop is highly functional and, when intact, maintains PS1 as a zymogen (Li, et al., 2000). Moreover, a clinical mutation in which the entire endoproteolysis site is deleted (residue 290-319, known as PS1ΔE9), results in an active γ-secretase and causes AD (Steiner, et al., 1999). Previous studies have proposed two different mechanisms of action for GSIs, one that involves blocking the substrate from entering the active site (Fukumori, et al., 2010) and the other where GSIs position the catalytic aspartates in an orientation that prevents catalysis (Ahn, et al., 2010). The second model is supported by the finding that full length, catalytically inactive D257A and D385A PS1 mutants can still bind substrates (Xia, et al., 2000), but not the active site-directed inhibitor JC-8 (Ahn, et al., 2010). Whether BMS-708163 is preventing substrate entry, separating the catalytic aspartates, or both remains to be investigated. The finding that the 163-BP3-Dde-biotin attachment site on PS1-NTF is in a region that forms the inhibitory loop of PS1 suggests that BMS-708163 is in fact a pan-inhibitor of γ-secretase, which is consistent with previous reports that BMS-708163 has little Notch-sparing activity and blocks the photoinsertion of four active site-directed probes to PS1-NTF (Crump, et al., 2012). Furthermore, modeling indicates that the inhibitor potentially interacts with the backbone carbonyl of G382, which is proximal to the catalytic residue D385, and could also contribute to the mode of inhibition.

In addition, cryo-EM analysis of γ-secretase complexed with DAPT suggested that DAPT resides in a pocket formed by TM2, TM3, TM5, TM6 and TM7 of PS1, with M146, M233, W165, F283 and G384 likely interacting with DAPT, although the orientation of the inhibitor could not be determined (Bai, et al., 2015). Our studies indicate that S170, R278, L282, F283 and G382 residues are involved in the binding of BMS-708163, suggesting that the two binding sites partially overlap. This proposal is supported by our finding that DAPT inhibits photolabeling of PS1 by 163-BP3-Dde-biotin (Fig. S4C).

Overall, we have shown that distinct classes of GSIs and GSMs bind to non-overlapping regions on PS1, but the precise binding sites have yet to be elucidated (Crump, et al., 2013). BMS-708163 (avagacestat) was reported as a Notch sparing inhibitor (Gillman, et al., 2010), but failed in AD clinical trials partially due to Notch-mediated toxicity (Coric, et al., 2012). Our study provides mechanistic evidence that BMS-708163 is a pan inhibitor of γ-secretase, reconciling reports that were heretofore seemingly disparate. Furthermore, it breaks ground for investigating the molecular mechanism and binding mode of GSMs, which specifically target toxic Aβ species and are at the forefront of AD research because of their potential as disease-modifying agents (Crump, et al., 2013). In addition, this work develops an effective approach for mapping the interaction site of small molecules with target proteins, including membrane proteins.

SIGNIFICANCE

Identification of small-molecule binding sites within the γ-secretase complex has been a formidable challenge in both structural and chemical biology studies due to the nature of this multi-subunit transmembrane protein complex. In this report, we have developed a new generation of BMS-708163-based probes with cleavable linkers and ultimately found that 163-BP3-Dde-biotin was the most efficient at labeling and eluting PS1-NTF. Taking advantage of this probe’s efficiency, we mapped the binding site of 163-BP3-Dde-biotin on γ-secretase for the first time. We were able to localize 163-BP3-Dde-biotin binding to amino acids 279-291 of PS1-NTF and identified Leu282 as the probe-modified residue. Identification of a site of labeling combined with MD simulations based on the γ-secretase structure allowed us to confidently model the binding site for the BMS-708163 series of GSIs, offering a molecular basis for inhibition of γ-secretase. This work paves the way for mapping the binding sites of other clinically relevant GSIs/GSMs in order to better understand the mechanism by which these compounds alter γ-secretase activity.

Photolabeling and pull-down samples for LC-MS/MS

ANPP membrane (Kim, et al., 2003) (6.4 mg) was photolabeled with 100 nM 163-BP3-Dde-biotin either with or without 10 μM BMS-708163. The reactions were incubated at 37°C for 1 h and UV irradiated at 350 nm for 30 min on a cold block. The labeled samples were centrifuged at 100,000xg, and pellets were resuspended in 500 μl RIPA buffer using TissuLyser (Qiagen). The solubilized samples were spun down at 16,000xg for 10 min and ensuing supernatants were combined and pulled-down with 30 μl streptavidin beads. Beads were washed 3 times with RIPA and 3 times with PBS and then eluted twice with 40 μl of 2% hydrazine + 0.05% SDS and twice with 40 μl of water and these eluates were combined and frozen. When all samples had been eluted, they were combined and concentrated ~approximately 24-fold (from 1440 μl down to ~60 μl) on 10 kDa Amicon Ultra Centricon. A fraction (1 μl) of these samples was run on a western blot, blotting for PS1-NTF, and the rest was processed for LC-MS/MS.

LC-MS/MS

The concentrated sample (60 μL) was treated with 60 μl of water and 480 μl of acetone, and incubated at −20 °C overnight. The samples were then centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 15,000xg and the residues were dried. They were next redissolved in 40 μl of 8 M urea containing 5 mM DTT and incubated at 60 °C for 1 h, after which they were allowed to cool to room temperature, treated with iodoacetamide (10mM) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were then treated with 40 μl of 0.05 M NH4HCO3 containing 0.2 μg of LysC (Wako) and incubated overnight at 37 °C, after which they were treated with 160 μl of 0.05 M NH4HCO3 containing 0.2 μg of trypsin (Promega sequencing grade), and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Following this, each sample was acidified to pH &lt; 3 by addition of trifluoroacetic acid, and subjected to solid-phase extraction of peptides using StageTips (Rappsilber, et al., 2007). The resulting samples were dried in the centrifugal evaporator, redissolved in 40 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 7.5 μl portions were analyzed by liquid-chromatography/mass spectrometry using a Waters nanoAcquity system operating at 250 nl/min and a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Specific searches for products of photolabeling were conducted against a custom-built small database containing the sequences of human γ-secretase subunits together with the sequences of known abundant contaminants. Theoretical peptide masses and MS/MS fragmentations were calculated using GPMAW v. 9.5 (Lighthouse data, Odense, Denmark) and ChemBioDraw Ultra v. 13.0 (Perkin-Elmer).
