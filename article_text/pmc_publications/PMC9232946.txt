The number of Latinos living with Alzheimer’s disease is projected to grow. Latinos currently make one-fifth of U.S. family caregivers. In this paper, we explore the cultural scripts and gendered practice of care in Latino families in relation to the underutilization of services to persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. We conducted interviews with 24 Latino caregivers in Miami-Dade, Florida representing 6 Latin American countries of origin. Interviews were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. We critically examined the concept of familism in order to better understand in-depth experiences of diverse Latino caregivers and concluded that an ethics of care model better elucidates the complexities of the care experience. Our analysis illustrates the ambivalence, contradictions, and changes in the beliefs and practice of care. These findings can help advance understanding among researchers and providers to develop a formal support system that is responsive to Latino caregiver needs.


pmcIntroduction

Latinos have higher rates of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) when compared to Whites (Alzheimer’s Association, 2016; National Institute on Aging, 2018). By 2060, the number of Latinos living with Alzheimer’s disease is projected to grow by 832% and the disease is expected to cost Latino families $2.3 trillion (Wu et al., 2016). Latinos make up 21% of the estimated 40 million family caregivers in the United States (US). ADRD can place a tremendous financial and emotional burden on caregivers. Caregiving for someone with dementia has long been associated with declines in physical health and psychological well-being (Mausbach et al., 2007; Ownby et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 1999; Richardson et al., 2013; Rosa &amp; Fuentes, 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Kalenkoski et al., 2021). Caregiving for someone with dementia in particular can be more stressful due to the behavioral management challenge of the disease (Greenwood &amp; Smith, 2019). Latino families provide more intense caregiving in terms of hours and level of care than other populations, yet are less likely to use community support services and formal care services such as nursing home and hospice care. Instead they turn to more affordable long-term care services (such as adult daycare) and unpaid informal care compared to non-Latino whites (Herrera et al. 2013; Wu et al., 2016).

Reasons for underutilization of community support among Latinos include lack of awareness of services, language barriers, beliefs that promote informal care, financial limitations, and insensitivity to cultural factors in the formal setting (Ayalon &amp; Huyck, 2002; Casado et al., 2011; Martinez et al., 2021; Chavez-Dueñas et al., 2020; Cruz-Saco &amp; López-Anuarbe, 2017; Zwingmann et al., 2020)). Similar challenges accessing services are faced by other immigrant and minority groups (Shanley et al., 2012; Nielsen et al., 2021; Kenning et al., 2017).

Familismo (familism), marianismo (devotion to the Virgin Mary), and respeto (respect), and dignidad (dignity) (Arévalo-Flechas et al., 2014; Gelman, 2014; Ayalon &amp; Huyck, 2002; Borrayo et al., 2007; Mendez-Luck et al., 2016) have dominated discussions of Latino caregiving. Familismo implies strong feelings of loyalty, reciprocity, and solidarity among members of the same family which can lead to greater involvement of extended family in care work and reduced perception of caregiving burden (Gelman, 2014; Mendez-Luck &amp; Anthony, 2016). Marianismo refers to the expectation that women be deferential and self-sacrificing for the benefit of the family (Mendez-Luck &amp; Anthony, 2016). Respeto dictates deference toward certain persons based on age, gender, and authority (Arévalo-Flechas, 2014).

Research on familism and caregiving has produced mixed results (Chavez-Dueñas et al., 2020). While familism may be upheld in principle, these values may also be changing and contradicted by actual behavior (Ramos, 2004; Ruiz &amp; Ransford, 2012; Gelman, 2014). The implicit assumption is that the family is the natural support network for older adults, without considering the impact of immigration on family structure or potentially strained familial relations (Angel et al., 2004; Martinez 2002; Martinez 2009; Miyawaki, 2016). Similarly, the literature on filial piety has yielded mixed results. Filial piety (respect for elders) among Asian populations has been found to be generally protective of reported caregiver burden (Lai, 2010). However, with modernization the concept has been waning (Speilman, 2021). Moreover, the experience of filial piety is not experienced positively by all (Guo et al., 2019), and many caregivers require more support than currently available (Ng et al., 2016). The increasing demand of care needs paired with a relative unavailability of persons to provide care due to demographic shifts (Martinez &amp; Baron, 2019), as well as the lack of preparation of families and care workers to provide care is often referred to as the “care crisis” (Fraser, 2016).

The decision of who, when, how, and where to provide care is conditioned by gender (Acosta, 2021). Other factors such as age, migrant status, and social class must also be taken into account (Mora &amp; Piper, 2021; Shutes, 2021). Both in research and in practice, a homogenized view of the Latina caregiver is assumed with little attention to how caregiving expectations, experiences, or practices may vary by social characteristics such as gender, generation, or acculturation. However, traditional gender images are in dispute while others are in transition. Flores et al. (2009) recommend using the concept of “an ethics of care” drawn from feminist and Chicana literature on the gendered nature of caregiving to move beyond familism as a general ideology to a more “experience-near” account of dementia-caregiving experiences and practices within Latino families.

The findings presented here are part of a broader research study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIAR03AG054142) to better understand the preferences of Latino family ADRD caregivers in South Florida and cultural congruence with available home and community-based services (HCBS) (Martinez et al., 2021). Resistance to services appeared to be anchored in particular notions of what constitutes good care and gendered expectations of who and how to provide care. Therefore, in the current analysis, we set out to move beyond familism and explore more in-depth cultural scripts and gendered practices of care in Latino families in relation to the underutilization of services to persons with ADRD. By better understanding this experience, within the broader theoretical framework of care work, we hope to address the existing disparities in access to formal support systems.

Methods

Participant Recruitment

This study used a qualitative approach to further deepen our understanding of the dynamics of caregiving within a Latino community in the United States. We recruited 24 Latinos providing care for family members aged 65 and older with ADRD through chain referral methods via support groups, Spanish language radio, and social media. Written consent was obtained prior to interviewing. Caregiver interviews lasting one to two hours were conducted in Spanish in the home by both authors and three research assistants. Interviews were recorded and observational notes were taken. Interview guides followed a semi-structured format with prompts and evolved from initial interviews to ensure flexibility while covering similar topics throughout the interviews (see Table 1). Transcriptions and translations were completed by a bilingual and bicultural research assistant and reviewed by bilingual. Bicultural research team members to ensure cultural and linguistic nuances were captured.

Data Analysis

Interviewing, translation, transcription, and coding overlapped over the course of the study. Once transcripts were available, the PI and three project staff collaborated on the coding and analysis of the interviews (facilitated by NVIVO software, v. 11) using a grounded theory approach. This approach strives to generate theory grounded in data by systematically collecting and analyzing the data obtained through constant comparison (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998) until saturation of concepts is reached. Through this comparative analysis strategy reality confronts the researcher’s interpretations (Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994).

Inductive “open” coding was utilized to allow “understanding to emerge from close study of the texts” (Bernard, 2006). Each transcript was reviewed and coded by at least two researchers to ensure validity. The primary coder kept running notes via memos, both descriptive and analytic. Coding and memos were reviewed during weekly team meetings and similar words and phrases (codes) together were grouped into major categories or themes (“domain coding”). Notes included a descriptive phrase that identified the core categories and their meaning. In this way, a theme is an abstract entity that brings meaning and identity to a recurrent pattern capturing and unifying it into a meaningful whole (Saldaña, 2015). The team met until the analysis had reached saturation (i.e. no new codes and themes were identified by the research team). Figure 1 illustrates the major codes and themes that emerged in this analysis. The results section provides sample quotes for each theme.

Results

Sample

Our final sample of caregivers was predominantly female (92%). Two thirds (67%) were providing care for their parents (mostly mothers). Nearly half (46%) of the caregivers we interviewed were currently employed, and 63% were married. Our sample had higher levels of education than expected, with 33% holding a college degree or higher and 37% having a high school education or lower. Their average age was equal to 63 years of age (range=41–85 years). Fifty-four percent (54%) were providing 41 hours or more of care per week. On average, they had provided care for 7 years (range=1–18). Eighty-eight (88%) of caregivers were born outside the US; all originated from Latin America and represented six countries, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela.

The Distinction between care and caring

One of the most salient themes that emerged from the analysis was the distinction made between care that is paid for (or hired caregivers) and the caring that family caregivers provide. For example, a woman in her sixties from the Dominican Republic, who was living with and providing care for her mother stated:

“…I could employ someone. but there are things that I do for my mother that I can’t pay others to do. For example, massages while bathing and putting on cream. These are things that I do with my mother. The person who comes to bathe her in the morning does not do that. But I do it automatically because it’s something she did for herself, so I continue to do it for her. On her face, I put on a cream, and use soap different from her body…If I pay someone, they would not do this.”

Several caregivers expressed that good care (or caring) goes beyond meeting the basic needs of the care recipient, but understanding more intimately the care recipient’s preferences, meeting these with patience and affection, as well as maintaining a sense of respect and autonomy towards the older adult.

There was also a sense of exceptionalism related to how they provide care based on their cultural background among those interviewed.

“I think that Latinos have a specific way of being due to how we were raised. For example, in our home countries an elder gets sick and you see that their grandchild is right there, and their daughter and you feel that company. They are more like that in Latin American countries. Americans, it’s not because they’re bad people, it’s just not what they’re used to. (Cuban woman caring for husband for 18 years)

This sense of exceptionalism may delay outreach for supportive services. These statements are also embedded in the role of family and community for Latinos, and as a resistance to the inevitable acculturation to the individualism of American society.

Gendered attributes of care

Cultural gendered norms in the Latino community inevitably places females at the root of care. Caregiving, especially for one’s parents, is a cultural moral expectation (el ‘deber ser’) for daughters; sons providing care is optional. A “good daughter” is self-sacrificing and provides care unquestionably (or else are deemed as “bad daughter”). The concept of the good daughter (Martinez 2002) reflects not only on the caregiver, but on the family.

“Because I was a good daughter, I would cover for her. I would let her speak [badly] of the family, and I was always trying to cover for her…like a good Latina. I want to solve everything and now I am the one in charge of everything.” (Cuban woman caring for mother for 15 years)

A mother’s maternal role is central in gendered notions of care. There is a cultural ideal that the type of care provided by a mother is irreplaceable (Acosta, 2015) This may stem from the “cult of motherhood” based on marianismo, a cultural system that emphasizes the spiritual strength and patience of women (Fuller, 1995). However, some conflicts come from discrepancies between cultural expectations of care and the daily challenges of caregiving. As a consequence, Latino women are impacted in their social and personal life as well in their labor participation as the following quote shows.

“…And I took care of her. I had no social life, I was in the middle of a divorce. It was very difficult. I did not go out. I did not go out for anything because I did not have enough for someone to take care of her and I was not going to leave her alone.” (Cuban woman caring for mother for 15 years)

Moreover, gender roles are changing and may also contribute to the lack of availability of women to care for Latinos with Alzheimer’s Disease in the future.

“I think my generation is the last to take on the role that I have taken with my mother…I can’t expect my children, I don’t expect it, and I don’t think it will happen with me nor do I pretend that my children will do with me even a fourth of what I have done [in caring for my mother]. I want to be realistic.” (Cuban woman caring for mother for 15 years)

Men as caregivers

Male caregivers expressed a different experience of care. Instead of being strengthened, intimacy with the care recipient is affected. Male caregivers expressed not having innate maternal qualities, and difficulties adjusting to duties that women are already accustomed to. Some participants, particularly caregivers providing care of their spouses, experienced difficulties while trying to sustain their marital relationship and provide high quality care. Males also tend to have a different caregiving experience based on their relationship to the care recipient. Males providing care for their mother or a family member, may seek to detach themselves and see their loved one as a “patient.”

“I know that women take better care of their relatives, and I know that I do it because it is a necessity of mine and a necessity for my mother. I do it because I know that I’m doing something good, and I like to do good…[Women] do it with more love, they worry more. I see my mother as a patient more than as my mother, most of the time. I know she is my mother, but there are few moments where I can express or feel that love, because already at this moment in time she is just not there.” (Colombian male in his early 50’s, married, providing full time co-living care for his mother for the past 2 years)

When men provide care they are seen as an “exception” of the cultural norm and for that reason, they are often praised for their “extraordinary” caregiving efforts. Social inequalities show up in the social valorization of care as well in its execution. As one Cuban male in his early 70’s, providing full-time care for his wife said:

“There are some people in my building that comment how proud they are of me, they say that it’s a big responsibility, that I am very humble and I take care of her well. It’s not easy for me, it’s hard because it’s not the same for a man to take care of a woman, than for a woman to take care of a man…when a woman takes care of a man it’s like she’s already accustomed to it, but taking care of a woman is very difficult, in regards to intimacy and everything…but I feel that I am adapting to it now.”

Love, Obligation, and Duty

The emotional aspects mostly challenge or stress Latina women caregivers, experiencing feelings of gratification and feelings of frustration. Love, obligation, and duty are mixed feelings in the experience of caregiving. From the Latina caregiver’s point of view, care work can be more valued as a moral obligation than a voluntary act, even if not always gifted with family or social recognition.

The love and dedication… The most important thing is that it comes from you and it becomes a vocation. In my case, I’m taking care of my mother because it’s my vocation to do so.” (Honduran college educated woman caring for mother for 8 years).

Feelings of gratitude, generosity, loyalty, or altruism can coexist with resentment, complacency, or self-forgetfulness when Latina caregivers attempt to honor and respect older adults’ autonomy in the face of their diminishing abilities and at times frightening behavioral symptoms.

It’s difficult to speak of gratifying things when it comes to a terminal illness that has no cure, but on the other hand if this was going to happen at least I know one tries to think one did their best to take care of them because it is my responsibility as their daughter. (College professor of Cuban origin caring for her mother for 10 years)

The long-term psychological and emotional effects of caring for someone with ADRD, lack of familial and institutional support, and changing care expectations in the context of immigration may lead to changes in the perception of care as an obligation among future generations.

What I did for my mother was extraordinary. But I do not wish this upon anyone; I don’t want my children to do this with me. This is the reality. The reality is we will have to take care of ourselves. We cannot even think with the Cuban way of thinking or the Latin way of thinking that our children will take care of us. No, no. This is not reality. We will have to take care of ourselves. (65-year old Cuban woman who cared for her mother for 17 years)

However, while Latina caregivers may still have trouble accepting help, once they know that help may exist they eventually do reach out and accept help.

“I took her [to the daycare] and left her like when a parent leaves a child the first day of school feeling horribly bad. But with time I’ve realized that yes, at the beginning she did not want to stay and then I would stay with her, I would check in on her like a mother checks in on a child. I’d visit, I’d take her out early, sometimes I would not take her and little by little not only did I see that it was good for her, but it was also a relief for me.” (Cuban woman caring for mother for 15 years)

Discussion

This paper highlights the importance of emotional work and the gender attributes of care among Latino family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer’s and related dementias (ADRD). Our findings illustrate the ambivalence, contradictions, and changes in the beliefs and practice of care in order to advance understanding among researchers and providers. Underutilization of care among Latino caregivers is embedded in concepts of good care and who can provide it, i.e. the family and particular female family members. As more hours of care need to be provided and more intensive care is needed, Latino caregivers are likely to consider using available services if a more nuanced understanding of the experience of care bridges the gap between services and those who need them. Latino caregivers note a difference between care (things that you can hire other people to do) and caring (the extra things one does for a loved one). Care is not only physical and financial, but also emotional (Aguirre, 2005). The emotions involved in caregiving are not always rewarding. There is love, respect, pride, solidarity, recognition, but also resentment, guilt, sacrifice, etc.

The distinction made between the care that is paid for, and the caring that family caregivers provide confirms the distinction pointed out by feminist scholars between caring about others (which is viewed as a masculine form of caring) and caring for others, which is construed as a moral position (Flores et al., 2009; Acosta, 2015). Thus, for women, the issue is not whether one should care for another, but how one should care for and how one should deal with conflicting caring concerns (Tronto, 1993). Several caregivers expressed that good care (or caring) goes beyond meeting the basic needs of the care recipient, but understanding more intimately the care recipient preferences and meeting these with patience and affection.

To understand what constitutes good care it is necessary to know that caregiving is a social relationship that reveals the inequalities of social relations in terms of the gendered division of labor manifested in the construction of care as “women’s work” and as historically undervalued labor (Misra, 2003; Glenn, 2000; Acosta, 2015; Coffey et al., 2020; Shutes, 2021). Few researchers have examined how familism as a cultural value or ideology may influence the performance of the ethics of care for Latina caregivers (Flores et al. 2009). Ibarra (2003) defined ethics of care as “behavioral scripts” which mandate that older adults should maintain their former roles within the family and that their autonomy should be honored. Familism in practice functions as a stereotype that does not allow us to move forward in addressing the support needs of Latino families. An ethics of care is not limited to an immovable cultural construct and better elucidates the complexities of the care experience (Comas-d’Argemir, 2017). This theoretical framework is confirmed by the findings of this study using a grounded theory approach (see Figure 1).

Among U.S. Latinos, caregiving is guided by an ethics of care that responds to cultural scripts to the ideals of family harmony and cohesion (Flores et al, 2009). Thus, caregiving of older adults ought to embody sacrifice of individual or personal desires or goals in the service of others, altruism, collectivism, and interdependence. Caregiving responsibilities are typically assigned to women due to cultural assumptions of women as natural nurturers and caregivers, and cultural expectations that women should prioritize family over individual desires. This cultural idea is reinforced by the health providers’ narratives which mainly assume Latina women as natural caregivers, being always attentive to and supportive of the older adult’s routines and needs even if these negatively impact their own self-care (Martinez et al., 2021). The enactment of familistic cultural scripts that mandate respect for older adult autonomy, preservation of dignity, and maintenance of their role within the family typically falls upon women (Flores, 2009). Therefore, feelings of love, linked to loyalty or altruism, act as a barrier to ask for an equal distribution of care responsibility among the family members. To utilize home and community-based services (HCBS) is to go against cultural expectations.

Migration not only impacts the practice of care, but results in the rearrangement of family responsibilities (Martinez, 2002; Martinez, 2009; Acosta, 2021; Mora &amp; Piper, 2021). Changing gender roles may also contribute to the availability of women to care for Latinos with Alzheimer’s Disease in the future (Rodrigues et al., 2012; Gonzalvez et al., 2020; Duran, 2020). This so-called “care crisis” is due to the absence of policies for care and the disproportionate burden of care on certain social sectors, namely women (Fraser, 2016). Caregiving is poised to be one of the biggest challenges for the aging Latino population, therefore we must move beyond familism in regards to the needs of Latino older adults (Martinez &amp; Baron, 2019). Cultural values are dynamic and constantly changing. In other words, while Latino caregivers have very specific notions of what constitutes appropriate care, by upholding the myth that they are unique in caring, there is a tendency among researchers, providers, and policy makers to not look deeper into how they may be better supported in caregiving. We found that once caregivers know that help may exist they do reach out for help. And if care meets their expectations, they do accept care. However, providers need to understand the underlying cultural dynamics impacting the help they are willing and able to receive. The reality is that Latinos do need, want and seek help, but the existing systems of formal support are not meeting their needs (Ramos, 2004). Changes in formal supports need to be responsive to the current needs of local populations. Therefore, health and social providers need to be trained on the experience of Latino caregivers, available supports, and existing challenges in access in order to create a culturally-conscious formal support system (Martinez et al., 2021).

Limitations

Limitations of the study include an inability to formally explore intracultural variability due to the sample size. While the sample composition is not representative of the Latino population in the US overall in terms of age, education, and marital status, it reflects the population of Latinos in south Florida that has a large number of immigrants from South America, Central America and the Caribbean who tend to be older and more educated than Latinos in the US overall. In addition, we use the term Latino as shorthand for describing a heterogeneous group, as demonstrated even by our own sample, in terms of factors such as country of origin, socioeconomic status, and immigration history. However, as noted earlier, there are common cultural threads throughout Latin America with respect to family values and caregiving. We were also limited in the number of male caregivers in the study.
