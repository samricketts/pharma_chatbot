The notion that autoimmune responses to α-synuclein may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder stems from reports that mutations in α-synuclein or certain alleles of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are associated with the disease and that dopaminergic and norepinephrinergic neurons in the midbrain can present antigenic epitopes. Here, we discuss recent evidence that a defined set of peptides derived from α-synuclein act as antigenic epitopes displayed by specific MHC alleles and drive helper and cytotoxic T cell responses in patients with PD. Moreover, phosphorylated α-synuclein may activate T cell responses in a less restricted manner in PD. While the roles for the acquired immune system in disease pathogenesis remain unknown, preclinical animal models and in vitro studies indicate that T cells may interact with neurons and exert effects related to neuronal death and neuroprotection. These findings suggest that therapeutics that target T cells and ameliorate the incidence or disease severity of inflammatory bowel disorders or CNS autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis may be useful in PD.


pmcINTRODUCTION

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting nearly one million people in North America (Marras et al., 2018). The pathologic hallmarks of PD are the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, aggregates that are composed in part of non-degraded α-synuclein (α-Syn). While PD diagnosis is based on classical clinical motor features, the initial stages of pathogenesis may begin outside the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in the enteric nervous system (Orimo et al., 2007). Here, we discuss how critical steps in PD pathogenesis may be related to autoimmune responses to α-Syn; however, as with classical autoimmune disorders including type-1 diabetes, a variety of additional proteins may act as antigenic epitopes. In the case of PD, these may include mitochondrial proteins, as suggested by research in mouse models carrying PINK1 and parkin mutations (Matheoud et al., 2016, 2019), although the specific steps that may underlie additional possible autoimmune epitopes will not be discussed here.

ROLES FOR α-SYNUCLEIN IN PD

Genetic, pathologic and epidemiologic studies have advanced our understanding of PD pathogenesis by highlighting impairments in cellular processes involved in the regulation of protein homeostasis. These include protein aggregation, dysfunction in intracellular protein and membrane trafficking, protein disposal by the ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosome-autophagy pathways, and mitochondrial function and mitophagy (Kalia and Lang, 2015). Here, we discuss properties that contribute to understanding how such changes could promote α-Syn-related autoimmune features in PD.

SNCA, the gene encoding α-Syn protein, was the first gene linked to familial PD (Polymeropoulos et al., 1997). Six disease-causing mutations (A30P, A53T, E46K, H50Q, G51D, A53E) in SNCA have been identified (Polymeropoulos et al., 1997; Kruger et al., 1998; Zarranz et al., 2004; Appel-Cresswell et al., 2013; Kiely et al., 2013; Lesage et al., 2013; Proukakis et al., 2013; Pasanen et al., 2014). Duplications and triplications of the SNCA gene that increase α-Syn protein levels lead to highly penetrant forms of PD (Singleton et al., 2003; Chartier-Harlin et al., 2004; Farrer et al., 2004). There is also evidence from the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) that SNPs located in the non-coding regions in the SNCA promoter may enhance expression of the protein in PD (Zhang et al., 2018b).

α-Syn is a 14kDa protein composed of 140 amino acids (Ueda et al., 1993) that is expressed abundantly in the brain, particularly in axons, and at lower levels in other organs and hematopoietic tissues (Shin et al., 2000; Ltic et al., 2004). The protein is subdivided into three regions: an amphipathic lysine-rich amino terminus, which modulates the protein’s interaction with membranes, a disordered acidic carboxy-terminal tail, and a highly hydrophobic central motif (Fig. 29.1A; see also Chapter 11). The central region (comprising residues 65–90) is sometimes called the “non-amyloid beta component” of Alzheimer’s disease amyloid plaques (NAC), as it was first isolated from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain (Ueda et al., 1993; Masliah et al., 1996; Spillantini et al., 1997; Ulmer and Bax, 2005), although it may not be a typical component of AD plaques. The NAC region is essential for α-Syn aggregation as removal of large segments of the motif reduces α-Syn’s oligomerization and fibrillization (Fig. 29.1) (Giasson et al., 2001). α-Syn exists predominantly as a stable unfolded monomer and adopts an α-helical conformation upon binding to membranes (Davidson et al., 1998).

α-Syn regulates presynaptic functions and appears to be involved in the dilation of the secretory vesicle fusion pore (Logan et al., 2017), although other functions including acting as a chaperone for fusion proteins have also been suggested (Burre et al., 2014; Sulzer and Edwards, 2019; Sun et al., 2019) (see also Chapter 11). α-Syn is found at presynaptic varicosities (Jakes et al., 1994; Iwai et al., 1995; Withers et al., 1997) and in some cases is associated with a distal reserve pool of synaptic vesicles (Kahle et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008). SNCA-knockout mice generally display no change in excitatory neurotransmission [although see (Liu et al., 2004)], slightly lower dopamine levels, and faster recovery of dopamine release from paired-pulse stimulation in striatal slices (Abeliovich et al., 2000; Chadchankar and Yavich, 2011). Recent in vivo work shows that α-Syn exerts both a relatively rapid facilitation and slower depression of burst firing-evoked dopamine release (Somayaji et al., 2020).

It is often reported that α-Syn exists predominantly as a stable unfolded monomer and adopts an α-helical conformation upon binding to membranes (Davidson et al., 1998), although there is evidence for tetrameric conformations (Bartels et al., 2011). α-Syn aggregation depends mostly on the central NAC region (Fig. 29.1A) (Giasson et al., 2001) (see also Chapter 11); however, intramolecular interactions within α-Syn shield the hydrophobic patches of the NAC region (Bertoncini et al., 2005) and disruptions to these interactions can increase α-Syn’s propensity to aggregate.

IMPLICATIONS OF AGGREGATION AND ACCUMULATION FOR AUTOIMMUNITY

While the mechanisms by which α-Syn causes PD are not fully understood, differences in proteolytic processing and turnover of the protein have been implicated in disease pathogenesis and aggregates of α-Syn are the main components of Lewy pathology (Spillantini et al., 1998). Environmental factors, such as increased temperature or lower pH, can cause α-Syn to form a partially folded structure that enhances aggregation and amyloid formation (Fig. 29.1B) (Uversky et al., 2001). During early stages of aggregation, unfolded stable α-Syn forms partially folded intermediates that contain hydrophobic patches on their surfaces (Uversky et al., 2002). These hydrophobic patches lead to the formation of an amyloidogenic nucleus when they interact with each other (Uversky, 2003) and recruit other soluble proteins to form fibrils (Ghosh et al., 2017). Additional factors can enhance α-Syn’s propensity to accumulate, including genetic mutations in SNCA and increased levels of the protein.

α-Syn accumulation can be due to increased aggregation, increased synthesis, decreased clearance or a combination of these three factors. α-Syn can be degraded by direct proteolysis (Iwata et al., 2003), binding to molecular chaperones (Klucken et al., 2004), proteasomes (Webb et al., 2003), and autophagy (Cuervo et al., 2004; Desplats et al., 2009; Spencer et al., 2009; Kragh et al., 2012). Strikingly, the α-Syn mutations causing PD are not accumulated into lysosomes by chaperone-mediated autophagy (Cuervo et al., 2004). Oligomeric forms of α-Syn and α-Syn that has been oxidatively modified by dopamine in the cytosol cannot be degraded in the lysosome by this form of lysosomal degradation (Martinez-Vicente et al., 2008).

In PD, neurons lack the ability to degrade α-Syn by normal means, leading to accumulation and formation of Lewy bodies. Additional genetic causes of PD may play important roles in inhibiting normal α-Syn turnover. Mutations in LRRK2 gene are the most frequent known cause of late-onset autosomal-dominant PD (Paisan-Ruiz et al., 2004; Zimprich et al., 2004) and have been found to block normal turnover of α-Syn at the lysosomal membrane (Orenstein et al., 2013). Mutations in β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA), a lysosomal enzyme important for glycolipid metabolism, could likewise block efficient α-Syn degradation, and are important genetic risk factors for developing PD (Sidransky and Hart, 2012).

If aberrant α-Syn processing leads to unusual cleavage products, these may be misrecognized as “non-self” proteins by the immune system, leading to autoimmune responses. The phosphorylation of residue S129 (pS129) and other post-translational modifications (PTM) of α-Syn have been identified in Lewy bodies isolated from PD patients. These PTMs include phosphorylation, nitration, oxidation, glycosylation, N-terminal acetylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and truncation (Breydo et al., 2012; Ghosh et al., 2017). Thus, such post-translational modifications could create neoantigens that trigger autoimmune reactions.

α-SYN ACCUMULATION IN ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELLS

To activate specific T cells, antigenic epitopes must be presented in the extracellular milieu by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. Professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), including macrophages, dendritic cells and microglia (CNS), internalize antigens from the extracellular space, and then process and present the antigen at the plasma membrane for T cell recognition. Release of α-Syn from cells has been demonstrated under various stress regimens (Jang et al., 2010), dopamine treatment (Lee et al., 2011), and oxidative stress (Bae et al., 2013). While the mechanism by which α-Syn is released from cells remains to be elucidated, its release may be caused by cell death in the CNS or enteric nervous system (ENS), turnover of red blood cells and platelets that express high levels of α-Syn in the periphery, or secretion via exosomes from multivesicular bodies due to lysosomal dysfunction.

Various uptake pathways of α-Syn fibrils have been reported over the last several years, including via heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (Holmes et al., 2013), the immune receptor Lag3 (Mao et al., 2016), and endocytic uptake of extracellular vesicles (Minakaki et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018a). Internalized α-Syn “seeds” could be trafficked through the endocytic pathway (Apetri et al., 2016; Masaracchia et al., 2018). Alternatively, while some internalized fibrils may remain sequestered in lysosomes where they can be degraded (Karpowicz et al., 2019), fibrils have been shown to disrupt lysosomal or endosomal membranes, allowing toxic conformations of α-Syn to enter the cytosol (Freeman et al., 2013; Samuel et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2017). Once in the cytosol, α-Syn fibrils can recruit monomeric proteins and promote further aggregation.

THE ENTERIC SYSTEM AND PD

It is possible that the inflammatory steps involved in PD may first occur in the ENS, as suggested by several findings:

Constipation is reported to occur in up to 70% of patients with PD (Fasano et al., 2015), and it is three times more prevalent in PD patients than healthy controls (Drossman and Dumitrascu, 2006). This carries a risk of impaction, a potentially deadly complication.

Lewy body pathology is prevalent in the gut of PD patients, and it has been reported in the ENS in nearly all patients with PD examined so far (Beach et al., 2009). α-Syn inclusions are found in submucosal and myenteric neurons of the gut (Wakabayashi et al., 1993; Braak et al., 2003, 2006; Braak and Del Tredici, 2009). Based on these findings, Braak and colleagues hypothesized that α-Syn deposition begins in the gut and travels through the vagus nerve into the CNS (Braak et al., 2003).

A recent study reported that patients with inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD) show an increased prevalence of PD, while patients with IBD who were treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) therapy show a nearly 80% lower level of PD than those who have not been treated (Peter et al., 2018).

People who undergo truncal vagotomies, which may sever a conduit for α-Syn propagation from the gut to the brain, appear to have a lower risk of developing PD than those, who do not (Svensson et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017).

Clinical studies have revealed altered gut microbiota composition in patients with PD that may either increase inflammation (Keshavarzian et al., 2015; Unger et al., 2016) or gut permeability (Kalia and Lang, 2015; Scheperjans et al., 2015). Indeed, higher intestinal permeability has been observed early in PD pathogenesis (Davies et al., 1996; Salat-Foix and Suchowersky, 2012) and has been associated with enteric α-Syn pathology (Forsyth et al., 2011). A leaky intestine facilitates the translocation of microbes and their products, which triggers a sustained inflammation, promotes activation of T cells and may directly promote α-Syn aggregation.

Multiple studies have been conducted to investigate the diversity and abundance of microbial taxa in the gastrointestinal microbiome of patients with PD in comparison to healthy controls (Keshavarzian et al., 2015; Scheperjans et al., 2015; Unger et al., 2016; Bedarf et al., 2017; Hill-Burns et al., 2017; Hopfner et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Mertsalmi et al., 2017; Minato et al., 2017; Petrov et al., 2017; Cilia et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018). Discrepancies in specific findings exist, but there is a consensus that an altered microbiome or dysbiosis is present in patients with PD compared to healthy controls (Sampson, 2020).

A gut-to-brain propagation of α-Syn has been modeled in mice. α-Syn fibrils injected into the gut of mice cause accumulation of α-Syn inclusions in the brain as early as 1 month-post injection (Kim et al., 2019; Challis et al., 2020). Importantly, this effect is lost when mice have undergone a truncal vagatomy or are deficient for the SNCA gene (Kim et al., 2019). These studies are consistent with the Braak hypothesis of α-Syn spread and highlight the requirement for endogenous α-Syn for the propagation of pathology from the gut to the CNS.

The role of the gut microbiota in PD pathogenesis has also been investigated in mouse models of PD. A recent study showed that α-Syn-overexpressing mice that are rendered germ free by either antibiotic treatment or rederivation, display decreased Lewy body pathology, decreased neuroinflammation, and improved motor performance (Sampson et al., 2016). Similarly, antibiotic treatment of MPTP mice reduces α-Syn aggregation and dopaminergic neuron death (Du et al., 2001; Bisht et al., 2014; Jing et al., 2017; Kaur and Prakash, 2017). Conversely, infection of mice with specific microbes promotes PD pathology. There is an increase of α-Syn inclusions within the gastrointestinal tract when mice are infected with norovirus (Stolzenberg et al., 2017). Moreover, germ-free α-Syn-overexpressing mice perform worse in motor tests when they are colonized with human fecal microbes from PD patients, but not with those from healthy individuals (Sampson et al., 2016).

Escherichia coli can produce an extracellular structure termed curli that can acquire an amyloid structure similar to α-Syn (Tursi and Tükel, 2018). When α-Syn overexpressing mice are treated with curli-producing E. coli, but not curli-deficient E. coli, motor impairments and α-Syn pathology are exacerbated (Sampson et al., 2020). Similarly, aged Fisher rats fed with amyloid-protein curli-producing E. coli display increased neuronal expression of α-Syn both in submucosal and myenteric plexi of the gut as well as in the brain (Chen et al., 2016).

Gut pathology is also linked to intestinal inflammation in PD patients. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IFNγ (interferon-γ) are negatively correlated with disease duration (Devos et al., 2013). In addition, CD4+ T cells infiltrate the colonic mucosa of PD patients with constipation at higher numbers than in PD patients without constipation (Chen et al., 2015b). The gut may be an initiating site of inflammation and pathology and could be the location in which the adaptive immune system is primed against α-Syn deposition. Although the incidence of PD among patients with IBD is 28% higher than controls, PD patients with IBD who receive anti-TNFα therapy have a 78% lower incidence rate of PD than those who do not receive the therapy (Peter et al., 2018). These studies suggest that inflammation may not only be an effect of PD pathology, but that it promotes PD pathogenesis and that reducing its activity can prevent disease onset.

EVIDENCE OF ALTERED INFLAMMATORY PATHWAYS IN PD

Consistent with the view that PD involves multiple systems and tissues, inflammation in PD encompasses changes in cytokine profiles in both the periphery and the brain (Cebrian et al., 2014a; Garretti et al., 2019). Proinflammatory cytokines that are elevated in the blood of patients with PD include IL-2 (Mogi et al., 1996; Stypula et al., 1996), IL–6 (Mogi et al., 1994; Blum-Degen et al., 1995; Muller et al., 1998; Dobbs et al., 1999; Reale et al., 2009), IL-8 (Reale et al., 2009), MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) (Reale et al., 2009), MIP-1α (macrophage inflammatory protein-1 α) (Reale et al., 2009), RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) (Rentzos et al., 2007; Reale et al., 2009), TNFα (Boka et al., 1994; Mogi et al., 1994; Hunot et al., 1996; Dobbs et al., 1999), and IFNγ (Reale et al., 2009). Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are indicative of an immune system responding to tissue damage and/or foreign molecules. The levels of cytokines and chemokines correlate with the clinical stage of the disease, highlighting a role for peripheral inflammation in PD progression (Reale et al., 2009).

Th1 and Th17 CD4+ lymphocytes can contribute to increased levels of IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-17A (Kustrimovic et al., 2018; Sommer et al., 2018). Several studies have compared the T cell subpopulations of patients with PD and healthy controls. Patients with PD have fewer naive T cells (Bas et al., 2001; Saunders et al., 2012), including CD4+ Th (helper) cells (Bas et al., 2001; Calopa et al., 2010; Saunders et al., 2012), and more activated T cells (Chiba et al., 1995), including Th2 regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Bas et al., 2001; Calopa et al., 2010) than healthy age-matched controls. Some studies reported general decrease in total T cells (Baba et al., 2005; Calopa et al., 2010; Gruden et al., 2011), Tregs (Chen et al., 2015a; Kustrimovic et al., 2018), and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (Gruden et al., 2011), whereas other studies show no change in Treg number (Rosenkranz et al., 2007) with an increase in Th1 cells and the Th17 subset in patients with PD (Chen et al., 2015b, 2017; Sommer et al., 2018). These disparate findings may be due to differences in phenotyping methods and patient recruitment. Note that these studies examine the total bulk populations of T cells without discerning changes related to autoantigen recognition, which may represent a very small fraction of the total populations.

Increased levels of peripheral cytokines act on CNS endothelial cells that form the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to increase vascular permeability (Liebner et al., 2018). The CNS was formerly considered an immunologically privileged site, largely due to the presence of the BBB, a physical barrier formed by endothelial cells via interactions with pericytes and astrocytes to prevent blood proteins, antibodies, immune cells, and drugs from penetrating into the brain parenchyma (Platt et al., 2017; Biswas et al., 2020). A compromised BBB renders the brain susceptible to circulating immune cells, antibodies, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. During CNS autoimmune diseases, leukocytes migrate across several pathways to reach the CNS parenchyma. These include a vascular route through the BBB, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid route through an epithelial barrier present in the choroid plexus and the meningeal lymphatic route on the surface of the brain (Daneman and Engelhardt, 2017; Louveau et al., 2017; Platt et al., 2017). These different routes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and its animal model, Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Liebner et al., 2018); however, only vascular abnormalities and impaired BBB function have been documented so far in brains of PD patients.

Neuroimaging studies on patients with PD show that the BBB is compromised in the vicinity of the midbrain (Kortekaas et al., 2005) as well as in various deep and cortical gray matter and white matter regions (Ham et al., 2014; Janelidze et al., 2015). In postmortem tissue, there is evidence of brain capillary leakage indicated by deposition of blood-derived proteins (e.g., fibrinogen and IgG) in both striatum and subthalamic nucleus (Gray and Woulfe, 2015; Pienaar et al., 2015). Capillary leakage associated with microvascular degeneration, disrupted endothelial cell tight junctions, changes in capillary basement membrane composition in the subthalamic nucleus (Pienaar et al., 2015) and aberrant angiogenesis (marked by increased levels of Integrin αvβ3, − a proangiogenic integrin expressed by immature endothelial cells) have been found within the SN, locus coeruleus (LC), and putamen of PD brains (Desai Bradaric et al., 2012). The BBB may be disrupted during acute and chronic inflammation in PD. Under sustained chronic inflammation, tight junctions between endothelial cells that prevent paracellular diffusion are weakened or disrupted, allowing the passage of antibodies or immune cells that would otherwise be restricted from the brain (Platt et al., 2017; Varatharaj and Galea, 2017). In addition, inflamed CNS endothelial cells upregulate expression of adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM and VCAM-1) that bind and recruit circulating T cells and monocytes, as well as proteins (e.g., Caveolin-1, PLVAP) that promote transcellular transport of immune cells and antibodies across the barrier (Platt et al., 2017; Liebner et al., 2018). T cells can then extravasate into the brain via the disrupted BBB, as seen in both MS patients and animal models for the disease (Platt et al., 2017; Liebner et al., 2018). Taken together, these studies suggest a profound neurovascular dysfunction in PD patients, although the timing of BBB damage in relationship to disease onset remains unknown.

LYMPHOCYTE ROLES IN PD

T cells can infiltrate the affected brain regions of PD patients either as a consequence of peripheral inflammation that changes lymphocyte populations and may potentially induce BBB breakdown or an active process. As first reported by the McGeers in 1988, CD3+ T cells are found in brains of PD patients (McGeer et al., 1988a,b). Brochard et al. reported that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not B and natural killer (NK) cells, infiltrate the SN of PD patients and are present at greater numbers than in healthy controls. These T cells are located near blood vessels and neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons, suggesting a potential vascular route of their entry into the CNS (Brochard et al., 2009; Sommer et al., 2018). The presence of T cells in the region affected in the disease suggests a targeted extravasation in local blood vessels, rather than a consequence of increased BBB permeability throughout the CNS vessels induced by peripheral inflammation.

The number and proportion of T cells types provide clues to their roles. Tregs respond to heightened inflammation by suppressing effector T cell proliferation and cytokine production (Kondelkova et al., 2010) and their dysregulation can lead to autoimmune disorders. PD patient-derived Tregs have an impaired ability to suppress effector T cell proliferation in vitro compared to Tregs derived from healthy controls (Saunders et al., 2012). In addition, effector T cells from PD patients produce higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in response to T cell activators in vitro and their Tregs fail to suppress cytokine release (Kustrimovic et al., 2018). If Tregs are dysfunctional in PD, the heightened and persistent proinflammatory environment observed in patients may remain unabated throughout the nervous system and periphery.

Although animal models have limitations in recapitulating PD, they are useful tools for genetic manipulation and identifying features of disease pathology. A range of models for studying PD have been developed that employ toxins or genetic mutations to recapitulate aspects of the disease. Some of the models implicate a role for infiltrating T cells in propagating neurodegeneration. Intracerebral injections of the toxin 6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OH-DA) into the midbrain of mice induces degeneration of dopamine and noradrenaline neurons (Ungerstedt, 1968), which are rendered vulnerable to the drug because they express the dopamine transporter, DAT, that accumulates the toxin. Once in the neuronal cytosol, 6-OHDA mediates oxidative stress-related cytotoxicity (Saner and Thoenen, 1971; Graham, 1978; Blum et al., 2001). The subsequent acute neurodegeneration produces motor deficits in rodents and, if injected unilaterally, in rotational motions. 6-OHDA treated mice show serum IgG deposition into the CNS parenchyma, indicative of a leaky BBB, as well as T and B cell infiltration around CNS blood vessels (Theodore and Maragos, 2015). Treg cells are significantly decreased in the periphery of 6-OHDA treated rats, which do not show marked T cell infiltration into the midbrain (Ambrosi et al., 2017).

Another toxin model of PD uses 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), originally identified as a contaminant in intravenous drug users who developed PD (Davis et al., 1979; Langston and Ballard, 1983). MPTP is lipophilic and readily crosses the BBB and is then internalized by astrocytes where it is metabolized to MPP+. Astrocytes release MPP+, which is taken up by dopaminergic neurons via DAT (Javitch and Snyder, 1984; Cui et al., 2009; Rappold and Tieu, 2010). Once accumulated, MPP+ induces SN death by inhibiting complex I in the electron transport chain, depleting cells of ATP, and increasing oxidative stress in a dopamine and calcium-dependent manner (Nicklas et al., 1985; Mizuno et al., 1987; Choi et al., 2015; Lieberman et al., 2017). T cells extravasate into the SN as soon as 2 days post-MPTP treatment (Kurkowska-Jastrzebska et al., 1999; Depboylu et al., 2012), following microgliosis (Brochard et al., 2009). A causative role for T cells in MPTP-induced dopaminergic degeneration was investigated using immuno-deficient mouse strains. Mice that lack functional T cells (Rag1−/− and Tcrb−/− mice) are protected from MPTP-induced neurodegeneration. Despite the observation that CD8+ T cells are more numerous in the midbrain following MPTP, Cd8a−/− mice were not protected from neuronal death. In contrast, mice that lack functioning CD4+(Cd4−/− mice) cells were protected from loss of dopaminergic neurons (Brochard et al., 2009), implicating this arm of the adaptive immune system in disease pathogenesis. SCID mice, which are deficient in functional T and B cells, are also protected against MPTP induced neuronal death (Benner et al., 2008). Neurodegeneration was restored in SCID mice that are reconstituted with wild-type splenocytes (Benner et al., 2008). These studies reinforce the notion that CD4+ T cells may be essential for neurodegeneration in the MPTP model of PD.

Interestingly, dopamine receptors are expressed by cells of the innate and adaptive immune response, including CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Expression of the D3-type receptor (D3R), one of five DA receptors in humans, was significantly reduced in PD patient T cells and is correlated with disease severity (Nagai et al., 1996). D3R-deficient mice treated with MPTP were protected from dopaminergic neuron death and microglial activation, but the protection was lost with the transfer of CD4+ T cells from wild-type animals (Tijero et al., 2013). Additionally, Rag1−/− mice that were protected against MPTP become susceptible to neurodegeneration with the transfer of WT CD4+ T cells but not when reconstituted with D3R-deficient CD4+ T cells (Tijero et al., 2013). These data suggest that D3R signaling in T cells may be required for neuronal death in the MPTP mouse model.

T cell receptor stimulation is reported to induce D3R expression on CD4+ T cells, and D3R signaling on CD4+ T cells contributes to the expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells in the context of inflammatory colitis (Contreras et al., 2016). DA is in part depleted in PD, as a subset of dopaminergic and norepinephrinergic neurons are lost in the disease. The role of DA receptors on T cells could evolve over the disease course, including via decreased activation due to DA loss and spikes of activation with treatment of DA replacing drugs. The level and activation profile of these receptors throughout the disease could shed light on their role in contributing to a proinflammatory T cell profile, particularly during drug treatment.

While CD8+ and CD4+ Th1 T cells can exert cytotoxic and proinflammatory effects, CD4+ Tregs exert antiinflammatory properties that protect cells against neurotoxic molecules or persistent inflammation. Adoptive transfer of Tregs cells into MPTP mice protects dopaminergic neurons that appears to be mediated by suppression of microglial activation (Benner et al., 2004; Reynolds et al., 2007, 2009, 2010).

A third approach to modeling PD in rodents uses targeted overexpression of human α-Syn in the midbrain of rodents. In one model, α-Syn is overexpressed in the SN by injection with recombinant adeno-associated virus vector (AAV2-SYN), which leads to the slow degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (Theodore et al., 2008). Consistent with findings from the toxin mouse models described above, AAV2-SYN-injected mice display serum IgG deposition into the CNS parenchyma as a consequence of BBB dysfunction, as well as T and B cell infiltration (Theodore et al., 2008). The AAV2-SYN model induces a slower, less acute form of neurodegeneration than the toxin-based animal models for PD, and so may prove useful for understanding the timing of inflammation and neuronal death. Importantly, human α-Syn overexpression triggers microglial activation, BBB leakage, and recruitment of T and B cells into the SN prior to neurodegeneration in mice (Theodore et al., 2008). These findings support the concept that immune cell recruitment and local inflammatory features play critical roles in induction of neurodegeneration, rather than acting as a secondary consequence from neuronal death.

In a rat model of PD, overexpression of a rare, autosomal dominant A53T mutant α-Syn allele that causes α-Syn aggregation and early onset PD in humans, induces microgliosis and lymphocytic infiltration in SN (Van der Perren et al., 2015). However, administration of FK506, an immunosuppressive drug that inhibits T cell signal transduction and IL-2 transcription, to the rAAV2/7 α-Syn overexpressing rat model increased the survival of dopaminergic neurons, with a trend for motor improvement. FK506 reduced the numbers of microglia, macrophages, and CD4+ T cells in the SN and delayed the infiltration of CD8+ T cells (Van der Perren et al., 2015).

A recent in vitro study using induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived midbrain neurons and T cells from PD patients showed that PD patient-derived T cells can kill dopamine neurons directly, and further demonstrated that PD patients contain significantly higher Th17 cells than healthy controls (Sommer et al., 2018). The PD patient-derived Th17 cells exerted cytotoxic effects on neurons by releasing IL-17A, a cytokine detected by IL-17R expressed on neurons (Sommer et al., 2018). The iPSC in vitro cultures lacked glia, which express MHC class II and can potentially interact with Th17 cells. In addition, T cells were activated non-specifically, and so the antigen specificity of Th17 cells remains unclear (Sommer et al., 2018). While the study indicates that PD-derived T cells can directly kill dopaminergic neurons, there was an absence of professional antigen presenting cells, antigenicity, and neuronal specificity in the cultures in this study, each of which play important roles in disease progression in vivo. While, the mode of action that garners specific vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons and avoids unaffected neurons is not resolved, this study indicates that Th17 cells may participate in PD-related neuronal death.

A ROLE FOR MHC PROTEINS IN PD PATHOGENESIS

Antigenic epitopes are presented to T cells as a result of a complex series of events termed antigen processing and presentation that involve the intracellular degradation of self and foreign proteins into peptides, that are then loaded onto the antigen-binding groove of MHC molecules. In general, T cells recognize peptides derived from foreign molecules, but some T cells also evade self-tolerance and can recognize self-peptides. MHC class I in general presents peptides derived from the same cell (endogenous presentation), while MHC class II typically present peptides derived from extracellular proteins (exogenous presentation).

GWAS in PD patients have shown an association with haplotypes of MHC II genes, including DRB5*01 and DRB1*15:01 alleles and a polymorphism in a non-coding region that may increase levels of MHC class II expression (Hamza et al., 2010; Greenbaum et al., 2011; Wissemann et al., 2013; Hill-Burns et al., 2014; Kannarkat et al., 2015). MHC-II positive microglia are detected in the SN of PD patients (McGeer et al., 1988a) and their levels increase with disease severity (Imamura et al., 2003).

Mature neurons are generally thought to lack MHC expression and present antigens. However, SN and LC neurons have been shown to express MHC-I and co-localize with CD8+ T cells in response to stimuli such as IFNγ (Cebrian et al., 2014b) released by microglia that have been exposed to extracellular α-synuclein or neuromelanin. Catecholamine neurons are particularly sensitive to inflammation in comparison to other neuron types. A lower amount of IFNγ is required to induce expression of MHC-I in dopaminergic and locus coeruleus catecholaminergic neurons in comparison to other neuronal subtypes. These neurons can also induce MHC-I expression in response to oxidative stress from high cytosolic dopamine induced by l-DOPA. The MHC-I presented by dopaminergic neurons is functional and can result in cytotoxicity in the presence of matching antigen and CD8+ T cells (Cebrian et al., 2014b). Dopaminergic neuron sensitivity to inflammation and corresponding MHC-I upregulation could render them susceptible to infiltrating T cells versus neighboring, more resistant GABAergic neurons.

Animal models of PD have been used to investigate the role of MHC proteins in neurodegeneration. AAV2-α-Syn overexpression in mice lacking MHC-II does not promote microglial activation, BBB permeability, and neuronal death in the SN (Harms et al., 2013). A requirement for MHC-II signaling to promote neuronal death is also reported in the MPTP model of PD, where MHC-II null mice are resistant to neuronal death their microglia do not release pro-inflammatory cytokines in contrast to wild-type animals (Martin et al., 2016).

Association of HLA alleles to late-onset PD and a positive correlation between levels of MHC-II expression and disease severity in humans, in conjunction with the necessity for MHC-II expression in PD mouse models, suggests that antigen presentation and adaptive immune signaling may be involved in dopaminergic neuron death. Taken together, infiltrating T cells, MHC expression, and the particular sensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to inflammation support the concept that PD possesses features of an autoimmune disorder.

A CONNECTION BETWEEN INNATE IMMUNITY AND ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELLS

Professional antigen presenting cells detect foreign pathogens via pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), that activate signaling cascades to change the inflammatory profile of immune cells (Bryant et al., 2015). Picomolar concentrations of α-Syn, possibly relevant to extracellular levels found in PD, sensitize the response by macrophages to release proinflammatory cytokines (Hughes et al., 2019). Extra-cellular neuromelanin derived from human autopsy also activates microglia via CD11b/CD18 (also known as Mac-1) integrin receptors (Zhang et al., 2011b). Thus, it may not be surprising that peripheral blood monocytes isolated from PD patients are found to be hypersensitive and predisposed to an inflammatory stimulus (Grozdanov et al., 2014). Antigen presenting cells in the periphery have the potential to be the first in line to respond to sustained, slight increase in α-Syn levels, which have deleterious effects over time. In addition, in vitro studies report that α-Syn acts as a chemoattractant to neutrophils and monocytes (Stolzenberg et al., 2017).

Peripherally activated antigen-presenting cells such as monocytes can extravasate into tissues including the brain during active disease states (Ransohoff, 2011). In an AAV overexpressing model of PD, α-Syn expression recruited peripheral monocytes to the brain, a step necessary for dopaminergic neuron death (Harms et al., 2018). α-Syn in the periphery and CNS can activate and recruit professional antigen presenting cells, potentially initiating an inflammatory response against itself.

Microglia and other cells of the monocyte lineage are particularly adept at internalizing aggregated proteins and presenting peptides derived from exogenous proteins in the context of class II MHC molecules, and therefore represent a strong candidate for MHC class II restricted presentation of α-Syn peptides to T cells. Microglia are the primary immune cells of the CNS and act as both resident phagocytic and antigen presenting cell to provide an active immune defense (Shemer et al., 2015). Microgliosis is characterized by microglia proliferation, change in morphologic state from ramified to amoebic, and the presence of inflammatory markers including CD68 (Shemer et al., 2015). In vivo imaging studies of microglial activation using positron-emission tomography (PET) showed that PD patients have markedly increased neuroinflammation in various brain regions, including the basal ganglia and striatum, regardless of the number of years with disease (Ouchi et al., 2005; Gerhard et al., 2006).

Studies suggest that inhibiting or preventing microglial activation may be protective in PD. RANTES and eotaxin, two chemokines secreted by activated microglia, are upregulated in MPTP mice and monkeys (Roy et al., 2015; Chandra et al., 2016). Treatment of MPTP exposed monkeys with NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide, which selectively inhibits NF-κB activation, decreases microglia expression of RANTES, and attenuates CD8+ T cell infiltration into the SN (Roy et al., 2015). Neutralization of RANTES and eotaxin in MPTP-intoxicated mice decreases lymphocyte infiltration in the SN, reduces inflammation, and confers dopaminergic neuronal protection and improved motor function (Chandra et al., 2016). The neuron-derived chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) is a ligand for CX3CR1 on microglia and promotes sustained microglial activation. Mice that are CX3CR1-deficient are protected against dopaminergic neuron loss in MPTP-treated mice (Tristao et al., 2016), likely by limiting the neurotoxic effect of CCL2 induction by astrocytes, which promotes CCR2+ monocyte infiltration (Parillaud et al., 2017). Treatment of 6-OHDA rats with safinamide suppressed microglial activation and protected dopaminergic neurons from degeneration (Sadeghian et al., 2016). In addition, deficits in microglial restraint exacerbate dopaminergic neurodegeneration in 6-OHDA rats (Zhang et al., 2011a).

α-SYN AS AN AUTOIMMUNE NEOANTIGEN IN PD

It is possible that microglia in the SN are activated by α-Syn aggregates and present epitopes derived from these aggregates to T cells. Indeed, in vitro studies show that α-Syn robustly activates microglia (Cebrian et al., 2014a). Treatment of primary microglia with recombinant, monomeric α-syn consistently induces an activated, pro-inflammatory profile, including increased TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2 expression, and iNOS production. When α-Syn is overexpressed in mouse models by viral injection or transgenic expression, it initiates an immune response via upregulation of microgliosis and recruits lymphocytes into the SN prior to degeneration [for review (Sanchez-Guajardo et al., 2013)].

Autoimmunity, a concept introduced by Rose and colleagues in studies of immune reactions to thyroglobulin (Rose et al., 1965), arises from the failure to recognize endogenous proteins as self, driving the immune system to respond to and attack one’s own cells and tissues. In addition, immune-proteosome proteins are activated in the inflamed state of PD, potentiating the formation of novel protein processing machinery that generates novel peptides in the unique inflamed state (Ugras et al., 2018) that could further lead to the formation of neoepitopes of α-Syn and other proteins. α-Syn was first shown to drive antigenic responses in a study in rats by Cohen and colleagues (Mor et al., 2003) in a study of autoimmune encephalitis and uveitis.

To determine if PD patients and age matched controls showed antigen responses to α-Syn, lymphocyte responses were studied in PBMC fractions. Peptides derived from α-Syn elicit in vitro responses from cytotoxic and Th cells from PD patients but not healthy controls (Sulzer et al., 2017). Two regions showing differential response were identified, one that contained Y39 and is in proximity with the disease-causing alleles, and the other that contains S129, and requires phosphorylation at an α-Syn residue, S129, that is found in high levels in Lewy bodies (Spillantini et al., 1998). The peptide region containing Y39 strongly binds to MHC complexes encoded by HLA (DRB1*15:01, DRB5*01:01) that are associated with PD by GWAS (Hamza et al., 2010; Greenbaum et al., 2011; Wissemann et al., 2013; Hill-Burns et al., 2014; Kannarkat et al., 2015), and so may explain the association of these alleles with PD.

It appears that autoimmune responses by T cells to α-Syn exist prior to the onset of motor symptoms and PD diagnosis and are strongest earlier in the course of the disease (Lindestam Arlehamn et al., 2020), but are mostly lost by 10 years after diagnosis. These findings support the notion that α-Syn-specific T cells may not simply be downstream effects of the disease but are present in the circulation prior to disease onset and may play an early role in PD pathogenesis.

The T cells identified to respond to α-Syn-derived epitopes in human are mostly CD4+ and include both Th1 and Th2 types, but CD8+ T cells were also identified in some participants. Cytokines released by these cells include IFN-γ, IL-5, and IL-10. As mentioned, the type of T cells appears to change over the course of the disease, but additional studies are needed to elucidate this issue in detail.

The presence of α-Syn as an autoantigen has been independently confirmed in a study that compared multiple sclerosis and PD patients (Lodygin et al., 2019). Interestingly, they found that β-Synuclein, which shares high homology with α-Syn, is an antigenic epitope in multiple sclerosis; however, MS patients do not show abnormally high response to α-Syn despite the high homology. This is quite surprising and more research may reveal the differences in these responses.

We note that α-Syn-specific T cells have thus far only been detected in the periphery of PD patients. There are differences between blood and brain T cells (Fransen et al., 2020), likely because there is a retention and/or proliferation of T cells in brain that recognize local epitopes (Pasciuto et al., 2020). If these reactive T cells were to extravasate into the brain, they would detect α-Syn on the surface of microglia, astrocytes and neurons, which may assist in the retention of these T cells in the brain. Antigen recognition by Th1 and cytotoxic T cells leads to increased local inflammation and cell death. However, whether α-Syn-specific T cells identified in PD patients permeate into the CNS and cause dopaminergic neuron death remains to be determined.

Many autoimmune disorders feature “antigen spreading,” an expansion of response to additional epitopes. A strong candidate for this in PD would be phosphorylated tau, which in addition to a high presence in dementias, has also been linked genetically and frequently observed in PD brain pathology studies: however, while T cell response to tau was found to be very common, and there was a higher overall response in subjects with PD, no specific epitope signature was found (Lindestam Arlehamn et al., 2019). There are suggestions from studies of pink and parkin mutant animals that mitochondrial proteins may also provide antigenic epitopes in PD and that this could be triggered by intestinal infection (Matheoud et al., 2016, 2019).

IMPLICATIONS FOR DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPEUTICS

Recent research studies on the role of the immune response in the pathogenesis of PD suggest new avenues for diagnosis and treatment. α-Syn-specific T cells could provide early biomarkers of the disease, identifying autoimmunity prior to the onset of motor symptoms, particularly for those who carry the HLA alleles associated with PD. Large-scale, longitudinal studies monitoring α-Syn reactivity and the development of PD must be conducted before establishing T cells as PD biomarkers. New treatment avenues targeting the immune system are being tested on PD patients. As mentioned, an epidemiologic study indicates a strong effect of anti-TNFα therapy on the incidence of PD in subjects with IBD; therefore, inhibition of TNFα or other early inflammatory steps may also provide a potential therapy for PD (Peter et al., 2018). Sargramostim is a human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the recovery of patients receiving bone marrow transplantation and cancer therapies (Rowin et al., 2012). It functions by promoting myeloid recovery and inducing Treg responses (Rowin et al., 2012). In a preliminary randomized, double-blind phase 1 clinical trial, Sargramostim-treated patients showed modest improvements after 6 and 8 weeks of treatment and increases in Treg numbers and function, compared to PD patients receiving placebo (Gendelman et al., 2017). Another potential avenue is to target α-Syn with antibodies. In PD mouse models, monoclonal antibodies against α-Syn have shown to reduce the levels of protein spread, ameliorate dopaminergic neuron loss, and attenuate motor deficits (Games et al., 2014; Lindstrom et al., 2014). Affinity epitopes known as PD01A and PRX002/RG7935 are currently in clinical trial and have been shown to penetrate the BBB and lower plasma levels of α-Syn (Foltynie and Langston, 2018; Jankovic, 2018). However, anti-α-Syn antibodies are also found in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid of PD patients and are absent in healthy controls (Horvath et al., 2017; Shalash et al., 2017; Akhtar et al., 2018), suggesting that anti-α-Syn antibodies may be more promising as an early biomarker for PD rather than a treatment.

Large strides have been made in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, mostly through the use of monoclonal antibodies to a variety of steps involved in the immune system, and there are now 14 FDA approved therapies. Some of these might have efficacy in the treatment of PD if begun at an early stage. As for all neuroprotective therapies in neurodegenerative disorders, it would be best to begin therapy before the clinical signs are recognized, and if such markers can be established by the presence of specific T cells or other means, future interventions will be far likelier to demonstrate efficacy in drug trials.

SUMMARY

Numerous independent studies suggest that a heightened and sustained immune response observed in PD patients may be a driver, rather than a consequence, of neuronal death. α-Syn pathology may begin in the periphery, where the enteric nervous system is compromised up to 20 years prior to diagnosis. Circulating T cells of PD patients have been shown to respond to α-Syn stimulation in vitro. PD patients are afflicted with sustained peripheral inflammation, which has been shown to lead to a deterioration of the BBB. Lymphocytes can extravasate into the CNS via the BBB, which is thought to be leaky in PD patients. Within the CNS, α-Syn accumulation and spread, microgliosis, and antigen presentation can help recruit and attract α-Syn-specific T cells. α-Syn targeting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells observed in PD patients can recognize specific peptides bound to MHC-II on microglia and MHC-I on dopaminergic neurons. While further studies are necessary to confirm a role for T cells response to α-Syn in PD pathology, these phenomena have been observed in PD patients and found essential in recapitulating aspects of the disease in animal models.
