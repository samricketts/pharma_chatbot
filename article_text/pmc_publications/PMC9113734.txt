Elevated exposure to toxic amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides and consequent blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction are believed to promote vasculopathy in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the accumulation kinetics of different Aβ isoforms within the BBB endothelium and how it drives BBB dysfunction are not clearly characterized. Using single positron emission computed tomography (SPECT)-computed tomography (CT) dynamic imaging coupled with population pharmacokinetic modeling, we investigated the accumulation kinetics of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the BBB endothelium. Brain clearance was quantified after intracerebral administration of 125I-Aβ, and BBB-mediated transport was shown to account for 54% of 125I-Aβ40 total clearance. A brain influx study demonstrated lower values of both maximal rate (Vmax) and Michaelis constant (Km) for 125I-Aβ42 compared to 125I-Aβ40. Validated by a transcytosis study in polarized human BBB endothelial cell (hCMEC/D3) monolayers, model simulations demonstrated impaired exocytosis was responsible for inefficient permeability and enhanced accumulation of Aβ42 in the BBB endothelium. Further, both isoforms were shown to disrupt the exocytosis machinery of BBB endothelial cells so that a vicious cycle could be generated. The validated model was able to capture changes in Aβ steady-state levels in plasma as well as the brain during AD progression and allowed us to predict the kinetics of Aβ accumulation in the BBB endothelium.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Abnormal accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, Aβ40 and Aβ42, in the brain and plasma is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).1 Differing only by two amino acid residues, these Aβ isoforms demonstrate distinct accumulation patterns in the brain. For example, amyloid plaques that predominate brain parenchyma mostly contain Aβ42, whereas the cerebrovascular amyloid deposits primarily contain Aβ40.2 Differences are also observed in the distribution of soluble Aβ42 (sAβ42) and sAβ40 peptides in plasma and the brain. Studies have shown that the sAβ42/40 ratio in plasma and the brain decreased in patients during AD progression.3,4

Impaired brain clearance rather than overproduction is believed to be responsible for amyloid accumulation in late-onset sporadic AD, which constitutes about 97% of total AD cases.5,6 The blood–brain barrier (BBB) endothelium, a dynamic physiological interface between plasma and the brain, is believed to mediate Aβ transport between plasma and the brain.7,8 On the luminal side, plasma Aβ was claimed to be endocytosed by BBB endothelium via the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE).9,10 The exocytosis of Aβ carrying endosomes is presumed to be handled by soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes.11 On the abluminal side, Aβ was claimed to be endocytosed by the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1)12,13 and transported to the luminal side by the P-glycoprotein (P-gp).14 It is important to note that these are putative Aβ receptors; there might be other, yet undiscovered receptors/transporters that are involved in Aβ trafficking at the BBB.

In Alzheimer’s brain, RAGE expression is found to be upregulated15 whereas reductions in LRP1 expression and P-gp efflux activity were reported.16,17 Furthermore, substantial reduction in SNARE complexes has been reported in post-mortem brains of AD patients,18 which may lead to the disruption of Aβ exocytosis. It is likely that the accumulation of toxic Aβ in the BBB endothelium is substantially increased due to these changes in the expression of putative Aβ receptors/transporters. On the other hand, elevated BBB exposure to toxic Aβ was shown to disrupt BBB functions including altered glucose transport,19 loss of tight-junction integrity,20 inflammation21 and even the trafficking of Aβ itself.22 Consequently, a vicious cycle could be generated that leads to BBB breakdown and vasculopathy in AD. Therefore, it is important to assess BBB exposure to Aβ peptides during AD progression and correlate it with BBB dysfunctions that ensue.

However, it is challenging to assess Aβ accumulation in the BBB endothelium in AD patient brains, even post-mortem. Therefore, we employed dynamic imaging techniques coupled with mathematical modeling to assess Aβ accumulation and elucidate the differences in Aβ40 and Aβ42 interactions with the BBB. Mathematical modeling allows us to predict Aβ disposition in physiological compartments in health and disease; especially in the BBB endothelium, where Aβ exposure cannot be determined using current experimental techniques. Existing pharmacokinetic (PK) models primarily focus on predicting Aβ production and how pharmacological agents (e.g., γ-secretase inhibitors) could alter Aβ brain levels,23–25 while very few of them describe Aβ transport kinetics in and out of the brain. Moreover, none of these models consider the BBB endothelium as a separate compartment to capture Aβ trafficking and accumulation in the BBB endothelium. In this study, we employed single positron emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) dynamic imaging to quantify Aβ levels in the brain, and then applied nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM) approach to investigate differential trafficking kinetics and accumulation of Aβ40 versus Aβ42 in the BBB endothelium. In vitro cellular kinetic studies were subsequently performed to verify the in-silico findings. The validated model was employed to simulate the effect of altered Aβ trafficking at the BBB on Aβ steady-state levels in various physiological compartments, especially in the BBB endothelium, during AD progression.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Animals.

B6SJLF1/J mice were maintained in the Mayo Clinic animal care facility with food and water ad libitum under 12 h/12 h light and dark cycles. Experiments were conducted in mice aged 9 ± 2 months in adherence with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals provided by the National Institutes of Health. All protocols were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Radioiodination of Aβ Peptides.

The Aβ peptides were labeled with 125I using the chloramine-T procedure as described in our previous publications.26 The purity of the 125I-labeled proteins was determined by the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) assay. The specific activity of 125I-Aβ was determined to be in the range of 45–48 μCi/mg.

Plasma Pharmacokinetics of 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42.

The plasma PK studies were conducted as described in our previous publications and part of the data for subsequent curve fitting was extracted from our previous work.27 Briefly, the femoral vein and artery of each animal was catheterized under general anesthesia with a mixture of isoflurane (1.5%) and oxygen (4 L/min). A bolus injection (100 μCi) of 125I-Aβ40 or 125I-Aβ42 was administered in the femoral vein, and the blood (20 μL) was sampled from the femoral artery using heparinized capillary tubes at various time points. The blood samples were diluted with saline and centrifuged to separate the plasma. Then the intact 125I-Aβ was precipitated using TCA and centrifuged to collect the pellet. Total radioactivity counts in both supernatant and pellet were separately analyzed in the gamma counter.

Model Development.

As shown in Figure 1, a stepwise-compartmental model was constructed to describe Aβ transport kinetics across the BBB endothelium. First, a two-compartment model was established using plasma concentration–time data. Next, with plasma PK parameters fixed, the full model was fitted to the brain radioactivity–time data following intracerebral injection of 125I-Aβ and 68Ga-DOTA tracers and abluminal-to-luminal (efflux) transport kinetic parameters were predicted. Finally, luminal-to-abluminal (influx) transport was determined by fitting the same model to brain radioactivity–time data where 125I-Aβ tracers were administered intravenously. Under the current experimental conditions, efflux transport of 125I-Aβ was assumed to be linear but uptake on the luminal side was described by Michaelis–Menten equation in the model. Plasma and influx transport PK analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed effect modeling with NONMEM v7.3 (ICON Development Solutions, MD USA). Subroutines ADVAN3 TRANS1 and ADVAN13 were used to build the plasma and final PK model, respectively. The first-order conditional estimation (FOCE) with interaction was used throughout the modeling procedure. Between-subject-variability (BSV) of the PK parameters was assumed to follow a log-normal distribution and described by an exponential error model. Proportional error model for the residual unexplained variability was used after comparison with additive and mixed error models. Model development was guided by the likelihood ratio test using objective function values, information criteria, and graphical goodness-of-fit. For efflux studies, parameters were estimated using the iterative two-stage (ITS) method in SAAM II program (version 2.3, SAAM Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA).

Mass-balance equations for each compartment were displayed as the ordinary differential equations (ODE) provided below:

Central and peripheral compartments: (1) dA1dt=−K10×A1−K12×A1−Vmax×A1Km×V1+A1+K21×A2+K31×A3+K41×A4

(2) dA2dt=−K21×A2+K12×A1

BBB compartment: (3) dA3dt=−K31×A3−K34×A3+Vmax×A1Km×V1+A1+K43×A4

Brain extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment: (4) dA4dt=−K43×A4−K45×A4−K41×A4+K34×A3

Brain retention compartment: (5) dA5dt=K45×A4

where A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 were the amounts of Aβ in the central, peripheral, BBB, brain ECF and retention compartment, respectively. V1 was the volume of distribution of the central compartment; K10, K12, K21, K31, K41, K43, K34, and K45 were the first-order rate constants between the respective compartments. Vmax was the maximal rate and Km was the Michaelis–Menten constant describing the receptor-mediated uptake of Aβ at the BBB on the luminal side.

In the brain-to-plasma transport studies, brain radioactivity was determined after intracerebral injection of tracers. Briefly, mice were mounted on stereotaxic apparatus following anesthesia under a stream of isoflurane (1.5%) and oxygen (4 L/min). The skin above the skull was cut open and sutures were exposed. A small hole was drilled into the skull to access the cortex per the accurate stereotaxic coordinates. Each animal was injected with 2 μL of either 125I-Aβ40 or 125I-Aβ42 (around 2–3 μCi) into the right hippocampus. Immediately following this, the mice were imaged for 2 h by dynamic SPECT/CT (Gamma Medica, Northridge, CA). The percentage of radioactivity remaining in the brain after intracerebral injection was calculated as (6) radioactivityremaininginthebrain(%)=NtN0×100

where Nt is the radioactivity remaining in the brain at time t, and N0 is the initial radioactivity as measured immediately after microinjection. To avoid overparameterization, the following parameters were fixed or constrained. First, the maximal rate of uptake on the luminal side (Vmax) was set as zero since influx and is expected to be negligible with such a low intracerebrally injected dose (2–3 μCi) and rapid systemic clearance. Second, the first-order rate constant of glymphatic drainage bulk flow (K41) was fixed as the elimination rate constant of intracerebrally injected 68Gallium-dodecane tetraacetic acid (68Ga-DOTA). Third, the BBB uptake rate constant on the abluminal side (K43) was fixed as literature reported values.12,28 Finally, the relationship between exocytosis rate constants to the luminal and abluminal side (K31 and K34) was further constrained based on our previous in vitro findings.27 The brain radioactivity remaining in the brain was defined as the following equation during curve fitting: (7) brainradioactivity=A3+A4+A5+Cp×Vp

where Cp was the plasma concentration of 125I-Aβ and Vp was the residual brain region plasma volume as determined from our previous work.

In order to estimate the plasma-to-brain transport kinetic parameters, brain radioactivity was measured after intravenous injection of 125I-Aβ. The femoral vein of each animal was catheterized under general anesthesia with a mixture of isoflurane (1.5%) and oxygen (4 L/min). Then the mice were administered with 500–600 μCi of 125I-Aβ through the femoral vein. The animals were immediately imaged for the following 40 min by dynamic SPECT/CT. Measured radioactivity was corrected for instrument sensitivity difference between SPECT/CT and gamma counter. Data for some of the animals was extracted from our previous work.27 The model was fitted to the corrected brain radioactivity–time data using eq 7. All the plasma and efflux kinetic parameters were fixed as obtained values described above. The only estimated parameters were Michaelis–Menten parameters which described the receptor-mediated uptake on the luminal side (Vmax and Km).

Model Evaluation.

The plasma and final models were evaluated by goodness-of-fit plots, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesion information criterion (BIC), nonparametric bootstrap analysis and visual predictive check (VPC) using Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN 4.2.0). Two hundred bootstrap samples were generated from the original data sets for model fitting to obtain parameter estimates. The mean and 95% bootstrap confidence interval calculated from the successful bootstrap runs were compared with the final model estimates. For VPC, 1000 hypothetical data sets were simulated using the parameter estimates of the final model. The 90% confidence intervals were calculated and visually inspected to see how the intervals overlapped with the observed data.

Model Simulation.

The validated model was used to simulate the luminal-to-abluminal (L-A) endocytosis, exocytosis, permeability and BBB accumulation at 15 min post administration of 10 μCi 125I-Aβ on the luminal side. Parameter sensitivity analysis was performed for the abluminal exocytosis rate constant (K34) in prediction of L-A permeability and BBB accumulation. The K34 values used ranged from one-third to twice the original values and the fold change of L-A permeability and BBB accumulation was predicted. In order to simulate the Aβ accumulation at steady-state level, the model input was switched from exogenous tracer administration to endogenous Aβ production which follows zero-order kinetics in both brain and plasma compartments. The rates were calibrated on the basis of literature reported Aβ42/40 ratio and concentrations of total Aβ in CSF and plasma, which are around 2 nM and 0.05 nM, respectively.29,30 Simulations of Aβ accumulation in the context of AD progression were conducted after adjusting various kinetic parameters simultaneously as informed by our published work as well as literature evidence.

Aβ Permeability across the Polarized hCMEC/D3 Cell Monolayer.

The immortalized human cerebral microvascular endothelial (hCMEC/D3) cells were cultured as previously described.31 Polarized cell monolayer was incubated with 125I-Aβ40 or 125I-Aβ42 in tracer amount on the luminal side. Multiple samples were taken from the abluminal chamber at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min, and radioactivity was assayed using a gamma counter. The flux of 125I-Aβ across the BBB endothelium was calculated as the slope of the cumulative amount of 125I-Aβ reaching the abluminal side per cm2 versus time. The apparent permeability coefficients were calculated by normalizing flux with initial concentration of 125I-Aβ added to the luminal compartment. In the experiment of tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) treatment, the monolayers were pretreated with TeNT for 60 min prior to 125I-Aβ addition. To evaluate temperature dependence on Aβ permeability across the polarized hCMEC/D3 monolayers, fluorescein-labeled Aβ (F-Aβ) was used to correlate with the flow cytometry studies reported previously.32 The F-Aβ fluorescence reaching the abluminal side was collected at various time points described above and was measured by microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm.

Impact of Aβ Exposure on Exocytosis Machinery Determined by Fluorescence Energy Transfer (FRET).

The detailed information on FRET studies was described in our previous publication.33 Briefly, the hCMEC/D3 were transfected with the FRET donor (Cer-VAMP2), FRET acceptor (Cit-SNAP25) or both using transfection reagent (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Transfected cells were preincubated for 1 h with 1 μM Aβ40, Aβ42, or 10 nM TeNT. The FRET intensity was captured on an Olympus FluoView FV1000IX2 inverted confocal microscope and the images were processed stepwise using FIJI ImageJ software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, USA). Offline fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) data analysis was performed using SPCImage software (Becker &amp; Hickl) to obtain the frequency histogram and mean lifetime (τm).

Impact of Aβ Exposure on Exocytosis of FM4–64 in hCMEC/D3 Endothelial Cells.

FM4–64 was added to hCMEC/D3 cells with or without Aβ40/42 and incubated for 1 h. Then the cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and imaged live using Nikon TE-2000S inverted microscope (Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with appropriate filters. The cells were washed with colorless DMEM every 5 min. Cellular fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ software (National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland). A minimum of 25 cells was quantified per group at each time point.

RESULTS

Plasma Pharmacokinetics of 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42.

The plasma PK parameters of 125I-Aβ peptides were predicted by fitting a two-compartment model to the plasma concentration–time data. Both 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42 exhibited biexponential disposition in mice upon intravenous bolus injection via femoral vein (Figure 2). Basic goodness-of-fit plots for 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42 plasma PK model were displayed in Supplementary Figures 1 and 2. Individual predictions were in good agreement with observed concentrations, and conditional weighted residuals were found to be randomly distributed along the zero-ordinate line. By a nonparametric statistical test, the volume of distribution of 125I-Aβ40 in the central compartment (V1, 6.3 mL) was found to be substantially lower compared to that of 125I-Aβ42 (16.5 mL). The elimination rate constant from the central compartment (K10) for 125I-Aβ40 (0.20 min−1) was considerably greater than that of 125I-Aβ42 (0.088 min−1) (Table 1).

aK10, K12, and K21 are the first-order rate constants between respective compartments; V1 is a volume of distribution in the central compartment; BSV is the between-subject variability; CV is the coefficient of variation; RSE is the relative standard error; RE is the residual error; and CI is the confidence interval. bThere is a significant difference between 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42 with a p-value &lt; 0.0001 (Kolmogorov–Smirnov nonparametric test).

Brain-to-Plasma Efflux Kinetics of 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42.

From the brain, the 125I-Aβ peptides were reported to be cleared simultaneously by BBB34 and by the glymphatic drainage pathway,35 which involves bulk fluid flow pathways. The rate of elimination via the glymphatic drainage pathway was estimated by injecting 68Ga-DOTA into the brain, which is expected to be cleared along the fluid drainage pathways, and imaging the residual brain radioactivity with PET/CT dynamic imaging for up to 40 min (Figure 3A). A monoexponential equation was fitted to the residual brain radioactivity against time, and the first-order rate constant was estimated as 0.013 min−1 (Figure 3B). After fixing the parameters describing plasma pharmacokinetics and glymphatic clearance from the brain, parameters describing 125I-Aβ efflux via the BBB and the brain retention were predicted by fitting the mechanistic model described in Figure 1 to 125I-Aβ brain radioactivity–time data following intracerebral injection. It was shown that the model can adequately describe the radioactivity loss from the brain for both 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42 (Figure 3C). The corresponding parameter estimates were presented in Table 2. The luminal exocytosis rate constant (K31) of 125I-Aβ42 (0.17 ± 0.15 min−1) was found to be 4-fold higher than that of 125I-Aβ40 (0.044 ± 0.043 min−1). Both peptides exhibited retention in the brain as indicated by a plateau phase in Figure 3C. The retention rate constant (K45) of 125I-Aβ42 (0.018 ± 0.012 min−1) was 2-fold higher compared to that of 125I-Aβ40 (0.010 ± 0.003 min−1). However, neither the difference in K31 nor K45 was found to be statistically significant. Finally, the relative contribution of various pathways to the total clearance of 125I-Aβ was quantified as predicted by the corresponding rate constants (Figure 3D). It was found that the BBB-mediated efflux accounted for 54.0% of 125I-Aβ40 total clearance, whereas only 32.6% of 125I-Aβ42 was cleared by BBB and higher proportion was trapped inside the brain (39.1%).

Plasma-to-Brain Influx Kinetics of 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42 and Model Evaluation.

Immediately following intravenous administration of 125I-Aβ, the brain was scanned by dynamic SPECT/CT imaging for 40 min. The saturable influx parameters (Vmax and Km) were obtained by fitting the model to brain radioactivity–time data. As demonstrated in Figure 4, the model well described the brain radioactivity–time profile for both peptides. As presented in Table 3, the Michaelis constant (Km) of 125I-Aβ40 (60.6 nM) was significantly higher than that of 125I-Aβ42 (6.83 nM). A similar trend was also observed for the maximal uptake rate (Vmax), which was 0.36 pmol/min and 0.20 pmol/min for 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42, respectively.

Model Validation.

The visual predictive check plots (Figure 5) demonstrated that observed median plasma concentrations and the brain radioactivity were within the 90% confidence interval of 1000 simulations based on final parameter estimates. Nonparametric bootstrap analysis (Tables 1 and 3) showed that all parameter estimates were close to the mean and were inside the 95% confidence interval of the bootstrap estimates.

Kinetics of 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42 Accumulation in the BBB Endothelium.

The established model was employed to simulate the accumulation kinetics of 125I-Aβ in the BBB endothelium. Uptake of 125I-Aβ42 on the luminal side was predicted to be substantially higher than that of 125I-Aβ40 (Figure 6A). However, the exocytosis of 125I-Aβ40 to the abluminal side was predicted to be more efficient (Figure 6B). Consequently, L-A permeabilities of 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42 were not significantly different (Figure 6C), but a higher accumulation of 125I-Aβ42 within the BBB endothelium was predicted (Figure 6D). These model predictions were verified in polarized hCMEC/D3 monolayers grown on Transwell filters in vitro. Data presented in Figure 6G have shown that the transcellular L-A permeabilities (37–4 °C) of F-Aβ40 and F-Aβ42 were not significantly different from each other. Parameter sensitivity analysis indicated that a reduction in the K34 value (abluminal exocytosis) would decrease the L-A permeability (Figure 6E). This simulation was verified by in vitro permeability studies in which L-A permeabilities of 125I-Aβ decreased significantly when the cellular exocytosis machinery was disrupted by the treatment of TeNT (Figure 6H). The model simulations have also shown that the BBB endothelial accumulation of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 increases with a decrease in abluminal exocytosis rate constant (Figure 6F).

Impact of Aβ Exposure on Exocytosis Machinery in the BBB Endothelium.

After assessing the role of abluminal exocytosis on Aβ accumulation in the BBB endothelium, the impact of Aβ exposure on critical SNARE proteins that mediate abluminal exocytosis in the BBB endothelium was examined using FRET studies. Spatial lifetime images demonstrated a decrease in the FRET efficiency between Cer-VAMP2 and Cit-SNAP25 in hCMEC/D3 cells pretreated with Aβ40 (Figure 7C), Aβ42 (Figure 7D), or TeNT compared to the FRET controls (Figure 7B). Associated spectral frequency histograms displayed a rightward shift into blue regions, indicating an increased lifetime. This was further verified by software projected τm values as presented in the cumulative table (Figure 7F). In a separate study, the effect of Aβ on the exocytosis of fluorescent marker FM4–64 was investigated in hCMEC/D3 cells. The microscopy imaging and quantification of fluorescence intensity demonstrated that Aβ40 or Aβ42 exposure significantly inhibits the exocytosis of the FM4–64 marker. The first-order exocytosis rate constant of FM4–64 was found to reduce from 0.043 min−1 (control cells, Figure 8A) to 0.031 min−1 in Aβ40-treated cells (Figure 8B) and to 0.025 min−1 in Aβ42-treated cells (Figure 8C).

Simulations of Steady-State Aβ Levels.

The effect of AD pathology on Aβ disposition was evaluated by simulating steady-state Aβ levels using the validated model. The parameters used for simulation are presented in Table 4. As demonstrated in Figure 9A, an increase in steady-state levels of both isoforms in the BBB endothelium was predicted during AD progression, but this effect was more significant for Aβ40 (~3-fold). In plasma, levels of both peptides were predicted to increase with AD (Figure 9B), but the soluble Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio decreased from 0.13 to 0.08. Similarly, in the brain parenchyma, the soluble Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio decreased from 0.37 to 0.24 (Figure 9C).

DISCUSSION

BBB plays a pivotal role in maintaining the dynamic equilibrium between plasma and brain Aβ levels. Previous research has established that BBB dysfunction leads to abnormal Aβ deposition in the brain.7,34 With upregulated RAGE expression,15 a decrease in LRP1/Pgp efflux activity,16,17 and impaired exocytosis machinery,18 we speculate that Aβ accumulation within the BBB endothelium is also substantially enhanced during AD progression, which could aggravate BBB dysfunction. Further, both preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated significant alterations in the concentrations of Aβ40 and Aβ42 and their disposition in plasma and the brain during Alzheimer’s progression.3,4 However, the manner in which these changes affect Aβ accumulation in the BBB endothelium is not well characterized.

In the current study, a semimechanistic population pharmacokinetic model was constructed to investigate the trafficking and accumulation of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the BBB endothelium. The parameters describing luminal-to-abluminal and abluminal-to-luminal trafficking of Aβ peptides were estimated independently and simultaneously. The model, which was optimized and validated by our experimental results, was further employed to simulate Aβ accumulation in various physiological compartments, particularly the BBB endothelium. We made the following important findings: (1) BBB mediates 54% of total 125I-Aβ40 clearance, but only 33% of total 125I-Aβ42 clearance from the brain, (2) brain influx was lower for 125I-Aβ40 compared to 125I-Aβ42, (3) transcytosis studies conducted in BBB endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) and in model simulations have demonstrated that impaired exocytosis is responsible for inefficient permeability and enhanced accumulation of Aβ42 in the BBB endothelium, and (4) both isoforms were shown to disrupt the exocytosis machinery of BBB endothelial cells so that a vicious cycle could be generated.

Plasma Pharmacokinetics.

The model construction was initiated with the elucidation of Aβ plasma PK. Mounting evidence suggests that Aβ pools on the luminal side could interfere with insulin and RAGE signaling within the BBB endothelium and ultimately impact Aβ accumulation in the brain.38,39 Therefore, a thorough analysis of plasma PK of 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42 was conducted in young wild-type (B6SJLF1/J) mice. The Aβ peptides have been shown to display biexponential disposition in plasma.40 Similarly, in the current study, a two-compartment model adequately fitted the plasma concentration–time data of both 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42 (Figure 2). The goodness-of-fit of the model was indicated by randomly distributed weighted residual and high correlation between observations and predictions (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2). The125I-Aβ42 demonstrated higher volume of distribution than that of 125I-Aβ40 (Table 1), which can be attributed to greater hydrophobicity of Aβ42 that facilitates adsorption to the phospholipid bilayers of the plasma membrane as demonstrated in previous studies.41,42 These differential biophysical interactions with cellular membranes may promote a higher volume of distribution of Aβ42 compared to Aβ40. Further analysis demonstrated that the elimination rate constant of 125I-Aβ42 was only 45% of 125I-Aβ40. It was previously reported that Aβ is primarily cleared from systemic circulation by the liver, and the uptake by the liver is mediated by LRP1.43 Further, Aβ40 has higher binding affinity to LRP1 than Aβ42,44 which may result in greater systemic elimination of Aβ40.

Brain Clearance.

Three pathways are believed to predominantly clear Aβ from the brain: efflux across the BBB,34 degradation in the brain parenchyma,45 and clearance with the bulk flow of ISF-CSF via glymphatic drainage.35 Using dynamic imaging in combination with pharmacokinetic modeling, the relative contribution of each clearance pathway was estimated in the current study. The PK model was constructed by appending BBB, brain ECF and brain retention compartments to the two-compartment model describing plasma PK (Figure 1). The addition of these extra compartments has no significant impact on the plasma PK, which is in agreement with our previous observations.40 Parameters describing brain efflux were estimated by fitting the model to the brain radioactivity–time data following intracerebral injection of radiotracers. The first-order rate constant of clearance via bulk flow was predicted as 0.013 min−1 from the monoexponential decay of intracerebrally injected 68Ga-DOTA radioactivity. Gadolinium diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) is a widely used contrast agent to assess BBB permeability using magnetic resonance imaging.46 Given the similar physiochemical properties, the 68Ga-DOTA is believed to have negligible BBB permeability and is presumably cleared from the brain via glymphatic drainage pathways. Xie et al. used inulin, which does not permeate the BBB, to calculate ISF bulk flow rate constant, and reported the clearance values within the same range of 0.006 min−1 and 0.016 min−1 for awake and sleep mice, respectively.47 The intracerebrally injected 125I-Aβ radioactivity was normalized by the initial value to adjust for variations in the injected dose, which was low enough to not saturate the efflux transport system, and its clearance was found to be linear.12,28 Although, the abluminal uptake of 125I-Aβ40 was twice as much as 125I-Aβ42, parameter estimates indicated that the abluminal–luminal exocytosis was 4-fold higher for 125I-Aβ42 (Table 2). Substantially greater intraendothelial uptake coupled with lower exocytosis could favor 125I-Aβ40 accumulation within the BBB endothelium, which is consistent with the reported vasculotropic nature of Aβ40.2

Accumulation in the Brain Parenchyma.

In addition to getting cleared, soluble Aβ in the brain extracellular fluid could also be internalized into brain cells such as neurons48–50 and astrocytes.51 This trapping effect was reflected by a plateau in the terminal phase of radioactivity versus time data for both isoforms (Figure 3C). The retention of 125I-Aβ42 was 2-fold higher than 125I-Aβ40, although the difference was not statistically significant. The greater trapping effect of 125I-Aβ42 could be attributed to greater uptake of Aβ42 by neurons52 and possibly astrocytes and its greater propensity to form aggregates.

The relative contribution of these pathways to Aβ clearance from the brain was predicted based on the corresponding first-order rate constants (Figure 3D). It was found that the contribution of BBB-mediated clearance of 125I-Aβ40 (54%) was greater than that via perivascular drainage (26%). Shibata et al. also found that a major portion of 125I-Aβ40 clearance from the brain is mediated via the BBB.12 Also, SPECT imaging studies conducted in monkeys have estimated that approximately 80% of brain 125I-Aβ40 was transported via the BBB.53 These results support the role of BBB as the major clearance pathway for brain Aβ40. Contrarily, the BBB clearance of 125I-Aβ42 accounted for only 33% of the total clearance.

Plasma-to-Brain Influx.

Plasma-to-brain influx parameters were estimated by fitting the model to brain radioactivity–time data obtained following intravenous administration of 125I-Aβ tracers. As shown in Figure 4, the model sufficiently described the dynamic imaging data of both 125I-Aβ40 and 125I-Aβ42, which was also indicated by the goodness-of-fit plots (Supplementary Figures 3 and 4). The Km (60.6 nM) and Vmax (0.36 pmol/min) of Aβ40 in mice estimated by the model were close to those reported previously using in situ perfusion techniques in guinea pig brain microvessels.54 Both Km and Vmax values of 125I-Aβ40 were significantly higher than that of 125I-Aβ42 (Table 3), which was strikingly consistent with our previous estimates obtained in BBB model in vitro.32 Although speculative, the difference in the uptake kinetics could result from distinct molecular mechanisms driving Aβ40 versus Aβ42 uptake at the BBB. Our previous studies have shown that these two isoforms are internalized via different cellular uptake mechanisms in neurons;49,55 however, differences in molecular mechanisms driving BBB uptake of 25I-Aβ40 versus 25I-Aβ42 are yet to be determined. On the other hand, the influx clearance as estimated by Vmax/Km ratio was significantly higher for 125I-Aβ42 compared to 125I-Aβ40. Similar results were reported where the in vivo permeability surface product (PS) value and influx clearance (Ki), determined from the Gjedde-Patlak plot, were found to be higher for 125I-Aβ42 than that of 125I-Aβ40.27,56 Lower Km and Vmax values of 125I-Aβ42 suggested lower capacity but higher affinity for the influx transport system. However, this argument warrants further investigation. The model was finally validated by VPC plots. As shown in Figure 5, the 90% confidence interval calculated from 1000 simulations based on final model parameter estimates overlapped with the observations.

Accumulation of Aβ in the BBB Endothelium.

The model thus developed was employed to simulate Aβ transcytosis and accumulation kinetics at the BBB endothelium. Although simulated L-A uptake of Aβ42 was higher than that of Aβ40 (Figure 6A), the exocytosis efficiency was significantly lower (Figure 6B) to the extent that the L-A permeability of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 was similar (Figure 6C). Additionally, the accumulation of Aβ42 was predicted to be higher (Figure 6D). These model simulations were verified by transcytosis studies conducted in polarized hCMEC/D3 monolayers. Our previous publication has shown that the intracellular accumulation of F-Aβ42 was significantly higher than that of F-Aβ40, when the peptides were administered on the luminal side.32 In the current study, we conducted permeability studies at both 37 and 4 °C (inhibits active transcytosis). The results demonstrated that F-Aβ peptides are primarily transcytosed across the hCMEC/D3 monolayers as their permeability is 8-fold higher at 37 °C than at 4 °C (Figure 6G). After subtracting the paracellular permeability contributions assessed at 4 °C, it was found that there is no significant difference between the transcytosis of F-Aβ40 and F-Aβ42, thereby verifying the physiological validity of the model simulations. The discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo permeability discussed above could be due to the fact that lower plasma Aβ42 exposure makes the in vivo permeability higher. The sensitivity analysis conducted using the pharmacokinetic model developed in this study has shown that the PS value increases with the abluminal exocytosis rate constant (K34) for both Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Figure 6E). Further, parameter sensitivity analysis has predicted greater BBB accumulation, especially of Aβ40, if the L-A exocytosis is compromised (Figure 6F).

The simulation was verified by disrupting critical SNARE interactions that facilitate exocytosis. As demonstrated in Figure 6H, the L-A permeabilities of both isoforms were considerably reduced after the treatment of hCMEC/D3 monolayers with TeNT, which was previously shown to disrupt the interactions among SNARE proteins.57 Using sophisticated FRET/FLIM microscopy, we previously demonstrated that Aβ could directly interfere with the interaction between two SNARE proteins: VAMP2 and SNAP25 in neuronal cells.33 We hypothesized Aβ to demonstrate similar detrimental effects in BBB endothelial cells, and tested the hypothesis by conducting FRET/FLIM studies in hCMEC/D3 cells. With treatment of either Aβ40 or Aβ42, the FRET efficiency between Cer-VAMP2 and Cit-SNAP25 in hCMEC/D3 cells reduced significantly (Figure 7), thus indicating that Aβ peptides could also disrupt SNARE protein interactions in the BBB endothelium. The impact of Aβ exposure on endothelial exocytosis was further tested using FM4–64 dye, which is a widely used exocytosis marker. The results indicated that the exocytosis rate constant was significantly reduced upon Aβ exposure (Figure 8). Impaired exocytosis could promote Aβ accumulation at the BBB endothelium; increased exposure to toxic Aβ could in turn disrupt the exocytosis machinery, and trigger a vicious cycle that may ultimately result in elevated Aβ levels in the BBB endothelium and engender BBB dysfunction.

Simulations of Steady-State Aβ Levels.

The validated model was finally employed to simulate the steady-state Aβ accumulation in various physiological compartments that manifest pathological hallmarks of AD. To simulate the effects of AD on Aβ disposition, several parameters were adjusted simultaneously based on the comprehensive analysis of the literature and PK data generated in our lab (Table 3). The production rate was unchanged to determine the impact of altered disposition profiles on Aβ accumulation, rather than the production. As shown in Figure 8A, steady-state levels of both isoforms were predicted to increase in the BBB endothelium with AD. However, the fold change of Aβ40 (3-fold) was greater than that of Aβ42 (2-fold), which is in agreement with the notion of Aβ40 being more vasculotropic than Aβ42. In plasma and the brain ECF compartment, a decrease in Aβ42/40 ratio was predicted with AD, which is consistent with the literature reports.3,4 Overall, the model successfully recapitulated the reported changes in Aβ accumulation patterns in plasma and brain compartments with AD progression. More importantly, it provided insight into the BBB accumulation of Aβ40 and Aβ42, which is difficult to assess in preclinical and clinical studies using conventional methods.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we established a semimechanistic population PK model using dynamic imaging techniques to investigate the trafficking and accumulation kinetics of Aβ40 and Aβ42 at the BBB endothelium. These results highlighted the importance of BBB trafficking in regulating plasma and brain Aβ42/40 ratios, which are disrupted in AD. More importantly, the model has enabled us to predict BBB endothelial accumulation of Aβ peptides and allowed us to hypothesize the underlying mechanisms and design targeted experiments to test the hypothesis. Since BBB dysfunction caused by Aβ exposure is widely believed to trigger vascular pathologies, which exacerbate AD progression and severity, the current model will allow us to predict Aβ accumulation in the BBB endothelium during AD progression. This will further aid in establishing causal connections between endothelial exposure to Aβ peptides and BBB dysfunction.

Figure 1. Schematic of the pharmacokinetic model describing Aβ disposition in mice. The central compartment consists of the plasma and highly perfused tissues where the distribution of Aβ is expected to be instantaneous. The peripheral compartment consists of tissues where the distribution is slower. Vmax and Km are the maximal rate and Michaelis–Menten constant of Aβ receptor-mediated endocytosis by BBB endothelium on the luminal side; K10, K12, K21, K31, K41, K43, K34, and K45 are the first-order rate constants between the respective compartments. The parameters were estimated stepwise. Step 1: plasma PK parameters were predicted by fitting a two-compartment model to plasma concentration–time data. Step 2: plasma PK parameters were fixed and the full model was fitted to the brain radioactivity–time data following intracerebral injection of 125I-Aβ and 68Ga-DOTA tracers to predict efflux transport parameters. Step 3: influx transport was determined by fitting the same model to brain radioactivity–time data where 125I-Aβ tracers were administered intravenously.
