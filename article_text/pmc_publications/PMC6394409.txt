Background:

Mechanisms underlying the association between age-related arterial stiffening and poor brain health remain elusive. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) homeostasis may be implicated. This study evaluates how aortic stiffening relates to resting CBF and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in older adults.

Methods:

Vanderbilt Memory &amp; Aging Project participants free of clinical dementia, stroke, and heart failure were studied, including older adults with normal cognition (n=155; age, 72±7 years; 59% male) or mild cognitive impairment (n=115; age, 73±7 years; 57% male). Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV; meters per second) was quantified from cardiac magnetic resonance. Resting CBF (milliliters per 100 g per minute) and CVR (CBF response to hypercapnic normoxia stimulus) were quantified from pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging. Linear regression models related aortic PWV to regional CBF, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (diabetes mellitus, smoking, left ventricular hypertrophy, prevalent cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation), hypertension, body mass index, apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) status, and regional tissue volume. Models were repeated testing PWVxAPOE ε4 interactions. Sensitivity analyses excluded participants with prevalent cardiovascular disease and atrial fibrillation.

Results:

Among participants with normal cognition, higher aortic PWV related to lower frontal lobe CBF (β=−0.43, P=0.04) and higher CVR in the whole brain (β=0.11, P=0.02), frontal lobes (β=0.12, P&lt;0.05), temporal lobes (β=0.11, P=0.02), and occipital lobes (β=0.14, P=0.01). Among APOE ε4 carriers with normal cognition, findings were more pronounced with higher PWV relating to lower whole-brain CBF (β=−1.16, P=0.047), lower temporal lobe CBF (β=−1.81, P=0.004), and higher temporal lobe CVR (β=0.26, P=0.08), although the last result did not meet the a priori significance threshold. Results were similar in sensitivity models. Among participants with mild cognitive impairment, higher aortic PWV related to lower CBF in the occipital lobe (β=−0.70, P=0.02), but this finding was attenuated when participants with prevalent cardiovascular disease and atrial fibrillation were excluded. Among APOE ε4 carriers with mild cognitive impairment, findings were more pronounced with higher PWV relating to lower temporal lobe CBF (β=−1.20, P=0.02).

Conclusions:

Greater aortic stiffening relates to lower regional CBF and higher CVR in cognitively normal older adults, especially among individuals with increased genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease. Central arterial stiffening may contribute to reductions in regional CBF despite preserved cerebrovascular reserve capacity.

1. Introduction

Arterial stiffness intensifies with age,1 and its estimates such as pulse wave velocity (PWV) are associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD)2 and accelerated brain aging, including cognitive impairment and small vessel disease.3 An elastic aorta is critical for distributing blood and buffering pulsatile flow.4 Age-related reductions in aortic wall compliance can contribute to increased transmission of harmful pulsatile energy into the microcirculation, increased microvascular remodeling, and impaired oxygen delivery to tissue.4 Highly perfused organs like the brain may be particularly susceptible. In response to excessive pulsatility, larger cerebral arteries and smaller arterioles coordinate to limit penetration of pulsatile flow into the capillaries.4 The consequence of increased aortic stiffening would thus be reduced cerebral perfusion with or without associated changes in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), defined as the ability of microvessels to increase blood flow in response to elevated demand.

Prior research relating arterial stiffness to cerebral hemodynamics has relied mostly on measures of velocity rather than cerebral blood flow (CBF; rate of blood delivery to tissue)5 and middle-aged adults.6 More limited research has attempted to understand aortic stiffening in the context of its influence on regional CBF patterns or CVR in older adults. Using the gold standard measurement of central arterial stiffening by directly measuring thoracic aortic PWV in the aortic arch on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR),7 we related aortic stiffening to resting CBF and CBF in response to a hypercapnic challenge (CVR) in older adults free of clinical dementia or stroke. Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE ε4) is a well-known Alzheimer’s disease genetic susceptibility marker, but it also appears to be a molecular mediator of vascular damage;8–10 it compromises vascular function,11 and it enhances adverse effects of clinical systemic vascular disease on brain health.12 Given that APOE ε4 mediates risk for cross-sectional13 and longitudinal CBF changes during aging,14 aortic stiffening may exert stronger effects and promote compromised cerebral hemodynamics in APOE ε4 carriers. Therefore, we also examined the interaction of aortic PWV and APOE ε4 on CBF and CVR measurements.

2. Methods

2.1 Cohort Selection

The Vanderbilt Memory &amp; Aging Project15 (VMAP) is a longitudinal study investigating vascular health and brain aging. Inclusion required participants be ≥60 years of age, to speak English, to have adequate auditory and visual acuity, and to have a reliable study partner. At eligibility, participants underwent a medical history and record review, clinical interview (including functional questionnaire and Clinical Dementia Rating16 with the informant), and a neuropsychological assessment for cognitive diagnosis by consensus, including normal cognition (NC) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on the National Institute on Aging/Alzheimer’s Association Workgroup clinical criteria.17 Specifically, MCI was defined as (1) a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0 or 0.5 (reflecting mild severity of impairment); (2) relatively spared activities of daily living; (3) objective neuropsychological impairment; (4) concern of a cognitive change by the participant, informant, or clinician based on information obtained during the clinical interview; and (5) absence of a dementing syndrome. Participants were excluded for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contraindication, history of neurological disease (e.g., stroke), heart failure, major psychiatric illness, head injury with loss of consciousness &gt;5 minutes, and systemic or terminal illness that could affect follow-up participation. At enrollment participants completed a comprehensive evaluation, including fasting blood draw, physical examination, clinical interview with medication review, echocardiogram, CMR, and brain MRI. Participants were excluded here for missing CMR, brain MRI, or covariate data (Figure 1).

The Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved the protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before data collection. Because of participant consent restrictions in data sharing, a subset of data is available to others for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating procedures. These data, analytical methods, and study materials can be obtained by contacting the corresponding author.

2.2 CMR Imaging

CMR imaging was acquired at Vanderbilt University Medical Center with a 1.5T Siemens Avanto system (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc, Malvern, PA) with a phased-array torso receiver coil. Velocity-encoded flow data were acquired from the ascending and descending thoracic aorta. Under the supervision of a board-certified radiologist (J.J.C.), trained raters blinded to clinical information (J.G.T., S.N.) used the 2-dimensional flow sequence to draw contours on the ascending and descending aorta using the QFLOW 5.6 Enterprise Solution (Medis, Leiden, the Netherlands). The thoracic aorta centerline length (centimeters) from the ascending aorta to the descending aorta was measured with the OsiriX (PIXMEO SARL, Bernex, Switzerland). Transit time was calculated with a custom MATLAB script to calculate the difference in time (milliseconds) at half maximum between the leading edges of the ascending and descending aortic flow curves. PWV (meters per second) was calculated as distance traveled across the aorta (meters) divided by time delay in onset of velocity waves (seconds). Interreader reliability (coefficient of variation, 6.6%) was determined by independent review of 34 scans by 2 readers (J.G.T., S.N.). Pulsatile wave transmission increases with decreasing arterial wall elasticity, such that a higher PWV indicates higher arterial stiffness.

2.3 Brain MRI

Participants were scanned at the Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science on a 3T Philips Achieva system (Best, the Netherlands) using 8-channel phased-array sensitivity encoding reception. T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (isotropic spatial resolution, 1mm3) images were post-processed with an established Multi-Atlas Segmentation pipeline18,19 with parcellation of 5 regions of interest, including whole brain and frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.

Pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (label duration, 1.65 seconds; post-labeling delay, 1.525 seconds; spatial resolution, 3×3×7 mm3; repetition time/echo time, 3900/13 milliseconds) assessed CBF (milliliters of blood per 100 g tissue per minute) using a reproducible protocol.20,21 Data were corrected for motion and baseline drift with the Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library’s Linear Image Registration Tool.22 Additional post-processing was completed with MATLAB. Images were slice-time-corrected, normalized by the equilibrium magnetization (M0), which was calculated from a separately acquired image with identical geometry but repetition time of 20 seconds, and converted to absolute CBF units following recommended guidelines.23 This image was co-registered to the anatomic T1-weighted map and standard Montreal Neurological Institute template.24 Transformation matrices were applied to CBF maps. Region-specific mean resting CBF was calculated in gray matter regions of interest described above.

To evaluate CVR, the pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling acquisition was repeated with identical parameters during a hypercapnic stimulus. A custom non-rebreathing facemask delivered 5% CO2 and 95% medical-grade room air (hypercapnic normoxia) from compressed cylinders at a rate of 12 L/min. End-tidal CO2 and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded. The first 4 scan volumes during the challenge were removed from calculations to allow CBF to plateau. CVR was calculated as percentage change in CBF (from resting CBF as a result of induced hypercapnia) normalized by the end-tidal CO2 change (millimeters of mercury). Region-specific mean CVR values were calculated for the 5 gray matter regions of interest described above.

2.4 Covariate Definitions

Body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Systolic blood pressure was the mean of 2 measurements. Diastolic blood pressure was the mean of 2 measurements. Hypertension was defined as antihypertensive medication use, systolic blood pressure ≥140mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥90mmHg. Diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1C ≥6.5%, or oral hypoglycemic or insulin medication use. Medication review determined antihypertensive medication use. Left ventricular hypertrophy was defined on echocardiogram as left ventricular mass index &gt;115 g/m2 in men or &gt;95 g/m2 in women. Self-report or history of atrial fibrillation was corroborated by any one of the following sources: echocardiogram, CMR, documented prior procedure/ablation for atrial fibrillation, or medication use for atrial fibrillation. Current cigarette smoking (yes/no within the year before baseline) was ascertained by self-report. Self-report prevalent CVD with medical record documentation included coronary heart disease, angina, or myocardial infarction (heart failure was a parent study exclusion). Framingham Stroke Risk Profile assigned points by sex for age, systolic blood pressure (accounting for antihypertensive medication use), diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, left ventricular hypertrophy, CVD, and atrial fibrillation.25 APOE genotyping was performed on whole blood. APOE ε4 status was defined as positive (ε2/ε4, ε3/ε4, ε4/ε4) or negative (ε2/ε2, ε2/ε3, ε3/ε3).

2.5 Analytical Plan

Before analyses, scatterplots with linear fit and locally weighted smoothing fit were visually inspected for linearity, and outliers were excluded (defined as ≥4 SDs from the sample mean). Linear regressions with ordinary least square estimates stratified by cognitive diagnosis related aortic PWV to resting CBF and CVR for whole brain and frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Models were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, education, hypertension, modified Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score (excluding points assigned for age and systolic blood pressure accounting for antihypertensive medication use), body mass index, APOE ε4, and corresponding gray matter region of interest to account for CBF reductions resulting from tissue volume loss26 (e.g., gray matter in the temporal lobe was a covariate for temporal lobe CBF). Covariates were selected a priori for their potential to confound the analytical models. To assess whether CVD or atrial fibrillation accounted for any significant results, models were repeated in sensitivity analyses excluding participants with these conditions. To test hypotheses related to APOE ε4 status, models were repeated with a PWVxAPOE ε4 interaction with follow-up models stratified by APOE ε4 status. In post-hoc analyses, significant models were re-analyzed to assess allele dosage effects in which APOE ε4 was coded with an additive coding scheme (0, 1, or 2 ε4 alleles). In post-hoc analyses, the effect of hypertension was examined by relating a PWVxhypertension interaction to CBF and CVR outcomes and stratifying primary models by hypertension status (yes, no). Significance was set a priori at P&lt;0.05. Analyses were conducted with R 3.2.3 (www.r-project.org).

3. Results

3.1 Characteristics

The sample included 155 participants with NC and 115 with MCI. Participants did not differ on covariates or global cognitive status (as assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) compared with those individuals missing data who were excluded from analyses (n=65). The mean sample age was 73±7 years (range, 60–92 years); 58% were men; and 86% self-identified as non-Hispanic White. Aortic PWV ranged from 3.5–25.5 m/sec. Total sample and diagnostic group characteristics are presented in Table 1. To illustrate the pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling method, maps for the NC group are presented for mean CBF (Figure 2A) and CVR (Figure 2B) by the lowest and highest quartile of PWV.

3.2. Aortic PWV and CBF in Participants With NC

Among participants with NC, aortic PWV related to frontal lobe CBF (β=−0.43, P=0.04; Figure 3A). Aortic PWV also related to CBF in the whole brain (β=−0.34, P=0.07) and temporal lobe (β=−0.36, P=0.08), but these associations did not meet a priori significance (Table 2). When participants with atrial fibrillation and CVD were excluded, results were similar. The PWVxAPOE ε4 interaction term related to CBF in the whole brain (β=−1.16, P=0.047) and temporal lobe (β=−1.81, P=0.004), such that associations between higher PWV and lower CBF were more pronounced among APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers (Figure 4A). The PWVxAPOE ε4 interaction term also related to resting frontal lobe CBF, but this association did not meet a priori significance (P=0.08; Table 3). In post-hoc analyses examining APOE ε4 allele dosage effects, APOE ε4 allele count did not improve model fit, likely because small cell sizes limited power. However, visual inspection of the data suggests an additive effect whereby homozygous carriers of the APOE ε4 allele may have lower CBF in the temporal lobe at higher PWV values than heterozygous APOE ε4 carriers (Supplemental Figure 1). When participants with atrial fibrillation and CVD were excluded, results were similar. In post-hoc analyses examining the interaction of PWVxhypertension on CBF outcomes, results were null (P≥0.57).

3.3. Aortic PWV and CBF in Participants With MCI

Among participants with MCI, aortic PWV related to occipital lobe CBF (β=−0.70, P=0.02), but results were attenuated in a sensitivity analysis excluding participants with atrial fibrillation and CVD (β=−0.54, P=0.15). Aortic PWV was unrelated to CBF in all remaining regions (P&gt;0.33; Table 2). The PWVxAPOE ε4 interaction term related to temporal lobe CBF (β=−1.20, P=0.02), such that associations between higher PWV and lower CBF were more pronounced among APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers. The PWVxAPOE ε4 interaction term was unrelated to CBF in all remaining regions assessed (P&gt;0.47; Table 3). When participants with atrial fibrillation and CVD were excluded, results were similar. In post-hoc analyses examining PWVxhypertension on CBF outcomes, results were null (P≥0.44).

3.4. Aortic PWV and CVR in Participants With NC

Among participants with NC, higher aortic PWV related to higher CVR in the whole brain (β=0.12, P=0.02; Figure 3B), frontal lobes (β=0.12, P=0.048; Figure 3C), temporal lobes (β=0.11, P=0.02; Figure 3D), and occipital lobes (β=0.14, P=0.01; Figure 3E). Higher aortic PWV corresponded to higher parietal lobe CVR (β=0.10, P=0.08), but results did not meet a priori significance. When participants with atrial fibrillation and CVD were excluded, results were similar.

Among participants with NC, the PWVxAPOE ε4 interaction term related to CVR in the temporal lobes (β=0.26, P=0.08; Figure 4B), but results did not meet a priori significance. Aortic PWV was unrelated to CVR in all remaining regions (P&gt;0.24; Table 3). In post-hoc analyses examining APOE ε4 allele dosage effects, the additive coding did not improve model fit, presumably because of limited power. However, visual inspection of the data suggests that homozygous carriers of the APOE ε4 allele may have greater CVR in the temporal lobe at higher PWV values than APOE ε4 heterozygotes (Supplemental Figure 2). In post-hoc analyses examining PWVxhypertension in relation to CVR outcomes, results suggest that hypertension modifies the association between PWV and CVR across the whole brain (β=−0.22, P=0.04), especially the frontal (β=−0.28, P=0.04) and parietal lobes (β=−0.24, P=0.06). Stratified results by hypertension status suggest that higher aortic stiffening is associated with higher reactivity throughout the entire brain (β=0.31, P=0.004), including the frontal (β=0.36, P=0.002) and parietal lobes (β=0.33, P=0.02) among the non-hypertensive participants only.

3.5 Aortic PWV and CVR in Participants With MCI

Among participants with MCI, aortic PWV was unrelated to CVR in all regions (P&gt;0.45). The PWVxAPOE ε4 interaction term was unrelated to CVR in all regions (P&gt;0.54). In post-hoc analyses examining the interaction of PWVxhypertension on CVR outcomes, results were null (P≥0.32).

3.6 Power Calculation

Post hoc power calculations for the PWV main models and PWVxAPOE ε4 interaction models by diagnostic group were conducted on the basis of change in R2 using an F distribution. On the basis of R2 ranging from 0.10 to 0.25 (selected after a review of the total R2 across all model results) and given the available sample sizes, the minimum detectable variance (change in R2) explained by PWV in addition to covariates was calculated with 80% power and a type I error of 0.05. The minimum detectable variance explained by PWVxAPOE ε4 interaction was calculated with the same approach. Although some of the models were sufficiently powered, increased R2 values for PWV and interaction terms in the models were consistently below threshold, suggesting that our study was possibly underpowered to detect some effects.

4. Discussion

Among community-dwelling older adults, greater aortic stiffness related to lower CBF and higher CVR globally. We observed an interaction between aortic stiffness and APOE ε4, such that greater stiffness was associated with a more pronounced reduction of CBF and more pronounced increase of CVR in the temporal lobes among APOE ε4 carriers. In addition, we observed an interaction between aortic stiffness and hypertension such that greater stiffness was associated with greater global CVR among participants without hypertension. Associations were present only in the participants with NC and determined with gold standard measurements of aortic stiffness and cerebral hemodynamics. Results could not be statistically explained by prevalent CVD, atrial fibrillation, or cerebral atrophy.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first to link higher aortic stiffness measured centrally in the thoracic aorta to lower CBF and higher CVR in older adults. Elevated aortic stiffness may affect brain health by reducing the efficacy of wave reflectivity,27 thus increasing the transmission of harmful pressure pulsatility into the microcirculation. Microcirculatory remodeling occurring in response to higher pulsatile energy may lead to increased resistance and lower CBF globally, as reported here (see Figure 5 for a theoretical model). These changes in CBF appear to persist despite largely preserved CVR and associated vasodilatory capacity, as seen here. Because arterial damage accumulates over time (e.g., with hypertension), CVR responses may adjust in a manner that parallels long-term changes in endothelial or smooth muscle integrity, resulting in unique CVR responses in increasingly damaged tissues. Ongoing follow-up of this cohort will allow us to test such longitudinal hypotheses in the future.

It is noteworthy that the global reactivity patterns we observed were specific to participants with NC, particularly those individuals without hypertension. This subset of participants continues to appropriately respond to changes in partial pressure of arterial CO2 over the range evaluated here, suggesting compliant cerebrovasculature with arterioles that remain capable of adjusting cerebral blood volume in response to demand. Older adults with NC who are free of hypertension may have better quality cerebrovascular integrity as a result of less long-term exposure of elevated pressures over their lifetime compared with older adults with hypertension who presumably have more long-term damage and compromised vasoreactivity.28,29 It is noteworthy that cell sizes for the subset of participants without hypertension are small, so stratified models may be underpowered. In addition to replication, future research is needed to examine the long-term effects of hypertensive risk factor exposure and its magnitude on the association between peripheral and central vascular health.

We provide preliminary evidence of a dominant interaction between PWV and APOE ε4 on temporal lobe hemodynamics coupled with more modest evidence of an additive effect of ε4 allele count because models examining additive effects were underpowered with small cell sizes. APOE ε4 carriers may be more susceptible to cerebrovascular injury via elevated aortic PWV. In particular, APOE ε4 has been shown to contribute to blood-brain barrier dysfunction11 and cerebrovascular damage before neuronal dysfunction.10,30 Furthermore, APOE ε4 carrier status strengthens vascular disease associations with brain health outcomes,12,31–33 and APOE ε4 carriers have more pronounced reductions in CBF and CVR.30 Among individuals with NC, arterial stiffening may exert stronger effects in APOE ε4 carriers and contribute to hypoperfusion in the face of preserved CVR. Interestingly, the interaction between aortic stiffness and APOE ε4 on CBF and CVR among participants with NC was regionally specific to the temporal lobes, where Alzheimer’s disease pathology first evolves.34

We observed null results between central arterial stiffening and cerebral hemodynamics in MCI. Individuals with MCI, who are at high risk for converting to clinical dementia,35 have alterations in CBF36 and may experience a narrowing of dynamic range and a failing cerebrovascular reserve capacity.37 Such alterations in cerebral hemodynamics are presumably the result of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular changes underlying the clinical presentation in MCI, which most commonly includes a combination of Alzheimer’s disease and cerebral small vessel disease.38 Key features of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis, including amyloid39,40 and upregulated transcription factors driving hypercontractility,41 disrupt vasoreactivity. Comparable vasoreactivity disturbances are associated with cerebral small vessel disease.42–44 The combination of Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular pathology underlying the MCI presentation, coupled with repeated exposure to higher pulsatility, may compromise arteriole health over time, eventually impairing blood flow regulation, accounting for the null results seen here. A similar explanation might apply to the aforementioned null findings among participants with hypertension. That is, arteriole damage resulting from long-term exposure to elevated blood pressure,28 taken together with ongoing exposure to higher pulsatility due to aortic stiffness, might result in severely compromised vasoreactivity, accounting for the null results seen among these participants. Collectively, cerebrovascular vulnerability to central pressure changes may be especially pertinent in the presence of conditions in which autoregulation may be compromised, including chronic risk factors such as hypertension45,46 or pathological conditions such as cerebral small vessel disease47 and Alzheimer’s disease.40 Further inquiry to better understand our null results is warranted.

Our study has several strengths, including gold standard methods for non-invasively assessing central arterial stiffening and regional CBF at rest and in response to a challenge, stringent quality control procedures, and the use of a core laboratory for processing CMR and brain MRI measurements with blinded raters. Although analyses were cross-sectional, which cannot speak to causality, the inclusion of older adults with NC and MCI allows us to speculate about the timing of associations between aortic stiffening and CBF and CVR across the cognitive spectrum. Our sample included predominantly White, well-educated, relatively healthy elders. Although generalizability to other races, ethnicities, ages, and medical conditions is unknown, we speculate that associations reported here would likely be stronger in a cohort with worse cardiovascular health. Multiple comparisons raise the possibility of a false positive finding and emphasize the need for replication. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual confounding.

In summary, among older adults free of clinical dementia, stroke, and heart failure, greater stiffening of the arch of the thoracic aorta was associated with worse cerebral hemodynamics statistically independent of concurrent cardiovascular risk factors, CVD, and atrial fibrillation. Data support a possible mechanism for central nervous system injury secondary to increased arterial stiffening with age.

Missing data categories are mutually exclusive. Missing arterial spin labeling (ASL) challenge data include participants unable to wear the non-rebreathing mask (determined by out-of-range end-tidal CO2 values between challenge and rest, &lt;3 and &gt;10 mmHg). CBF indicates cerebral blood flow; CMR, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; CVR, cerebrovascular reactivity; and MRI, magnetic resonance imaging. *Sensitivity analyses excluding cardiovascular disease (CVD) or atrial fibrillation removed 12 participants with normal cognition (NC) and 9 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). †Sensitivity analyses excluding CVD or atrial fibrillation removed 10 participants with NC and 7 participants with MCI.

Figure 2. Mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CBF change maps for participants with normal cognition.

CBF images were created using the unadjusted group mean image of VMAP participants with normal cognition who underwent CBF analyses (n=154) in the lowest or highest pulse wave velocity (PWV) quartile (A). CBF change images reflect change in CBF in response to hypercapnia and were created using the unadjusted group mean image of the VMAP participants with normal cognition who underwent cerebrovascular reactivity analyses (n=113) in the lowest or highest PWV quartile (B).

Figure 5. Theoretical model of cerebral damage induced by aortic stiffening.

(A) A healthy aortic wall is compliant, and vascular segments gradually stiffen toward the periphery. Mismatch in vascular wall properties and gradual arterial branching creates beneficial wave reflection sites that reduce forward pulsatile transmission and reflect backward waves for cardiac reperfusion. (B) A compliant aorta mediates continuous blood flow throughout the cardiac cycle and dampens pulsatility. (C) Blood flow from the heart into the brain is further regulated by microvascular vasodilation and vasoconstriction. These mechanisms can ensure adequate delivery of energy substrate to tissue and serve to dampen pulsatile energy. (D) With advancing age, the aorta thickens and stiffens, reducing impedance mismatch, increasing transmission of damaging pulsatility into end organs, and contributing to early retrograde waves that augment systolic pressure and reduce diastolic flow over time. (E) These changes may contribute to reduced perfusion in high-flow vulnerable organs and possibly more turbulent flow throughout the system. (F) The effects of aortic stiffening on cerebrovascular structure and function are less well studied. Existing evidence suggests that aortic stiffening contributes to altered vascular resistance, corresponding cerebral perfusion pressure, and compromises in blood-brain barrier integrity, potentially contributing to reduced brain perfusion.

Clinical Perspective

What is new?

Greater thoracic aortic stiffening quantified from cardiac magnetic resonance is associated with lower cerebral blood flow in cognitively normal older adults free of clinical stroke, dementia, and heart failure.

Aortic stiffening may be associated with cerebral hypoperfusion (reflected by reduced resting cerebral blood flow) in the presence of preserved reactivity and associated vasodilatory capacity (reflected by cerebrovascular reactivity), particularly among participants without hypertension.

Apolipoprotein E ε4, a well-known genetic susceptibility risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, appears to modify results with regionally specific and stronger cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity effects among Apolipoprotein E ε4 carriers in the temporal lobes where Alzheimer’s disease pathology first evolves.

What are the clinical implications?

These findings add to a growing and insightful body of research highlighting the interrelation of cardiovascular function and brain health among aging adults.

Understanding the association between higher aortic stiffness and compromised brain health, including cerebral hemodynamics, may allow for earlier detection and targeted interventions to prevent or mitigate the onset of more serious cerebrovascular damage associated with higher aortic stiffening.
