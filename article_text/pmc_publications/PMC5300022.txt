Background

Deficits in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) may be more prominent in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) than in non-fluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) or semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). It is uncertain if FTD subgroups exhibit different patterns and/or predictors of functional impairment.

Methods

We examined data from participants diagnosed with bvFTD (n=607), svPPA (n=132), and nfvPPA (n=155) who were included in the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Dataset (UDS) and assessed with the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses were performed to identify associations between FAQ scores and cognitive/behavioral deficits using the NACC UDS neuropsychological testing battery and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire.

Results

FAQ scores were higher in bvFTD than svPPA or nfvPPA. Functional deficits across FTD subtypes differed in severity, but not pattern, and were driven by executive dysfunction and behavioral symptoms.

Conclusion

Executive dysfunction and behavioral symptoms underlie IADL deficits in FTD, which are most prominent in bvFTD.

INTRODUCTION

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes are a common cause of young-onset dementia in individuals under 65 years of age [1]. FTD encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of neurodegenerative syndromes that produce early declines in social behavior, executive functioning, and/or language. Clinically, FTD has been classified into three subtypes: 1) behavioral variant (bvFTD), which is characterized by personality changes such as behavioral disinhibition, apathy, repetitive behaviors, and loss of sympathy/empathy; 2) semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), which is characterized by loss of semantic knowledge with intact speech fluency; and 3) non-fluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), which is characterized by agrammatism and expressive aphasia [1].

Despite the significant functional deficits seen in such patients, which have been associated with higher levels of caregiver distress [2], the literature examining activities of daily living (ADLs) in FTD patients is relatively sparse and limited by smaller sample sizes [3]. Most of the prior work has focused on bvFTD, which in some [4,5] but not all [6–9] studies produces more profound functional deficits than Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A subset of reports have also included svPPA and/or nfvPPA [4,5,7,10–12] and generally concluded that ADL performance, particularly for basic ADLs, is also poorer in bvFTD than in these other clinical FTD subtypes. However, due to the relatively smaller sizes of FTD cohorts at individual research centers, it remains uncertain whether these clinical FTD subtypes differ in their patterns of functional impairment as well as in their overall severity [4,7].

It is also uncertain whether the cognitive and behavioral predictors of poorer ADLs across clinical FTD subtypes are similar to those seen across a broader range of elderly cohorts, both with and without cognitive impairment. Both executive function [13–15] and memory [16,17] correlate with informant-based reports of functional performance in such groups. In FTD, cognitive measures, particularly of frontal/executive function, correlate with performance-based, but not informant-based, functional measures [4,18,19]. When behavioral associations with instrumental ADLs have been examined, aberrant motor activity and hallucinations are most strongly associated with functional decline in AD [20,21], while apathy is the strongest predictor of functional decline in bvFTD and svPPA [11].

We examined the large cohort of participants with FTD included in the multicenter Uniform Data Set (UDS) maintained by the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) to determine the relative severity of instrumental ADL deficits, the pattern of specific instrumental ADL deficits, and the cognitive and behavioral correlates of such deficits among the clinical subtypes of FTD. We hypothesized that analyses of instrumental ADLs as measured by the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) [22] would confirm prior work suggesting more severe global ADL deficits in bvFTD relative to svPPA and nfvPPA [4,5,7,11]. Additionally, given the broad differences in cognitive and behavioral deficits between FTD subgroups [1], we expected to find different patterns of deficits in specific FAQ categories and different cognitive and behavioral predictors for instrumental ADL deficits across these subgroups.

METHODS

Research participants

The NACC UDS includes data from 34 past and present Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs) supported by the National Institute on Aging [23,24]. We identified 894 participants with primary clinical diagnoses of FTD and complete assessments with the FAQ (i.e. no missing values) whose data were entered into the UDS from 2005 through the December 2015 data freeze. Participants were classified as bvFTD (n=607), svPPA (n=132) and nfvPPA (n=155) using Neary [25] and Mesulam [26,27] criteria. UDS participants diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia that did not meet criteria for svPPA or nfvPPA (i.e. logopenic progressive aphasia), corticobasal syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, or mixed presentations of FTD were not included in our analyses. Written informed consent, approved by the institutional review board of each ADC, was obtained from each participant and/or their authorized representative.

Functional assessment

The FAQ is administered to informants, who rate each participant’s performance over the preceding 4 weeks across 10 separate instrumental ADL categories: 1) writing checks, paying bills, keeping financial records; 2) assembling tax or business records; 3) shopping alone; 4) playing a game of skill; 5) making coffee or tea; 6) preparing a balanced meal; 7) keeping track of current events; 8) attending to and understanding a television program, book, or magazine; 9) remembering appointments, family occasions, medications; and 10) traveling out of the neighborhood [22]. Each category is rated on a scale between 0 and 3; higher scores denote increasing impairment. Overall FAQ performance was evaluated using total FAQ scores.

Cognitive and behavioral assessments

The UDS includes a standardized neuropsychological battery comprised of: Trail-Making Test Parts A and B [28], the Logical Memory IA and IIA subtests from the revised Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-R) [29], categorical verbal fluency (animals and vegetables) [30], the forward and reverse Digit Span subtests from the WMS-R [29], the Digit Symbol subtest from the revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-R) [31], and the odd-numbered items from Boston Naming Test [32]. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) [33] is an informant-rated scale that assesses the severity (but not frequency) of 12 categories of behavioral symptoms [1) delusions, 2) hallucinations, 3) agitation, 4) depression, 5) anxiety, 6) elation, 7) apathy, 8) disinhibition, 9) irritability, 10) aberrant motor behavior, 11) nighttime behaviors, and 12) appetitive behaviors] on a scale from 0 to 3; higher scores indicate greater severity. Overall behavioral impairment was evaluated using total NPI-Q scores across all categories.

Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 23 for Mac (IBM, Armonk, NY). Demographic variables were compared between FTD subtypes using analysis of variance (ANOVA; continuous variables) and Kruskal-Wallis tests (categorical variables). Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) adjusted for demographic factors were used to compare FAQ indices between FTD subgroups. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were used to determine the relative contributions of cognitive and behavioral symptomatology to functional deficits measured with the FAQ. Z-scores for separate cognitive domains identified in a prior factor analysis of the NACC UDS neuropsychological battery [34] were calculated within each group for regression analyses. Post hoc analyses underwent Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons where appropriate.

RESULTS

Demographics

Demographic data for the FTD clinical subtypes are shown in Table 1. Significant differences were seen across subtypes in age, symptom duration, and gender distribution (all p’s &lt;0.05). Bonferroni-corrected post hoc analyses indicated that bvFTD participants were younger than svPPA (p=0.015) and nfvPPA (p&lt;0.001) participants (critical p&lt;0.017). They also had longer symptom duration at study entry (p=0.001) and were more likely to be male (p=0.003) than the nfvPPA participants. The three groups had similar levels of formal education and comparable ethnic distributions. Amongst the informants, 73.3% were spouses or partners, 15.1% were adult children, 5.0% were siblings, and 6.6% had other relationships. Informant types were similar across FTD subtypes [data not shown; χ2(6,894)=7.20, p=0.30].

FAQ analyses

Unadjusted and adjusted total FAQ scores for the FTD subtypes are shown in Figure 1A. One-way ANOVA indicated significant group differences on this measure [F(2,891)=70.34, p&lt;0.001]. Bonferroni corrected post hoc comparisons revealed that total FAQ scores were significantly higher in the bvFTD group relative to both the svPPA and nfvPPA groups (p’s&lt;0.001), and that there was a trend towards higher FAQ scores in the svPPA group relative to the nfvPPA group (p=0.031; critical p&lt;0.017). This group effect persisted after adjustment for age, education, symptom duration, gender, and ethnicity via ANCOVA [F(2,847)=13.49, p&lt;0.001]. Post hoc group comparisons of adjusted analyses showed higher total FAQ scores in bvFTD relative to both svPPA (p=0.015) and nfvPPA (p&lt;0.001), but similar scores in svPPA and nfvPPA (p=0.11; critical p&lt;0.017).

Comparison of disease severity across clinical FTD subtypes remains challenging, and symptom duration represents an imperfect proxy [35]. Figure 1B shows total FAQ scores relative to symptom duration. One-way ANOVAs revealed significant group differences across symptom duration bins (p’s&lt;0.05), but the magnitude of this effect attenuated after 6 years. Since fewer participants were in each symptom duration bin, these findings were less robust to adjustment for demographic factors (data not shown).

Prior work has suggested potential qualitative differences in the pattern of functional deficits across clinical FTD subtypes [4]. We explored this question by analyzing scores from individual FAQ items (Figure 2). Unadjusted analyses using one-way ANOVAs indicated significant group effects for all items (Figure 2A; all p’s&lt;0.001). Post hoc comparisons revealed that participants diagnosed with bvFTD had significantly higher scores on all individual FAQ items relative to those with nfvPPA (all p’s&lt;0.001) and on all items other than the attention item relative to those with svPPA (all p’s&lt;0.001). The svPPA group had significantly higher scores than the nfvPPA group on the events and attention items (p’s≤0.001). After adjusting for demographic factors and symptom duration, significant group effects remained for each individual item (Figure 2B; all p’s&lt;0.01), with scores in the bvFTD group consistently higher than those in the nfvPPA group (all p’s≤0.001). However, a more mixed picture was seen with adjusted item scores in the svPPA group, which performed similarly to the bvFTD group on some items and similarly to the nfvPPA group on others.

NPI-Q and neuropsychological indices

Total NPI-Q severity scores and individual neuropsychological test scores for the FTD subgroups are shown in Table 2. Significant group effects were seen with unadjusted analyses on the NPI-Q and all neuropsychological measures. These effects persisted after adjustment for demographic factors and symptom duration on the total NPI-Q severity score, Logical Memory IIA, forward digit span, category fluency for vegetables, and the odd-numbered items on the Boston Naming Test (p’s&lt;0.05).

Correlations between FAQ, NPI-Q and neuropsychological indices

A subset of the overall study cohort had complete data for demographic, FAQ, NPI-Q, and neuropsychological testing indices. Using multiple linear regression analyses, we investigated the association between these variables in each diagnostic group (Table 3). Demographic variables were forced into each analysis, while behavioral and cognitive variables were entered in a stepwise fashion. In all three subtypes of FTD, total FAQ scores significantly correlated with NPI-Q severity and the processing speed/executive z-score. In bvFTD and nfvPPA, total FAQ scores also significantly correlated with the memory z-score. However, the language and attention z-scores did not correlate with FAQ scores in any of the three groups.

Correlations between FAQ and specific NPI-Q symptoms

We performed additional multiple regression analyses in the larger subset of participants with complete demographic and NPI-Q data to determine which individual behavioral symptom categories were associated with functional abilities in each clinical subgroup (Table 4). Demographic variables were forced into each analysis, while individual NPI-Q items were entered in a stepwise fashion. In bvFTD, total FAQ scores were positively correlated with the severity of hallucinations, anxiety, apathy, and aberrant motor behavior; and negatively correlated with the severity of depression and elation. In svPPA, total FAQ scores were positively correlated with the severity of apathy and aberrant motor behavior. In nfvPPA, total FAQ scores were positively correlated with the severity of delusions, appetitive disturbances, and aberrant motor behavior.

DISCUSSION

Our analyses of FAQ indices in a large cohort of FTD participants included in the NACC UDS confirm earlier work from smaller samples indicating more severe functional impairment in bvFTD relative to svPPA and nfvPPA [4,5,7,11]. After adjustments for group differences in age, gender, ethnicity, education, and symptom duration, bvFTD participants had the greatest deficits in instrumental ADLs, even at earlier stages of disease progression. There were no specific differences in patterns of impairment on the FAQ between FTD subgroups in item-level analyses. However, decreased instrumental ADL performance corresponded to poorer processing speed/executive functioning and more severe behavioral symptoms, which are characteristic of bvFTD [1]. Furthermore, poorer instrumental ADLs were not associated with greater language impairment, even in the svPPA and nfvPPA subgroups.

Despite the larger sample size available through the NACC UDS, we did not identify distinct patterns of deficits on specific FAQ items between clinical FTD subtypes. These findings suggest that functional impairments that emerge in FTD involve a wide spectrum of everyday activities, and that differences between clinical subtypes are primarily quantitative, rather than qualitative in nature. Mioshi and colleagues had previously suggested different patterns of ADL impairment between FTD subtypes [4]. However, the differences reported in their study were primarily driven by group differences in basic ADLs, since all three subtypes had similar levels of impairment on instrumental ADLs.

While clinical subtypes of FTD have similar overall patterns of functional impairment, such deficits may be associated with slightly different underlying patterns of cognitive impairment. In all three FTD subtypes, higher total FAQ scores were associated with poorer performance on processing speed/executive function measures. However, poorer instrumental ADL performance was associated with memory impairment only in the bvFTD and nfvPPA groups. These results are largely consistent with earlier work from broader cohorts of both cognitively intact and impaired individuals that suggest that both executive [13–15] and memory [16,17] function contribute significantly to functional ability. While prior studies of functional impairment in bvFTD have shown that frontal/executive or global cognitive indices correlate with performance-based ADL assessments [18,19], they have largely failed to demonstrate similar associations with informant-rated ADL assessments that are more similar to the FAQ [4,18,19], possibly because of their smaller sample sizes. Somewhat surprisingly, performance on language assessments did not significantly correlate with FAQ scores in either the svPPA or the nfvPPA groups. Language function may have relatively less impact on the instrumental ADLs measured by the FAQ. Alternatively, the NACC UDS neuropsychological assessments may not be sufficiently comprehensive to fully capture the language deficits that characterize these conditions.

For all three clinical FTD subtypes, more severe overall behavioral pathology (as measured by total NPI-Q scores) was associated with poorer instrumental ADLs. While these results are concordant with prior work suggesting associations between functional impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in both AD and vascular dementia (VaD) [20,36,37], they were not seen in a prior smaller study of behavioral symptoms and functional performance in bvFTD [9]. Nevertheless, targeted analyses focusing on specific neuropsychiatric symptoms have suggested that apathy is associated with poorer ADLs in bvFTD [38], similar to prior reports from AD and VaD cohorts [20,36,37], and more pronounced longitudinal declines in instrumental ADLs in bvFTD and svPPA [11]. Likewise, we found significant correlations between apathy severity on the NPI-Q and total FAQ scores in both the bvFTD and svPPA groups, but not in the nfvPPA group. Indeed, the only NPI-Q symptom that was consistently associated with functional impairment across FTD subtypes was aberrant motor behavior, which also correlates with poorer instrumental ADLs in AD [20,21].

Overall, the neuropsychiatric predictors for total FAQ scores in our analyses were more diverse than the cognitive predictors. Different sets of NPI-Q symptoms were positively correlated with poorer functional abilities in bvFTD (hallucinations and anxiety) versus nfvPPA (delusions and appetitive/eating disorders). Conversely, the severity of depression and elation were inversely correlated with the severity of functional impairment in bvFTD. Unlike apathy and aberrant motor activity, which progressively increase with worsening bvFTD [39], depression and elation remain stable or even decrease with disease progression [39,40]. These mood symptoms may be more prominent at milder stages of bvFTD, when functional impairments are less severe.

The large cohort of FTD participants included in the NACC UDS was a key strength of this study and allowed for more detailed analyses and comparisons of instrumental ADLs in clinical subtypes of FTD than prior reports [4,5,7,11]. However, a number of factors may limit the interpretation of our results. The NACC UDS is not specifically designed for analyses of FTD, and some of the standardized assessments may fail to capture the more unique deficits seen in this spectrum of disorders. In particular, it is difficult to compare dementia severity across FTD subtypes, given their very different clinical presentations. We chose to use symptom duration as a potential surrogate; others have used the global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR [41]) for this purpose [39,40]. The standard CDR was less well suited for our analyses, given its focus on AD symptomatology and inclusion of functional decline in its scoring. Other measures such as the FTLD-modified CDR [42,43] or the Frontotemporal Dementia Rating Scale [35] appear to be more effective in staging severity across different types of dementia. Future analyses that use such instruments may provide further insight into the questions addressed in this study. Our analyses were based upon clinical diagnoses of FTD using older criteria [25–27] that have since been supplanted by newer criteria which may be more sensitive [44–46] and identify patients at earlier stages of disease that are characterized by less functional impairment. Diagnoses in this study lack neuropathological confirmation. Since a prior study of NACC participants with clinical diagnoses of bvFTD revealed that a significant proportion had AD pathology [47] and differences in clinical symptoms in FTD appear to be driven in part by differences in underlying neuropathology [10,47,48], further analyses of ADLs in FTD should incorporate clinico-pathological correlations.

Overall, our findings confirm and extend prior reports that ADLs, including instrumental ADLs, are more impaired in bvFTD than svPPA and nfvPPA. Across FTD subgroups, poorer function was most consistently associated with executive dysfunction and behavioral symptoms, but relatively independent of language deficits. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that interventions tailored at behavioral pathology across the clinical subtypes of FTD may have the potential to improve functional outcomes.
