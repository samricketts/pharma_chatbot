The objective of this study was to evaluate an association of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use with late life cognitive decline and further investigate the association with brain pathology. Using the data are from two harmonized clinical-pathologic cohort studies with annual cognitive testing we found that SSRI use was associated with significantly faster global cognitive decline and this association was present in those with and without pre-existing cognitive impairment at the time of SSRI initiation. In separate analyses of persons who died during the study and underwent neuropathologic examination, SSRI use was related to higher level of paired helical filament tau tangles and faster rate of global cognitive decline. However, when SSRI use and tangles were included in the same model, the association of SSRI use with rate of global cognitive decline was reduced by more than 50% and no longer statistically significant. SSRI use was associated with higher postmortem level of tau tangles, possibly because SSRI are being used to treat neurobehavioral symptoms associated with dementia, and this relationship appears to partly account for the association of SSRI use with more rapid cognitive decline.

pmc1. Introduction:

Over 43 million Americans take anti-depressants(International) and over 70% of them are treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)(Luo et al., 2020), with a recent increase in use by older persons(Arthur et al., 2020; Maust et al., 2017). It is concerning, therefore, that SSRI use has been associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher risk of dementia in recent longitudinal studies(Leng et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2016) though other studies have not confirmed this association(Bartels et al., 2018; Carriere et al., 2017). Why might SSRIs be associated with late life cognitive loss? Much of late life cognitive decline is driven by common age-related neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathologies(Jansen et al., 2018). It is possible that these processes lead to changes in neurotransmitter levels that are associated with changes in mood symptoms in later life, and SSRI are prescribed to mitigate these pathology-associated symptoms. Alternatively, SSRIs might modify the association of pathology with cognitive decline or have an association with cognitive decline that is independent of known pathologies. We are not aware of prior clinical-pathologic investigations of these possibilities.

The present study examines the role of common dementia related pathologies in the association of SSRIs with cognitive decline. As part of 2 harmonized clinical-pathologic cohort studies, older persons underwent annual cognitive function testing, and upon death, there was a brain autopsy and uniform neuropathological examination to assess common neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathologies. In analyses, we compared rates of cognitive decline in persons who began SSRI during follow-up to rates in those never using SSRIs. In the subset that died and underwent neuropathologic examination, we determined the association of SSRI use with postmortem pathologic markers and tested the hypothesis that these associations account in part for the association of SSRI use with cognitive decline.

2. Methods:

2.1 Participants:

Participants are from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS-MAP)(Bennett et al., 2018), two ongoing community-based, prospective cohort studies that enroll older adults without a prior dementia diagnosis who agree to annual clinical evaluations and brain donation at death. ROS started in 1994 and enrolls nuns, priests, and monks from across the United States. MAP started in 1997 and enrolls lay persons from northeastern Illinois. An institutional review board of Rush University Medical Center approved each study. All participants signed an informed consent.

At the time of these analyses, 3218 participants were eligible as they had completed the evaluations at the time of entering into the study while not meeting criteria for dementia. We excluded 263 persons who were using an SSRI at study entry. We excluded these individuals because we wanted to map the SSRI associated cognitive change from the time of SSRI initiation. At enrolment into the ROS-MAP cohorts, all the 2955 eligible participants were not on any SSRI (Figure 1). However, after about 6.6 years (SD +/− 4.78), about 500 of these participants initiated SSRI, and the rest 2455 did not ever use SSRI. So, to prevent bias in the study, we matched a non-SSRI participant for age and education for each SSRI user. At the time of enrolment into the ROS-MAP cohorts, all participants had no cognitive impairment; however, over time, some participants developed MCI or dementia, and therefore, we also matched the sample for the diagnosis of normal cognition, MCI, or dementia at the time of matching. This additional matching was done to prevent bias introduced due to cognitive status. Each SSRI user started SSRI at a different time, about 6.6 years (SD +/− 4.78), Median 5.30, IQR 6.1). After enrolment into the ROS-MAP cohorts, we matched the duration from enrolment to SSRI initiation with each non-SSRI user. We created a new analytic baseline to prevent time-related bias. Then, we followed these participants for their cognition from this analytic baseline. The follow-up time was from enrolment to the SSRI initiation, not after initiating the SSRI. Because some SSRI users did not have enough follow-up for longitudinal analyses, the matching process yielded 374 incident users and 736 never SSRI users (Table-1). The median (Q1-Q3) follow-up time from enrolment in ROS-MAP cohorts to the last clinical assessment was 10.05 (8.2) years. Medan (Q1-Q3) time from enrolment into the cohort to matching of the samples (analytic baseline) was 5.3(6.2) years. The median (Q-Q3) follow-up time from the analytic baseline to the last assessment was 3 (5.7) years. We noted that, on average, 70% of the annual visits (SD 31, median 80%, Q1-Q3 50) were on SSRI after participants started these medications. Once SSRIs were initiated, SSRI users took them for an average of 4.4 years (SD 4.3) at the time of the last clinical assessment. This data suggests that the association of SSRI with cognition is related to chronic use rather than short-term use.

Additionally, to address the selection bias, we let the SSRI users act as their control and measured their cognition before and after SSRI initiation.

2.2 Assessment of medication use:

All clinical evaluations were done as home visits. Participants brought all prescription and non-prescription drugs to each annual evaluation. Study personnel recorded all prescription and over-the-counter medications taken by the participant during the previous two weeks in a drug database.

2:3 Clinical evaluations, medications assessment, and cognition

Annual clinical evaluations were conducted in the residence of each participant (e.g., convent, monastery, single-family home, retirement community, etc.)(Bennett et al., 2018).The evaluations included a medical history, neurological examination, and cognitive testing (see below). We also collected data on the presence of vascular disease burden. A vascular disease burden measure was based on the presence of a medical history of coronary disease, stroke, and claudication, and determined at each clinical evaluation, as published elsewhere (Boyle et al., 2009). We also used a covariate of six medical conditions (hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, thyroid disease, cancer, and head injury with loss of consciousness). These conditions are based upon questions, except for stroke, which are ascertained by a clinician on the basis of the history and a comprehensive exam. We then used this medical condition variable as a covariate in the main model of global cognition along with demographics.

Additionally, we also created separate variables for lipid lowering drugs and antihypertensive medications, and ran two separate analysis adding covariates in the core model adjusted for demographics. We also created an additional variable for common medications, specifically for lipid lowering drugs and antihypertensive medications, anti-diabetic agents, and anti-platelet agents and used these variables separately in the main model along with demographics. KATZ index measured with the Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale(Katz and Akpom, 1976). The scale measures six basic physical abilities: walking across a small room, bathing, dressing, eating, getting from bed to chair, and toileting. Participants are asked to report need for help/assistance in performing the ADLs. Responses are then dichotomized into 0 = no help and 1 = requires help or unable to do. The composite measure ranges from 0 to 6 and is the sum of the number of items for which participants report the need for help/assistance, with higher scores indicating greater disability.

At each annual evaluation, a battery of 19 cognitive function tests was administered by a trained research assistant in a 60–90 minute session. The battery included seven tests of episodic memory, three tests of semantic memory, three tests of working memory, four tests of perceptual speed, and two tests of visuospatial ability. To minimize floor and ceiling artifacts and other forms of measurement error in longitudinal analyses, we used a composite measure of global cognition based on all 19 tests. Raw scores on individual tests were converted to z scores, using the baseline mean and SD of all participants in both parent cohorts, and averaged to yield the composite measure of global cognition. Further information on the individual tests and the global cognitive measure is published elsewhere [12].

2.4 Assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia:

The annual clinical evaluations included a medical history, neurological examination, and cognitive testing. The cognitive function tests were used to rate impairment in the domains of orientation, attention, memory, language, and perception as previously reported(Bennett et al., 2002). A diagnosis of MCI was made if at least one cognitive domain was impaired and there was insufficient evidence of a meaningful decline in cognitive function from a previously higher level to warrant a diagnosis of dementia. The diagnosis of dementia required a history of cognitive decline and impairment in at least 2 cognitive domains, one of which had to be memory to meet Alzheimer’s dementia criteria(McKhann et al., 1984).

2.5 Assessment of depressive symptoms:

At each evaluation, participants completed a 10-item version(Kohout et al., 1993) of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale(Radlof, 1977). Individuals were asked if they had experienced each of 10 depressive symptoms much of the time in the past week. The score was the number of symptoms experienced.

2.6 Neuropathological Examination:

Our study used the following indicators of pathology: beta-amyloid, paired-helical-filament tau filaments (PHF), Lewy body disease, vascular pathologies (gross infarcts or micro-infarcts, moderate-to-severe atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy), hippocampal sclerosis, and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Depending on the distribution of a given pathologic marker, they were treated as either a continuous/ordinal measure with higher scores indicating a greater amount of a given marker (e.g., AD pathology and TDP-43), or as a binary indicator of the pathologic marker being either present or absent(James et al., 2019; Wilson et al., 2019) (e.g., cerebral amyloid angiopathy, hippocampus sclerosis, gross/micro-infarcts, Lewy bodies, atherosclerosis, arteriolar sclerosis). All were assessed using post-mortem neuropathologic examination. Collection of these data was completed via autopsy. The brain was removed, brain stem and hemispheres separated, then fixed and/or frozen via a standard protocol(Schneider et al., 2009). One centimeter coronal cuts were done on each hemisphere, and then examined for gross cerebral infarcts. Using hematoxylin and eosin stains, evidence of micro-infarcts were investigated in at least six cortical, two subcortical, and one midbrain region of the hemisphere(Arvanitakis et al., 2011). Using beta-amyloid immunostaining across the midfrontal, inferior temporal, angular, and calcarine cortex, cerebral beta-amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was assessed. Meningeal and parenchymal vessel beta-amyloid deposition in each region was assessed using a 5-point scale (no deposition, scatter segmental but no circumferential deposition, circumferential deposition up to 10 vessels, circumferential deposition up to 75% of region, and circumferential deposition over 75% of region). In this analysis, the highest value of each regional score was used and then averaged across regions to estimate a composite cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) measure(Boyle et al., 2015). Visual inspection of the vessels of the circle of Willis was used to identify the severity of atherosclerosis, and hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections of the anterior basal ganglia were used to score arteriolar sclerosis(Arvanitakis et al., 2016). Both atherosclerosis and arteriolar sclerosis were treated as binary indicators, and graded as either moderate/severe, or absent/low if inspections suggested less severe presence.

PHF tau was labeled with an antibody specific for phosphorylated tau (AT8, Innogenetics, San Ramon, CA, 1:1000). Quantification of tangle density was accomplished with a stereological mapping station as described previously(Bennett et al., 2012). TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions were detected in six brain regions using monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylated TDP-43(Neumann et al., 2009) (p5409/410; 1:100). Inclusion density was assessed, by region, using 6-point scale; the regional ratings were then averaged, resulting in a single composite index of TDP-43 pathology(Nag et al., 2015; Nag et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2013). Hippocampal sclerosis was classified using hematoxylin and eosin stain inspection for severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the hippocampus and/or subiculum(Nag et al., 2015; Nag et al., 2017). Finally, a monoclonal antibody to alpha-synuclein across the substantia nigra, anterior cingulate cortex, entorhinal cortex, midfrontal cortex, middle temporal cortex, and inferior parietal cortex was used to identify Lewy bodies(Schneider et al., 2006).

2.7 Statistical analyses:

For statistical analyses, we selected a matched sample of incident SSRI users and never users. Briefly, for each incident user, we determined their baseline age, number of follow-ups, visit when SSRI was initiated, as well as the diagnosis at SSRI initiation. Next, we identified a pool of never users with similar age (+/− 2 years), follow-up length (+/− 2 years), and same diagnosis at the visit when the matching case initiated SSRI. Of those, we selected a matched control with the shortest Mahalanobis distance. We repeated the process until we exhausted all 500 incident users. We then performed a second round of matching which yielded an approximately 1:2 matched sample of N=1,110.

In the full analytic group, we assessed the hypothesized association of SSRI use with change in global cognition in a series of linear mixed-effects models. These models estimate the mean cognitive change per year in the never SSRI users and SSRI users and the interaction of age at baseline, sex, education, and CES-D score at baseline. To further assess whether the association of SSRI use with cognitive change varied across diagnoses, we constructed a second model that included terms for diagnosis at the time of SSRI initiation with no cognitive impairment as the reference group (i.e. MCI vs no cognitive impairment, dementia vs no cognitive impairment), the 3-way interactions of time by SSRI use by diagnosis. The 3-way interactions test whether the association of SSRI use with rate of cognitive change differs between MCI and no cognitive impairment, and separately between dementia and no cognitive impairment.

In sensitivity analysis, we ran these models with additional covariates such as vascular disease burden, KATZ-index of daily living, the sum of six medical conditions, lipid-lowering agents, anti-hypertensive agents, anti-diabetic agents, and anti-platelet agents.

Next, we assessed the effect of initiating SSRI use during the study in a series of mixed-effects models with change point anchored at initiation of SSRI use. The models allowed us to compare the rates of cognitive decline before and after initiation of SSRI use.

In the neuropathologically examined subgroup, we regressed each postmortem pathologic marker on SSRI use in separate analyses (with terms also included for age at death, sex, education, and mean CES-D score). We then constructed a series of linear mixed-effects models adjusted for age at death, sex, education, mean CES-D score and their interactions with time. A first model included terms for time, SSRI use, and their interaction. A second model included terms for 3 pathologic markers and their interactions with time. A third model included terms for SSRI use and tau tangles plus their interactions with time. We also evaluated the model including terms for the interaction of SSRI use and tau tangles. To evaluate the change in depressive symptoms before and after initiating SSRI we constructed a series of generalized linear mixed effects models(Min, 2005) with depressive symptoms (CES-D score) treated as an ordinal longitudinal variable with 6 levels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ≥5). The model included a term for time (from baseline in years) which estimates the rate of change in log odds of having higher CES-D score over time, as well as a second term for time (from SSRI initiation in years) which estimates additional change in CES-D score after SSRI initiation. In this analysis, we compared the change in the log odds of more severe CESD differences before and after SSRI initiation. To minimize potential distortion due to death, and end of life changes in mood and behavior, we restricted this analysis to alive incident users (N=120) only.

3 Results:

3.1 SSRI Use and Cognitive Decline

In this analysis table 2), the global cognitive score declined a mean of 0.130-unit per year in the no SSRI subgroup and a mean of 0.202-unit per year in the SSRI subgroup (0.130 + 0.072), which is about 55% faster than the rate in the no SSRI subgroup. In this analysis, depressive symptoms were associated to lower cognition at analytic baseline (Estimate=−0.034, SE=0.013, p=0.0080 but were not associated with rate of cognitive decline. Next, to determine whether the rate of cognitive decline associated with SSRI use was influenced by diagnosis at the onset of SSRI therapy, we conducted a second analysis with terms for diagnosis and the interactions of diagnosis with SSRI use and time (table 2). Among those without cognitive impairment, the global cognitive score declined at a mean rate of 0.093-unit per year in the no SSRI subgroup and a mean of 0.155-unit per year in the SSRI subgroup (0.093 + 0.062), which is about 67% faster than the rate in the no SSRI subgroup; the association of SSRI use with cognitive decline in those with MCI did not differ from the association in those without cognitive impairment; and SSRI use in those with dementia was associated with an additional mean decline of 0.055-unit per year.

Depressive symptoms (CES-D) in this analysis were not associated with cognition (Estimate =−0.014, SE=0.008, p=0.092) or change in cognition over time (Estimate =0.001, SE=0.003, p=0.852). In a sensitivity analysis we did not find any interaction of CESD and SSRI with cognition (CES-D x SSRI; p=0.32) or cognitive change over time (time x CES-D x SSRI; p=0.95).

3.2 Follow-up SSRI Use and Change in Cognitive Function:

In the 500 individuals who began SSRI use during follow-up, we examined global cognitive decline in a mixed-effects change point model that allowed the rate of cognitive decline to change after the initiation of SSRI use. In this analysis, the global cognitive score declined a mean of 0.085-unit per year before SSRI use (SE = 0.008, p &lt; .001). After SSRI use was initiated, the annual rate of decline accelerated to a mean of 0.191-unit per year (SE = 0.020, p &lt; .001) to 0.276-unit per year. Figure 2, which is based on this analysis, shows that initiating SSRI use during follow-up was associated with a more than 3-fold increase in the mean annual rate of global cognitive decline.

In sensitivity analysis, we ran these models with additional covariates such as vascular disease burden, KATZ-index of daily living, the sum of six medical conditions, lipid-lowering agents, anti-hypertensive agents, anti-diabetic agents, and antiplatelet agents, and there was no change in the outcome. (See Table 5).

3.3 Association of SSRI and Dementia Related Pathology

During follow-up, 254 of the SSRI subgroup and 387 of the no SSRI subgroup died and underwent neuropathologic examination. The SSRI subgroup were slightly older than no SSRI subgroup, in age at study entry (mean of 84.8 years vs 83.7 years, t[639] = 2.01, p = 0.044), and age at death (mean of 90.6 years vs 89.4 years, t[639] = 2.32, p = 0.021), but did not differ from the no SSRI subgroup on level of education (mean of 16.6 years vs 16.5 years, t[639] = 0.13, p = 0.89).

We examined the association of SSRI use with dementia related neuropathologies by regressing each postmortem marker on SSRI use (with terms also included for age at death, sex, education, and mean CES-D score). As shown in Table 3, SSRI use was significantly related to PHF tau tangles and nominally related to gross infarcts and micro-infarcts.

3.4 Association of Neuropathology with SSRI Mediated Cognitive Change

To understand the influence of neuropathology on the SSRI association with cognitive decline, we investigated global cognitive change with additional neuropathological covariates (in addition to age at death, sex, education, and mean CES-D score). The first analysis included terms for SSRI use and its interaction with time (Model A Table 4). The global cognitive score declined a mean of 0.153-unit per year in the no SSRI subgroup and a mean of 0.200-unit per year in the SSRI subgroup (0.153 + 0.047), which is about 31% faster than the rate in the no SSRI subgroup. The second analysis was conducted with PHF tau tangles as an additional covariate (Model B Table 4. In this analysis, the effect of SSRI use was reduced by more than 59% and was no longer statistically significant. In the third and final analysis all the three pathological markers (PHF tau tangles, Gross infarcts and micro-infarcts) were included as covariates (Model C Table 4) and the SSRI related cognitive decline over time did not differ much from the Model B. In this analysis, PHF tau tangles were related to more rapid rate of cognitive decline (time x tau tangles; estimate=−0.062, SE=0.006, p&lt;0.001), but gross infarcts (time x gross infarcts, estimate=−0.030, SE=0.016, p=0.062) and micro-infarcts (time x micro-infarcts; estimate=0.002, SE=0.017, p=0.902) were not. These analyses suggested that SSRI associated decline in cognition was mainly driven by PHF tau tangles. In a sensitivity analysis, there was no evidence of any interaction of SSRI use with tau on cognition (SSRI x PHF tau; p=0.251) or cognitive change (time x SSRI x PHF tau; p=0.104) suggesting that SSRI use did not modify the association of tau tangles with cognitive decline.

3.5 A Case for/against SSRI use in Older Adults:

Our data suggested that SSRI did not alter the cognition alone but it was associated with age related neurodegenerative processes. Therefore, it is possible that older adults are prescribed SSRI for behavior changes such as late life depression, anxiety, irritability, agitation, and quick temper etc. and origin of these behaviors are likely due to imbalance of neurotransmitter levels associated with underlying neurodegenerative pathology. Since, we did not observe any positive or negative association of SSRI use with cognition after controlling for PHF tau, so, next, we questioned about any therapeutic benefit of SSRI use in this sample. Therefore, we evaluated the effectiveness of SSRI by measuring changes in CES-D before and after initiating SSRI. The odds of having more depressive symptoms increased over time (Estimated rate of change in log odds: 0.071 Units, SE= 0.024 p= 0.004), however we did not observe a difference after SSRI initiation (estimate=−0.040 units SE=0.039 p=0.301). These results did not change after adjusting for age, sex and education. This analysis suggested the SSRI use in older adults was not associated with improvement in depressive symptoms, in this small sample of alive SSRI users (N=120).

4 Discussion:

As part of 2 harmonized clinical-pathologic cohort studies, older persons completed a battery of cognitive tests at enrollment and annually thereafter. Rate of cognitive decline in persons who began SSRI use during follow-up was more rapid than the rate in comparable persons not using SSRIs. Further, initiating SSRI during the study was associated with a more than 3-fold increase in the rate of cognitive decline.

In participants who died and underwent neuropathologic examination, SSRI use was associated with greater numbers of PHF tau tangles and controlling for this association substantially reduced the correlation of SSRI use with cognitive decline. These data support that neurodegenerative pathologies PHF Tau in-part explained the variance of SSRI associated cognitive decline. Additionally, in a small subset of SSRI users who remained alive during the course of the study, there was no difference in depressive symptoms before and after initiating SSRI.

Neurodegeneration starts years and even decades before death and contributes to the changes in cognitive abilities leading to dementia. In addition, these neurodegenerative pathologies contribute to late-life changes in mood and behaviors. Therefore, pathology models in this study reflect antemortem neurodegenerative changes accruing in the brain for decades before death and their contribution to progressive cognitive decline. We have previously published a study (Boyle et al., 2018) that measured neuropathological changes at death and their contribution to late-life cognitive decline.

Additionally, there is concurrent use of SSRIs in old age to treat late-life behavior changes. By leveraging our unique clinicopathological data set, in this study, we tried to untangle the issue of late-life cognitive and behavioral change, neurodegenerative pathologies, and concurrent SSRI use. The data suggests an association of tau rather than SSRI with cognitive change. Here, we only report an association with no causal interference.

Prior research on the relation of SSRI use to late life change in cognitive function has had mixed results. One large study of community-dwelling older persons(Carriere et al., 2017) found no association between baseline SSRI use and change in cognitive function during up to 10 years of observation, but only 2% of participants used SSRIs, likely limiting the power to detect an association. In another study, baseline SSRI use (present in 6.2%) was associated with more rapid cognitive decline over 5 years(Leng et al., 2018). However, the association is hard to interpret because cognition was only assessed at 2 points in time, making it difficult to disentangle the association of SSRI use with cognitive level from its association with cognitive change. In the present study, we were able to show that SSRI use is related more rapid rate of cognitive decline. We were also able to show that this association was present not only in persons with MCI and dementia at the onset of SSRI use but also in persons without these conditions, making it unlikely that the association is conditional on pre-existing cognitive impairment, although underlying neurodegenerative change can precede many years before a measurable cognitive change.

A novel feature of this study is that participants agreed upon death to undergo a brain autopsy and neuropathologic examination, allowing identification of common dementia related pathologies. We found that SSRI use was robustly related to PHF tau and marginally related to chronic cerebral infarcts. Tau tangles (but not infarcts) were related to cognitive decline. When SSRI use and tangles were included in the same model, the association of tangles with cognitive decline persisted but the association of SSRI use with cognitive decline was reduced by &gt; 50% and no longer statistically significant, supporting the hypothesis that tau tangles partly account for the association of SSRI use with cognitive decline.

There are reports of SSRI associated reduced platelet function, increased bleeding risk but reduced thrombosis risk (Grech et al., 2022) and ischemic stroke(Alqdwah-Fattouh et al., 2022). Contrary to these reports, in our study, SSRI use was associated with increased risk of gross and microscopic infarcts, however, these pathologies did not contribute to SSRI associated cognitive changes.

In a previous study of depressive symptoms and neuropathology and cognitive decline (Wilson et al., 2014), depression, and neurodegenerative changes were both associated with cognitive decline; however, depressive symptoms only had a limited contribution to cognitive changes. Additionally, depressive symptoms did not modify any association of neuropathology with cognitive decline. These results agree with our observation; as a neurobehavioral symptom in late life, depressed mood could originate from a neurodegenerative process. Indeed neurofibrillary tangles have been reported in raphe nucleus(Simic et al., 2017) with lower levels of serotonin in AD brains(Gottfries et al., 1986) and could be associated with late life change in mood. Alterations of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and acetylcholine due to neurodegenerative processes are probably one factor leading to behavioral and cognitive symptoms. Physicians often prescribe SSRIs for behavioral symptoms associated with old age, which may be prodromal signs of incipient dementia due to an underlying neurodegenerative process. Yet, SSRIs are not found to be superior to placebo in eliciting a response or achieving remission in people with major depression over age 65(Tham et al., 2016). Similarly, there is a lack of treatment effect of comorbid depression in elderly Alzheimer’s patients with SSRI(Elsworthy and Aldred, 2019). We did not find any improvement in depressive symptoms after initiation of SSRIs; however, number of participants was limited, and we did not evaluate an association of SSRI with other behavioral symptoms or clinical depression. Mild behavioral impairment(Ismail et al., 2017) was the term coined describing the conglomeration of subtle behavioral symptoms that appear in the elderly due to underlying neurodegenerative pathology, which signifies a shift in mindset associating late-life behavioral changes with neurodegenerative processes.

Our study emphasizes that using SSRIs in late life should be a red flag for proteinopathies such as tau accumulation in the brain associated with dementias, and treatment with SSRIs may not relieve depressive symptoms in this population.

The strengths and weaknesses of our study include a large cohort of about 3,000 older women and men with an extended follow-up, annual evaluations including medication use, comorbidities, and cognition, and analysis of postmortem brain tissue in a subset of deceased participants. There was a high participation rate in clinical follow-up and brain autopsy, minimizing the likelihood that selective attrition biased results. Cognition was assessed with a previously established psychometrically sound index, likely minimizing measurement error. Some limitations of our study include using volunteer cohorts, which may lead to biases and limit the generalizability of results. While several mitigating measures were used (such as direct visual inspection of all medication receptacles in the community setting and immediate recording into an electronic capture form on a laptop), the exposure to SSRI remains challenging to estimate in epidemiologic studies, and more research is needed. We lack data on SSRI doses. Also, the epidemiologic design does not allow testing for causality as would be possible using other study designs, such as a clinical trial with randomization. There was a lack of diversity among participants, so results may not be generalizable to minoritized populations using SSRI.
