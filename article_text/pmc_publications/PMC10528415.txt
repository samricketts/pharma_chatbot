Current data suggest a hypothesis of vascular pathogenesis for the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To investigate this, we studied the association of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) gene on microvessels in human autopsy-confirmed AD with and without APOE4, compared with age/sex-matched control (AC) hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum. AD arterioles (without APOE4 gene) had mild oxidative stress and loss of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelial cell density, reflecting aging progression. In AD+APOE4, an increase in strong oxidative DNA damage marker 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), VEGF, and endothelial cell density were associated with increased diameter of arterioles and perivascular space dilation. In cultured human brain microvascular cells (HBMECs), treatment of ApoE4 protein plus amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers increased superoxide production and the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase 3, sustained hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) stability that was associated with an increase in MnSOD, VEGF, and cell density. This cell over-proliferation was inhibited with the antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine and MnTMPyP, the HIF-1α inhibitor echinomycin, the VEGFR-2 receptor blocker SU1498, the protein kinase C (PKC) ε knock-down (KD) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) inhibitor FR180204. The PKCε KD and echinomycin decreased VEGF and/or ERK. In conclusion, AD capillaries and arterioles in hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum of non-APOE4 carriers are related with aging, while those in APOE4 carriers with AD are related with pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Current data suggest that change of microvessels (arteriole, capillary and/or venule) is a causal factor in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis and/or a consequence of AD progression, but the mechanism is not clearly understood (Attems and Jellinger 2014; Kalaria and Ballard 1999). Capillary loss plays a major role in brain aging and mild cognitive impairment, which are risk factors for AD (Brown and Thore 2011; Fang et al. 2022; Toda 2012). Although hypoperfusion is progressive during early AD, the overall capillary density is not changed (Hunter et al. 2012; Brown and Thore 2011). Aging, hypertension, and diabetes are risks for AD as well as arteriolar wall thickening (arteriolosclerosis), which is a prominent feature of small vessel disease and microangiopathy, one of the first changes to occur during cerebrovascular pathology (Kalaria and Hase 2019). Arteriolosclerosis reduces blood flow in the arterioles and capillaries, resulting in hypoperfusion, perivascular degeneration, and then cortical and subcortical microinfarcts. This mild cerebrovascular disease appears to be the most robust substrate of cognitive impairment (Arvanitakis et al. 2017; Kalaria 2016; Yamazaki et al. 2021).

During the aging process, the activity of sirtuin1 (SIRT1) in the nucleus is reduced, resulting in HIF-1α stabilization. Activated HIF-1α reduces c-Myc activity and subsequently reduces the transcription of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which is required for replication, transcription, and maintenance of mitochondrial biogenesis. The transcriptional coactivator’s peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α activity is also inhibited upon its interaction with HIF-1α, resulting in the downregulation of mitochondrial genes and MnSOD (Lu et al. 2010; Yeo 2019). The reduction of c-Myc activity may elicit the loss of VEGF and small microvessels (Baudino et al. 2002; Florea et al. 2013).

In response to sustained hypoxia, the mitochondria consume almost all the oxygen. Prolyl hydroxylase is inhibited by low oxygen levels and HIF1-α is upregulated and stabilized (Kim, Lee, and Choi 2020; Wu, He, and Zhu 2018; Yeo 2019). The HIF-1α forms a heterodimer with HIF-1β to function as a transcription factor, resulting in increased expression of VEGF and receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) (Ji et al. 2014).

Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) may contribute to early AD by its effect on microvessels (Attems and Jellinger 2014; Arvanitakis et al. 2011; Kemper et al. 1999; Brown and Thore 2011; Schneider 2009; Arvanitakis et al. 2016; Butterfield and Mattson 2020). In the central nervous system of APOE4 carriers, ApoE4 is mainly produced by astrocytes, and microglial ApoE4 production is strongly induced during injury and disease, including in aging and AD (Fernandez et al. 2019). A possible direct effect of ApoE4 expression has been shown on in vitro microvascular (MV) endothelial cells and neurons (Thal et al. 2008; Tai et al. 2011; Sen, Nelson, and Alkon 2015; Masuda et al. 2017). Few studies demonstrate the effect of ApoE4 on MV dysfunction. ApoE4 increases amyloid precursor protein (APP) mRNA and amyloid-beta (Aβ) isoform 770 cleavage in vascular smooth muscle cells (Mazur-Kolecka et al. 1999), impairs the blood-brain barrier (BBB; (Nishitsuji et al. 2011; Montagne et al. 2020), and lowers Aβ degradation and perivascular clearance of Aβ (Zhu et al. 2013; O’Callaghan et al. 2014; Hawkes et al. 2014). ApoE4 then promotes cerebral amyloid angiopathy mostly in small- to medium-sized blood vessels (Chalmers, Wilcock, and Love 2003; Nelson et al. 2013; Vidal et al. 2000), which increases thrombosis and/or fibrinolysis (Hultman, Strickland, and Norris 2013), as well as microbleeds (Benedictus et al. 2013; Kester et al. 2014). In AD complexed with ApoE4 brains, a decrease in cortical cholinergic afferents contributes to arteriolar vasodilation (Hunter et al. 2012). The amyloid-related capillary occlusion and arteriolar-vasodilation hypoperfusion presumably affects the brain in AD (Thal et al. 2008). ApoE4 enhances age-related arteriolosclerosis and microinfarcts (Yip et al. 2005). By contrast to non-APOE4 carriers, an increase in VEGF activity is associated with cognitive decline in aging and AD (Moore et al. 2020).

In AD subjects, ApoE4 enhances oxidative damage during the early stage of sporadic AD, while less oxidative stress but increased Aβ accumulation are associated with the late stage of sporadic AD (Nunomura et al. 2012). Mitochondria generate less energy with age, and during the early stage of sporadic AD, the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by their increased metabolic activity, lead to neuron degeneration (Demetrius, Magistretti, and Pellerin 2014). Mitochondrial dysfunction interacts with ApoE4, which increases the risk of developing AD (Gamarra et al. 2015; Montesanto et al. 2018). The molecular mechanism of ApoE4 protein complex with AD in mitochondrial oxidative stress and MV lesions has not been clearly investigated.

Thus, the present study investigated the effect of ApoE4 on capillaries and arterioles, associated with synaptic loss in autopsy-confirmed AD hippocampi. In cultured HBMECs, we studied the effect of ApoE4 and/or Aβ on VEGF/PKCε/ERK/cell proliferation signal cascade correlated with mild and/or strong oxidative stress levels.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Human Postmortem Tissue Samples

Human tissue specimens were obtained from the NIH NeuroBioBank. The pathological diagnosis of AD was conducted according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (‘World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki: ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects’ 2013). All patients (or relatives/representatives who had the power of attorney) signed informed-consent forms. The present work was carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans (‘World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki: ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects’ 2013). A total of 11 age/sex-matched controls (AC) without APOE4, 10 with AD+APOE4, and 9 AD (without APOE4) individuals were used for histopathologic analyses. All samples were matched for age and gender.

Exclusion Criteria of Human Postmortem Tissue Samples

In this study, we excluded any patients with the following conditions: frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, Parkinson’s disease dementia, stroke, brain cancer, mental retardation, severe depression, and/or severe weakness leading to invalid mental health assessment.

Preparation of human autopsy hippocampal sections

Human hippocampal samples at 0.4 cm thickness were processed for paraffin embedding. Paraffin-embedded sections (10 μm) were mounted on glass slides and deparaffinized with xylene (2 times; 5 min each) and 100% ethanol for 5 min. Tissue sections were then rehydrated with graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 85%, 70%, and 50%; at 3 min each step) and washed with distilled water (2 times; 5 min each).

Culturing of HBMECs

HBMECs (Neuromics, Edina, MN, USA or ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at subculture passages 2–5 were grown on fibronectin-coated glass slides or well plates. Cultured cells were maintained in endothelial medium (ScienCell) supplemented with endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS, ScienCell) and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for up to 3 days at about 1 ml per well (3.5 cm2 surface area) on the 12-well plate or 3 ml per well (9.6 cm2 surface area) on the 6-well plate. HBMECs could not survive under serum-free medium to induce maturity. Therefore, the limited culture medium and FBS, without fresh culture medium change, was used to allow HBMECs to initially multiply and thereafter reach maturity during the gradual exhaustion of serum.

Preparation Aβ1–42 oligomers

To prepare Aβ1–42 oligomers (Porter et al. 2020), 1 mg of lyophilized Aβ1–42 monomers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was suspended in 167μL of nuclease-free water (Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. The dissolved Aβ1–42 was then diluted to 230μM by adding 833μL of Ca2+-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma Aldrich) and incubated for 24h at 37°C for polymerization. After polymerization, Aβ1–42 was separated into 50μL aliquots and stored at −80°C. The final product produced 230 μM Aβ1–42 at mixed polymerization states.

Measurement of superoxide (O2•−) in cultured cells

The specific probe hydroethidine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to measure changes in cellular O2•− production (Hongpaisan, Winters, and Andrews 2004). The reaction between O2•− and non-fluorescent hydroethidine generates a highly specific red fluorescent product, 2-hydroxyethidium. In biological systems, another red fluorescent product, ethidium, is also formed, usually at a much higher concentration than 2-hydroxyethidium (Zielonka and Kalyanaraman 2010). Cultured cells, grown on glass slides, were incubated with hydroethidine (2μg/ml) at room temperature for 15–20 min and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Increased O2•− production was qualitatively determined with a confocal microscope at 488 nm/&gt;510 nm (excitation/emission).

Immunohistochemistry

For immunohistochemistry, cultured cells growing on cover glasses were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15–20 min and kept in PBS at 4°C. Due to long-term storage in paraformaldehyde, human autopsy brain sections were treated for antigen retrieval. Deparaffinized hippocampal sections were incubated in 10mM citrate and 0.05% Tween 20 in distilled water (adjusted to pH 6.0 with 1N NaOH) for 30 min at 95°C. Tissue sections were then washed with PBS (3 times; 5 min each).

For immunohistochemistry of hippocampal sections and cultured neuron samples, the samples were treated with PBS containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature to block non-specific protein binding sites. The samples were incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibodies against synaptophysin (mouse monoclonal IgG; 1:1,000; MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO), spinophilin (rabbit polyclonal IgG; 1:100; MilliporeSigma), VEGF (mouse monoclonal IgG; 1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PKCε (rabbit polyclonal IgG; 1:100; MilliporeSigma), 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG; mouse monoclonal IgG; 1:100; Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX, USA), OGG1 (rabbit polyclonal IgG; 1:250; Protein Tech, Rosemont, IL), MnSOD (rabbit polyclonal IgG; 1:200; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), anti-HIF-1α (rabbit polyclonal IgG; 1:250; Novus Biological, Centennial, CO), anti-TFAM (rabbit polyclonal IgG, 1:500; Invitrogen), and cleaved caspase 3 (rabbit polyclonal IgG; 1:100; Cell Signaling Tech, Danvers, MA). The secondary antibody was biotinylated horse anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:20; Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 3h at room temperature. The samples were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit (if biotinylated anti-mouse IgG was previously used) or anti-mouse (if anti-rabbit IgG was previously incubated) IgG (1:1,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and streptavidin conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 3h at room temperature. The samples mounted on glass slides were sealed with cover glasses, using Vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories) to counterstain nuclei and were processed for confocal microscopy.

PKCε knockdown

PKCε knockdown was performed using 100 nM of three target-specific 19–25 nucleotide PKCε si-RNA constructs (sc-36251), purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). For negative control, a scrambled si-RNA (sc-37007) was used. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine RNAimax, per the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). The medium was changed 5–6h after the addition of lipofectamine. PKCε downregulation was assessed 72 h after transfection.

RNA ISOLATION AND QUANTITATIVE RT-PCR of PKCε mRNA

As we previously described, HBMEC cultured cells were washed with 1X PBS followed by trypsinization using diluted trypsin at room temperature. Cells were observed under a microscope for complete dissociation and transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing fetal bovine serum and mixed to inactivate trypsin spin at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were removed, pellets were washed with 1 ml 1X PBS, 350 ul RLT buffer was added, and the cells were stored at −80 for subsequent RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy kit with on column DNase treatment following the manufacturer’s protocol. The 1 ug of total RNA was reverse transcribed (RT) using Omniscript (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed with FAST SYBR Green or Fast TaqMan master mix (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA) on the Step One plus ABI 7000 machine (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA). Data were normalized to 18S. PCR assay name is PKC epsilon (PRKCE), Assay ID:HP208540 (Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD).

Confocal microscopy

The images were oriented with a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope equipped with a 710 confocal scanning system using the 10x objective lens in the DAPI channel (for staining nuclei). The random area that appeared immediately after switching to the higher magnification lens, either 63X or 100x Plan-APO Chromat oil immersion objectives (1.4 NA), was imaged for appropriate fluorescence (e.g., Alexa 488 and/or 568). Confocal images (512 × 512 pixels) were acquired in line-scan mode with a pinhole of approximately 1.00 Airy unit, and averaged data from several (8x) images were reported. Confocal images, obtained with a Zeiss confocal microscope, were stored and quantified offline. Immunofluorescence intensity was evaluated with the NIH ImageJ program and normalized with DAPI intensity. The control data were set at 100%, and all other experimental data were defined as percentages of their controls.

While obtaining confocal images, the strong brightness of each fluorescence channel was collected close to the saturation because the gray level of pixel with oversaturated brightness was reported to the maximal level of saturated brightness. Therefore, the confocal images under different experimental conditions within the same panels in the figures were adjusted at the same level.

Measurement of pre- and postsynaptic densities

After immunohistochemical processing and confocal microscopy, we measured the densities of postsynaptic dendritic spines (spinophilin grains) and presynaptic axonal terminals (synaptophysin grains) per 63 × 63 × 0.6 μm3 volume of the CA1 stratum radiatum (where apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons are located). Images were analyzed by grain counting using the ImageJ program. In brief, the 8-bit grey scale images were inverted, so that the dark pixels became light and vice versa. The (light) background of the photographic negative was then subtracted, using a background subtraction command, in order to omit diffuse, low-fluorescence staining of proteins that had not yet been transported to pre- and postsynaptic structures. The images were converted from an 8-bit (256 shades of grey) to a 1-bit (black or white) image. The particles that ended up touching one another were then processed for separation. Only particles within the range of pixel sizes of the measured structures were defined and counted. The control data were set at 100%, and all other experimental data were defined as percentage of their controls.

Cell lysis and Western blot analysis

Cultured cells were harvested in homogenizing buffer containing 10mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 20 μM leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100 and were lysed by sonication. Protein concentration was measured using the Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Protein extracts were run on Nu-Page 4–12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in an iBlot2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Blots were treated with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR) at room temperature for 1 h and incubated with rabbit monoclonal HIF-1α antibody (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; 1:250), rabbit monoclonal TFAM antibody (Invitrogen, 1:500), mouse monoclonal MnSOD antibody (R&amp;D Systems, 1:500), rabbit polyclonal PKCε antibody (Novus Biologicals, 1:500) and mouse monoclonal β-Actin antibody (MilliporeSigma, 1:30,000) overnight at 4 °C overnight, and detected with anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 800 from (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1,000) and anti-mouse IgG DyLight 680 (Invitrogen, 1:1,000) and quantitated using a LI-COR imaging system. Densitometric quantification was performed using the NIH ImageJ. For quantifying expression of a protein, the densitometric value for the protein of interest was normalized against β-actin (loading control).

Statistical analyses

The effect of post mortem change was analyzed with linear regression analysis. In most case, data with a significant overall difference among the groups as demonstrated with an one-way (one factor) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were further analyzed for Tukey’s multiple comparison or t-test. Autopsied data were analyzed for Tukey’s multiple comparison (biochemical data) or paired t-test (morphological data). For cultured cell experiments, data with &gt;2 studied groups, except Western blots) were analyzed for Tukey’s multiple comparison, whereas Western blot data and data with only 2 studied groups were analyzed with paired t-test. The number of microvessels, cells, or areas (n; number of observations) from the number of human autopsy brains or cultured HBMEC experiments used (number of replicates) were indicated in the graph.

Results

Human brain autopsies were used to study the association of the APOE4 gene on changes in capillaries and arterioles. The detailed demographic data of human subjects are shown in Table 1. The average ages for human subjects were 81.5±1.8 years for the AD+APOE4 group, 76.6±3.8 years for the AD (without APOE4) group, and 79.4±3.0 years for AC. Basically, once human death is pronounced at no heartbeat, postmortem change occurs rapidly in high energy-required cells or organs. Several cells may survive at least 24 h under low temperature. In human postmortem brains, a rapid reduction in neuronal gene expression occurs with a reciprocal time-dependent increase in astrocytic and microglial gene expression that continued to increase for at least 24 h after tissue resection (Dachet et al. 2021). In the present study, the postmortem interval (PMI) of brains before fixation with 10% formalin was between 6.25–28.0 h. To investigate the effect of postmortem interval on morphology or biochemistry of capillaries and arterioles, we used linear regression analysis with 3 autopsied brain groups (11 AC, 9AD, and 8 AD+E4 hippocampal groups) and found no significant difference between each study parameter (morphology or staining) and the postmortem interval (Figures. S1–S3) among the human autopsy brain samples.

These data suggest that that capillaries and arterioles in the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum are slowly changing, but not significantly different, within a 28-h postmortem interval.

Braak staging with one number indicates the brain at both sides had the same Braak stages, while two Braak stages (with / in the middle) indicate that brain at left and right hemispheres showed different Braak staging.

In general, Braak staging is based on the expression of neurofibrillary tangles in different brain regions (Braak et al. 2003). Non-AD brains are mostly at Braak stages 0-III, while AD is mostly at Braak II-VI. Changes in capillaries and arterioles were studied in 5 different AC and AD groups, related with Braak staging: AC 0-I (n=7), AC II-III (n=4), AD+E4 II-III (AD with APOE4, n=4), AD IV-V I (AD without APOE4, n=9], and AD+E4 IV-VI (n=4).

AD did not affect capillary number and morphology, while AD+APOE4 was associated with a decrease in capillary density in the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum

Capillaries (&lt;10μm diameter) do not have smooth muscle cells (Liu et al. 2012; Jackson 2022). Arterioles are 10–100μm in diameter and composed of a single layer of endothelial cells (round or oval-shape nuclei) and a couple of layers of smooth muscle cells (thin and elongated or spindle-shape nuclei) in tunica media. Terminal arterioles (&lt;50μm diameter) have a single layer of smooth muscle cells (Liu et al. 2012; Jackson 2022). Confocal microscopy was used to study the morphology of microvessels in the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum (Fig. 1A). The number of capillaries (&lt;10μm in diameter) and arterioles (&gt;10μm in diameter) within the 200μm × 200μm area was studied (Fig. 1B, C). We found that most arterioles in the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum were &lt;50μm in diameter, suggesting they were terminal arterioles (Liu et al. 2012; Jackson 2022). Comparing AC (Braak 0-I), AC (Braak II-III), and AD (Braak IV-VI), we found no change in the number of capillaries per 200μm × 200μm areas of the hippocampal CA1 areas (Fig. 1B), the capillary diameter (Fig. 1D), the number of capillary nuclei per 100μm perimeter (Fig. 1F), and ratio of perivascular space per capillary area (Fig. 1H), even when Braak staging was advanced to AD at the late Braak stages (IV-VI). APOE4 was associated with a decrease in capillary density in AD+E4 at Braak II-III (p=0.022), compared with AC at Braak II-III (Fig. 1B).

AD+APOE4 was associated with an increase in wall cells and diameter of arterioles and perivascular space dilation in the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum

In contrast to capillaries, morphology of arterioles showed a tendency to change, when compared among AC (0-I), AC (II-III), and AD (IV-VI). AD at Braak stages IV-VI increased the number of arterioles (p=0.001), but decreased the arteriolar diameter (p=0.015) and the number of arteriolar wall nuclei (p=0.001; Fig. 1C, E, G; AD IV-VI vs AC 0-I). These suggest hypertrophy of arterioles.

APOE4 was associated with an increase in arteriolar wall nuclei (p&lt;0.013) and diameter (p&lt;0.014) in AD at both middle (II-III) and late Braak (IV-VI) staging (Fig. 1E, G; AD+E4 II-III vs AC II-III and AD+E4 IV-VI vs AD IV-VI). These suggest hyperplasia of arteriolar cells. In addition, APOE4 was associated with a decrease in the number of arterioles but an increase in perivascular space divided with arteriolar area in the AD +E4 at late Braak stages (IV-VI; Fig. 1C, I; AD+E4 IV-VI vs AD IV-VI). An increase in round or oval-shaped nuclei of endothelial cells was seen in the AD+E4 group (Fig. 1B). The results suggest that AD+APOE4 is associated with arteriolar wall thickening and perivascular space dilation, the indicator for cerebrovascular disease and lacunar infarct (Kalaria and Ballard 1999; Kövari et al. 2013).

Reduced MnSOD expression and mild oxidative stress in both capillaries and arterioles, but VEGF was decreased only in arterioles in AD hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum

Biochemical changes in the MV endothelial cell were further investigated, using immunohistochemistry and imaging with confocal microscopy. We investigate the oxidative stress level in capillaries and arterioles in the AD hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum with and without APOE4. VEGF is involved in angiogenesis or the growth of existing blood vessels and in the maintenance of blood vessels (Holmes et al. 2007).

In general, healthy DNA and RNA contain guanosine that can be transformed to 8-OHG and 8-OHdG with the interaction of hydroxyl radical (HO), the most toxic ROS during strong oxidative stress. The 8-OHdG undergoes keto-enol tautomerism, which favors the oxidized product 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG). In the literature, 8-OHdG and 8-oxodG are used for the same compound (Kasai 1997). The DNA damage induced by ROS contains base modification, base loss, and DNA single-strand breaks, which are usually repaired by the base excision repair pathway. The human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1) is the main enzyme in this repair pathway and is responsible for the excision of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a mutagenic base byproduct that occurs as a result of exposure to ROS (Lillenes et al. 2016; Santos et al. 2013).

Immunohistochemistry with primary antibody that recognized both 8-OHG and 8-OHdG and anti-MnSOD antibody revealed that capillaries and terminal arterioles in AC II-III and AD IV-VI had low levels of the oxidative DNA/RNA marker 8-OHG (p=0.001) and the mitochondrial MnSOD, important for anti-oxidation (p&lt;0.033; Fig. 2A, B). We further studied whether change in VEGF and its down-stream molecular signal PKCε was correlated with the MV change. In capillaries, VEGF and PKCε were not changed among AC 0-I, AC II-III and AD IV-VI groups (Fig. 2D, E). In arterioles, however, VEGF and PKCε were decreased in AC II-III (p=0.019) and AD IV-VI (p=0.001) groups, compared with AC 0-I (Fig. 2D, E). In AD+E4 (II-III) compared with AC (II-III), an increase in PKCε, but not VEGF, was increased in the arterioles (Fig. 2D, E).

The results suggest that mild oxidative stress and a reduction in VEGF signal cascade (Fig. 2D, E) were associated with the decrease in cell number and diameter of arterioles, but increase in the number of AD arterioles (arteriolar hypertrophy; Fig. 1C, E, G).

APOE4 was associated with an early and temporally strong oxidative stress followed by a late increase in VEGF/PKCε signal cascade in AD hippocampal CA1 capillaries and arterioles

In AD+E4 capillaries, the oxidative DNA/RNA damage marker 8-OHG/8-OH-dG marker (p=0.001) and mitochondrial MnSOD (p=0.001) increased, compared with AC at braak II-III, to the AC levels at Braak 0-I (Fig. 2A, B). In AD+E4 arterioles, we found an increase in the oxidative DNA/RNA damage marker 8-OHG/8-OH-dG (p=0.001) and mitochondrial MnSOD (p=0.001), compared with AC at Braak II-III, to the levels even higher (p=0.033) than the AC at Braak 0-I (Fig. 2A, B). The strong oxidative DNA/RNA damage was related with a rise in the oxidative DNA/RNA repair protein OGG1 in AD+E4 arterioles at Braak II-III (Fig. 2C). However, these changes associated with APOE4 at Braak II-III were not seen in AD+E4 at Braak IV-VI. The results suggest that a tempory increase in the strong oxidative DNA/RNA damage at in AD+E4 at Braak II-III is associated with an increase in VEGF signal cascade that is sustained in AD+E4 arterioles at late Braak stages IV-VI.

In AD+E4 (IV-VI) compared with AD (IV-VI), both VEGF and PKCε were increased in both capillaries (p&lt;0.032) and arterioles (p=0.001, Fig. 2D, E).). This suggests that although APOE4 does affect VEGF, APOE4 may increase the down-stream VEGF molecular target PKCε in the AD arterioles at middle Braak stages II-III. However, APOE4 increases VEGF and PKCε in both capillaries and arterioles of AD hippocampal CA1 area at the late Braak stages IV-VI.

A decrease in microvessels was associated with an acceleration of synaptic loss in AD hippocampal CA1 areas with APOE4 gene

We investigated the association of MV change on synaptic loss in the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum from APOE4 and non-APOE donors. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used on the presynaptic vesicle membrane protein, synaptophysin, and the dendritic spine-specific protein, spinophilin (Fig. 3A). The presynaptic axonal bouton density was quantified by counting the number of synaptophysin-positive profiles in random areas of the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum, while synaptophysin intensity reflected the concentration of presynaptic vesicles within the boutons. Spinophilin grain counting was used to determine the dendritic spine density. A decrease in presynaptic axonal bouton density (p=0.006), presynaptic vesicle concentration (p=0.001), and postsynaptic dendritic spine density (p=0.001) was seen in AD IV-VI hippocampal CA1 areas, compared with AC 0-I or AC II-III (Fig. 3B–D). The results suggest that synaptic loss is related with an increase in the number of arterioles with reduced caliber and wall cell number in AD hippocampal CA1 area (Fig. 1C, E, G).

A decrease in presynaptic vesicle concentration was seen in AC at Braak stages II-III, compared with AC 0-I (Fig. 3C). APOE4 was associated with the acceleration of presynaptic axonal bouton (p=0.002) and dendritic spine (p=0.001) loss in AD at Braak stages II-III (Fig. 3B, D; AD+E4 II-III vs AC II-III). However, presynaptic membrane vesicle concentration was increased in AD+E4 at Braak II-III (p=0.008) and later Braak stages (IV-VI) in both AD (p=0.029) and AD+E4, compared with AC at Braak stages II-III (Fig. 3C). This suggest that an increase in presynaptic vesicles, which contain neurotransmitters, is associated with neuron excitotoxicity and synaptic loss.

The results suggest that capillary loss and arteriolar wall thickening (Fig. 1E, G) are associated with acceleration of synaptic loss in AD+E4 II-III. Although synaptic loss was accelerated in AD+E4 at middle Braak stages II-III, the loss of presynaptic axonal boutons, presynaptic vesicles, and dendritic spine density in AD+E4 at late Braak stages IV-VI was not different from the AD IV-VI (Fig. 3B–D).

Aβ oligomers induced a prolonged decrease in VEGF and HBMEC density, while ApoE4+Aβ induced an early decrease, followed by VEGF surge and over-proliferation of HBMECs

Effects of ApoE4 protein and Aβ oligomers were studied in cultures of HBMECs. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI, while change in VEGF was investigated using immunohistochemistry. Cultured cell density (p&lt;0.045) and VEGF (p&lt;0.003) were reduced significantly at 4 h after ApoE4, Aβ or ApoE4+Aβ treatment (Fig. 4A, B). At 24 h, cell density (p=0.001) and VEGF (p=0.002) were still decreased in Aβ-treated cells (Fig. 4A, B). After ApoE4 treatment, cell density and VEGF were recovered to the basal levels at 24 h (Fig. 4A, B). However, in cells treated with both ApoE4+Aβ for 24 h, cell over-proliferation (p=0.003) and VEGF surge (p=0.001) were observed (Fig. 4A, B). Vascular endothelial cells require serum up tom 10% in culture medium. Because unlike most other cell types, HBMEC could not survive under serum-free medium to induce maturity. Additionally, vascular wall thickening is considered as exaggerated repair, due to over surge of VEGF (Ji et al. 2014). We used 5% fetal bovine serum in culture medium to allow HBMEC maturity as well as the repair of HBMEC cell proliferation at 24h after the insult of ApoE4 and/or Aβ to induce early HBMEC loss at 4h (Fig. 4A,B).

The results showed that the effect of Aβ on VEGF and cultured cell density at 24 h was the same as on arteriolar MV endothelial cells in the autopsied AD hippocampus, while ApoE4+Aβ at 24 h increased VEGF and cell density similar to that seen in arteriolar endothelial cells in AD hippocampus with APOE4 (Fig. 4A vs Fig. 1F; and Fig. 4B vs Fig. 2D). Therefore, we subsequently use this experiment as a study model to investigate pathophysiology of VEGF expression related with oxidative stress level.

An early loss of VEGF and HBMECs, induced by ApoE4 and Aβ, was related with an increase in HIF-1α but decreases in mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and MnSOD

HIF-1α-dependent VEGF signal was further studied with immunohistochemistry imaged with confocal microscope (Fig. 5A) and Western blot analysis (Figure S4A). Cultured HBMECs were treated with ApoE4, Aβ oligomers, or ApoE4+Aβ for 4 h. Immunohistochemistry showed an early increase in cytoplasmic HIF-1α, but decreases in mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM (p&lt;0.04) and mitochondrial MnSOD (p&lt;0.006) were seen (Fig. 5B–D, at 4h). These results were confirmed with Western blots for HIF-1α, TFAM, and MnSOD (Figure S4B–D).

Addition of oxidative stress, induced by early ApoE4 and Aβ oligomers, did not promote Aβ-dependent apoptosis

Oxidative stress-dependent apoptosis is involved in aging (Pollack and Leeuwenburgh 2001). Effects of Aβ, ApoE4, and ApoE3 during an early reduction of VEGF and cell density were further studied. Non-fluorescent hydroethidine was oxidized by O2•− to fluorescent ethidium (mostly) and 2-hydroxyethidium (Hongpaisan, Winters, and Andrews 2004). HBMECs were loaded with hydroethidine to detect an excess increase in O2•− to indicate oxidative stress (Fig. 6A). Parallelly, immunohistochemistry was used to detect changes in the apoptosis-marker cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 6A). ApoE4 treatment for 4 h increased (p=0.001) O2•− without an increase in cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 6B, C). By contrast, treatment of Aβ for 4h induced an increase in O2•− (p=0.001) and the apoptosis-marker cleaved caspase 3 (p=0.046; Fig. 6B, C). In cells treated with both ApoE4+Aβ, the effects of ApoE4 were additive with the effect of Aβ on an increase in O2•− but not apoptosis marker cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 6B, C).

ApoE3 completely blocked the early effect of ApoE4 but partially inhibited ApoE4+Aβ-inducing cell loss

Effect of ApoE3 on Aβ and/or ApoE4 during an early reduction of VEGF and cell density were further studied, using O2•− measurement and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 6). Western blot analysis was used to study changes in HIF-1α, TFAM, MnSOD, and PKCε (Figure S4). Treatment of ApoE3 (alone) at 1μg/ml for 4 h had minor effect on oxidative stress, apoptosis, VEGF expression, HIF-1α, TFAM, MnSOD, and PKCε (Fig. 6B, C and Figures S4B–E). When cells treated with ApoE4+ApoE3 were compared to the cells treated with only ApoE4, ApoE3 abolished the effects of ApoE4 oxidative stress, VEGF, HIF-1α, TFAM, MnSOD, and PKCε expression (Fig. 6B, C and Figures S4B–E). When ApoE4+Aβ+ApoE3 was compared to ApoE4+Aβ, ApoE3 attenuated the effect of ApoE4+Aβ on oxidative stress, apoptosis, and PKCε but not VEGF, cell density, HIF-1α, TFAM, and MnSOD (Fig. 6B, C and Figures S4B–E). The results suggest that in APOE3/4 carriers, under healthy condition, ApoE3 can prevent the effect of ApoE4; however, during AD pathogenesis, ApoE3 cannot prevent the combined effect of ApoE4 and increasing Aβ.

Aβ oligomers induced a prolonged increase in age-related mild oxidative stress and HIF-1α stability but a decrease in mitochondrial transcription TFAM, MnSOD, and VEGF

After Aβ oligomer treatment, an increase in HIF-1α, but a decrease in mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM, were seen at 4h (p&lt;0.04) and 24h (p&lt;0.03; Fig. 5B, C). A decrease in MnSOD (p&lt;0.006) was seen at 4 h without an increase in the strong oxidative DNA damage marker 8-OHdG. The results suggest that Aβ activates age-related increase in HIF-1α stability that decreases mitochondrial transcription (TFAM) and MnSOD expression, leading to mild oxidative stress (not strong enough to increase 8-OHdG) and a decrease in VEGF (Fig. 4B).

Late effect of ApoE4+Aβ oligomers induced sustained hypoxia-related increase in HIF-1α, VEGF, mitochondrial MnSOD, and strong oxidative DNA damage

At 24 h after ApoE4 incubation, changes in cell density, VEGF, HIF-1α, TFAM, and MnSOD were recovered to the control levels (Figs. 4A, B and 5A–D). However, at 24 h after ApoE4+Aβ treatment, an increase in HIF-1α, TFAM, MnSOD and the oxidative DNA damage marker 8-OHdG (Fig. 5B–E). These results suggest that ApoE4 switches the age-related effect of Aβ to sustained hypoxia by possibly increasing HIF-1α-dependent VEGF expression (Fig. 4B) and mitochondrial transcription and activity, and resulting in an excessive increase in mitochondrial O2•− by-product of mitochondrial respiration and strong oxidative stress.

ApoE4+Aβ oligomers-induced strong oxidative stress activates an increase in the HIF-1α-activated VEGF/PKCε/ERK that induces HBMEC over-proliferation

We further investigated whether an early increase in oxidative-stress-dependent apoptosis, HIF-1α, and subsequent surge in VEGF can induce exaggerated repair of HBMECs after ApoE4+Aβ treatment. HBMEC over-proliferation at 24 h after ApoE4+Aβ treatment was quantified, using confocal microscopy of DAPI-stained HBMEC nuclei. An increase in ApoE4+Aβ-induced HBMEC cell density was inhibited with the superoxide scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (Nac, p=0.005) and a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic Mn(III)tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (MnTMPyP, p=0.038; Fig. 7A), the HIF-1α inhibitor echinomycin (p=0.031), and PKCε knock-down (KD, p=0.042; Fig. 7A). The density of cells treated with ApoE4+Aβ in the presence of the VEGFR-2 receptor blocker SU1498 or the ERK inhibitor FR180204 was not different from control cell density (Fig. 7A).

Echinomycin inhibited the surge in VEGF (p=0.001) and ERK (p=0.001) at 24 h (Fig. 7B, C). The PKCε KD decreased ERK expression (p=0.010; Fig. 7D). A qPCR test confirmed the results, indicating that the ApoE4+Aβ-dependent oxidative stress and subsequent VEGF surge is associated with the stimulation of VEGFR-2 receptor molecular cascade involving PKCε and ERK, and resultant cell proliferation.

DISCUSSION

The present study provides evidence that the AD pathogenesis in APOE4 carriers may be involved in strong oxidative stress-dependent apoptotic cell loss, resulting in VEGF surge, exaggerated endothelial cell repair in the walls of arterioles, and perivascular space dilation that accelerates neurodegeneration. The findings demonstrate that capillary loss and arteriolar wall change (Fig. 1E, G) are associated with acceleration of synaptic loss in AD hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum from APOE4 carriers (Fig. 3B–D). These changes in the terminal arterioles may contribute to the cerebral blood flow reduction and the progress of AD symptoms (Hunter et al. 2012; Brown and Thore 2011). As mentioned in the Introduction, ApoE4 increases APP mRNA and Aβ isoform 770 cleavage in vascular smooth muscle cells that impairs the BBB permeability and Aβ 1–42 clearance. An increase in Aβ, induced by ApoE4, may accelerate an increase in presynaptic vesicles, which contain neurotransmitters (Fig. 3C), resulting in neuron excitotoxicity, post-synaptic dendritic spine loss and neurodegeneration and synaptic loss during AD pathogenesis.

Our study had some limitations. Our emphasis on AD and other dementia samples was not examined, so it was not known whether the differences in our postmortem data were specific for AD. ApoE transports lipids, but differences in lipid compositions were not examined. ApoE4 is one of the main causes cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis (Breitner et al. 1999; Pereira et al. 2019; Roher et al. 2011; Viticchi et al. 2014) that promote cerebrovascular disease and AD (Arvanitakis et al. 2011; Attems and Jellinger 2014; Brown and Thore 2011; Kemper et al. 1999). However, effects of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis on our data were also not investigated. Finally, persons with the APOE4 allele are more likely to develop cerebral amyloid angiopathy in capillaries (Thal et al. 2008), but we did not examine plaque formation in capillaries.

Our findings also verified that age-related capillary loss in AD hippocampus is not different from the AC (Hunter et al. 2012; Brown and Thore 2011). This suggests that age-related capillary loss already occurs in AC hippocampus. In AD hippocampus from a non-APOE4 carrier, we demonstrated a high density of small terminal arterioles (10–20μm in diameter) with a decrease in wall cell density (Fig. 1C, F), suggesting an enlargement of arteriolar wall cells and/or an increase in terminal arteriole length that may slow down blood flow to capillaries. We previously demonstrated an increase in arterioles with a decrease in MV cell density in the AD hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum (Sen and Hongpaisan 2018). The present study showed that although the capillaries and arterioles were not further decreased in AD hippocampus, the reduction in VEGF and PKCε may affect their physiological function. PKCε regulates VEGFR2 expression, which is critical for activation of the Src/Akt/eNOS/vascular cell permeability signal (Rask-Madsen and King 2008; Apte, Chen, and Ferrara 2019).

As hypothesized in Fig. 8A, our data on cultured HBMECs demonstrated that an increase in ApoE4 or Aβ (in AD hippocampus) may accelerate the aging signal in capillaries and arterioles by inducing mild oxidative stress and HIF-1α stabilization and decreasing TFAM, MnSOD, and VEGF. The decrease in MnSOD resulted in mitochondria-induced oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to ROS production and inflicting further oxidative injury to the mitochondria and/or nucleus (Bereiter-Hahn 2014; Lee and Wei 2012).

Under healthy conditions, the direct cell-to-cell contact activates Notch1 receptors that suppresses VEGFR-2 activity (Kim, Lee, and Choi 2020). In cultured cell experiment, ApoE4+Aβ-induced mitochondrial-oxidative-damage-induced apoptosis resulted in a decrease in cell density at 4 h after treatment. Mitochondrial oxidative damage activates cytochrome C oxidase / caspase / apoptosis and a decrease in cell density (Tian et al. 2017; Zhu et al. 2014). Apoptotic cells then reduced the cell-to-cell contact and notch receptors, resulting in an increase in VEGFR-2 sensitivity in surviving cells.

The embryonic lethal, abnormal vision, Drosophila (ELAV)-like, or human antigen (Hu) family of proteins can specifically bind with AU-rich (ARE) sequence in the 3´-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of mRNA. PKC activates the mRNA-stabilizing proteins, the Hu family proteins, which results in the nuclear export of mRNA and Hu to the cytoplasm (Antic and Keene 1998; Pascale et al. 2005; Quattrone et al. 2001). MnSOD, and VEGF mRNAs have multiple ARE sequences. The HuR protein binds and prevents MnSOD and VEGF mRNA degradation, thus enhancing protein synthesis in vascular endothelial cells (Arcondéguy et al. 2013; Chaudhuri et al. 2012; Kim, Lee, and Choi 2020; Wang et al. 2001; Millien et al. 2022). PKCε can activate HuR that prevent MnSOD and VEGF mRNA degradation in HBMECs (Millien et al. 2022). The present data showed an increase in PKCε may activate HuR that prevents MnSOD and VEGF mRNA degradation and enhances MnSOD expression and VEGF autocrine in arteriolar endothelial cells. Apoptosis also upregulated VEGF autocrine via Akt-dependent cell signaling (Ji et al. 2014).

In the present study, after 24 h of treatment, ApoE4+Aβ induced the surge in MnSOD and VEGF, resulting in over-proliferation of cultured HBMECs. The HIF-1α inhibitor echinomycin suppressed the increase in VEGF and its downstream PKCε/ERK/cell proliferation cascade. The results suggest the sustained hypoxia that can increase VEGF expression and VEGFR-2 sensitivity (Yeo 2019). Therefore, the above compensatory system induced after apoptosis was active, and even overshot resulted in over-proliferation of HBMECs at 24 h. The HBMEC results suggested that ApoE4+Aβ induces apoptosis and exaggerated wound repair in terminal arteriole wall in APOE4 carriers with AD. Arteriolar wall thickening and stiffness may reduce blood flow to capillaries, resulting in perivascular degeneration in the hippocampus. This pathogenesis may occur in other brain regions. Perivascular space may progress to microinfarct, infarcts, and lacunes in the deep brain nuclei that can be seen with MRI or with naked eyes during autopsy and appear to be the most robust substrates of cognitive impairment (Arvanitakis et al. 2017; Kalaria 2016, 2012). More details of molecular mechanisms underlying MV change in the hippocampal CA1 areas from AD patients with APOE4 are hypothesized in Fig. 8B.

Our data demonstrated an increase in VEGF in both capillaries and terminal arterioles in the AD+APOE hippocampus. This may reflect pathogenesis of MV enlargement from capillaries to large microvessels in the AD+APOE4 hippocampus. The microvessels had a morphology similar to MV dysplasia, which is atypical hyperplasia with an increase in the numbers of immature cells (with different size and morphology). The increased cells had morphology similar to endothelial cells (with large nuclei), while 1–2 layers of smooth cells (with small spindle-shape nuclei) were unchanged (Fig. 2D). An increase in local angiogenic factors (e.g., growth factors such as VEGF) and inflammation (cytokines and chemokines) can turn capillaries and/or small arterioles into microvascular dysplasia (Fan and Yang 2007; Su et al. 2008). In contrast to MV dysplasia, hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis is mostly correlated to severe (malignant) hypertension with markedly thickened walls due to smooth-muscle-cell proliferation, resulting into concentric ring of smooth muscles in the thickened tunica media and infiltration of lymphocytes in the tunica intima. Unlike an increase in cells with the same size and shape in hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis, MV dysplasia comprises hyperplastic cells with different sizes and shapes.

The frequencies of APOE genotypes in the population are APOE-2/3 (prevalence 7.92–7.97%), APOE-2/4 (0.79–1.18%), APOE-3/3 (58.95–75.99%), APOE-3/4 (13.19–27.32%), and APOE-4/4 (1.58–4.58%) (Cacabelos et al. 2012; Gharbi-Meliani et al. 2021; Stakias et al. 2006). The present study revealed that although ApoE3 inhibited the effect of ApoE4 on HBMECs, ApoE3 partially attenuated ApoE4+ApoE4. The results may explain the findings by other investigators that APOE-3/4 and 2/4 can still increase the AD risk by 3- to 4-fold, and APOE-4/4 by 10- to 15-fold (Zhao et al. 2020).

CONCLUSIONS

AD capillaries and arterioles in non-APOE4 carriers had mild oxidative stress but loss of VEGF and endothelial cell density in arterioles. This suggests the progression of aging in AD. However, the AD pathogenesis in ApoE4 carriers may involve strong oxidative stress and apoptotic cell loss, followed by sustained hypoxia, which increased VEGF/PKCε/ERK/cell proliferation signal and exaggerated arteriolar wall repair. This results in the acceleration of synaptic loss and perivascular space degeneration.

To detect cerebral hypoperfusion and hypometabolism, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and/or arterial spin-labeling MRI, with a cheaper cost than positron emission topography and not involving radioactivity, are used for several neurological diseases, including mild cognitive impairment and early-onset AD (Dolui et al. 2020; Narvid et al. 2018). Future research is required to prove whether arteriolar wall thickening, perivascular space dilation and/or lacunae, determined by, e.g., high-resolution MRI or angiography, can be used for prevention and prognosis for AD dementia in non-APOE4 and/or APOE4 carriers.

Fig. 8 Hypothesis: AD activates age-related disruption, while AD+ApoE4 induces sustained hypoxia in capillaries and arterioles of hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum. (A) An increase in Aβ during AD pathogenesis accelerates aging: the activity of SIRT1 in the nucleus is reduced, which decreases von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) levels and subsequently stabilizes HIF-1α. Activated HIF-1α reduces c-Myc activity and subsequently reduces the transcription of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which is required for replication and transcription, resulting in the downregulation of mitochondrial genes and MnSOD and mild oxidative stress (Lu et al. 2010; Yeo 2019). In addition, c-Myc targets the genes regulating processes required for cell growth, including rRNA transcription and processing, ribosomal protein transcription and translation, and translation initiation (Lu et al. 2010). The reduction of c-Myc activity may elicit the loss of VEGF (Baudino et al. 2002; Florea et al. 2013). (B) Normal O2 levels (normoxia, ~10% in the cytoplasm) activate prolyl hydroxylase (PHD), which promotes pVHL-dependent HIF-1α degradation (Kim, Lee, and Choi 2020; Wu, He, and Zhu 2018; Yeo 2019). Under sustained hypoxia induced by AD in ApoE4 carriers, increased mitochondria activity consumes almost 100 % O2, resulting in an increase in mitochondrial respiration and its excessive superoxide (O2•-) by-product, strong oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Therefore, PHDs are inhibited by sustained hypoxia, and HIF1-α is upregulated and stabilized (Kim, Lee, and Choi 2020; Wu, He, and Zhu 2018; Yeo 2019). The HIF-1α forms a heterodimer with HIF-1β to function as a transcription factor, resulting in increased expression of VEGF and VEGFR2 (Ji et al. 2014). The surge in VEGF and VEGFR2/PKC/ERK signal cascade results in exaggerated repair of MV endothelial cells.
