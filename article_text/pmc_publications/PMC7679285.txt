Malnutrition and weight loss are highly prevalent in persons with Alzheimer’s and related dementias. Oral intake is an important interventional target for addressing these nutritional consequences. However, the efficacy of interventions remains poorly understood as prior syntheses have failed to examine the impact of intervention approaches on malnutrition and hypothesized mechanisms of action in persons with dementia. This review aimed to determine the efficacy of mealtime interventions to improve oral intake and nutritional outcomes in persons with dementia. Four databases yielded 1712 studies, resulting in 32 studies that met inclusion criteria. Studies included education, environmental modifications, feeding, oral supplementation, and other pharmacologic/ecopsychological interventions. While the majority of studies reported statistically significant improvements in at least one nutritional outcome, study design and outcome measures were heterogeneous with many lacking adequate statistical power or blinding. Collectively, we found moderate evidence to suggest the efficacy of oral supplementation, and preliminary evidence to suggest that feeding interventions, education, and environmental modifications may confer improvements. Findings clarify the state of existing evidence regarding various interventional strategies for improving malnutrition in persons with dementia. While some approaches are promising, adequately powered and rigorously designed multi-dimensional intervention trials are needed to inform clinical decision-making in real-world contexts.

INTRODUCTION

Weight loss and malnutrition are highly prevalent in both post-acute and long-term care residents as well as persons with Alzheimer’s and related dementias, and are associated with poor functional outcomes, including an increased rate of hospitalizations, falls, cognitive impairment, and dependency with activities of daily living.1–3 Oral intake is an important interventional target for addressing these more distal nutritional consequences, and feasible and efficacious interventions have been identified as a priority for patients, caregivers, and funding agencies.4 Determinants of poor oral intake in persons with dementia are multifactorial, and integrated approaches to addressing contributing mechanistic and contextual factors have been proposed in a recent conceptual model that presents core modifiable domains of meal access, meal quality, and the mealtime experience.5,6 In addition to these domains, staff, environmental, cultural, and societal characteristics are relevant contextual factors that shape care delivery and eating-related activities.6

Patients with dementia encounter many barriers to adequate nutritional intake within each mealtime domain. Cognitive impairments can negatively affect one’s ability to participate and engage in physical and psychosocial aspects of the mealtime experience, often requiring feeding assistance and modifications.7 For example, impairments in memory, executive functioning, and visual perception can negatively impact one’s awareness of the mealtime situation, self-feeding abilities, and visual recognition of food.8 Additionally, impairments in cognitive flexibility, attention, and orientation can affect swallowing safety.9,10 Furthermore, non-cognitive behavioral symptoms such as verbal or physical aggression and agitation are common during mealtimes11, resulting in decreased consumption12 and increased rates of aspiration.13 Mealtime interventions targeting social interactions, food access, and the mealtime environment have shown promising results in improving these behavioral and psychosocial symptoms in post-acute and long-term care residents.14

Dysphagia, or swallowing impairment, is also a highly prevalent barrier to adequate and safe oral intake among older nursing home residents and persons with dementia.15–17 Age-related swallowing dysfunction has been attributed to sarcopenia of pharyngeal musculature18,19, as well as oral and pharyngeal sensory deficits.20–22 These difficulties are exacerbated in persons with dementia, worsening with disease progression.23 Impairments in the efficiency of oral intake during meals commonly results in weight loss, dehydration, and malnutrition.24 Aspiration is also a common adverse sequela, placing persons with dementia at a two-fold increased risk of pneumonia-associated mortality.25,26

Mealtime interventions often address various determinants of poor nutritional status and have been successfully implemented among post-acute and long-term care populations.27 Readily available syntheses of the efficacy of various mealtime interventions in dementia populations are lacking. Furthermore, existing evidence summaries are outdated and have not attempted to delineate specific mechanistic and modifiable environmental and caregiving factors that are specific to dementia, limiting the evidence-base for informing clinical management of these patients in post-acute and long-term care settings. Furthermore, prior syntheses of existing evidence have failed to provide conclusive evidence regarding the impact of intervention approaches on malnutrition, features of interventional strategies, intervention doses, or hypothesized mechanisms of action in persons with dementia.14,27–31

The efficacy of specific interventional strategies for improving oral intake and nutritional outcomes in individuals with dementia remains poorly understood due to heterogeneity in approaches and outcomes. To address this gap, the current paper reports findings from a systematic review designed to identify, synthesize, and critically appraise existing evidence surrounding the efficacy of mealtime interventions to improve nutritional outcomes in persons with dementia.

METHODS

Overview

The objective of this systematic review was to determine the efficacy of mealtime interventions in improving malnutrition and oral intake in persons with dementia. We initially attempted to identify articles for a homogenous dementia population to draw stronger inferences; however, upon reviewing the literature, it was clear that a broader approach was necessary due to multiple criteria for defining Alzheimer’s and related dementias.32 Thus, broad inclusion criteria was established regarding dementia subtypes, study setting, and types of nutritional outcomes to allow for a variety of study interventions and designs in order to comprehensively assess existing evidence and inform clinical practice. The goal of the review was to examine the efficacy of interventions specifically in persons with Alzheimer’s and related dementias; thus, known studies that examined mealtime interventions in heterogenous post-acute or long-term care cohorts without a specific emphasis on dementia were excluded.33–35

Search Strategy

Methodological standards established by the Cochrane Collaborative36 were followed in determining a prior search strategy, study selection procedures, data extraction, and synthesis approach. Four databases were searched (PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and CENTRAL) from inception to March 2019 using terms developed by two authors (SB &amp; NRP) and a librarian (SJ) in order to capture all articles related to mealtime interventions, malnutrition, and dementia (For MeSH terms, see Supplementary Table 1). The search strategy did not include dissertations or grey literature. A manual search of reference lists was performed on articles meeting inclusion.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Full-text articles were included if they reported on mealtime interventions and its effect on at least one nutritional outcome in persons with dementia. Dementia was broadly defined to include the following subtypes: Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body dementia, Vascular dementia, Parkinson’s dementia, Frontotemporal dementia, Huntington’s disease, mixed dementia, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Inclusion criteria for articles were the following: 1) persons with dementia; and 2) the outcome(s) for the study were objective measures of nutritional status and/or oral intake. No requirement was established regarding the methodology of diagnosing dementia, which could include a documented diagnosis in the medical chart. Exclusion criteria for articles were the following: 1) studies with a focus on end of life care; 2) qualitative methods/analyses; 3) geriatric populations without dementia, 4) enteral interventions and 5) non-English articles.

Data Extraction

Results from each database search were imported into EndNote software, where duplicate papers were removed. Two authors (JCB and SB) independently screened articles for potential inclusion based on titles and abstracts, assessed the eligibility of full-text articles, extracted relevant variables from articles meeting full-text inclusion, and performed quality assessments outlined below. A third author (NRP) resolved all disagreements that occurred in the screening, full-text review, extraction, or quality assessment process. The following information was extracted from articles meeting final inclusion: author, year, sample size, study design, study setting, type and severity of dementia, criteria to define dementia and cognition, age, gender, type of mealtime intervention, type of swallowing evaluation, nutritional outcome, and statistical and power analysis.

Assessment of Study Quality

All studies were reviewed through duplicate independent review using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool to appraise study quality.37 Criteria for quality assessment as outlined by Cochrane includes sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete data, and selective outcome reporting. Studies were appraised as either high, low, or unclear risk of bias.

RESULTS

Study Characteristics

The database search yielded 1,712 distinct articles. Thirty-two studies were determined to meet criteria. Thirty articles were retrieved directly from database searches38–67 and two were identified through manual search of citations68,69 (Fig. 1). Characteristics of study interventions, outcome measures, and results are detailed in Table 1. All but one study employed a prospective design, including 14 randomized controlled trials (Table 2). Sample size ranged from 6 to 1912 patients, and power analyses were reported in 8 studies. Given broad variation in interventions and outcomes, as well as a small number of studies in certain categories, a meta-analysis was conceptually and statistically infeasible.

Patient Characteristics

The majority of studies examined persons with Alzheimer’s disease.44,46–48,52,54–58,60,62,63,65–68 Studies predominantly relied on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)42,44,47,49,50,58,65,66 and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)43,53,57–59 for diagnosis of dementia. Additional diagnostic criteria, dementia diagnoses, and measures of cognition across studies are detailed in Table 3.

Assessment of Dysphagia

Twenty-three studies (66%) did not specify whether participants had clinical signs or a diagnosis of dysphagia.41,42,44–51,53–56,60,61,64,66–69 One study included a subset of individuals with dysphagia, but did not report diagnostic criteria.65 Seven studies excluded participants with dysphagia, defined as requiring modified food and liquids38,52,62,63 or speech pathology services39. Two studies excluded persons with dysphagia but did not specify operational definitions.40,59 Four studies excluded individuals with enteral or parental nutritional requirements.43,57,58 Riley and colleagues55 reported that a nutritional supplement reduced choking in one patient, whereas another patient did not exhibit improvements in the frequency of asphyxiation.

Nutritional Outcome Measurements

Twenty-nine studies (91%) considered oral intake or nutritional status as a primary study outcome38–40,42–48,50–57,59–69, as opposed to a secondary outcome.41,49,58 In studies examining nutritional status as a secondary outcome, primary outcomes included knowledge and behaviors of nursing assistants41, feeding ability49, and the functional level of residents.58 There was significant heterogeneity in nutritional outcomes across studies, as twenty-three studies (72%) included multiple nutritional outcomes. These included weight42–45,48,49,51,53,55–60,64,66,69, body mass index (BMI)43,45–51,53,54,58–64,66, blood assays43,45,46,48,53–55,57,59,60, body composition assessments43,45,46,48,53,54, oral intake38–41,44,48,49,51,52,54,60,62,63,65,67,68, the mini nutritional assessment (MNA)43,46,48–50,56–61, and vitamin levels determined through blood assays.43,45,46,54,57,59,60

Mealtime Interventions

Mealtime interventions were classified into one of five categories: feeding interventions, environmental modifications, oral supplementation, education of patient, family, and staff, and other pharmacologic/ecopsychological interventions (Table 4). One study53 separately assessed two intervention types (oral supplementation, education) and was included in both categories.

Patient, Caregiver, and Staff Education:

Five studies examined the efficacy of patient53,58, caregiver53,56,58, and staff39,41,58 education. The hypothesized mechanisms of action for these studies were related to increased knowledge and self-efficacy of patients, caregivers, or staff with education39,41,53,58, whereas one study targeted caregiver stress reduction.56 Improvements were evident in weight53,56, blood assays53, and self-report measures56,58, but not in body composition outcomes.53 Batchelor-Murphy et al.39 documented beneficial trends in oral intake, but did not perform statistical analyses due to low sample size. Intervention duration ranged from a forty-five minute session39 to nine sessions across twelve months.56 Two studies included patients with Alzheimer’s dementia56,58, whereas three studies did not specify dementia subtype.39,41,53

Environmental Modifications:

Four studies examined the efficacy of environmental modifications, including the introduction of music67 or an aquarium during mealtime44 to reduce behavioral symptoms, manipulating the visual contrast of cups and plates to improve the perceptual salience and discrimination of tableware68, and olfactory priming targeting non-conscious memory processes to stimulate appetite.65 Variability in hypothesized mechanisms of action was evident, including enhanced visual discrimination68, a calming environment targeting agitation reduction44,67, and increased food-related mental representations targeting appetite stimulation.65 Three studies reported oral intake44,67,68 and two examined weight.44,65 Improvements in both outcomes were evident across all studies, though Thomas &amp; Smith67 only reported mean trends and did not perform statistical analyses. Intervention duration ranged from four consecutive meals65 to eight weeks with a three month follow-up.44 All studies included patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s dementia.

Feeding Interventions:

Six studies examined feeding interventions, including hand-over-hand feeding techniques40, altering consumption methods of liquids with either a glass or straw38, shared mealtime with staff and residents42, and Montessori-based feeding activities with49,61 or without spaced retrieval50. Hypothesized mechanisms of action included increased compliance due to ease of consumption method38, increased patient autonomy during feeding40, increased mealtime interactions42, and targeting repetition priming and procedural memory during feeding.49,50,61 Four studies examined weight42,49,50,61, and three studies reported oral intake38,40,49 and/or self-report measures.49,50,61 Improvements were evident in two studies reporting weight42,61, two studies examining self-report measures49,61, and two studies on oral intake38,49. Intervention duration ranged from one week38 to six months42, and implementation of feeding strategies ranged from every meal38 to three times per week.49,50 Dementia subtype was unspecified across all studies.

Oral Supplementation:

Fifteen studies examined oral nutritional supplementation, specifically oral supplementation with45,60 or without43,46–48,51–55,62,63,69 staff education, or a whole formula diet.57 All studies examined weight as a primary outcome and improvements were reported in eight studies43,45,47,48,52,53,57,69. Hypothesized mechanisms of action were largely multi-factorial including disease-related metabolic alterations46,48, neuroplasticity47,54,70, and appetite regulation.52,62 The majority of studies reported improvements in oral intake48,52,60,62,63,70, blood assays43,46,48,53,55,57,60, and body composition outcomes.43,45,46,48,53 Six studies included self-report measures, two of which reported statistically significant improvements.43,48 Average intervention duration lasted 174 days, ranging from 2143,52,62,63 to 630 days.69 The majority of studies included individuals with Alzheimer’s dementia46–48,52,54,55,57,62,63,70, whereas one study also included Parkinson’s dementia, multi-infarct, and Korsakoff syndrome69, and two studies did not specify dementia subtype.43,53

Other Pharmacologic/Ecopsychological Interventions:

Three studies described pharmacologic and ecopsychological interventions that did not fit into the aforementioned categories. Interventions included acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy59, music therapy66, and a comprehensive preventative care model involving various intervention components such as nutritional supplements, weight control, eating support, medication review, oral health care, patient education, parenteral and nutritional support, and end of life care.64 Johansson and Christensson64 found improvements in body weight for patients who completed each step of an interdisciplinary and individualized preventative care process. McHugh and colleagues66 found no differences in oral intake between patients receiving vocal re-creative music therapy four times a week for three weeks compared to control patients. After 6 months, Soysal and Isik59 demonstrated improvements in some blood assay outcomes following acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy, but none were seen in weight, BMI, or self-report.

Assessment of Study Quality

According to criteria outlined in the Cochrane handbook37, most studies demonstrated high risk of bias due to blinding of either the participant (n = 21, 66%) or outcome measure (n = 25, 78%). Detailed risk of bias ratings is provided in Table 2.

DISCUSSION

In this comprehensive systematic review, we identified 32 articles examining various mealtime interventions to improve oral intake and nutritional outcomes in persons with dementia. Results revealed five broad categories: education, environmental modifications, feeding, oral supplementation, and other pharmacologic/ecopsychological interventions which were commonly comprised of pharmacotherapy, music therapy, or multi-factorial interventions involving several components of the aforementioned categories (e.g. feeding, education, oral supplementation). Though heterogenous with regard to study design, nutritional outcomes, and length of intervention, there is some evidence to suggest that these mealtime interventions are efficacious in improving malnutrition or oral intake in persons with dementia. The majority (n = 27, 84%) of studies reported a statistically significant improvement with at least one nutritional outcome. Among studies examining two or more nutritional outcomes (n = 23), 17 (74%) reported improvements in at least two outcomes and 8 (35%) in three or more outcomes.

Studies included a wide range of nutritional outcomes to define and quantify changes in malnutrition, including weight loss, oral intake, blood assays, and body composition assessments. A recent consensus report by the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition recommended at least one phenotypic (e.g. weight loss, low body mass index, reduced muscle mass) and one etiologic criteria (e.g. reduced food intake, inflammation or disease burden) to diagnose malnutrition.71 Nineteen (59%) studies included outcomes that adhere to this recommendation. Dehydration, a common fluid and electrolyte disorder among post-acute and long-term care residents72, was rarely examined across included studies and primarily included measures of liquid intake38,68 and relevant blood assays, such as hemoglobin.45,57,59 Our search terms did not include dehydration, which is a type of malnutrition that has been shown to affect persons with dementia. As a result, this may have excluded relevant studies.

There is moderate evidence to suggest that oral supplementation is efficacious in improving malnutrition in persons with dementia. This included three randomized controlled trials, though some degree of bias was evident in each study. All but one study showed improvements in at least one nutritional outcome. The effects of oral supplementation were most evident in weight and blood assay outcomes though the efficacy of oral supplementation likely varies as a function of many different factors including dementia subtype, disease severity, and psychosocial support. Despite these promising results, it is difficult to further assess related factors when prescribing oral supplementation given significant heterogeneity in the type and dosage of supplements, as well as the duration of supplementation. Future studies will be required to systematically examine the relative effects of these patient and intervention-related variables.

There appears to be preliminary evidence to suggest that some interventions targeting feeding, environmental modifications, and caregiver education demonstrate improvements in malnutrition and oral intake. Four of the six studies examining feeding interventions reported improvements in at least one nutritional outcome, most notably with oral intake. Feeding interventions such as shared mealtimes42, consumption of liquids in a glass38, and spaced retrieval combined with Montessori-based activities49,61 demonstrated promising preliminary benefits on nutritional status. Improvements in weight and oral intake were evident across all four studies addressing environmental modifications during the mealtime; however, the small number of studies with heterogeneous designs and small sample sizes warrants caution when interpreting and aggregating these results. Patient, family, or staff education alone appears to improve self-report of nutritional status, whereas outcomes of weight and oral intake showed mixed results. Interestingly, the only studies reporting improvements in objective nutritional outcomes provided education on both nutritional supplementation and management of behavioral symptoms during meals.53,56

Though the aforementioned intervention categories provide varying levels of evidence from diverse disciplines, such as nursing, nutrition, and speech pathology, a lack of interdisciplinary interventions addressing multiple mealtime domains was apparent. Only three studies included in this review examined interventions that integrated multiple domains of the mealtime experience.45,60,64 A Swedish national preventative care program incorporated nutritional supplementation, weight control, eating support, medication review, oral health, nutritional education, and end-of-life care64, and two studies integrated both oral supplementation and nutrition education.45,60 Though studies involving multiple domains are unable to elucidate the efficacy of domain-specific interventions, their ease of translation to clinical practice is greatly needed in this area of research.

This review identified several areas of improvement across studies that might inform future research. In order for findings to generalize to clinical practice, studies must diagnose and characterize dementia subtypes. Inadequate diagnostic methods were commonly employed, such as the MMSE, DSM, or medical charts, which alone are insufficient in diagnosing and characterizing dementia. For example, performing structural imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment is well supported by best-practice guidelines73,74. Thus, the external validity of included articles in this review is a limitation and prohibited examining the efficacy of interventions across different dementia subtypes or severities. In order to better elucidate the impact of interventions across the broad spectrum of Alzheimer’s and related dementias and identify potential modifiers of effectiveness, comprehensive and valid diagnostic assessments are required. Future studies must also appropriately evaluate and characterize swallowing impairments in this patient population when assessing the efficacy of a nutritional intervention. Dysphagia, often characterized by tongue weakness in this population, is highly correlated with both malnutrition and longer mealtime durations in residents of long-term care facilities.75 Furthermore, studies should incorporate instrumental swallowing evaluations, such as videofluoroscopic swallow studies or flexible endoscopic evaluations of swallowing, since bedside evaluations have not demonstrated adequate sensitivity for dysphagia detection.76

There are several limitations of this systematic review that should be acknowledged. Since our review focused solely on articles in English, we might have missed articles in other languages. Additionally, improvements in study outcomes was based solely on statistical significance. Studies that were underpowered and reported non-significant results might have been susceptible to commit a type two error. Furthermore, direct comparisons between studies via meta-analysis was infeasible due to significant heterogeneity in study outcomes.

Malnutrition is prevalent among persons with dementia with known detrimental effects on health outcomes. Individual studies in this review contain varying levels of evidence to suggest that interventions targeting aspects of the mealtime experience can improve nutritional outcomes in this patient population. Patients, caregivers, clinicians, and stakeholders can integrate this preliminary evidence into clinical practice. However, future large-scale, adequately powered interdisciplinary studies will be required to examine pragmatic interventions spanning multiple domains of the mealtime experience. These studies are needed to provide further guidance and evidence regarding the feasibility and efficacy of mealtime interventions across various disease stages and co-morbid conditions, which are insufficiently characterized in the existing literature.

CONCLUSION

This review evaluated the efficacy of mealtime interventions to improve malnutrition or oral intake in persons with dementia. We found moderate evidence to suggest the efficacy of oral supplementation to improve nutritional outcomes, though future studies are required to better understand the optimal dosage, duration of supplementation, and effect modifiers on dementia subtypes and severities. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that some interventions targeting feeding, environmental modifications, and education might demonstrate improvements in malnutrition and oral intake. Findings from this review serve as a concise summary of the state of the literature for both clinicians and researchers. Future interdisciplinary studies are paramount to addressing the impact of malnutrition in persons with dementia and understanding the efficacy of pragmatic mealtime interventions.
