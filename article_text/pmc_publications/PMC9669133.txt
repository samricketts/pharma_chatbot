pmcLewy body dementia (LBD) is a clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, fluctuating mental status, and REM sleep behavior disorder1,2. LBD lies along a spectrum between Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, and recent evidence suggests that the genetic architectures of these age-related syndromes are intersecting3.

Numerous investigations into the role of amyloid precursor protein (APP) pathway genes have implicated an intracellular transmembrane protein, sortilin-related receptor 1 (encoded by the SORL1 gene), to be associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Pathogenic loss-of-function and missense mutations in SORL1 have been postulated to affect APP shuttling between the trans-Golgi network and early endosomes, leading to disease4. Interestingly, several studies have also found rare SORL1 mutations in patients with Alzheimer’s disease with concomitant LBD, suggesting that SORL1 may be a pleiotropic risk gene4–6. Here, we assessed the possible association of SORL1 variants with risk for LBD.

We used our previously published whole-genome sequencing data generated on 2,591 European-ancestry LBD patients and 4,027 neurologically healthy individuals3, which has good coverage of the SORL1 gene (mean coverage 38x, range=22x–83x). Patients with LBD included in this dataset were diagnosed with pathologically definite or clinically probable disease according to consensus criteria.1,3 Controls were selected based on a lack of evidence of cognitive decline in their clinical history and absence of neurological deficits on neurological examination. We first reviewed a common SORL1 risk variant for Alzheimer’s disease (rs74685827) in our previous LBD GWAS data,3 which found no association (beta=0.02, standard error=0.14, p-value=0.90). Next, we extracted 6,617 rare variants in SORL1 (minor allele frequency ≤0.01 in the European, non-Finnish population; Supplementary Table 1) and annotated them with variant effect predictor7, then filtered the data to only include loss-of-function and missense mutations. This step identified 167 variants on which we performed a gene burden analysis using SKAT-O, as implemented in RVTests (v.2.1.0)8. The model included age, sex, and four principal components as covariates. We also explored the rare single-variant association tests for each observed missense and loss-of-function mutation using Fisher’s exact tests, as implemented in PLINK (v.1.9) (Supplementary Table 2).

Our gene burden analysis did not identify a significant association of rare damaging variants with an increased risk of developing LBD (SKAT-O p-value=0.24). Additionally, none of the single-variant associations were significant after correction for multiple testing (Supplementary Table 2). We observed eight missense mutations that have been previously described in patients with mixed dementias4–6. However, these mutations were either found in cases and controls or were more frequent in controls. None of these variants were nominally associated with disease (Table 1). Furthermore, a recent report examining SORL1 mutations in a large Greek family with Parkinson’s disease, Parkinson’s disease dementia and mixed dementia reported a rare missense variant (p.G379W) segregating with disease6. We observed the same mutation in one LBD patient of Greek ancestry. From our data, we cannot conclude that this mutation is disease-causing or simply a variant present in the Greek population.

In summary, we did not find a significant enrichment of rare, damaging SORL1 mutations in our well-powered LBD cohort. Our dataset is, to our knowledge, the largest genome-sequence cohort in this understudied disease. While it is possible that an association was missed due to allelic heterogeneity, our findings indicate that caution should be exercised when interpreting SORL1 mutations in LBD, as current evidence does not conclusively support an association with disease risk.
