Research on the relationship between normal-range personality and cognitive aging has demonstrated consistent, modest effects. The current investigation increases our understanding of unhealthy cognitive aging by testing whether personality disorders (PD), specifically borderline, avoidant, and obsessive-compulsive PD, show prospective associations with the onset of cognitive problems. Interpersonal stressful life events and social support were expected to mediate these relationships. The current investigation used data from two longitudinal studies of older adulthood: the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center cohort (ADRC, N = 434, Mage = 69.95, 56% women) and the St. Louis Personality and Aging Network study (SPAN, N = 1,058, Mage = 65.92, 54% women). The ADRC study administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to assess cognitive ability/memory. Borderline PD was measured with a composite from the NEO Five Factor Inventory. The SPAN study administered self-, informant, and interview measures of the three PDs, a free recall task, and an informant report measure of cognitive problems. Borderline PD features exhibited cross-sectional correlations with memory (ADRC: r = −.11; SPAN: all rs = −.08), general cognitive ability (ADRC: r = −.11), and informant-reported cognitive problems (rs ranged from .15 to .39). Most importantly, BPD features predicted an increase in informant-reported cognitive problems in SPAN participants (Std. bs = .13 and .15) over a 2-year period, but they did not predict a deterioration in the performance-based cognitive measures in either study. Avoidant and obsessive-compulsive PD exhibited little association with cognitive aging. Neither interpersonal variable mediated any of these effects.

pmcResearch has uncovered a personality profile associated with poor cognitive health in later life: low conscientiousness and high neuroticism (Best et al., 2020; Curtis et al., 2015; Duchek et al., 2007, 2019; Low et al., 2013; Luchetti et al., 2016; Terracciano et al., 2014). The effects of this profile are modest. At the same time, known risk factors for cognitive decline do not fully account for the variance attributable to personality traits (Terracciano et al., 2017). Despite the fact that this normal-range trait profile is characteristic of several personality disorders (Samuel &amp; Widiger, 2008), few studies have examined the links between personality pathology and cognitive decline. Those that have are cross-sectional and limited in scope (Cruitt &amp; Oltmanns, 2018; Dondu et al., 2015; Henriques-Calado &amp; Duarte-Silva, 2019; Nicholas et al., 2010; Pilleron et al., 2015; Prior et al., 2016). Personality pathology contributes unique variance beyond the Big Five traits to predicting later life outcomes (Gleason et al., 2014). Furthermore, the focus in the clinical literature on exploring potential therapeutic targets offers insight into the mechanisms that may be at play in the relationship between personality and cognitive aging. Therefore, incorporating personality pathology into predictive models of cognitive aging may improve the detection of at-risk individuals while also facilitating the identification of potential mediators.

Much of the previous research on personality pathology and cognitive aging has examined dementia diagnoses or declines in global cognitive abilities. Cognitive aging is not a unitary phenomenon, however, and specific cognitive abilities show different trajectories in both healthy and pathological aging (Karr et al., 2018; Salthouse, 2018). For example, declines in verbal memory appear to begin prior to the onset of impairment in abilities such as visuospatial processing or executive functioning. Therefore, it is important to study the relationship between personality pathology and changes in particular cognitive abilities, such as memory, that for many individuals serve as early symptoms of cognitive decline. The current investigation expands upon the current literature by exploring the prospective relationship between personality pathology and global cognitive ability (or cognitive problems) as well as its prospective relationship with the specific domain of memory.

Personality Pathology and Cognitive Aging

Among the six PD types that are represented by hybrid models in Section III of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association, 2013), borderline personality disorder (BPD) is the most promising candidate for exploring the role of personality pathology in cognitive aging. When viewed as a dimensional profile, BPD represents the same high negative affectivity/neuroticism, high disinhibition (low conscientiousness) pattern that has previously been associated with declines in cognitive health. The literature also indicates that BPD symptoms demonstrate negative health effects across the lifespan (see Dixon-Gordon et al., 2015 for a review). These negative consequences may extend to cognitive decline. One previous study reported higher rates of current and retrospectively-reported premorbid BPD in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Henriques-Calado &amp; Duarte-Silva, 2019). This study also found that current Cluster B PD features, which include BPD, contributed unique variance to the prediction of AD diagnosis when controlling for age, cognitive ability, and other PD features. Another study found that BPD features assessed from multiple sources contribute unique variance to the prediction of observer-rated cognitive problems, after controlling for other PDs (Cruitt &amp; Oltmanns, 2018). These findings suggest that BPD is an important construct to consider when examining longitudinal associations between personality and cognitive aging.

It is also important to recognize, however, that BPD is not the only PD characterized by high negative affectivity/neuroticism. Examining PDs characterized primarily by anxiety, such as avoidant PD (AVPD) and obsessive-compulsive PD (OCPD), may provide additional insight into the mechanisms linking personality and cognitive decline. Anxiety/stress reactivity seems to be the specific component of neuroticism that drives the association with cognitive decline (Wilson, et al., 2011). Clinical manifestations of anxiety are associated with chronic inflammation (Renna et al., 2018), which in turn predicts increased rates of cognitive decline (Bradburn, et al., 2018; Dziedzic, 2006; Swardfager et al., 2010). If anxiety is a primary contributor to unhealthy cognitive aging, we might expect individuals with high levels of AVPD or OCPD features to show similar associations with cognitive decline as those with BPD features. In fact, there is some evidence that retrospective OCPD diagnoses are more prevalent in AD patients, although the findings in the literature are mixed (Dondu et al., 2015; Henriques-Calado &amp; Duarte-Silva, 2019; Nicholas et al., 2010). On the other hand, if BPD stands alone in its association with cognitive decline, the culprit may more likely be disinhibited behavioral strategies for coping with the broad spectrum of negative emotions. In particular, increased risk taking and decreased engagement in health-promoting behaviors characteristic of BPD and not AVPD or OCPD (which is associated with precisely the opposite) would be potential mechanisms by which personality predicts higher rates of cognitive decline.

The Role of Interpersonal Stress

Although completely disentangling these possible pathways is beyond the scope of the present analyses, one mechanism of particular interest is impairments in interpersonal functioning. Longitudinal evidence indicates that stressful life events (SLEs), including interpersonal SLEs, predict risk for dementia later in life (Johansson et al., 2013). The frequency of negative social interactions is associated with risk for development of mild cognitive impairment and more rapid declines in memory (Wilson et al., 2015). Just as interpersonal stress is harmful for cognitive health, positive interpersonal functioning is protective against cognitive decline. For example, high levels of perceived social support are related to better cognitive maintenance over time (Seeman et al., 2001). Personality pathology is closely related to both aspects of interpersonal functioning. The social networks of individuals with higher levels of BPD features are characterized by greater frequency of negative interactions and poorer social support (Beeney et al., 2018). Furthermore, BPD features prospectively predict increased rates of interpersonally-oriented, dependent SLEs (Conway et al., 2018; Gleason et al., 2012; Powers et al., 2013). AVPD also has a negative impact on interpersonal functioning, but the process is quite different. AVPD is associated with lower social support, but it does not predict increased rates of interpersonal SLEs (Wilberg et al., 2009). Overall, this evidence suggests that interpersonal stress may play a mediating role in the relationship between personality pathology and cognitive aging.

The Current Investigation

Given the clear intersection of personality pathology, interpersonal functioning, and cognitive decline, it is unfortunate that there is an obvious dearth of research examining all three constructs. This gap in the literature may be due, in part, to the challenges associated with assessing personality pathology and cognitive decline in later life. Assessments for both domains are time and effort intensive, and both benefit from considering multiple sources of information. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by integrating findings across two longitudinal datasets of community-dwelling older adults. The Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) in St. Louis has cultivated a pool of participants with detailed cognitive assessments at multiple time points. already contributed meaningfully to our understanding of the relationship between normal-range personality and cognitive decline (Duchek et al., 2007, 2019; Schultz et al., 2017). Meanwhile, the St. Louis Personality and Aging Network (SPAN) is the first major, longitudinal study to examine personality pathology as assessed from multiple different perspectives (self, informant, and interview) in community-dwelling older adults (Oltmanns et al., 2014). Analyses using data from both of these datasets have already contributed meaningfully to our understanding of the relationship between normal-range personality and cognitive decline (Best et al., 2020; Duchek et al., 2007, 2019; Schultz et al., 2017), and they represent two sides of the same coin. The ADRC dataset has comprehensive assessments of cognitive aging coupled with a brief self- and informant report personality inventory (from which a BPD composite can be drawn), whereas SPAN has extensive interview, self- and informant report personality measures and two brief screening instruments for cognitive decline. By comparing findings across these two longitudinal datasets, the current study is able to draw more robust conclusions about the relationship between personality pathology and cognitive aging than would be possible by examining either dataset in isolation.

Specific hypotheses for the current investigation were preregistered at https://osf.io/62d9u/?view_only=9e1d4e6603b6466391224df07a1a38ff. In summary, we predicted that BPD features would show cross-sectional and prospective associations with performance-based measures of episodic memory and general cognitive ability as well as informant-reported cognitive problems in the ADRC and SPAN samples. We also made predictions regarding AVPD and OCPD, in line with the idea that both anxious arousal and disinhibited behaviors are partly responsible for increased rates of cognitive decline. As such, we predicted that AVPD symptoms would show similar associations with cognitive decline as BPD, whereas OCPD symptoms would be unrelated (due to increased behavioral constraint offsetting the negative effects of anxiety). Finally, we predicted that interpersonal stressful life events and lower levels of perceived social support would mediate the relationships between PD features and impairments involved in cognitive aging.

Method

Participants

Both samples used in the current investigation were recruited from the St. Louis metropolitan area. The ADRC sample initially consisted of 1,211 adults (56% women; aged 30 to 101, M = 69.95). Of these, 434 participants had personality data and neuropsychological data at one time point (ADRC Time 1), and 424 had neuropsychological data for at least one time point afterward (ADRC Time 2). On average, these waves were collected 1.8 years apart. As for the SPAN sample, data for the current analyses come primarily from the third and fourth in-lab assessments (SPAN Time 1 and SPAN Time 3), which occurred on average 2.3 years apart. The current investigation also used a perceived social support measure administered during an at-home wave that occurred mid-way between the other two waves (SPAN Time 2). Out of 1,630 participants at the initial assessment, 1,058 participated at SPAN Time 1 (54% women; aged 60 to 73, M = 65.92). Of these participants, 974 had relevant data from SPAN Time 3 for the free recall analyses, and 424 had data for the analyses with informant reported cognitive problems. Both studies had their procedures approved as being in accordance with ethical guidelines by the relevant institutional review board.

Descriptive statistics for the personality and cognitive aging measures in both samples can be found in Table S1 and S2 in supplemental material.

ADRC Measures

NEO Five-Factor Inventory (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992).

A short form of the 240-item NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R), the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO FFI) consists of 60 items assessing the five domains of the five-factor model (FFM). Both self- and informant report versions were administered in the ADRC study. Few et al. (2016) developed a 24-item BPD composite score (FFI-BPD), for use as a proxy of personality pathology when conducting secondary analyses on existing datasets. Self- and informant reported FFI-BPD scores were correlated, r(393) = .40, 95% CI [.31, .48].

Clinical Dementia Rating (Morris, 1993).

The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) was developed to adequately capture the full range of dementia severity using behavioral and psychometric data. A CDR score is assigned to participants on the basis of an approximately 90-minute interview procedure that obtains independent information from the participant and a close other. Out of the 434 participants at ADRC Time 1, 58 (13.4%) had a CDR score of 0.5 (very mild dementia), with the remaining participants having a score of 0 (no dementia). At ADRC Time 2, 12.3% (n = 52) had a CDR score of 0.5 and 1.2% (n = 5) had a score of 1, with the rest again receiving a score of 0.

Free recall (Grober et al., 1988).

The ADRC study used the free recall portion of the selective reminding task to measure episodic memory performance. Participants were presented with pictures of 16 items alongside a category cue word and engaged in three recall trials that assessed both free and cued recall. The free recall scores represent the total number of items recalled across all three free recall portions of the task, with an absolute range of 0 to 48.

General Cognitive Composite.

A general cognitive composite was obtained by averaging z-scores across the selective reminding (including both free recall and total recall), animal naming (Goodglass &amp; Kaplan, 1983), and trails A and B tasks (Armitage, 1946). These measures were selected because they provided good coverage of memory, verbal fluency, processing speed and executive functioning abilities. Trails A and B were negatively weighted in the composite, as higher scores on these tasks indicate greater impairment.

SPAN Measures

NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992).

The full 240-item NEO PI-R used in the current analyses was administered at the first wave of data collection, using both self- (Form S) and informant (Form R) report versions. The FFI-BPD composite was calculated for comparison purposes with the ADRC sample. Self- and informant report were correlated r(838) = .41, 95% CI [.35, .46].

Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality (Pfohl et al., 1997).

The Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality (SIDP-IV) is an 80-item diagnostic interview for PDs contained in the fourth and fifth editions of the DSM (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Trained graduate students, research staff and advanced undergraduate students administered the SIDP-IV at SPAN Time 1. Interviewers were trained to phrase probe questions to be relevant for later life. Mean scores for each of the specific PD diagnoses (BPD, AVPD, and OCPD) were calculated. Interrater reliability was calculated at the baseline assessment of the SPAN study by having independent raters watch a randomly selected subsample of 265 interviews. One-way random, average measures intraclass correlation coefficient for the BPD, AVPD, and OCPD scores at baseline were .77, .86, and .62, respectively.

Multisource Assessment of Personality Pathology (Oltmanns &amp; Turkheimer, 2006).

The Multisource Assessment of Personality Pathology (MAPP) is also an 80-item measure of the PD features described in the DSM, translated into lay terms and administered in both self- and informant report versions. The MAPP data used in the current analyses were obtained at SPAN Time 1. We calculated composite scores for each relevant PD.

The Ascertain Dementia Eight-Item Informant Questionnaire (Galvin et al., 2005).

The AD8 is a screening instrument for cognitive decline that assesses informant reported problems due to changes in cognition over the last several years. Each of the eight items has three response options: “YES, a change,” “NO, no change,” or “N/A, Don’t know.” A total score of cognitive change is obtained by summing “YES” responses. In a community sample, a cutoff of two or more demonstrated 85% sensitivity and 86% specificity in discriminating between individuals with a CDR of 0 and those who scored 0.5 or greater (Galvin et al., 2005). Out of the 842 participants with AD8 data at SPAN Time 1, 120 (14.25%) received a score of two or more.

Immediate free recall.

Immediate free recall was tested in the SPAN sample using lists of sixteen, verbally presented words. Word lists were selected from a set of six, which were previously developed for use in a study on dementia. Participants received different lists at consecutive waves. Lists were balanced with each other in terms of word length, frequency, and concreteness. Administrators provided the words at a three-second presentation rate and gave the participants two minutes for recall. Scores represent the number of words recalled, with an absolute range from 0 to 16.

List of Threatening Experiences Questionnaire (Brugha et al., 1985).

The List of Threatening Experiences Questionnaire (LTE) assesses the occurrence of twelve life events that are associated with negative long-term outcomes. At SPAN Time 3, trained interviewers asked whether the participant experienced each item in the last six months. Separately, the interviewers asked about the time period since the date of the participant’s last in-lab follow-up (for the purposes of the current analyses, SPAN Time 1), excluding the last six months (Mean duration = 19.80 months, SD = 8.26, Range = 3–106).1 Interviewers asked probe questions to ensure that the event actually occurred to the participant personally, in the appropriate time frame, and was a major event. Interpersonal SLEs consisted of separation due to marital difficulties, breaking off a steady relationship, and serious problem or conflict with a close other (Powers et al., 2013). Of the 424 participants who had complete data for the mediation analyses using the LTE-Q, 16.27% (n = 69) reported at least one interpersonal SLE. Participants reported a total of 61 conflicts with a close other, 16 break ups, and 3 separations due to marital difficulties. Due to the highly skewed nature of the data, interpersonal SLEs were coded either as present (1) or absent (0).

Quality of Relationship Inventory (Pierce et al., 1991).

At SPAN Time 2, participants completed the seven-item general support subscale of the Quality of Relationship Inventory (QRI). Items on this subscale assess perceptions of support from relationships other than a person’s spouse or partner. Composite scores for the QRI general support subscale ranged from 1 to 4 (M = 3.14, SD = 0.69). Cronbach’s alpha for the subscale was .92.

Data Analytic Plan

All analyses were conducted in R. Excluding the correlational analyses, we planned to run 19 confirmatory statistical tests.2 As such, we adopted a conservative Bonferroni corrected alpha threshold of p &lt; .003. All regression models included initial levels of the cognitive outcome, gender, initial age, and education as covariates. To test the mediation models, we performed path analyses using the lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012). For the path analyses we used a bootstrapping procedure to obtain an estimate for the indirect pathway, with the number of iterations set to 5000.

To reduce the number of comparison tests, we conducted principal components analyses on the self- and informant reported FFI-BPD scores to obtain a single factor score. First, we imputed missing data for one source based on the participant’s score on the other using the missMDA package (Josse &amp; Husson, 2016).3 We then submitted these variables to a principal components analysis using the FactoMineR package (Le et al., 2008). We expected that the measures would demonstrate a large shared component as well as a source-specific dimension, so we determined that we would use a single latent factor score if it accounted for at least 60% of the variance in the measures and no more than two dimensions received eigenvalues of greater than 1. If a single factor failed to emerge, tests were to be run with both the self- and informant reported FFI-BPD separately, and the focus of the interpretation would be on those findings that are consistent across both measures. We used the same procedure on the self, informant and interview BPD, AVPD, and OCPD measures in the SPAN sample, again planning to run analyses with each measure separately if a single dimension failed to meet our a priori criteria.

Results

ADRC results

First, self- and informant report FFI-BPD scores were submitted to a principal components analysis. This analysis yielded two dimensions with eigenvalues of 1.38 and 0.62, respectively. The first dimension accounted for 69.16% of the variance. As such, we proceeded to use the resulting latent factor scores for all analyses. The FFI-BPD factor score had a range of −2.66 to 4.18 (M = 0.00, SD = 1.18).

The FFI-BPD factor exhibited the expected negative associations with free recall and the general cognitive composite, although the effects were weak, both r(427) = −.11, 95% CI [−.20, −.01]. Consistent with our hypothesis, the FFI-BPD discriminated between those with a CDR score of 0 (M = −0.10) and those with a 0.5 (M = 0.62, t [72.84] = −4.14, p &lt; .001).

Next, we ran a linear regression model predicting residualized change in free recall and general cognition from FFI-BPD factor scores. All variables except for gender were standardized for ease of interpretation. Contrary to hypotheses, FFI-BPD factor scores did not contribute unique variance to the prediction of either outcome at ADRC Time 2 (Table 1).

SPAN Results

Next, we sought to replicate and extend the findings from the ADRC sample in the SPAN sample. The self- and informant report FFI-BPD scores were submitted to a principal components analysis. Eigenvalues for the first two factors were 1.47 and 0.53, and the first factor accounted for 73.32% of the variance in the measures. As such, we used the latent factor score as our predictor. Factor scores in the SPAN sample ranged from −4.20 to 7.30 (M = 0, SD = 1.16).

Cross-sectional correlations between the SPAN PD measures and cognitive aging outcomes are presented in Table 2. Consistent with our hypotheses and the results from the ADRC sample, FFI-BPD factor scores at SPAN Time 1 showed a weak, negative association with performance on the immediate free recall task, r(1002) = −.08, 95% CI [−.14, −.02], and a moderate, positive association with informant reported cognitive problems on the AD8, r(701) = .33, 95% CI [.26, .40]. Surprisingly, the correlation between AD8 scores and recall was weak and the 95% confidence interval included zero, r(661) = −.07, 95% CI [−.14, .01].

As with the ADRC analyses, we ran linear regression models predicting residualized change in informant reported cognitive problems and immediate free recall from FFI-BPD factor scores, baseline age, years of education, and gender (as before, all variables were standardized except for gender). The results for these models are found in Table 3. FFI-BPD factor scores showed no effect on change in free recall performance, Std. b = −0.03, 95% CI [−0.08, 0.02]. The results regarding informant reported cognitive problems as measured by the AD8 were in the expected direction, with higher FFI-BPD factor scores predicting increased AD8 scores at SPAN Time 3, Std. b = 0.07, 95% CI [0.01, 0.13]. However, the effect was weak and failed to reach the corrected statistical significance threshold of p &lt; .003.

The next step was to determine if the borderline, avoidant, and obsessive-compulsive PD scales obtained from self-report, informant report and structured interview could each be characterized by a single latent dimension. All three PDs met our first a priori criterion, with only one dimension exhibiting an eigenvalue greater than one. However, these dimensions accounted for between 52.68% (OCPD) and 57.37% (AVPD) of the variance in the measures, failing to reach the 60% threshold. Therefore, we ran all analyses with each individual measure separately.

Starting with the BPD symptom measures, we first examined the cross-sectional correlations with free recall and cognitive problems (Table 2). Just like the FFI-BPD, self-, informant and interview BPD symptom measures were all cross-sectionally correlated −0.08 with free recall at SPAN Time 1 (df = 979, 790, 992; 95% CIs [−.14, −.02], [−.15, −.01], [−.14, −.02], respectively). Next, we ran linear regression models predicting immediate free recall at SPAN Time 3, controlling for covariates and free recall performance at SPAN Time 1. As with the analysis predicting cognitive problems from FFI-BPD factor scores, the direction of the effect for self-report and interview BPD symptom scores was in the expected direction (Table S3). Higher scores on these instruments were associated with decreased performance on the free recall task (Both std. bs = −0.06, 95% CIs [−0.12, 0.00]), although once again this effect was weak and did not rise to the level of statistical significance. The effect for informant report symptoms was essentially zero (Std. b = −0.01, 95% CI [−0.08, 0.05]).

However, the analyses with informant reported cognitive problems as the outcome of interest told a different story. BPD symptom measures showed weak to moderate positive correlations with AD8 scores at SPAN Time 1: self-report, r(689) = .15, 95% CI [.08, .23]; informant report, r(695) = .39, 95% CI [.33, .45]; interview, r(692) = .26, 95% CI [.19, .33]. Furthermore, both self- and informant reported BPD symptoms predicted increases in cognitive problems over time (Table 4). For each one standard deviation increase in self- and informant reported BPD symptoms at SPAN Time 1, AD8 scores were expected to increase by 0.15 (95% CI [0.06, 0.24]) and 0.13 (95% CI [0.05, 0.22]) standard deviations, respectively. Conversely, the same analysis using the interview measure of BPD symptoms as the predictor found no effect (Std. b = 0.07, 95% CI [−0.01, 0.15]). Nevertheless, the results on the whole do identify a significant relationship between BPD symptoms and informant reported cognitive problems.

In contrast with the BPD findings, the AVPD symptom measures showed near-zero cross-sectional correlations with free recall at SPAN Time 1: self-report, r(979) = .02, 95% CI [−.04, .08]; informant report, r(787) = −.03, 95% CI [−.10, .04]; interview, r(992) = −.03, 95% CI [−.10, .03]. Given the lack of zero-order correlations at SPAN Time 1, it is unsurprising that the results of the linear regression models do not support our hypothesis that AVPD would predict change in free recall performance (Table S4). Similarly, AD8 scores at SPAN Time 1 were uncorrelated with AVPD symptoms as measured by self-report, r(689) = .05, 95% CI [−.03, .12], and interview, r(692) = .02, 95% CI [−.06, .09]. Informant reported AVPD symptoms did show the expected correlation with AD8 scores, r(692) = .28, 95% CI [.21, .34]. In terms of predicting residualized change in cognitive problems, self-reported and informant reported AVPD symptoms demonstrated positive, but non-significant, associations with increased cognitive problems, whereas interview based AVPD symptoms showed no association (Table S5).

Finally, we examined the relationship between OCPD symptoms and the cognitive measures. As predicted, self-reported OCPD symptoms, r(979) = −.01, 95% CI [−.07, .06], and informant reported OCPD symptoms, r(792) = −.02, 95% CI [−.09, .05], showed no association with free recall at SPAN Time 1. Interview reported OCPD symptoms, on the other hand, exhibited a weak, negative correlation, r(992) = −.09, 95% CI [−.16, −.03], similar in magnitude to the correlations between the BPD symptom measures and free recall performance. None of the OCPD measures predicted residualized change in free recall between SPAN Time 1 and Time 3 (S6). Informant reported cognitive problems exhibited a weak, positive correlations with OCPD symptoms as assessed using informant report, r(697) = .18, 95% CI [.11, .25], and interview, r(692) = .08, 95% CI [.01, .15], but a near-zero correlation with self-report OCPD symptoms, r(689) = 0.04, 95% CI [−0.03, 0.11]. Contrary to expectations, informant reported OCPD symptoms did predict change in cognitive problems over time (Table 5). For each one standard deviation increase in informant reported OCPD symptoms, AD8 scores at SPAN Time 3 were expected to increase by 0.14 standard deviations (95% CI [0.06, 0.21]). Neither self-report nor interview showed the same effect.

Mediation Results

Once the relationships between personality pathology and cognitive aging outcomes had been established, the next step was to examine the potential role of interpersonal stress measures in mediating those relationships. As with the regression models, all variables were standardized before running each model, with the exception of gender and presence/absence of interpersonal stressful life events. Given that BPD and AVPD symptoms did not predict change in free recall, it is unsurprising that no mediating effects were found through interpersonal stressful life events or perceived social support with regard to that outcome.

Results for the planned path analyses with informant reported cognitive problems as the outcome are presented in Table S7. There was no indirect effect of BPD symptoms as measured using either of these sources on cognitive problems through interpersonal stressful life events (self-report: ab = −0.00, 95% CI [−0.02, 0.01]; informant report: ab = −0.01, 95% CI [−0.04, 0.01]). Neither was there an indirect effect of self- or informant report BPD symptoms on cognitive problems through perceived social support (self-report: ab = 0.01, 95% CI [−0.00, 0.03]; informant report: ab = 0.01, 95% CI [−0.00, 0.03]). We also conducted an exploratory test of whether the interpersonal stress measures mediated the relationship between informant reported OCPD symptoms and cognitive problems. Again, there was no mediation effect through interpersonal stressful life events, ab = −0.00, 95% CI [−0.01, 0.00], or perceived social support, ab = 0.01, 95% CI [−0.00, 0.02]. As would be expected given the results of the earlier regression analyses, none of the other PD variables showed an indirect effect on cognitive problems through interpersonal stressful life events or perceived social support.

Discussion

The current results meaningfully advanced our understanding of the relationship between personality pathology and cognitive aging, providing support for some of our hypotheses. BPD features showed modest cross-sectional associations with poorer memory performance, worse overall cognitive ability, higher clinical dementia stage, and more informant reported problems due to changes in cognitive ability in both the ADRC and SPAN samples. Perhaps most important is the finding that self- and informant report measures of BPD symptoms predicted changes in informant reported cognitive problems over time in the SPAN sample. Contrary to our hypotheses, BPD features did not show a prospective relationship with changes in performance-based measures of memory or general cognitive ability.

We considered two additional forms of personality pathology that, like BPD, are also associated with high neuroticism. Avoidant PD was for the most part unrelated to the cognitive aging outcomes. Obsessive Compulsive PD did show some small associations with cognitive problems. In general, AVPD and OCPD did not exhibit a prospective relationship with either decline in free recall or the onset of cognitive problems. The one exception in this regard was that informant reported OCPD symptoms predicted increased informant-reported cognitive problems. The overall pattern of findings suggest that chronic anxiety alone may not be the primary driver of the relationship between personality and cognitive decline. Rather, it is likely that disinhibited behaviors play an important role. Future work would benefit from examining this possibility further, exploring specific facets of clinical trait domains in relation to cognitive aging and health behaviors as possible mediators of these relationships.

The current investigation did aim to explore one potential mechanism through which personality pathology may contribute to the onset or maintenance of cognitive decline. We focused on two social constructs that are related to personality pathology: interpersonal stress (which might contribute to increased inflammation and neuropathology) and perceived social support (which might buffer the person against a variety of factors that can increase risk, such as poor health behaviors, decreased access to medical care, and loneliness). The current findings uncovered no evidence to support the role that these factors might play in linking personality pathology to problems in cognitive aging. Put another way, the observed direct relationships between personality pathology and changes in cognitive problems were largely preserved when accounting for interpersonal functioning. This is consistent with previous literature suggesting that the effect of normal-range personality risk is not accounted for by biomarkers, physical activity, or other indicators of physical health (e.g., obesity; Terracciano et al., 2017). Of course, these null results do not suggest that social factors are not involved in the link between personality and poor cognitive outcomes in later life. Rather, the current analyses did not detect such an effect over a two-year time course using the specific measures that we chose to examine. Future research with these samples and in other research studies will determine whether this was a sufficiently long follow-up period to observe such an effect. Other ways of defining and measuring potential social mediators must also be considered. For example, our measure of interpersonal stress was rather narrow, focused on a few of the items that are included in the List of Threatening Experiences (e.g., divorce). With regard to perceived social support, it may be that other related constructs, such as social engagement and loneliness, may provide additional leverage on this topic. Given that no one mechanism or factor is responsible for individual differences in cognitive aging (see e.g., Smith, 2016), it is important to consider multiple mechanisms that stand to improve our understanding of how people differ in their trajectories of cognitive functioning across older adulthood.

Contributions to the Field

Comparing findings across two datasets with varying degrees of granularity in the assessment of personality pathology and cognitive ability, our results offer a clearer understanding of this relationship than either study would provide on its own. In particular, the current investigation provides three major contributions to the field. First, the current analyses indicate that BPD features are associated with cognitive ability in later life, and they prospectively predict an increase in informant reported cognitive problems. These findings add to the growing recognition that BPD features, though less prevalent in later life, continue to exert a meaningful, negative impact on aging-related health and well-being outcomes (Beatson et al., 2016; Rosowsky &amp; Gurian, 1992). Of note, the prospective effect of BPD features on cognitive problems was not found when BPD was measured using the NEO FFI. Items in the FFI were written to capture the adaptive range of personality traits, and it seems quite likely that clinical indicators of BPD capture additional information that is relevant to understanding cognitive difficulties in later life.

We also did not find a significant prospective association between BPD features and change in neuropsychological assessments of memory. This result contrasts with our results with the AD8. The inconsistency across measures seems to suggest that the informants – people who interacted closely with the participants on a regular basis -- were able to observe early signs of cognitive impairments in complex daily tasks that were not yet reflected in the performance of explicit tests of memory. For example, a spouse or child would likely notice that an individual is struggling to prepare a complicated meal or follow multi-step directions to a new location before that individual begins to show meaningful changes in their ability to remember a list of words. The inconsistent results in the current analyses suggest that future research would benefit from exploring what specific behaviors lead informants to report cognitive changes on an instrument such as the AD8 (e.g., what specific instances are informants thinking of when they say that a patient has a change in “problems with judgment”). This line of research could guide further exploration of how clinical features of BPD may yield important information about cognitive difficulties at the level of everyday tasks.

Second, the current investigation helps to identify the boundaries of the relationship between personality pathology and cognitive aging. For example, we found no evidence in either sample of a prospective relationship between personality pathology and neuropsychological measures of cognitive ability and memory over a period of approximately two years. Much of the previous work that used explicit measures of personality pathology has been cross-sectional in nature or asked for retrospective reports of participants’ premorbid personality (Cruitt &amp; Oltmanns, 2018; Dondu et al., 2015; Henriques-Calado &amp; Duarte-Silva, 2019; Nicholas et al., 2010; Pilleron et al., 2015; Prior et al., 2016). These methods may overestimate the predictive utility of personality pathology for understanding decline in discrete cognitive abilities. At the same time, the follow-up period in question was relatively short compared to other longitudinal studies (Curtis et al., 2015).

Third, the current investigation provides an important methodological contribution to the field by once again confirming that the source of personality information matters (Cruitt &amp; Oltmanns, 2018). For example, BPD features as assessed by semi-structured diagnostic interviews failed to show the same prospective impact on cognitive problems as was evident when these symptoms were assessed using self- and informant report. Interview data may be more conservative and therefore provide more information at higher levels of dysfunction than is typically found in community samples of participants. Further evidence that the source of information about personality pathology matters comes from our findings with regard to features of OCPD. These results make another contribution to the mixed results in the literature on this topic (Dondu et al., 2015; Henriques-Calado &amp; Duarte-Silva, 2019; Nicholas et al., 2010). Informant reported OCPD features demonstrated an association with informant reported cognitive problems, but self- and interview-based assessments of OCPD did not. The former result could be attributed to shared source variance. Close others may tend to describe difficult individuals in a generally negative manner, i.e., being willing to report negative personality characteristics as well as difficulties with everyday cognitive tasks. This possibility may explain why previous studies that used a mix of self- and informant report to assess dementia patients may overestimate the association between OCPD and dementia status (Dondu et al., 2015). This same bias may in part explain the findings with regard to BPD features, although the fact that self-report BPD features also showed an association with cognitive problems suggests that some variance in cognitive problems due to personality pathology goes beyond a shared source. Our findings may tell a cautionary tale and argue for the use of multiple sources of information when examining the relationship between personality and cognitive decline.

Limitations

Given that much of the previous research on personality pathology and cognitive aging relied on cross-sectional and retrospective analyses, the current investigation’s ability to examine this relationship prospectively over two waves of data is a significant strength. There are, however, at least two limitations stemming from the use of only two waves of data. First, there was relatively high rank-order stability and no mean-level change in cognitive aging outcomes over the two waves of data in both samples (see Table S2). The relatively short time interval allowed only a minimal opportunity to identify significant cognitive decline among our community-based sample of participants, with most of them being in good health. As these longitudinal studies unfold with additional assessments, it will be possible to model trajectories of change in cognitive abilities over a longer period time. Second, when these data were collected, participants were in their late sixties or early seventies, which is relatively young for most people to exhibiting symptoms of cognitive decline. Studying these participants into later life will obviously increase our ability to identify risk factors for the onset of major forms of cognitive impairment.

In addition to the limitations arising from the use of two waves of data, another feature of the current investigation that may limit the generalizability of its conclusions involves the use of the AD8 as an index of cognitive problems. One potential limitation is that it was not designed to be used as a measure of cognitive change; the time frame that informants are asked to consider (“the last several years”) was deliberately vague in order to enhance its use as a screening measure for cognitive decline. Unfortunately, this lack of temporal precision complicates the interpretation of residualized change when using the AD8. Informants may have considered overlapping periods of time when filling out the AD8 at both waves, thus potentially masking changes that did occur. Future research should examine whether informant reports of cognitive problems map on to impairments in everyday cognitive functioning through more frequent and detailed assessments. Ideally, such work would account for personality functioning as well, to ensure that informants are not conflating problems due to personality and cognitive functioning.

Ultimately, the current investigation represents an incremental advancement of our understanding of the relationship between personality and cognitive ability in later life. The relationship between BPD features and cognitive problems appears similar in magnitude to previous findings with regard to normal-range personality traits (Curtis et al., 2015; Duchek et al., 2019; Low et al., 2013; Luchetti et al., 2016; Terracciano et al., 2014, 2017). By mining the rich clinical literature on personality pathology, there is potential to identify mechanisms involved in cognitive aging and design interventions to promote cognitive maintenance and psychological well-being. Such research at the intersection of clinical, personality, and aging science stands to leverage our understanding of the pathological extremes of personality to help people live and age well in older adulthood.

1 Due to an error in training, a small subset of participants was asked about the period since the intervening at-home follow-up (SPAN Time 2). As such, some events may have been missed, but there is no reason to suspect systematic error.

2 This number assumed that analyses were to be conducted with a single latent factor score in all cases, rather than treating each individual measure of the same construct as a separate test (see below). In cases where the single latent factor failed to meet our a priori fit criteria, we focus on interpreting results as a family of tests.

3 This step was not mentioned in the preregistration but follows the guidelines for using the PCA function of the FactoMineR package.
