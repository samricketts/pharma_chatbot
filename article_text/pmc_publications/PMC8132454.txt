Aβ deposition is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Besides the full-length amyloid forming peptides (Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42), biochemical analyses of brain deposits have identified a variety of N- and C-terminally truncated Aβ variants in sporadic and familial AD patients. However, their relevance for AD pathogenesis remains largely understudied. We demonstrate that Aβ4–42 exhibits a high tendency to form β-sheet structures leading to fast self-aggregation and formation of oligomeric assemblies. Atomic force microscopy and electrophysiological studies reveal that Aβ4–42 forms highly stable ion channels in lipid membranes. These channels that are blocked by monoclonal antibodies specifically recognizing the N-terminus of Aβ4–42. An Aβ variant with a double truncation at phenylalanine-4 and leucine 34, (Aβ4–34), exhibits unstable channel formation capability. Taken together the results presented herein highlight the potential benefit of C-terminal proteolytic cleavage and further support an important pathogenic role for N-truncated Aβ species in AD pathophysiology.

Graphical abstract text

N- and C-terminal truncated Aβ species play an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this study, structural, morphological and electrical activity of one of the main N-truncated species Aβ4–42 was analyzed. Through EM and AFM analysis we report that Aβ4–42 forms oligomeric structures and in the membrane environment these structures have a pore-like morphology. These pores are electrically active as evident from the transmembrane current recorded through electrophysiological studies. These results have broad implications in understanding the pathophysiology of AD and help advance the design of therapeutic agents.

Background

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in the world, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder neuropathologically characterized by the presence of extracellular parenchymal and vascular Aβ amyloid deposits as well as intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated versions of tau, a microtubule accessory protein. Parenchymal amyloid lesions adopt different morphological characteristics presenting as dense core neuritic plaques or diffuse deposits[1]. Irrespective of their dissimilar morphology, both lesions are populated by relatively short Aβ peptides cleaved from the much larger membrane spanning amyloid precursor protein (APP)[2]. Whereas compact plaques and vascular deposits are rich in β-sheet structures responsible for their characteristic green birefringence under polarized light after Congo red staining, and exhibit fibrillar appearance under electron microscopy (EM), diffuse plaques are non-fibrillar and Congo red negative, likely representing early phases in the development of compact plaques[3].

Multiple lines of investigation implicate amyloid peptides in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Individuals with Down’s syndrome – trisomy 21 harbor similar lesions and develop early AD-like pathology, typically by middle age[3]. Furthermore, familial mutations in the APP gene in the long arm of chromosome 21 are associated with early onset hereditary forms of AD. In addition, animal models overexpressing human APP or transgenic for familial APP mutations exhibit progressive AD-like Aβ amyloid pathology associated with cognitive deficits[2]. Amyloid peptides are known to be produced by the sequential processing of APP through the action of β- and γ-secretases which result in the generation of Aβ peptides starting at the aspartate residue at position 1 and ending at amino acids 38/ 40 / 42 [4]. Although, Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 have been the most frequently studied species, a wide variety of post-translational modifications – including isomerization and racemization of aspartate residues, cyclization of N-terminal glutamate, and oxidation of methionine, among others – have also been documented.

The post translationally modified peptides also include different N- and C-terminally truncated Aβ species that have been identified in animal models and AD patients [5,6] and are likely generated by a number of Aβ-degrading enzymes among them neprilysin, insulin degrading- and endothelin converting-enzymes, plasmin and matrix metalloproteases[7,8]. In this sense, biochemical and mass spectrometry analyses have revealed the presence of a variety of C-terminally truncated Aβ species in human brain interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), among them Aβ1–16, Aβ1–30, Aβ1–34, and Aβ1–37 [9–12] likely representing the proteolytic action of local resident enzymes. Similarly, an assortment of Aβ peptides truncated at the N-terminus have been reported, among them Aβ2–42, Aβ3–42, Aβ3pE-42, Aβ4–42, Aβ9–42, and Aβ17–42 [13]. Aβ truncations severely alter the biophysical properties of the molecule. While C-terminal cleavage of Aβ generates peptides that are soluble and normal components of body fluids, N-terminal truncated forms, due to their propensity for adopting β-sheet conformations, are prone to self-aggregation,are poorly soluble, and typically exhibit exacerbated cytotoxicity[1,13,14].

One of the most relevant N-terminal truncated forms, Aβ4–42 was first reported over three decades ago[3]. This peptide, preferentially found in dense core plaques and cerebrovascular deposits in AD cases and transgenic animal models [1,3,15] is also highly prevalent in patients with trisomy-21, and vascular dementia[16]. Recent studies indicate that the N-terminal truncation at Phe4 of Aβ results in greater hydrophobicity and higher β-sheet content of the molecule compared to Aβ1–42 leading to an augmented ability to oligomerize[1]. These biophysical properties of Aβ4-x forms contrast with those of C-terminally cleaved Aβ species, generally found in aqueous-based biological fluids, which typically exhibit higher solubility and less aggregation propensity than the parent full-length peptides. Mounting evidence indicate a critical role of the lipid microenvironment in the molecular pathways affecting amyloid aggregation. In this sense, the composition of the different cellular membranes including the type of lipid molecules and cholesterol content [17,18] are known to play important roles in the oligomerization and aggregation fates of amyloid peptides. Particularly, the presence of GM1 gangliosides has been shown to increase amyloid aggregation by forming ganglioside-peptide complexes with capacity to act as amyloid seeds [19,20]. Recent NMR based studies have also explored geometric factors such as bilayer thickness in modulating binding affinity of Aβ1–40 with the membrane and propensity of oligomerization by folding into an intermediate, partially folded helical filament, which maybe a crucial step in the aggregation cascade [21,22]. Notably, in-vitro NMR studies of Aβ1–40 with lipid nanodiscs have reported an inhibition of fibrillation as a consequence of the trapping of aggregation intermediates, indicative of a potential use for future therapeutic avenues [23,24].

In spite of extensive studies focusing on Aβ, the relevance of the N- and C-terminal truncated species for AD pathogenesis as well as their contribution to the complex cellular mechanisms affected during the disease remain largely understudied. Among the most relevant pathogenic pathways under investigation, the insertion of channel structures in cellular and intracellular membranes, a two-step insertion mechanism, is certain to cause alterations in membrane potential and leakage of critical cellular ions such as calcium and potassium, ultimately damaging cellular homeostasis and survival[25–28]. The present work examines the ability of Aβ4–42 to form ion channels in lipid membranes using both electrophysiology and AFM approaches, further demonstrating that additional C-terminal truncation of Phe4 starting peptides results in highly unstable pore structures. Overall, the current studies provide insight into the detrimental pathogenic mechanisms of N-terminally truncated Aβ proteoforms, contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the three dimensional structure of Aβ aggregates – both in solution and in the membrane environment– and expand existing knowledge on the significance of Aβ heterogeneity for disease pathophysiology. All these features provide new and unique ways to design and develop therapeutic molecules targeting the aggregation and oligomerization pathways and/or blocking channel activity[29,30].

Materials and Methods

Aβ Peptides: synthesis and structural changes

Peptides Aβ4–42 (FRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVVIA) and Aβ4–34 (FRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGL) were synthesized at ERI Amyloid Laboratory (Oxford, CT) using N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry. Peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac C4 column (Western Analytical, Murrieta, CA). Molecular masses and purity of the synthetic peptides were corroborated by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, as previously reported [31].

Monodisperse amyloid subunit of both peptides were obtained by dissolving 1mg/ml of peptides in 1,1,1,3,3,3, hexafluoro-isopropanol (HFIP; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and subsequent incubation for 4 days, which breaks down β-sheet structures and disrupts hydrophobic forces, promoting the formation of stable α-helical secondary structures [32–34]. HFIP-pretreated peptides were lyophilized and maintained frozen at −80°C, storage conditions that in our hands preserved the same unaggregated structures for up to one month, as verified by the predominance of monomeric components in Western blots and negligible fluorescence signal after thioflavin T binding.

Atomic Force Microscopy: sample preparation and imaging conditions

Proteoliposome preparation has been included in supplementary information. For AFM sample preparation, 10–20μl of sonicated proteoliposome solution was added to a freshly cleaved muscovite mica disk and further diluted to 50μl by adding HEPES/KCl/MgCl2 buffer. The solution was incubated for 10–15 mins at room temperature on the mica disk, washed thrice, and rehydrated to 50ul using imaging buffer (HEPES, pH 7.4). A Bruker Multimode equipped with Nanoscope V controller, EV scanner and fluid cell was used for all AFM imaging studies (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA). Bruker SNL-20 (silicon nitride cantilever, Al coated, k=0.08N/m, fr~8kHz in buffer or 0.24N/m, fr~32kHz in buffer) or Mikromasch XNC12 (silicon nitride tip, Au coated, k=0.08N/m, fr~7kHz in buffer) were used (Mikromasch, USA). Contact and Tapping (according to convenience and imaging stability) mode imaging was performed in 10mM HEPES at scan rates of 1–2Hz. Scanning was usually started with a larger scan size (10μm x 10μm) and then gradually reduced to smaller sizes depending upon area of interest (1μm x 1μm, 500nm x 500nm etc.). Setpoint voltage and feedback gains were optimized, and height and phase images collected. The resulting images were processed with the Nanoscope Analysis 1.9 software provided by Bruker. The height images were first flattened (0th, 1st or 2nd order) and section analysis feature was used to extract cross sections of different regions feature heights.

Electrophysiology

POPE (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), and POPG (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-1′-rac-glycerol), purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and stored at −20°C, were dissolved in n-heptane to a final concentration of 1.5%. Aβ peptides were reconstituted in deionized water to the concentrations illustrated in Figure 4 whereas anti-Aβ4-x monoclonal antibody 18H6 [1] was diluted to the desired concentration in deionized water and stored at −20 °C.

Phospholipid bilayer membranes were prepared as previously described [35]. Briefly, bilayer membranes were prepared by placing a bubble of lipid dissolved in solvent onto the end of the Teflon tube of approximately 300μm in diameter. The chamber design allows rapid introduction of solution into immediate proximity with the membrane in a volume of 50μl. One percent agar salt bridges with 1 M KCl were used to connect the Ag/AgCl electrodes (E-207, Warner Instruments) to the solutions. Voltage clamp conditions were employed in all experiments. The side where peptides were added (cis side) was taken as ground. All voltages given in Figure 3 refer to the voltage of the trans side. Current was recorded with an “Axopatch C1” amplifier and stored by “DataTrax” system for later analysis. Membrane capacitance and resistance were monitored regularly to ensure the integrity of the membranes.

Results

Structural properties of Aβ4–42 and Aβ4–34 truncated peptides

Figure 1A illustrates the purity of the synthetic peptides used in our studies. In each case, MALDI-TOF analysis revealed the presence of a single component with a m/z value well within the range of the expected theoretical mass. The structural changes of the Aβ4–42 and Aβ4–34 synthetic homologues, pretreated, solubilized, and aggregated as described in Methods, was analyzed by CD spectroscopy, thioflavin T-binding, and electron microscopy analysis over a time-lapse of 2h. Consistent with previous findings [1], the highly fibrillogenic Aβ4–42 (Figure 1B), showed upon 2h incubation under physiological salt concentrations, a CD spectrum with a typical minimum at 218 nm, indicative of β-sheet secondary structures. In contrast, Aβ4–34, bearing an additional C-terminal truncation display a primarily random conformation in the experimental timeframe. Thioflavin T binding, largely associated with the presence of cross β-sheet structures and typically correlating with the existence of fibrillar and/or protofibrillar components [36], also varied between both peptides. In accordance with its tendency to form β-sheet structures, Aβ4–42 exhibited much higher fluorescence values than the freshly solubilized peptide after 2h incubation (Figure 1C). Further C-terminal truncation at position 34 completely abolished the fluorescence signal, in agreement with the absence of changes in the CD profile. Figure 1 (panels D and E), illustrates the characteristics of the Aβ4-x truncated species visualized by EM after uranyl acetate negative staining. The formation of oligomeric structures defined as elements of &lt; 100 nm in length with longer assemblies classified as protofibrils was evident for the 2h incubated Aβ4–42 (Figure. 1D). The C-terminally truncated Aβ4–34, displayed a lower capacity to form oligomeric species within the same time frame (Figure. 1E). The above data clearly indicates that the N-terminal truncation at position 4 induces formation of high β-sheet content elements and concomitant generation of oligomeric assemblies, all characteristics associated with pro-amyloidogenic properties. In contrast, the additional C-terminal truncation at position 34 leads to the generation of peptides less prone to oligomerization, suggestive of molecules with more accelerated clearance potential, in agreement with the reported tissue retrieval of C-terminally cleaved derivatives in water-based buffers and their presence in biological fluids[1].

Aβ4–42 and Aβ4–34 show pore-like structures in lipid bilayer

AFM images of different concentrations of freshly prepared Aβ4–42 and Aβ4–34 (outlined in methods) on mica showed densely populated clusters of different diameter distributions;~5nm for smaller oligomeric structures, ~5nm-20nm for intermediate aggregates and &gt;20nm for larger irregular aggregates (Figure 2A and 2B). Significantly, Aβ4–34 formed oligomers at a higher propensity (Fig 2B), and the peptides were closely packed compared to Aβ4–42 (Figure 2A). This is consistent with the difference in the number of membrane-spanning amino acids (8 amino acids for Aβ4–34 vs 16 amino acids for Aβ4–42). In general, the size of the globular Aβ4–42 (Figure 2A) was larger than the size of the globular Aβ4–34 (Figure 2B).

AFM images of Aβ4–42 and Aβ4–34 when reconstituted in a DOPC bilayer show multiple different forms of oligomeric species of different sizes present in the bilayer membrane as well as some clustered together around membrane edges and defects (Figure 3A for Aβ4–42 and 3B for Aβ4–34). At a lower molar ratio (1:1000) of Aβ4–42:DOPC, much lesser membrane disruption was observed, and oligomeric species were easier to detect and differentiate from DOPC bilayer over the mica substrate. High resolution AFM images of Aβ4–42 oligomers interacting with DOPC membrane reveal annular pore-like structures with outer diameter 12–16 nm (+/−2.3 nm, accounting for tip convolution) with a central dip, indicative of a peptide pore in the membrane. These are very similar to AβpE3–42 pore-like structures reported previously [37,38] (Figure 3C and inset attached with C). Similar structural clusters of diameter 14–18.5 nm with a pore-like morphology are observed for Aβ4–34 reconstituted with DOPC bilayer, although a clear dip in the pore structure was not resolvable (Figure 3D and inset attached with D). The height protrusion of these pore-like structures above the DOPC planar surface is found to be about 0.9~1.2 nm. These pore-like structures were found to be distributed throughout the sample with varying spatial and number density.

Aβ4– 42 forms a stable and long-lived ion channel in lipid bilayer

Figure 4A shows the results of an experiment where Aβ4–42 was added to the aqueous phase bordering a phospholipid membrane. The horizontal traces represent current passing through the membrane as a function of time under voltage clamp conditions. The current was extremely close to zero prior to the addition of peptide. After the addition of peptide (first arrow), there is a lag phase, and then the current begins to rise in a stepwise manner ultimately resulting in a large (negative) and stable current through the membrane representing the insertion of multiple ion channels in the membrane. The current increase is represented by a downward deflection of the current trace, indicating that the current is in the negative direction, as a negative voltage was applied to the membrane. When the voltage is reversed to a positive voltage, the current direction reverses, but is approximately equal in magnitude, indicating the channels do not turn on or off with voltage. These channels appear to have significant stability over time and relatively long lifetimes comparable to those exhibited by Aβ1– 42 [39]. At the point indicated by the second arrow, zinc chloride was added to the solution. A short time later the magnitude of the negative current was reduced by the addition of zinc, similar to the previous findings of zinc blockade of Aβ1– 42 [40].

Aβ4–34 forms unstable and short-lived ion channels

Figure 4B shows the results of a lipid bilayer experiment where peptide Aβ4–34 was added to the solution bathing the membrane on one side. In the initial phase of the experiment the current passing through the membrane is close to zero reflecting the very low permeability to ions of the unmodified phospholipid membrane. After the addition of Aβ4–34, there is a lag phase followed by the appearance of spontaneous fluctuations in the current. These fluctuations represent the insertion and opening of ion channels in the membrane. These channels appear to have very poor stability and short lifetimes (&lt; 1 sec). The channels flicker rapidly open and closed, and do not exhibit the more typical stability of full length Aβ peptides (1–40 and 1–42)[41].

Monoclonal 18H6, specific to the N-terminal truncation at Aβ Phe4, blocks activity of Aβ4-42 ion channels

Figure 4C shows an experiment where Aβ4– 42 was added to the solution bounding the membrane. After a lag there is a significant increase in the membrane current represented by a downward deflection as the voltage at that time across the membrane was a negative voltage therefore resulting in a negative or downward current. Monoclonal antibody 18H6, specific for N-terminal truncated peptides, was added to the solution bounding the membrane (arrow). This resulted in a rapid reduction of the magnitude of the negative current indicating partial blockade of the channel by the antibody. This suggests not only that the current induced in the membrane was specific to Aβ4–42, but also that the N-terminal epitope that recognized the antibody was still accessible to the side of the membrane to which the peptide was added. That is, Aβ4–42 is oriented in the membrane with its N-terminus facing the side to which it has been added.

Discussion

N-terminally truncated peptide Aβ4–42, a major fibrillar component of parenchymal plaques and vascular deposits, has a high tendency to adopt β-sheet conformations and lead to the rapid formation of oligomeric assemblies, structures that are considered today the most pathogenic amyloid species associated with the development and progression of AD. Indeed, previous work indicates that this truncated form exhibits even higher aggregation/oligomerization tendency than the parent full-length Aβ1–42 molecule itself and is an invariable component of the plaque cores [1,3]. Also consistent with previous reports demonstrating the protective effect of C-terminal cleavages for Aβ oligomerization and toxicity, Aβ4–34 lacking the C-terminal portion of Aβ4–42 exhibits a random-coil conformation and very little oligomerization propensity in the current experimental timeframe.

The results presented herein clearly indicate that both Aβ4–42 and Aβ4–34 can differentially form ion permeable channels in phospholipid bilayer membranes. The results are not totally surprising given previous reports of channel formation by peptides containing the full length Aβ1–42 sequence [42,43] or its N-terminal truncated species Aβ3pE-42 [38] and Aβ17–42 [44,45] as well as smaller fragments such as Aβ25–35 [46,47] all of which are capable of forming ion permeable channels, albeit with varying electrophysiological characteristics. What is striking about the results presented here is the marked difference in physiologic properties between the two ion channels tested. Aβ4–42 exhibits channels that appear quite stable in the timeframe of our experiments with lifetimes lasting many seconds to minutes. The conductance induced by these channels is quite large and stable over the time course of our experiments. The conductance also appears to be independent of voltage which is a typical characteristic of full length Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 [48,49]. Moreover, Aβ4–42 is blocked by zinc added from the same side as the peptide, sharing this property with Aβ1–42 [48]. In contrast Aβ4–34 forms channels that appear to be unstable during the time course of our experiments and rapidly flicker open and shut. This instability is consistent with the less hydrophobic nature of the C-terminal truncated peptide Aβ4–34. It seems to be less comfortable in the hydrophobic environment of the membrane and less stable, therefore. Because the insertion of small numbers of ion channels in a planar lipid bilayer membrane is an inherently variable process, we cannot make firm conclusions about the relative channel forming activity of both peptides from the present data. Many factors including lipid and ionic composition, temperature, and molecular crowding, among others, can affect channel activity. Still, the contrast between the two Aβ variants examined here is striking.

This physiologic evidence is consistent with the AFM images presented here in which Aβ4–42 clearly shows multimeric aggregates in the membrane, clustered around a central pore region. This would be compatible with the large, stable, long lasting conductance (current fluctuations) that we see in the electrophysiological experiments and also consistent with AFM images of similar Aβ peptides including Aβ1–42, AβpE3–42, Aβ9–42 and Aβ17–42 [37,44,45,50,51]. In contrast, the AFM images of Aβ4–34 do not show a clearly defined pore structure, suggesting that under the AFM imaging conditions, pore structures are highly unstable as is the case in the electrophysiological experiments. It should also be noted that Aβ4–42 is blocked by zinc in a manner quite similar to that of Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 [40,48] implying that the receptor site in the pore for zinc is similar in both peptides.

Notably, the Aβ4–42 channel activity can be specifically blocked by the antibody 18H6 which is specific for Aβ peptides N-truncated at position 4. This demonstrates that the N-terminus of this peptide is clearly accessible to the aqueous solution surrounding the membrane on the side that the peptide was added to, providing valuable information about the orientation of the Aβ N- terminus in the functional channel structure. This finding will be extremely useful for further molecular modeling of potential ion channel structures in the lipid membrane.

The results presented here give further weight to the idea that N-terminal truncated peptides that are more prone to aggregation and more toxic to neurons than comparable full length Aβ species may play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. This idea may be critical in the formulation of therapeutic approaches to inhibiting or reducing amyloid deposition in the brain using antibodies or small molecule inhibitors targeted toward N- terminal truncated peptides. We have previously reported on the channels formed by Aβ9–42 and Aβ17–42 [44,45]. These N-terminally truncated peptides do not form amyloid, but are toxic to neurons, allow calcium ions to enter cells, and do aggregate in the presence of membranes, forming ion channels. These features are all inhibited by millimolar zinc ion, indicating that calcium entry and neurotoxicity directly result from ion channel formation, leading us to propose this pathway as an alternative mechanism for AD.

Similarly, we have also studied the structure and biological activity of AβpE3–42, an N-terminal truncated amyloid peptide where after the loss of the first 2 amino acids, the third position glutamate is converted to pyroglutamate via intramolecular dehydration by the enzyme glutamyl cyclase, creating a lactam ring. While glutamate is a charged polar group and typically seeks an aqueous environment, the pyroglutamate is more nonpolar and seeks the hydrophobic environment of the membrane. Pyroglutamate-modified Aβ represents a dominant fraction of Aβ oligomers found in AD brains, while control brains show much lower concentrations of pE Aβ [52]. Plaques formed with pE Aβ appear earlier in the course of the AD-like illness due to trisomy 21 (Down’s syndrome) and transgenic AβpE3–42 mice develop an earlier and more severe illness than those with Aβ1–42 [52]. Lipid bilayer experiments showed that AβpE3–42 formed channels more rapidly and exhibited a larger fraction of high conductance (100–200 picoSiemens) channels compared to Aβ1–42. [38].

The precise mechanisms leading to the development and progression of AD are complex and multifactorial involving crosstalk among different cellular pathways. Over the years, different lines of investigation have provided support for a central role of Aβ in the disease pathogenesis [53]. It is now clear that the conformational transition from soluble to fibrillar material is a highly complex process modulated by a variety of factors, among them the presence of post translational modifications in the Aβ molecule including N- and C-terminal truncations as studied in the current work. The interlinked cellular pathways compromised by Aβ – many of them shared by those elicited by non-Aβ oligomeric conformations associated with other forms of cerebral amyloidosis [36,54] – are currently under active investigation. Among the most studied pathways, induction of apoptotic/cell death mechanisms, oxidative stress, metabolic/mitochondrial dysfunction, and the ability of amyloid subunits to assemble into functional ion channel-like structures in lipidic environments are the most relevant [55,56].

Insertion of channel structures in cellular and intracellular membranes has the potential to alter homeostasis and metabolism since cells depend on intact membrane structures for a wide variety of functions. Beta sheet conformers are well-suited to forming pore-like structures in a hydrophobic environment which may account for their widespread presence in three-dimensional amyloid and non-amyloid pores. Cells depend on intact membrane structures for a wider variety of cellular functions. Non-specific ion channels, such as those described by us and other laboratories, insert leakage pathways into membranes that interfere with their biological function causing dissipation of membrane potential and leakage of critical calcium and potassium ions [27]. Ultimately cells are forced to work harder and use up their energy stores. Ion channel formation and its potential modulation carry vast potential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Indeed, in spite of extensive research efforts, disease-modifying therapies that may prevent or slow the rate of AD progression are still lacking. While biochemical, genetic, and longitudinal imaging analyses provide strong support to the role of Aβ aggregation in initiating disease pathogenesis, the clinical trials as conducted so far have not panned out. Current consensus in the research community indicates that Aβ-modifying therapies are not beneficial for symptomatic patients and those in the late stage of disease when Aβ fibrillogenesis and brain deposition is extensive [57]. Targeting ion channel formation and its deleterious effects on cellular function either independently or as part of future combinatorial therapies is certainly a promising alternative to address the cross-talk mechanistic paths involved in the disease. A better understanding of the relevance of Aβ4–42 and other N-terminal truncated fragments will certainly provide insight into the role of Aβ heterogeneity in the complex mechanisms of Alzheimer’s pathophysiology and open new avenues for translational opportunities.
