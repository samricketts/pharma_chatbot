Objective

The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) provides a measure of verbal learning and memory. The aim of this study was to provide normative performance data on the HVLT-R for community-dwelling older individuals according to ethno-racial group, age, gender, and years of completed education, in Australia and the U.S.

Method

The ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study recruited 19 114 generally healthy community dwelling individuals aged 70 years and over (65 years and over for U.S minorities), who were without a diagnosis of dementia and scored above 77 on the modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) examination. Included in the analysis presented here were 16 251 white Australians, and in the U.S. 1 082 white, 894 African American and 314 Hispanic/Latino individuals at baseline.

Results

Performance on each of the components of the HVLT-R (trials 1–3, total, learning, delayed recall, delayed recognition, percentage retention and recognition discrimination index [RDI]) differed by demographic variables. In country and ethno-racial stratified analyses, female gender, younger age and higher education were significantly associated with better total recall, delayed recall and RDI. Among white Australians these characteristics were also associated with better retention. Age, education and gender-specific reference values across ethno-racial categories were determined.

Conclusions

Ethno-racial, age, gender and education-stratified normative data from this large cohort of community-dwelling older individuals will serve as important reference standards in Australia and the U.S. to assess cognition in older individuals.

INTRODUCTION

An assessment of verbal learning and memory is considered an essential component of any neuropsychological battery. Changes in cognitive function occur as individuals age (Harada, Natelson Love, &amp; Triebel, 2013), and some decline in verbal memory can be considered part of the ‘normal’ aging process (Davis et al., 2017; Simensky &amp; Abeles, 2002). However, more substantial deficits are a feature of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Tremont, Miele, Smith, &amp; Westervelt, 2010) or a symptom of more severe underlying pathology (Mistridis, Krumm, Monsch, Berres, &amp; Taylor, 2015). Delayed recall impairment is considered an important element in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Parra et al., 2009) and is used to help discriminate AD from other underlying causes of dementia (Tierney et al., 2001). Assessment of verbal memory in older individuals is thus a useful screening and diagnostic tool. For these tests to be optimally effective, performance must be compared with appropriate normative data that considers demographic-related differences.

The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) is a brief, multicomponent word-list learning task that was developed by Brandt and Benedict (Benedict, Schretlen, Groninger, &amp; Brandt, 1998) to assess verbal learning and memory. The HVLT-R consists of three free recall learning trials, a delayed recall trial and a recognition task, and yields a number of raw and calculated scores including total recall score, delayed recall score, percentage retention and a recognition discrimination index (RDI).

The HVLT-R has good test-retest reliability (Benedict et al., 1998) and demonstrated construct validity (Shapiro, Benedict, Schretlen, &amp; Brandt, 1999). It was originally normed on 541 adults aged 17–88 years (of whom 75 were older than 70 years), with demonstrated utility and validity across a wide range of individuals, including different ethno-racial groups and individuals with significant cognitive impairments (Gaines, Shapiro, Alt, &amp; Benedict, 2006; McLaughlin, Chang, &amp; Malloy, 2012). It has high classification accuracy for distinguishing individuals with and without a diagnosis of dementia (Frank &amp; Byrne, 2000; Hogervorst et al., 2002) and even modest accuracy in discriminating individuals with probable AD from those with vascular dementia (Shapiro et al., 1999). These properties, combined with the ease of administration and straightforward scoring, make it a popular test for neuropsychological assessment of older individuals in both the clinical and research settings (Lacritz, Cullum, Weiner, &amp; Rosenberg, 2001). For the test to have optimal utility however, it is important to understand the extent to which HVLT-R scores are influenced by demographic factors. A number of studies have attempted to address this, but have been limited by relatively small sample sizes.

Normative data generated from a study of 394 elderly in the U.S. showed that age and gender had significant effects on HVLT-R performance but that there was only minimal effect from education (Vanderploeg et al., 2000). On the other hand, an Australian study of 203 men and women aged between 60 and 89 years found that education and age, but not gender, predicted total score and delayed recall. A difference in the mean level of education between the U.S. and Australian samples (with a mean of 14.1 versus 11.1 years respectively), was cited as one possible explanation for the divergent findings. In addition to national differences, race and ethnicity may also be important factors to consider when interpreting HVLT-R normative data. Indeed, a United States (U.S.) study of healthy African-American (n=103) and Caucasian (n=143) adults (aged 20–65 years) reported that race/ethnicity was associated with test performance, and modified the effect of age on performance (Norman et al., 2011). Together, these studies highlight the importance of considering socio-demographic factors when assessing test performance on the HVLT-R. However, to date, most studies which have provided normative data have done so in relatively small samples, which makes stratification by numerous demographic variables problematic. The largest study providing HVLT-R normative data to date included a total of 3 977 individuals with a wide age range (18–95 years) from 11 Latin American Spanish speaking countries (Arango-Lasprilla et al., 2015). Country differences were observed, and in stratified analysis, age and education, but not gender, influenced performance on the HVLT-R total and delayed recall. This contrasts with commonly reported findings in neuropsychology that women outperform men in verbal memory performance, including in later life (McCarrey, An, Kitner-Triolo, Ferrucci, &amp; Resnick, 2016).

In summary, there is a lack of large-scale normative data on HVLT-R performance, particularly in older individuals which have considered the influence of age, education and gender, as well as ethnicity. Failure to consider these factors when interpreting test performance could lead to problems with misclassification and potentially misdiagnosis when existing normative data are used.

The aim of this paper is to provide high quality normative data on the HVLT-R in a large sample of community-dwelling, generally healthy older individuals without a diagnosis of dementia or major impairment in general cognitive function (defined by a modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) examination score above 77). The size of this sample permits normative data to be presented separately for Australian and U.S. ethno-racial groups, and according to gender, age and education levels. Establishing a reference of normative HVLT-R data, including total and delayed recall, percentage retention and RDI will provide a useful tool for clinicians and researchers.

METHODS

Study Design &amp; Participants

The ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) randomized controlled trial was established to determine the effects of an average 5 years of daily low dose aspirin on disability-free survival in older people, when used in the primary prevention setting (McNeil et al., 2018). The sampling procedure and study design of ASPREE, including full inclusion and exclusion criteria, have been detailed previously (ASPREE, 2013; McNeil et al., 2017).

Community based recruitment occurred throughout the U.S. (predominantly through academic and clinical trial centres) and Australia (mainly through general practitioners, GPs) between March 2010 and November 2014. Individuals who were aged 70 years or over (or at least 65 years for U.S. African American and Hispanic/Latino minority groups), able to provide informed consent and capable of attending a study visit at the GP/clinical trial center were eligible for participation. Key exclusion criteria, in addition to a diagnosis of dementia or a score of &lt;78 on the 3MS examination, included established cardiovascular disease (e.g. atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure) or previous cardiovascular event (e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack), uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure ≥105 mmHg), physical disability (severe difficulty or inability to perform at least one of the six Katz basic Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)), high risk of bleeding, anemia, current continuous use of antithrombotic medications or aspirin, or other contraindication/allergy to aspirin. These were based on participants medical records and in the case of the 3MS and ADLs, assessments undertaken at study enrolment. Furthermore, GPs/primary care physicians also needed to agree to the participant’s involvement, and to state that they were free of any chronic illnesses likely to cause death within five years.

Ethics

ASPREE was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 1964 as revised in 2008, the NHMRC Guidelines on Human Experimentation, the federal patient privacy (HIPAA) law and ICH-GCP guidelines, and the International Conference of Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. ASPREE also follows the Code of Federal Regulations as it relates to areas of clinical research. The ASPREE Steering Committee had overall responsibility for the conduct of the trial.

Assessments

Baseline assessment included detailed questionnaires to gather demographic information (including age, highest level of completed education, gender), health and lifestyle information, as well as clinical assessments of physical and cognitive function. Based on self-report, participants were grouped into one of the following categories: Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, African American, American Indian, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic white, another racial group or more than one race. In line with the U.S. census, these “ethno-racial” categories capture both self-reported race, as well as whether or not participants identify as ethnically Hispanic/Latino or not.

Hopkin’s Verbal Learning Test Revised (HVLT-R)

Baseline neurocognitive testing included administration of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised (HVLT-R). The HVLT-R is an extension of the HVLT test of verbal learning and memory (Brandt, 1991) that includes a delayed recall and a delayed recognition trial (Benedict et al., 1998). It consists of a list of 12 nouns with four words drawn from each of three semantic categories. The individual is read the list at a rate of one word every two seconds, and then attempts to recall freely, in any order, as many of the words as they can remember. Correct responses range from 0 to 12, with no deduction for repeated words. The trial with presentation of the word list and then free recall is repeated twice, yielding a total immediate recall score from 0 to 36. The delayed recall component occurs after a delay of 20–25 minutes (occupied by non-verbal tasks), when the individual is asked to recall the same list of words without the benefit of having them presented before recall. Immediately following this is the delayed recognition trial in which a list of 24 words is read, including 12 words from the recall list and 12 false positives, half of which are semantically related to the recall list and the other half are not. The individual must state whether or not each of the words was on the original list. There are six alternative forms of the HVLT-R which are equivalent (except for the discrimination index) (Benedict et al., 1998). In this study Form 6 was used.

When scoring the HVLT-R, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score and the learning score is calculated as the higher score from trial 2 or 3, minus the score from trial 1. A delayed recall score is obtained from the corresponding trial and the percentage retention score is calculated by dividing the delayed recall trial by the higher of learning trial 2 or 3 multiplied by 100. The delayed recognition trial provides the number of true positive responses (hits) and the number of false-positive errors, while the Recognition Discrimination Index (RDI) is the difference between the number of correct responses and the number of false positives. The test-retest reliability of the HVLT-R total and delayed recall components is good, with correlations of 0.74 and 0.66 respectively (Benedict et al., 1998). It is lower for that of the learning, RDI and % retained (r = 0.39 to 0.41 respectively), indicating only marginal reliability and these may best be considered as secondary measures (Benedict et al., 1998).

Staff were fully trained and accredited in conducting the neurocognitive assessments and this was strictly monitored to ensure consistency across all staff members. Staff in the U.S. were trained by qualified Coordinating Center staff supervised by geriatrician study investigators (J.W, A. M) and staff in Australia were trained by a neurologist study investigator (E.S). In both countries, staff were re-accredited annually.

A small number of participants reported that Spanish was their primary language, and they therefore completed the HVLT-R in Spanish (all others having completed in English). Given the very small numbers (n=56), it was not appropriate to provide separate normative data for these individuals according to gender, age and education. They were therefore excluded from the current analysis, but summary statistics for these individuals are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

Statistical analyses

HVLT-R summary scores were calculated across categories defined by gender (male/female), age (65–69 years for U.S. minorities only, 70–74 years, 75–79 years, 80+ years) and education (which ranged from less than 9 years to more than 16 years), and stratified according to ethno-racial group.

In analyses stratified by ethno-racial group, multivariate linear regression was used to determine which of the demographic factors (age, gender and education) were independently associated with the five main components: HVLT-R total recall; learning; delayed recall; percentage retention and RDI scores. Two-way interactions between age and each of gender and education were investigated by including relevant terms in the models. Standard model assumptions including homogeneity of variance and approximately normal distribution of the residuals were confirmed as valid. Stata version 15.0 (StataCorp, College Station, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.

For the HVLT-R normative tables, the mean and standard deviation (SD) for total and delayed recall, learning and percentage retention were tabulated, according to age, gender and education, and separately for each ethno-racial group. Due to the skewed distribution of the scores for the RDI, percentile scores were used in place of mean (SD).

Sensitivity analysis was also performed using longitudinal information on dementia diagnosis from the ASPREE clinical trial (McNeil et al., 2018). In particular, given that the purpose of this paper was to provide clinically relevant normative data in a community sample without dementia, using the ASPREE data from enrolment, sensitivity analysis was performed excluding individuals who were diagnosed with dementia within the first three years of follow up. This permitted a comparison of normative data generated from both the full sample and the sample excluding 259 individuals who had a diagnosis of dementia in the first three years.

RESULTS

The demographic characteristics of ASPREE participants are shown in Table 1. The majority of participants were white and recruited in Australia (85.6%), 5.7% were white recruited in the U.S, 4.7% were African-American from the U.S. and 2% were Hispanic/Latino from the U.S. Participants were aged between 70 years (or 65 for U.S. minority groups) and 99 years (there was no upper limit for eligibility), with African-American participants being the youngest. There were more female than male participants in each ethno-racial category. There were differences in the proportion of individuals in each educational category across ethno-racial groups, with white U.S participants being the most highly educated.

ASPREE individuals not included in the analyses presented here are those where numbers were too small to enable stratified normative data to be presented. This included individuals self-identified as belonging to another ethno-racial group (including 165 Asians, 12 Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, 9 American Indian), those who reported more than one race, or individuals who did not provide this information. These numbers were too small for reporting normative data, however Supplementary Table 1 gives the summary statistics for the largest two groups (Asians and multiracial participants in Australia), and for the participants (all Hispanic/Latino) who completed the HVLT-R in Spanish and who were not included in the main analyses.

The overall scores for each of the raw and calculated components of the HVLT-R are given in Supplementary Table 2 according to ethno-racial group. Mean performance increased from recall trial 1 to 3, with the majority of individuals having positive scores for ‘learning’. This indicates that they performed better on trial 2 or 3 compared with trial 1. A small number of individuals, however, had negative learning scores, which indicates that they performed better on the first trial (Supplementary Figure 1). The total immediate recall scores were approximately normally distributed. Delayed recall scores were also approximately normally distributed in this sample, although there was a ceiling effect with the maximum of 12 correctly recalled words (Supplementary Figure 2).

The majority of retention scores fell at or below 100%, indicating that most individuals performed the same or worse on the delayed recall trial compared with the best recall on trial 2 or 3 (Supplementary Figure 2). Six individuals however, scored at least double on the delayed recall trial compared with either of the immediate trials (% retention scores ranging from 200–300%). In the delayed recognition trial, most individuals scored very highly, with a high number of true-positive hits and few false-positive errors. Consequently, RDI was heavily right skewed with a very narrow interquartile range (10–12 overall, Supplementary Table 2) and little difference between groups. For all subsequent analyses, the focus was on the five main memory indexes of the HVLT-R: total recall (the sum of trials 1–3), learning, delayed recall, % retention and RDI.

Ethno-racial group, gender, age and education level were all significant independent predictors of performance on the total and delayed recall, % retention and RDI (Supplementary Table 3). On the total recall task there was no significant difference in the performance of white participants between Australia and U.S., however white U.S. participants did perform significantly better on learning, delayed recall and % retention, but worse on RDI. Hispanic/Latinos did not perform significantly differently from white Australians on % retention, but performed better on learning, and worse on total and delayed recall, and RDI. African-Americans had lower scores on each of the cognitive measures in comparison to white Australians, with greater effect sizes than those of Hispanic/Latinos.

Female gender was associated with better performance on all components of the HVLT-R. A negative association was found between age and cognitive performance, and a positive association between education level and cognitive performance. The exception was learning, where the association was age was very weak and only the highest education category was a predictor of better performance. The association between education and total and delayed recall, % retention and learning were different across ethno-racial categories. All subsequent analysis was stratified by country and ethno-racial group.

The results of the multivariate linear regression analyses for white Australians are shown in Supplementary Table 4. In models where they were included simultaneously, gender, age and education level were all independent predictors of performance on total recall, delayed recall, percentage retention and RDI, with the strongest predictor being 17 or more years of education (versus less than 9 years). Gender was the only characteristic that was associated with learning performance.

Supplementary Table 5 presents the linear regression models for the U.S. ethno-racial groups. In white U.S. and African-Americans, females outperformed males on all components, while among Hispanic/Latinos this was not the case for learning and % retention. Older age was associated with lower total and delayed recall among all ethno-racial groups, and with worse percentage retention among white and African-American U.S., and worse RDI among participants white and Hispanic/Latino participants. Only in the case of RDI among African-Americans, was there evidence of a nonlinear relationship between age and cognitive performance. Education level predicted performance on total and delayed recall, as well as learning among African-Americans specifically, and RDI among Hispanic/Latinos. Two-way interactions between age, gender and education level were not statistically significant in these models.

Given the results of the linear regression analyses, normative data were generated according to age, education and gender categories, and stratified by country and ethno-racial groups. To maximize the utility of this information, some age and education categories were grouped to ensure that none of the individual sub-categories included fewer than 20 participants. Table 2 shows the mean (SD) of HVLT-R scores on the total recall, learning, delayed recall and RDI components of the HVLT-R for white Australians. Table 3 presents the data for the U.S. ethno-racial groups. As RDI scores were heavily skewed with strong ceiling effects, normative data displays the percentile rather than mean and variability within each sub-group (Table 4 and 5).

There were 259 individuals who were adjudicated as having dementia in the first three years after baseline testing (213 white Australian, 26 white U.S., 15 African-American, and 3 Hispanic/Latino). The characteristics of these participants and their HVLT-R summary scores are shown in Supplementary Table 6. As expected, these participants had lower HVLT-R performance at baseline. Normative data which excludes individuals with dementia in the first three years is provided in Supplementary Tables 7 to 10. Given the small number of incident cases overall, exclusion of these individuals had little effect on the normative data, with differences of less than 1 SD, or less than one for RDI.

DISCUSSION

The HVLT-R is a reliable and valid clinical tool to screen for dementia and decline in cognitive performance in older individuals (Davis et al., 2017) (Parra et al., 2009), but high-quality normative data are needed. Such normative data must take into consideration the contribution of demographic factors to individual test performance. Inappropriate norms could negatively impact on the accuracy of screening and diagnosis.

Normative data are presented from a large community-based sample of generally healthy older individuals who were without a diagnosis of dementia when recruited to the study (according to clinical history at baseline) and with a 3MS score above 77. Our data indicate country and ethno-racial differences in HVLT-R performance, in particular, on the components of total recall and delayed recall. When normative data were stratified by ethno-racial group (i.e. white Australians, white U.S., African-American U.S. and Hispanic/Latinos), the association of age, gender and education level on cognitive performance also varied across these groups.

The most consistent finding was with regards to the total and delayed recall tasks; across all ethno-racial groups, females outperformed males, an increasing number of years of education was associated with better performance, and advancing age with lower performance. Prior normative HVLT-R data has predominantly focused on the total and delayed recall, and there is good evidence to support the reliability and construct validity of these components of the HVLT-R (Benedict et al., 1998; Shapiro et al., 1999). However, other components of the HVLT-R have also demonstrated construct validity in differentiating individuals with and without neurodegenerative disorders (Shapiro et al., 1999), and for distinguishing Alzheimer’s dementia versus other underlying causes of dementia (McLaughlin et al., 2012). RDI has also shown strong correlations with other recognition tests of verbal memory (e.g. CVLT) (Lacritz &amp; Cullum, 1998).

In this study, females outperformed males on the RDI, percentage retention and learning components of the HVLT-R overall, among white participants (both Australian and U.S.) and African-Americans. For Hispanic/Latinos, female gender was only associated with higher RDI. Increasing age was associated with lower RDI, and apart from Hispanic/Latinos, with worse percentage retention. Among white Australians, increasing education level was associated with better cognitive performance. Higher education also was a stronger predictor of performance on RDI in U.S. Hispanic/Latinos, but to a lesser extent in the other U.S. groups. Of note, the demographic differences observed in RDI were despite ceiling effects with this test, with a median score of 11 from a total maximum of 12.

The original publication on the HVLT-R reported standardized data from 541 healthy adult U.S. volunteers (aged 17 to 88 years) in four age-based groups (Benedict et al., 1998). This included normative data for 75 individuals aged 70–88. In the overall sample, education was moderately correlated with test performance, but no individual level data was provided according to education, nor for gender or ethnicity (there were 85% white and 14% African-American). Since then, only a few studies have supplemented this data through broader sample populations and/or other ethno-racial groups, however, most have been restricted by their sample size. The lack of normative data across gender, age and education categories could explain some of the discordant findings. Most prior studies have reported that age is significantly associated with performance on the total and delayed recall tasks, however, these conclusions have predominantly been drawn from studies assessing adults who have varied considerably in age (i.e. 18–65 years) (Arango-Lasprilla et al., 2015; Cherner et al., 2007; Norman et al., 2011), and may not be evident in smaller samples of older adults with a narrow age range (i.e. 60–71 years; 72–84 years) (Friedman, Schinka, Mortimer, &amp; Graves, 2002). Education level has been shown to be predictive of test performance in a number of prior studies (Friedman et al., 2002; Hester, Kinsekka, Ong, &amp; Turner, 2004; Norman et al., 2011), but not all (Brunet, Caldwell, Brandt, &amp; Miller, 2019; Vanderploeg et al., 2000), and the findings with gender have also been mixed (Arango-Lasprilla et al., 2015; Hester et al., 2004; Vanderploeg et al., 2000). To our knowledge, only one prior study has provided HVLT-R normative data by gender and across different age and education categories, but is limited by a total sample of only 237 (Friedman et al., 2002).

Country and ethnic/racial differences were observed in our study, which emphasises the limitations of applying normative data from one population to a culturally diverse sample. While the reliability and validity of the HVLT-R has been established across diverse populations, it has not been validated as a tool for cross-cultural research, and thus the results could be biased if interpreting this way (Lim et al., 2009). Our findings are supported by previous studies using the HVLT-R (Daugherty, Puente, Fasfous, Hidalgo-Ruzzante, &amp; Perez-Garcia, 2017; Norman et al., 2011), including those from a large study of 3 977 adults from 11 Latin American countries (Arango-Lasprilla et al., 2015). Our adjusted regression models indicate that ethno-racial group was associated with performance, independent of the other demographic characteristics, however other factors that could help account for these findings must be considered. Education level, for example, is a crude measure and does not adequately capture differences in an individual’s education experience and in particular, the quality of the education provided. Indeed, this is an important factor which accounts for racial differences in cognitive performance between older whites and African-Americans in the U.S. (Carvalho et al., 2015). Of note also, Hispanic/Latino individuals in ASPREE had lower levels of education than the other ethno-racial groups.

U.S. white participants performed better than Australian whites on learning, delayed recall and percentage retention, but there was no difference in total recall. In country stratified analysis, the association of demographic characteristics with cognitive performance appeared similar between the two countries, with gender influencing performance on all tasks. Both age and education were predictive of performance on total and delayed recall. The larger Australian sample permitted further stratification of age and education categories than in the U.S., and direct comparison between the scores in the two countries is therefore difficult.

The differences observed between Australian and U.S. whites in HVLT-R performance has been reported previously, in the only other study presenting normative data for older Australians (Hester et al., 2004). In a study of 203 participants aged 60 to 89 years (of whom only 136 completed the delayed recall task), learning and delayed recall performance were significantly different from U.S. normative data (Vanderploeg et al., 2000). Hester et al. reported however, that the average education of U.S. participants was also higher than that of the Australians (14.1 versus 11.1 years), and this partly accounted for the differences observed (Hester et al., 2004). Interestingly, these differences in education level between the older U.S. and Australian individuals align with the observations in our sample and have been reported previously for this generation (Tunny, 2006). Further small differences may be expected in our study, given the differences in recruitment procedures for the U.S. (through clinical trial and academic centers) and Australian (through primary care physicians) participants in our study.

Our data also indicates that demographic factors differentially influence performance across different ethno-racial groups. For example, learning was predicted by age and education in African-Americans, but not in the other ethno-racial groups. Likewise, female gender predicted increased learning among whites and African-Americans, but not among Hispanic/Latinos. Prior research also indicates that gender isn’t a major factor influencing HVLT-R performance in Latin Americans (Arango-Lasprilla et al., 2015). For Hispanic/Latinos, education level appeared to be most predictive of performance. This further highlights the need for ethno-racial stratified normative data that considers demographic characteristics.

Strengths of our study include the large size of the ASPREE sample, which has permitted reference range data to be presented within strata defined by ethno-racial group, age, gender and education. Given that all of these factors influenced performance on the key HVLT-R components (total and delayed recall, recognition and RDI), this information should make a significant and valuable contribution to existing data. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis which excluded individuals who were subsequently diagnosed with dementia (within three years of baseline cognitive testing), was included to ensure this group had no major bearing on the normative values. Indeed, the overall difference in normative data was very small, most likely due to the large sample and comparatively small number of participants reaching a diagnosis of dementia in the short time-frame since recruitment. Of note however, and providing some level of validation of this normative data, participants with incident dementia three years after recruitment performed substantially worse on the HVLT-R components at baseline than the overall sample.

The principal limitation of our data concerns its generalizability. Older individuals recruited to the ASPREE study were generally healthy, without dementia and without overt clinical disease. They were thus not fully representative of all older community-dwelling individuals. The participants were however, recruited from a number of metropolitan and regional sites in the United States and Australia, and had varying levels of education. The size of the samples of African-American and Hispanic/Latinos, while considerably smaller than the proportion of whites, are still relatively large compared to previous studies, and enabled age, gender and education stratified normative data to be presented. In comparison, normative data could not be presented for other ethno-racial groups (e.g. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, Native Americans and Asians), due to very low representation in the ASPREE sample.

The large size of the ASPREE study has provided high quality HVLT-R normative data which is presented for healthy, older Australian whites, U.S. whites, U.S. African-Americans and U.S. Hispanic/Latinos, and stratified according to age, gender and education levels. This is the most extensive cognitive normative data available for the HVLT-R in community-dwelling older individuals. The HVLT-R is a brief and easy to administer test of verbal memory, and in older individuals, can be used as part of a brief battery for more severe cognitive deficits or underlying conditions (including Alzheimer’s disease and vascular cognitive impairment). The normative data presented here will thus provide a useful resource for clinicians, as well as researchers.
