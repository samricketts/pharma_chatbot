Chronic pain, one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care, has been linked to restrictions in mobility and daily activities, dependence on opioids, anxiety, depression, sleep deprivation, and reduced quality of life. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative disorder (characterized by a progressive impairment of cognitive functions) in the elderly, is often co-morbid with chronic pain. AD is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders in the aged population. The reported prevalence of chronic pain is 45.8% of the 50 million people with AD. As the population ages, the number of older people who experience AD and chronic pain will also increase. The current treatment options for chronic pain are limited, often ineffective, and have associated side effects. This review summarizes the role of the endocannabinoid system in pain, its potential role in chronic pain in AD, and addresses gaps and future directions.


pmc1. Introduction

Pain is a complex phenomenon that comprises sensory, affective, and cognitive components. Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with or resembling that associated with actual or potential tissue damage. [1]. Chronic pain is defined as pain persisting beyond three months. It is a significant healthcare burden affecting approximately 50 million adults in the US alone [2], with an estimated annual healthcare burden of $600 billion in the United States alone [3]. Chronic pain, one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care, has been linked to restrictions in mobility and daily activities, dependence on opioids, anxiety, depression, sleep deprivation, and reduced quality of life.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60–80 % of dementia cases [4]. In 2020, the estimated cost of caring for and treating people with Alzheimer’s disease was $305 billion. By 2050, these costs are projected to be more than $1.1 trillion.[5] AD is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and one of the most common causes of neurodegenerative dementia in the elderly, and adults over 65 comprise approximately 95% of AD cases [6]. It is characterized by a progressive impairment of cognitive functions. AD is characterized pathologically by extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau.

Among the aging population, cognitive decline, and chronic pain are two significant healthcare burdens affecting the aging population and the healthcare systems and caregivers that support these individuals. [7]. The reported prevalence of chronic pain in AD patients is 45.8% of the 50 million people worldwide [8].

This review will provide a brief overview of chronic pain in aging with and without AD, shared pathology and mechanisms seen in older adults with AD and chronic pain, and explore the therapeutic potential of drugs targeting the endocannabinoid system as a novel treatment avenue.

2. Age, AD, and pain

In 2020, the population aged 60 years and overreach 1.4 billion.[9] By 2050, the world’s population of people aged 60 years and older will double (2.1 billion).[9] In the United States, the population of older individuals (age 65+) is projected to double in the coming decades, from 49 million in 2016 to 99 million in 2060 [10]. Chronic pain in the elderly is a growing concern as the world’s population ages [11]. Indeed, old age (age 65+) is significantly correlated with an increased incidence of chronic pain conditions [2],[12], The most common forms of chronic pain among older adults affect the back, neck, and joints [13],[14],[15]. Despite the increased prevalence of chronic pain in the elderly, some studies have found increased pain thresholds to experimentally induced pain in older adults [16], while other studies show mixed effects in pain thresholds between younger versus older adults [17]. Differences in pain progression, ages, gender, sample size, modalities of evoked pain, intensity, and outcome measures used may account for the discrepancy.

AD is associated with increased chronic pain prevalence [8]. Similarly showing varied responses to experimental pain thresholds, including increased sensitivity [8],[18],[19],[20],[21],[22] and decreased sensitivity [23],[24],[25], which may vary based on the type of painful stimuli and its intensity. The most longitudinal studies of pain in people with dementia revealed that at the time of diagnosis, individuals with dementia reported significantly more pain than individuals without dementia.[26]. Pain prevalence and the increase in its intensity are of particular concern. Currently, a considerable proportion of people with AD and chronic pain likely may not be receiving adequate treatment compared to those without AD. Additionally, pain is a key trigger for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [27],[28] such as agitation and mood disorders, and poorly managed pain in AD can result in overprescribing harmful antipsychotic medications. Additionally, inadequately treated chronic pain can lead to restrictions on daily activity and psychological problems, including depression and anxiety.

Below we summarized some potential mechanisms that may account for the enhanced pain in AD.

3. AD and chronic pain: Shared disease features

3.1. Brain structures.

Given that AD is a brain disease, there is a concern that AD may affect some brain areas involved in pain and, therefore, pain response and the effect of analgesics. AD produces structural and functional brain alterations, including changes in gray matter volume and disrupted functional connectivity between brain networks [29]. Among the areas disrupted by AD are brain areas critical for processing pain information [30]. Among the earliest sites affected by AD are the basal forebrain and medial temporal lobes, areas involved in pain processing, while the sensory cortices responsible for pain perception remain intact [30].

Neuroimaging studies showed that when exposed to experimental pain, subjects with early-stage AD had sustained activity in pain processing regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), suggesting AD patients may have greater difficulty in the cognitive and emotional appraisal of pain, and pain may be more distressing [31]. Similarly, fMRI analysis of networks in experimental pain reveals greater activation of Salience and Default Mode Networks in AD patients compared to healthy controls, which may correlate to greater attention to pain, and increased emotional responsiveness to pain [32]. In addition to the brain structure changes, other shared features between AD and chronic pain include neuroinflammation and mitochondria dysfunction.

3.2. Neuroinflammation

Neuroinflammation is a term used to describe the broad range of immune responses of the central nervous system[33]. Four features of neuroinflammation include increased vascular permeability, leukocyte infiltration, glial cell activation, and increased production of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines [34]. Mechanistically, neuroinflammation drives widespread chronic pain via central sensitization, which can be induced and maintained by cytokines, chemokines, and other glia-produced mediators. Neuroinflammation has a key role in the induction and maintenance of chronic pain [34–36], [37].

Neuroinflammation not only serves as a driving force for chronic pain but is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD [38]. Clinical [39],[40],[41],[42] and preclinical [43],[43] data have shown neuroinflammation in the brains with AD. In AD, neuroinflammation, instead of being a mere bystander activated by emerging senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, contributes as much to the pathogenesis as the plaques and tangles themselves [44],[38]. In AD, microglia can bind to soluble Aβ oligomers and Aβ fibrils, which are thought to be part of the inflammatory reaction in AD [38]. Studies showed that microglial activation contributes to Tau pathology during AD pathogenesis [45],[46],[47],[48].

3.3. Mitochondria

Mitochondria play a critical role in ATP synthesis, redox balance, and many other biological processes, including ion homeostasis, nuclear gene expression, protein turnover, and post-translational modification and apoptosis [49]. In terms of pain, both neuropathic and chronic inflammatory pain models have been associated with neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction, including impaired bioenergetics, calcium overload, oxidative stress, and aldehydic burden [50],[51].

Many lines of evidence suggest that mitochondria have a central role in aging-related neurodegenerative diseases [52]. Abnormal mitochondrial dynamics have been found to be early events in the AD disease process in studies using post-mortem AD brains, AD cell cultures, and AD mouse models [53],[54],[55],[56],[57],[58],[59],[60]. Increased mitochondria fission and reduced fusion can impair mitochondrial dynamics in AD-affected neurons [61,62] ,63]. Other studies using AD neurons revealed that Aβ interacts with The dynamin-related protein (Drp1), with a subsequent increase in free radical production, which in turn activates Drp1 and Mitochondrial fission protein 1 (Fis1), causing excessive mitochondrial fragmentation, defective transport of mitochondria to synapses, provides low synaptic ATP and ultimately leads to synaptic dysfunction[64]. Further studies revealed that phosphorylated tau (p-tau) interacts with Drp1, enhances GTPase Drp1 enzymatic activity, and leads to excessive fragmentation of mitochondria and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD.

Substantial amounts of data have demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction in chronic pain [51],[65],[49],[66],[67].

Taken together, there is a significant overlap in AD and chronic pain and shared mechanisms summarized in Figure 1 that may account for the enhanced pain in AD.

While the current treatment options for chronic pain are limited, often ineffective, and have associated side effects, the simultaneous presence of chronic pain and AD could pose an additional challenge in managing chronic pain (please see section 3). In Figure 2, we summarize the potential mechanism(s) by which pain sensitivity is increased in AD with chronic pain.

Based on this background (section 3), it is unlikely to assume that pain response and analgesic efficacy are the same in older adults with AD versus non-AD. Therefore, chronic pain management in the aged population needs to be addressed with and without AD. This will ensure that 45.8% of the 50 million people worldwide[8] with chronic pain and AD are receiving adequate treatment compared to those without AD.

In the next section, we will explore the endocannabinoid system’s role in pain and AD.

4. The endocannabinoid system’s role in pain and AD

4.1. The cannabinoids and Endocannabinoid System

The endocannabinoid system serves as a broadly acting modulatory system, influencing various processes in the body, with key roles in inflammatory processes and pain modulation. The endocannabinoid system at its core is defined by three main components: 1) the endogenous receptors, 2) the ligands for those receptors known as endocannabinoids, and 3) the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of those endocannabinoids. The two primary cannabinoid receptors, the CB1 and CB2 receptors are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) [68],[69].

Activation of cannabinoid receptors produces an inhibitory effect on cell activity via multiple signaling pathways, including inhibition of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP formation and modulation of potassium and calcium channels [68]. CB1 is expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, and CB1 activation on CNS neurons is responsible for the psychoactive effects associated with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ-9-THC), the primary psychoactive component in Cannabis sativa [70]. In contrast, CB2 shows low expression in CNS neurons under normal conditions but is highly expressed in immune cells and peripheral tissues [71],[72].

The ligands acting on these receptors, known as endocannabinoids, are fatty acid derivatives synthesized on demand and acting in a retrograde manner [73]. The two best-characterized endocannabinoids are 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and 2-arachidonoylethanolamide, also known as Anandamide (AEA) [70],[74].

Levels of these endogenous cannabinoids may be elevated to produce therapeutic effects through the use of inhibitors of the enzymes responsible for their degradation, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) for 2-AG, and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) for AEA [75],[76].

4.2. The Endocannabinoid System and pain

The endocannabinoid system is expressed throughout pain pathways in the CNS, PNS, and neuroimmune system, and cannabinoids have shown beneficial effects in various preclinical models of acute and chronic pain of mixed origins [77]. Cannabinoids may produce analgesic effects through inhibition of pain signaling at the periphery, spinal cord, and brain by either dampening the ascending nociceptive information that initiates the process of pain or producing descending modulation of pain. In the periphery, evidence for inhibition of ascending nociceptive signaling by cannabinoids has been demonstrated via local administration routes such as intraplantar injection. Indeed, in animal pain models, local administration of cannabinoids has been demonstrated to be antinociceptive via both CB1 and CB2 receptors. [78]

In the brain, CB1 receptor agonists (e.g., Δ9-THC, CP 55,940, WIN 55,212–2) activate descending (inhibitory) pain circuits in multiple pain-modulatory regions, including the amygdala [79], periaqueductal gray [80] and rostral ventromedial medulla [81]. Cannabinoids may also relieve pain through their anti-inflammatory effects via CB1, CB2, and other receptors. Selective CB2 receptor agonists show analgesic efficacy in animal inflammatory and neuropathic pain models by inhibiting pro-inflammatory signaling [82]. Additionally, orphan GPCRs such as GPR55 and GPR18 have also been implicated as targets for cannabinoid-mediated antinociception [83],[84].

4.3. The Endocannabinoid System in AD and AD mouse models

The endocannabinoid system has been demonstrated to be altered in AD, and these changes may reflect potential druggable targets to relieve symptomology and alter disease progression. Post-mortem analyses of the frontal cortex from AD patients found a decrease in CB1 expression, an increase in protein nitration of CB1 and CB2—thought to reflect oxidative damage, as well as a decrease in G-protein coupling at the CB1 receptor produced by the agonist 3HWIN55,212–2 [85]. The CB2 receptor was found to be upregulated in activated microglia in neuritic plaques in the parahippocampal cortex, in addition to an increase in FAAH protein levels and activity in plaque-associated astrocytes [86]. Endocannabinoid levels have also been found to be altered in AD patients. Post-mortem studies of AD brains found an increase in the 2-AG synthesizing and degradative enzymes, DAGL and MAGL, in the hippocampus [87], and the prefrontal and temporal cortex, lower levels of anandamide were found, which correlated to an increase in amyloid beta (Aβ) levels [88].

Exogenous cannabinoids have shown beneficial effects in AD models, improving behavioral symptoms through improved clearance of plaques and decreasing neuroinflammation [89]. In addition, centrally acting CB1 receptor agonists have shown beneficial effects in preclinical AD studies, reducing the accumulation of Aβ [90],[91], inhibiting neuroinflammation [92],[93], and improving cognition [94]. However, centrally acting CB1 agonists have known downsides; their ability to impair learning and memory is particularly relevant to AD. Impairments of CB1 agonists in memory are attributed to the high density of CB1 receptors in the hippocampus [95],[96],[97]. Indeed, in the hippocampus, CB1 agonists may reduce long-term potentiation [98],[99], alter firing patterns [100],[101],[102], and decrease acetylcholine release [103], [104]. It is possible, however, that some of these adverse effects are a function of dose and perhaps age that can be avoided. Indeed, in old mice, Δ9THC has been found to have beneficial effects on memory when administered in low doses [94],[105],[106].

CB2 receptor expression has been found to be increased in the post-mortem brains of AD patients [86], [107], while preclinical studies have shown increased CB2 receptor expression in the brain and spinal cord in states of chronic pain and inflammation [108], [109]. The potential role of CB2 receptors as therapeutic targets in AD models has been explored limitedly but with promising results. For example, selective targeting of CB2 receptors with the agonist JWH133 improved cognitive performance, decreased microglial reactivity, and reduced inflammatory cytokines [110]. Additionally, in rats injected in the hippocampus with Aβ, selective targeting of CB2 has been shown to improve cognitive performance by improving Aβ clearance [111]. Moreover, genetic knockout of the CB2 receptor has been found to increase Aβ42 and plaque deposition and increase plaque-associated microglia in the J20 APP AD mouse model [112]. Thus, CB2 could be a target to slow or reverse AD pathology and improve cognition.

5. Potential therapeutic role of cannabinoids in older adults with AD and chronic Pain

Older adults also comprise one of the fastest-growing age groups using cannabis and cannabinoids for medical purposes [113]. Among older adults using cannabis/cannabinoids for medical purposes, relief from chronic pain is overwhelmingly reported as a primary reason for use [114],[115]. Currently, there is no direct information about the use of cannabis/cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain in older individuals with AD. However, there is some evidence showing that the endocannabinoid system may still function in AD and thus has the potential to be a target for therapeutic strategy. For example, the beneficial effects of cannabis/cannabinoids on the physiological, behavioral, and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with AD have been reported. In particular, in individuals with AD, decreased agitation was seen in studies investigating the effects of dronabinol [116], nabilone [117], and Δ9THC-containing cannabis oil [118]. Sleep disturbances are also prevalent in AD, where a bidirectional relationship has been proposed between worsening sleep quality and worsening AD symptomatology [88],[119],[120]. In AD patients, Δ9THC-containing cannabis oil [118] and dronabinol [121] have shown beneficial effects on sleep in addition to decreasing agitation and improving mood.

6. Conclusions, gaps, and future directions.

The reported prevalence of chronic pain is 45.8% of the 50 million people with AD worldwide.[8] Pain may be underestimated in AD patients as they may be unable to communicate their pain, [122] particularly in more severe stages of dementia. As the population ages, the number of older people who experience AD and pain will also increase [123]. The current treatment options for chronic pain are limited, often ineffective, and have associated side effects. Despite rapidly shifting policies affecting access to cannabinoids, the use of cannabis continues to increase among older adults nationally[113] and the high prevalence of chronic pain in AD [8]. To date, there are no data on whether and how the endocannabinoid system is regulated in individuals with AD who have chronic pain. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address these knowledge gaps.
