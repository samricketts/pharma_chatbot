INTRODUCTION

This study examined whether, among subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), women progressed at faster rates than men.

METHODS

We examine longitudinal rates of change from baseline in 398 MCI subjects (141 Females, 257 Males) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1), followed for up to 8 years (mean 4.1±2.5 years) using mixed effects models incorporating all follow ups (mean 8±4 visits).

RESULTS

Women progressed at faster rates than men on ADAS-Cog (p=0.001) and CDR-SB (p=0.003). Quadratic fit for change over time was significant for both ADAS-Cog (p=0.001) and CDR-SB (p=0.004), and the additional acceleration in women was 100% for ADAS-Cog and 143% for CDR-SB. The variability of change was greater in women. The gender effect was greater in ApoE4 carriers.

DISCUSSION

Women with MCI have greater longitudinal rates of cognitive and functional progression than men. Studies to confirm and uncover potential mechanisms appear to be warranted.

1. Introduction

While men may have a greater risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [1], women make up over two-thirds of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients [2]. The higher prevalence of AD in women has been attributed previously to longer female life expectancy or socio-cultural detection biases, but some recent findings [1,3-32] also support an alternate hypothesis - that women at risk progress to AD at faster rates than men due to greater neurobiological vulnerability. The Framingham study found that the age-specific risk of AD was almost two-fold greater in women than men (17.2% versus 9.1% at age 65 years and 28.5% versus 10.2% at age 75 years) [3]. Holland et al. [6] reported that female gender was associated with a greater rate of cognitive change in MCI subjects than men over a 1-year period, raising further questions about what happens over longer periods.

Studies have also begun to examine underlying reasons for a possible sexual dimorphism in rates of decline. A greater potency of the AD risk associated with the Apolipoprotein E4 allele as well as the BDNF Met66 allele has been noted in women [1,5,7,9,11,12]. Other theories proposed to explain gender differences include sex hormones (such as estrogen), smaller head size, lower cognitive reserve, lower levels of exercise in women (at least in the U.S) and differences in occupational or educational attainment. Gender differences in pathological vulnerability for AD are supported by studies noting greater annual 3D tensor based MRI brain atrophy rates in women [4] and a significant association of gender with neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [5]. In one study, equivalent increases in AD pathology increased the odds of clinical AD by twenty-fold for women versus three-fold for men [5]. Collectively these studies argue for more definitive long-term examination of gender differences in MCI rates of progression as well as pathological vulnerability.

The aim of this report was to use 8-year longitudinal data on at risk subjects from a national biomarker study to test the hypothesis that women progress cognitively and functionally at faster rates than men, after covarying for baseline cognition, age, and education. A second aim was to model the long-term trajectories of decline in men versus women to see if the assumptions of linear decline noted by the prior 1-year study [6] held true over a longer period of follow up. The long-term data allowed us to test for both linear and curvi-linear patterns of decline as well as acceleration over time. A third aim was to examine interactions between ApoE genotype and gender on cognitive decline and to see if gender had an effect beyond that conferred by the E4 genotype. Lastly, we examined gender differences in the variability of decline in both cognition and function, using instruments widely used in prevention trials.

2. Methods

2.1 Subjects

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects recruited in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) (adni.loni.usc.edu) were used in our analyses. ADNI (ADNI ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00106899) is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. ADNI-1 originally recruited 398 MCI subjects who then had the option to be followed in ADNI-2. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org. Additional details are also provided in the ADNI-1 Procedures manual [33, 34].

All ADNI-1 MCI subjects were eligible for inclusion. Criteria for classification as MCI in ADNI-1 are as follows: an inclusive Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score from 24-30, subjective memory complaint, objective evidence of impaired memory calculated by scores of the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II adjusted for education, a score of 0.5 on the Global CDR, absence of significant confounding conditions such as current major depressive episode, normal or near normal daily activities, and absence of clinical dementia. For a detailed list of all selection criteria, readers are referred to the ADNI-1 Procedures manual [34]. In addition, data for all of the following parameters were required for subjects included for analysis: baseline age, race, gender, and years of education; baseline MMSE score; ADAS-Cog for at least two different time points, and ApoE genotyping results. ApoE allele genotyping of all subjects was executed using DNA extracted from peripheral blood cells, and details are provided elsewhere [34]. In total, 398 MCI subjects from ADNI-1 were included. The term “baseline” is used to indicate data collected at the subject's first visit (which may be screening or baseline).

2.2 Outcome Measures

The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog 11) is a 70-point scale designed to assess severity of cognitive impairment, and it is commonly used in MCI and Alzheimer's trials. The ADAS-Cog is comprised of 11 tasks that assess learning and memory, language production and comprehension, constructional and ideational praxis, and orientation [4]. Higher scores indicate worse performance, as it is scored based on number of errors.

The Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB), with a range from 0 to 18, is the sum of the ratings for the six domains of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global dementia rating scale. It provides a quantitative assessment of cognitive and functional impairments based on a semi-structured interview of the subject and informant [35]. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.

2.3 Follow up

ADNI MCI subjects were followed through ADNI-1 and then enrolled in ADNI-2. We compared ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB scores from baseline to endpoint (using most recent available scores at the time of our data extraction in late 2014) yielding a study duration of up to 8 years (mean duration 4 years).

2.4 Statistical Analyses (Models)

We fit a quadratic model of the form (as it was found to be a better fit than just a linear model): (1) Aj(t)=μ+βjt+γjt2+εjt

In model (1), Aj(t) is the ADAS-Cog value of subject j at follow up time t. The model explains this in terms of μ, the ADAS-Cog value for subject j at 3.45 years, β, the rate of change in ADAS-Cog and γ, the curvature in the ADAS-Cog trajectory. Finally εjt is measurement error, assumed to have a zero mean Gaussian distribution with SD σe . The curvature parameter captures non-linearity of the trajectories: γ = 0 indicates linear growth, i.e. constant rate of change, γ &gt; 0 indicates that the rate of change is increasing over time while γ &lt; 0 indicates that the rate of change is decreasing over time. The follow up time is centered; the median follow up time (3.45 years) is subtracted from the actual follow up time, to allow the slope and curvature parameters to be estimated approximately independently.

To confirm our findings with regards to slopes and curvatures, a mixed effects model was used to model the effect of gender on cognitive decline, taking into account the effect of confounders, such as baseline MMSE, age, years of education, ApoE4 status on baseline, with outcome being ADAS-Cog, as follows: (2) Ai(t)=μ+bi+αFiIF+αA+iIA++αA++iIA+++αAgeAgei+αEducEduci+αMMSEMMSEi++β0t+βFiIFt+γ0t2+γFiIFt2+βA+iIA+t+βA++iIA++t++γA+iIA+t2+γA++iIA++t2+βAgeAgeit+βEducEducit+βMMSEMMSEit+rit+εit

In the above model, Ai(t) is the ADAS-Cog value of subject i at time t (in years). Model (2) explains this in terms of μ, the baseline ADAS-Cog value for a 75.1 year old male with 16 years of education, MMSE of 27 and of ApoE4 negative. The terms with α are effects of gender, ApoeE status, MMSE, age and years of education on baseline ADAS-Cog values. The terms with β are effects on rates of change and β0 is the baseline rate of change. The terms with γ are effects on curvature and γ0 is the baseline curvature. We include a random effect bi and ri to account for the effect of unmeasured subject factors on the baseline ADAS-Cog value and rate of change respectively: both are assumed to have a zero mean Gaussian distribution with SD σb. Finally εit is measurement error, assumed to have an independent zero mean Gaussian distribution with SD σb. A similar model was fit for CDR-SB. Model 2 was fit by the method of restricted maximum likelihood using the nlme package in the R computing platform (www.r-project.org). In our models, we used the subject's initial MMSE as a covariate to represent baseline cognition; however, gender differences in cognitive decline remained significant when the baseline ADAS-Cog was used as a covariate in the model rather than the MMSE.

3. Results

3.1 Baseline Characteristics

Baseline features of the sample are summarized in Table 1. The mean baseline age and educational level in males were statistically higher than in females (p-value for both variables = 0.03), but the differences were small. There are no significant differences by gender for baseline ADAS, baseline MMSE, number of follow up visits, or follow up length.

3.2 Effect of Gender on ADAS-Cog Change from Baseline

As shown in Table 2 and Figure 1, the quadratic (curvilinear) term was significant for ADAS rate of change (p=0.001). The effect of baseline cognition, ApoE4, and years of education on ADAS-Cog change from baseline was significant, but the effect of age was not (Table 2). There was a significant effect of ApoE4 alleles, both homozygous (carriers of two E4 alleles) and heterozygous (one E4 allele), for ApoE4 on ADAS change (p&lt;0.001), and ApoE4 influenced decline in both genders (Figure 2). After adjusting for baseline cognition, ApoE4, age, and education status, the effect of female gender on ADAS-Cog worsening over time was significant (p&lt;0.001). The annual change in women was 2.7 ADAS points versus 1.5 points in men (Table 2). Female gender contributed an additional 95.7% to baseline curvature. The variability of change in ADAS-Cog tended to be greater in women than in men, for both slope and curvature (Table 4).

3.3 Effect of Gender on CDR-SB Progression over Time

As shown in Table 3 and Figure 3, the quadratic (curvilinear) term was significant for CDR-SB rate of change (p=0.004). The effect of ApoE4 on CDR-SB change was significant (p&lt;0.001), but the effect of age and education did not reach significance. After adjusting for these variables, the effect of female gender on CDR-SB worsening over time was significant (p=0.003). The annual change in women was 0.91 CDR-SB points versus 0.59 points in men. Female gender also had a significant effect on the slope curvature (p=0.004); female gender contributed an additional 143% to baseline curvature.

4. Discussion

This study found a marked gender difference in longitudinal rate of change in ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB in MCI subjects and demonstrates that there is a curvilinear acceleration of rate of change over time (influenced by both gender and ApoE4 status.) Previously, Holland et al. reported a smaller gender difference in a much shorter (1-year) follow up study of MCI subjects [6]. We confirm and extend this to a follow up period of up to 8 years (mean of 4 years). The baseline rate of ADAS change reported in Holland et al (0.49 points/year) was lower than that in our study – likely due to the fact that our much longer follow up allowed us to quantify a curvilinear acceleration of change over time. The similarity of the gender effect on ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB indicates that women have a faster rate of decline in both cognitive performance and functional status. Our models adjusted for age and ApoE4, which correlate substantially with risk for amyloid positive status. Gender differences are present in ApoE4 carriers and noncarriers; however gender effects appear to be greatest in E4 homozygotes, a group at greatest risk for conversion. Overall, these data confirm and extend prior findings [3-6] that women with MCI may have a greater vulnerability for cognitive and functional decline.

The strengths of our study include its use of a relatively large baseline sample size (398 MCI subjects recruited nationally), the employment of specific clinical criteria for amnestic MCI with standardized data collection across multiple sites, and relatively long (mean 4 years) follow-up duration. We focused primarily on MCI subjects originally recruited in ADNI-1 because they had a more traditional form of MCI (i.e. late MCI) whose memory criteria are well established. We did not include any subjects newly recruited in ADNI-Go or ADNI2 with early MCI (EMCI) because they lacked sufficient long-term follow up. One potential limitation is that ADNI MCI subjects are not necessarily representative of the population as a whole and as such are more representative of MCI subjects recruited at research centers or those who have been enrolled into secondary prevention trials. While our mean follow up time of 4 years is longer than that of others addressing this question, it may still not have been long enough to conclusively test for gender differences in rates of conversion to dementia. The rate of conversion from MCI to dementia was slightly higher among women than men but this was not statistically significant. Subjects who progressed to AD dementia were not excluded. All data points on subjects who entered the study as MCI in ADNI-1 were analyzed.

Although ADNI classified subject visits as “annual” (e.g. Year 1, 2, etc), there was considerable variability in actual visit dates. AD does not progress in fixed annual chunks but there is a slow steady progression that is somewhat variable for each subject. Therefore, in our analyses, we used the actual date of the follow up visit for each subject to give a more precise statistical measure of progression and variability (due to drop outs or fluctuations) over time. This is one reason why our figures show dips and peaks (e.g. around Year 6). Attrition biases are possible, but the baseline cognitive status, follow up period, and number of follow up visits were similar between males and females. Lastly, our study cannot determine causality or pathological mechanisms, since we did not look at other biomarkers or genes aside from ApoE4. In this regard, it should be noted that amyloid PET and CSF data are only available in a small fraction of ADNI-1 subjects.

Several different factors could underlie possible gender differences in rates of cognitive progression, including genetic, lifestyle, hormonal, psychological and neurobiological. We found a gender effect after adjusting for the ApoE4 effect, suggesting that additional factors may be at play. Some reports have noted an increased effect of ApoE4 in women; for example, in women, ApoE4 was reported to result in greater conversion risk [11], altered default mode connectivity [12], greater atrophy of hippocampus [30] and greater decrements on delayed word recall [30]. In contrast, Holland et al. did not report a gender by ApoE interaction on brain atrophy [6]. The greater variability of ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB rates of decline in women suggests there could be potential undiscovered genetic causes. In this regards, it is of interest that the Met66 allele of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) gene, which reduces the transport of BDNF, as well as the 219K allele of the ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1(ABCA1) gene have both been linked to increased risk for AD in women [1].

Further analysis should include other genetic factors besides ApoE4 that may be significant to cognitive decline, and ADNI genetic data are now becoming available. Likewise, in a few years we will have access to at least 4 years of ADAS and CDR data from ADNI-2 MCI subjects for our analysis to be replicated, and it should be possible to correlate gender differences in cognitive progression with various biomarkers such as amyloid deposition, cognitive reserve, and brain atrophy rates; ADNI-2 subjects receive MRI scans, florbetapir PET scans, CSF studies and resting state functional MRI. This is highly relevant in light of a prior study which noted that women may be at much greater risk than men for cognitive decline and dementia diagnosis for every one unit of increase in global brain pathology [5]. These data raise the hypothesis that there may be gender differences in cognitive reserve (with men having higher reserve).

Our findings also have relevance for clinical treatment/prevention trials, including Dominant Inherited Alzheimer Network Treatment Units (DIAN-TU), Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative (API), and the Amyloid Lowering Trial in Asymptomatic Individuals (A4 trial). Despite many candidate drugs being in trials, the causes of AD are not fully known and uncovering mechanisms underlying gender differences in cognitive progression may yield additional new treatment targets or non-pharmacologic strategies for risk modification as well as allowing more a personalized intervention. For example, trials of anti-amyloid therapeutics have revealed a greater vulnerability for cerebral adverse events such as ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities) in E4 carriers and many ongoing studies stratify enrollment by E4 and also employ differential treatment dosing by E4. In a similar vein, our findings support a prior call for AD prevention trials to deliberately stratify by sex and to have adequate sample size to test for a therapeutic risk-benefit in men and women separately [1]. One could conceivably also have separate thresholds for efficacy. In addition, differences in variability in the rate of change by gender suggests that unequal numbers of males and females may be required to measure the same effect size. Further, the curvilinear acceleration noted in this study suggests that usual statistical approach in trials of linear models may not be optimal to model MCI disease progression over longer periods. The CDR-SB has been suggested as an acceptable single cognitive/functional endpoint for MCI trials and our data suggest that lower baseline MMSE, female gender and ApoE4 are predictors of faster decline, and sample sizes for various specific effect sizes can be computed using the data. To our knowledge, no prior study has modelled long-term changes in cognition and function in MCI, as well as the effects of covariates, so comprehensively.

In conclusion, our results show a robust gender difference in the rate of change in ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB in MCI subjects, with women declining at much higher rates than men. These findings support prior calls [1,3-5,10-12,36] to make gender-specific research in AD a priority.

Research in Context

Systematic review: The authors reviewed the literature using traditional sources (PubMed, conference abstracts). Women have a higher prevalence of Alzheimer's than men but the reasons are not fully understood. Several recent publications have investigated gender differences in Alzheimer's risk and pathophysiology, and these are cited appropriately.

Interpretation: Women with mild cognitive impairment have significantly greater longitudinal rates of cognitive and functional decline than men. These findings confirm and extend prior reports on gender differences in neurobiological risk for Alzheimer's.

Future directions: Since the ADAS and CDR are used as outcomes in secondary prevention trials, gender differences should be considered in the design and interpretation of such studies. Further studies to replicate and elucidate underlying gender-specific AD genetic and biomarker mechanisms are warranted.
