Introduction

Variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr) is a recently described novel prion disease biochemically characterized by abnormal prion protein (PrP) which has various degrees of sensitivity to proteases and generates a distinct profile on Western blots 1. VPSPr is the second most common sporadic prion protein disease after CJD 2. All reported cases to date have exhibited cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric deficits with an age at onset range of 48-81 years and disease duration range of 7-72 months 1-4. Initial clinical diagnoses included normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 1,5, but Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) often was considered clinically after rapid decline became apparent 1.

All VPSPr cases evaluated have lacked mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP) 1,2,5. Initial reports indicated all cases were homozygous for valine at codon 129 (VV) in PRNP 1. However, more recent reports have found VPSPr in all three codon 129 genotypes 2,5-7.

Here we report a case of VPSPr in which there were no known clinical manifestations of prion disease during life and yet pathognomonic findings were revealed at autopsy.

Methods

The individual described herein was enrolled in an ancillary study of cognitively normal individuals at the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University, St Louis, MO. She had 2 in-person assessments (1996 and 1999), although limited objective testing (Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) 8) was obtained only at initial assessment. At death, her family was administered a postmortem dementia interview to ascertain any cognitive or neurological changes that may have occurred since her last in-person assessment 9. Pre-terminal hospitalization records were also reviewed. Genomic DNA had been extracted from blood during life for APOE genotyping by Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Genetics Core 10.

After death, the brain was examined macroscopically. Paraffin sections from formalin-fixed blocks taken from 12 areas were obtained. These were processed using standard neuropathologic methods including hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and a modified Bielschowsky silver impregnation. Spongiform changes were noted and prompted further detailed evaluation in conjunction with the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC), Case Western University, Cleveland, OH, USA. Monoclonal antibodies used for immunohistochemistry were as follows: phosphorylated tau (PHF-1, a gift of Dr. P. Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA), beta-amyloid (10D5, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA), alpha-synuclein (LB509, Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA), and PrP (3F4, EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA )10.

DNA was extracted from frozen brain tissue for PRNP sequence analysis by the NPDPSC. The PRNP coding region was sequenced to determine the codon 129 genotype and the absence of pathogenic mutations 2. Frozen brain tissue was obtained and sent to the NPDPSC for prion protein characterization by proteinase K (PK) digestion and Western blot analysis 2,10. The brain tissue from the frontal cortex was used for Western blot analysis. Other brain regions were examined including occipital cortex, cerebellum, temporal cortex, striatum, midbrain, thalamus, and substantia nigra, in which much less PK-resistant protein was detected compared to the frontal cortex.

Results

Clinical Assessment

This individual was determined to be cognitively intact during her initial visit at age 87 with a MMSE 29 (only error was that she missed the date by 4 days) 8. Furthermore, she was determined to be cognitively intact at her death at age 93 with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0, 11 as assessed by the retrospective collateral dementia interview (RCDI) 9. The RCDI is a structured telephone interview conducted by a clinician experienced in dementia evaluation with a knowledgeable collateral source. In particular, questions about memory and orientation are asked to elicit the onset, course, and nature of any problems (i.e., recent memory, orientation, and activities of daily living). Because the participant was asymptomatic, no additional clinical studies such as EEG, CSF (14-3-3) or imaging were obtained to evaluate the possibility of prion disease. Specifically, no neurologic abnormalities associated with prion disease were reported 2.

Chart review revealed no known risk factors for prion exposure. There was no family history of dementia. The RCDI was conducted with both her surviving spouse and their daughter, and neither had concerns about her memory and thinking abilities. She was oriented to her home and hometown. She continued to manage the household finances and paid the bills. She maintained her appointments but was less engaged in activities at her retirement home due to physical frailty. She continued to cook and work crossword puzzles. She maintained her activities of daily living and was only occasionally incontinent due to diuretics and physical limitations. She may have been depressed according to family. There was no history of seizures, strokes, unusual movements, tremors, visuospatial deficits, hallucinations, aphasia. This individual transitioned from assisted living to hospice care one month prior to expiration due to end-stage congestive heart failure. Her cause of death was due to inanition and congestive heart failure.

Genetic Findings

Genetic analysis of this individual was performed by the NPDPSC and confirmed both the absence of a mutation in the coding region of PRNP and the codon 129 genotype as being homozygous for methionine (MM). Her APOE genotype was ε3:ε3.

Neuropathology

The fresh, unfixed brain weighed 1,180 g. There was mild atrophy of the frontal lobes and mild to moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles. The amygdala and hippocampus were small in size. The basal ganglia and cerebellum were unremarkable (Figure A). Microscopic examination revealed pathognomonic changes for prion disease: neuronal loss and astrocytosis with spongiform changes in the deeper cortical layers of the frontal, parietal, and temporal neocortices were noted – in areas where initial pathological changes may precede the detection of PrP deposition by immunohistochemistry in CJD 12-14 (Figure B-E, Table). Furthermore, the current case exhibited a distinct and decreased vacuolation (“spongiform change”) profile as compared to sporadic CJD MM and previously described VPSPr MM cases (Figure G) 2. The cerebellum was unremarkable with a well-preserved complement of Purkinje and granule cells and neurons in the dentate nucleus. Weak PrP immunostaining revealed PrP deposits in the neocortex and none in the cerebellum (Figure D, Table). Mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology was noted in the parahippocampal gyrus (Figure E, Table). Western blot analysis of frozen brain tissue from the frontal lobe of this case demonstrated the presence of a five band ladder-like electrophoretic profile of PrP that is fairly resistant to proteinase K (PK) digestion as expected in VPSPr-129MM, and that is distinct from sporadic CJD 2 (Figure F). As no beta-amyloid plaques were present, the neuropathologic diagnosis of AD was excluded 15. However, some neurofibrillary tangles (Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage III) were present in the medial temporal lobe. In conclusion, sufficient neuropathologic and biochemical evidence were present to support the diagnoses of VPSPr.

Discussion

We describe herein the first report of histopathologically diagnosed VPSPr in a 93-year-old individual lacking clinically recognized cognitive, behavioral, or neurologic deficits at the time of death, as based on the RCDI and pre-terminal hospitalization records. Although it is possible that she may have had undetected neurological signs and symptoms, they were not appreciated by her family or her medical team. While other VPSPr cases of long duration have been reported, they were all symptomatic with findings consistent with Parkinson's disease or an underlying psychiatric illness, or else they exhibited myoclonus, ataxia, or aphasia 1,2,4,5,16-18. Our asymptomatic case had no prion disease exposures and had no family history of dementing illnesses.

One possibility is that the autopsy-confirmed VPSPr in our cognitively normal case may have led to symptomatic disease had she continued to live. Pathologically, VPSPr MM typically has medium-sized vacuoles and microplaques in the cerebellum 4. In our case, the characteristic vacuolation pattern found in VPSPr was notably reduced, which suggests overall low pathological burden. PrP grains and plaques were found in the temporal lobe while the cerebellum was normal. There is a VPSPr MV case report with normal cerebellum but that case was also symptomatic with cognitive and visuospatial deficits in the context of coexisting tau, beta-amyloid, and alpha-synuclein lesions 19. It is possible that longer duration was needed in this case to increase vacuole and PrP burden to a threshold at which point symptoms would manifest. In transgenic mouse models an age-dependent accumulation of prions and their infectivity has been shown to be inversely proportional to incubation time 20. Presymptomatic Tg2866 mice sacrificed at 56 days conferred no infectivity to Tg196 mice, but presymptomatic mice sacrificed at 112 days were able to induce disease in the Tg196 mice and after a shorter incubation time than if sacrificed at 84 days 20.

The VPSPr MM subtype also appears to be less prevalent and less severe in disease presentation (less severe histopathology and less prominent PrP immunostaining) when considering that 25 of 28 VPSPr cases in one series had at least one valine (V) allele 2,5. VPSPr MM is characteristically more resistant to PK such that a ladder of fragments persists even after relatively high concentration PK exposure as is seen in our case 2,4-6. Although the brain tissue in this case was not evaluated for infectivity, it is theoretically possible based on animal data 20 that even minimal pathology could be transmissible. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of VPSPr in a cognitively and neurologically intact person and adds to the growing spectrum of prion disease phenotypes.
