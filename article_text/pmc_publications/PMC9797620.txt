Age-related testosterone depletion in men is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). How testosterone modulates AD risk remains to be fully elucidated, although regulation of tau phosphorylation has been suggested as a contributing protective action. To investigate the relationship between testosterone and tau phosphorylation, we first evaluated the effect of androgen status on tau phosphorylation in 3xTg-AD mice. Depletion of endogenous androgens via gonadectomy resulted in increased tau phosphorylation that was prevented by acute testosterone treatment. Parallel alterations in the phosphorylation of both GSK3β and Akt suggest possible components of the underlying signaling pathway. To further explore mechanism, primary cultured neurons were treated with a physiological concentration of testosterone or its active metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Results showed that testosterone and DHT induced significant decreases in phosphorylated tau and significant increases in phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) effectively inhibited androgen-induced increases in Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation, and decreases in tau phosphorylation. In addition, androgen receptor (AR) knock-down by small interfering RNA prevented androgen-induced changes in the phosphorylation of Akt, GSK3β and tau, suggesting an AR-dependent mechanism. Additional experiments demonstrated androgen-induced changes in Akt, GSK3β and tau phosphorylation in AR-expressing PC12 cells but not in AR-negative PC12 cells. Together, these results suggest an AR-dependent pathway involving PI3K-Akt-GSK3β signaling through which androgens can reduce tau phosphorylation. These findings identify an additional protective mechanism of androgens that can improve neural health and inhibit development of AD.

pmcINTRODUCTION

As a normal consequence of aging, testosterone levels in men significantly decline in plasma (Feldman et al., 2002;Gray et al., 1991) and brain (Rosario et al., 2011;Rosario et al., 2004). Age-related testosterone depletion is associated with increased risks of dysfunction and disease in androgen-responsive tissues throughout the body, including brain (Bassil and Morley, 2010). Both animal and human findings indicate that one deleterious consequence of low testosterone in men is increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Lv et al., 2016;Pike, 2017). How androgens modulate AD vulnerability is unclear, although androgens are known to exert several neuroprotective actions that are mediated through a variety of cell signaling pathways (Pike et al., 2009;Siddiqui et al., 2016). Of particular importance to AD, androgens decrease accumulation of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) (Gouras et al., 2000;McAllister et al., 2010;Ramsden et al., 2003;Rosario et al., 2006), one of the two primary lesions that both characterize AD neuropathology and are implicated as driving factors in its progression. The second key lesion in AD is hyperphosphorylated tau, which accumulates in AD brain in a variety of forms including neurofibrillary tangles (Gao et al., 2018;Vinters, 2015). Whether and how androgens regulate tau phosphorylation is not well understood.

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that has a range of actions essential to proper neuronal functioning including stabilization of microtubules and axonal transport (Bodea et al., 2016). Tau is subject to several post-translational modifications, with excessive phosphorylation being most closely linked with pathological changes in tau that disrupt its normal functions, alter it solubility, and contribute to pathology (Gong et al., 2005). Phosphorylated tau species are associated with neurodegeneration and clinical progression of AD (Wang et al., 2013) and, like Aβ, have been a primary target of therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat AD (Congdon and Sigurdsson, 2018). Phosphorylation of tau is primarily regulated by the activities of specific protein kinases and phosphatases. Among these, the kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and cyclin dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) have been identified as key mediators of aberrant tau phosphorylation at disease-associated sites (Kimura et al., 2014;Lauretti et al., 2020;Martin et al., 2013;Sayas and Ávila, 2021;Turab Naqvi et al., 2020). GSK3β is of particular interest as early work in the field demonstrated that GSK3β activity and tau phosphorylation induced by heat shock in the brains of gonadectomized rats were largely prevented by testosterone treatment (Papasozomenos and Shanavas, 2002;Papasozomenos, 1997).

In this study, we examine the effects of androgens on tau phosphorylation using both 3xTg-AD mice and neuron cultures. We also investigate cell signaling pathways contributing to observed androgen effects on tau phosphorylation focusing on the potential contributions of GSK3β and its established upstream signaling pathway phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) (Dudek et al., 1997;van Weeren et al., 1998) in which PI3K activation of Akt results in inactivation of GSK3β (Lesort et al., 1999;Moule et al., 1997;Salkovic-Petrisic et al., 2006).

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Animals and treatments

3xTg-AD mice (Oddo et al., 2003) were bred and maintained in our vivarium under a 12 h light/dark schedule with ad libitum access to rodent chow and water. At age 13 months, male mice 3xTg-AD mice were anesthetized then gonadectomized (GDX) to deplete endogenous testosterone or were sham GDX. Five days after surgery, mice were injected (sc) with canola oil vehicle (n=4–5/group) or testosterone propionate (1 mg/100 g), a dose known to induce androgen effects in GDX male mice (Nikmahzar et al., 2016;Ogawa et al., 1998;Sims et al., 2003). Four hours after hormone treatment, mice were euthanized and hippocampi were quickly harvested and stored at −80°C until processed for western blots. These studies were conducted under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Southern California.

Primary neuron culture

Primary cultures of neurons were prepared from embryonic (gestational day 18) Sprague-Dawley rat pups using an established protocol (Yao et al., 2007). As previously shown, neurons in these cultures exhibit extensive neurite outgrowth (Nguyen et al., 2005;Pike et al., 1997;Yao et al., 2005) but do not exhibit adult level differentiation as indicated by expression of glutamate receptors (Guo et al., 2013;Mattson and Kater, 1988). In brief, dissected cerebral cortices were incubated 5 min in 0.125% trypsin at 37°C, followed by trypsin quenching with 1 volume of DMEM culture medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Cell suspensions were centrifuged (5 min at 200 × g), resuspended in serum-free DMEM, mechanically dissociated by repeated passage through a fire-polished Pasteur pipette, and then filtered through a sterile 40 μm nylon mesh (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cells were plated onto poly-L-lysine (0.05 mg/ml)-coated multi-well plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) at 1.5 × 105 cells/cm2 in serum-free, phenol red-free DMEM buffered with 26 mM bicarbonate, 20 mM HEPES, and supplemented with 100 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 100 μM putrescine, and 30 nM selenium. Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with room air supplemented to 5% CO2 for 3–4 days prior to experimentation. Testosterone and DHT were solubilized in 100% ethanol and diluted with media containing 3% bovine serum albumin to yield a final ethanol concentration of 0.1%. Across experiments, all groups received matching vehicle treatments. All neuron culture experiments were repeated at least three times using independent culture preparations.

Construction of AR expression plasmid

Rat AR cDNA was generously provided by Dr L. Q. Xiao (Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai, China). A 2820-bp BamHI-XbaI fragment of the full-length AR cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Empty pcDNA3 vector or pcDNA3-AR was transformed into Escherichia coli (strain DH5α, Invitrogen). Plasmids were prepared using Qiagen Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).

Generation of AR cell lines

Pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) generously provided by Dr. B. Lau (Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA) and were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 10% horse serum/5% FBS without antibiotics. PC12 cells at 60% confluence were transfected with 1 μg/mL pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-AR plasmid using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 h, the cultures were rinsed and 300–500 μg/mL G418 (Invitrogen) was added to the medium to select for monoclonal cells stably expressing transfected gene. Clonal lines were amplified in G418-containing medium for 3–4 weeks.

PC12 cultures

Wild-type PC12 (wtPC12), empty pcDNA3 vector transfected control PC12 (ctrlPC12), and AR transfected PC12 (ARPC12) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% FBS, and 200 μg/ml G418 (except for wild-type). To achieve a neuron-like phenotype (Fujita et al., 1989), PC12 cells were cultured for 7 d in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml of nerve growth factor and 1% horse serum. Prior to experimentation, PC12 cells were passaged and re-plated onto poly-L-lysine-treated 12-well plates at densities of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2. After 24 h, cultures were switched to serum-free medium for 24 h before experimental treatments. Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C in room air with 5% CO2. All PC12 culture experiments were repeated at least three times using independent culture preparations.

Design and transfection of small interfering RNAs

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) that targets androgen receptor (AR) was designed using the target finder and design tool (Ambion, Austin, TX). The target mRNA sequence of the siRNA is 5’-AACUUGCAUGUGGAUGACCAG-3’, corresponding to nucleotides 2128–2148 of AR gene. As a negative control, a scrambled siRNA was designed consisting of the same nucleotide composition as the specific AR siRNA but lacking significant homology to the genome. As an additional negative control, a mismatched siRNA was used in which two bases in the specific AR siRNA were modified to make them noncomplementary to the target mRNA. The antisense and sense template DNA oligonucleotides for each siRNA, plus T7 promoter 5’-CCTGTCTC-3’ to the 3’ end, were chemically synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) and were as follows: siRNA targeting AR (siAR), 5’-AACTGGTCATCCACATGCAAG-3’, 5’-AACTTGCATGTGGATGACCAG-3’; noncomplementary siRNA (ncAR), 5’-AACATGCTGACTAGCTACGCA-3’, 5’-AATGCGTAGCTAGTCAGCATG-3’; mismatched siRNA (mmAR), 5’-AACTGGCTATCCACATGCAAG-3’, 5’-AACTTGCATGTGGATAGCCAG-3’. The synthesized template DNA was in vitro transcribed into double-strand siRNA using the Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion). siRNA transfection with siPORT Amine (Ambion) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Gene expression

Gene expression levels were determined by reverse transcriptase PCR performed using a standard protocol, as described previously (Yao et al., 2005). In brief, total cellular RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed into the cDNA using the Superscript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Next, 1 μl of reverse transcription product was mixed with 2.5 U of JumpStart TaqDNA polymerase (Sigma), 20 pmol each of sense and antisense primers in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 mM of each dNTP in a volume of 50 μl. The primers used in this experiment were as follows: 5’-AAGCAGGTAGCTCTGGGACA-3’, 5’-GTAGTCCAACGGGTTCTCCA-3’ for rat AR, and 5’-AGCCATGTACGTAGCCATCC-3’, 5’-CTCTCAGCTGTGGTGGTGAA-3’ for β-actin (internal control). Primers were chemically synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies). The PCR cycles consisted of initial incubation at 94°C for 1 min; denaturation at 94°C for 30 s; annealing at 52°C for 30 s; and extension at 72°C for 1 min, for 30 cycles, and final extension at 72°C for 3 min. RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.7% agarose gels and visualized under UV light after ethidium bromide staining.

Western blot

Homogenates were prepared from frozen hippocampi using T-PER® tissue protein extraction reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) in the presence of Halt™ protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce). The final protein concentrations in extracts were determined using a standard Bradford assay. Total cell lysates were processed using a standard protocol described previously (Pike, 1999). Hippocampal homogenates or cell culture lysates were diluted into reducing sample buffer, electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 120 V in 12% polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Medford, MA) at constant voltage (100 V) for 1 h. After blocking of nonspecific binding (1 h incubation in 10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween, 3% bovine serum albumin), membranes were incubated with primary antibody, which included AT8 (1:1000), AT270 (1:200) (Pierce), phospho-Akt (Ser473; 1:1000), phospho-GSK3β (Ser9; 1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), Cdk5 (C-8; 1:500), p35 (C-19; 1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), androgen Receptor (PG-21; 1:500) (Millipore). After rinsing (6 times at 5 min each in 10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were incubated in the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL). To detect total Akt, GSK3β, Cdk5 and tau or verify equal loading of protein across conditions, membranes were stripped (5 min in 100 mM glycine, pH 2.5; and then 5 min in 62.5 mM Tris, 2% SDS, 0.7% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.7, at 60°C) and reprobed with primary antibodies against Akt (1:1000), GSK3β (27C10; 1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology), Cdk5 (C-8) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Tau5 (1:500), or β-tubulin (1:500) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Blots were quantified by band densitometry of scanned films using NIH Image 1.61 software. Background labeling was corrected by subtracting signal collected in the open area above each lane, using a separate background for each lane to control for the possibility of variation across the blots. For levels of phospho-specific proteins, the ratio of phosphorylated to total protein was determined. Data are presented graphically as a percentage of values from control conditions.

Statistical analyses

Raw data were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by between-group comparisons using Fisher’s least significant difference test. Statistical significance was indicated with a value of p &lt; 0.01 for all analyses.

RESULTS

Androgens regulate the phosphorylation of tau, GSK3β, and Akt in 3xTg-AD mice

We first examined whether androgen levels affect tau phosphorylation in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD at an age known to be associated with the formation of hyperphosphorylated tau pathology (Oddo et al., 2003). Depletion of endogenous testosterone by GDX of male mice was associated with 2–3 fold increases in hippocampal levels of phosphorylated tau recognized by phospho-specific tau antibodies AT270 and AT8 but with no change in total tau as indicated by the pan tau antibody Tau5 (Figs. 1A–C). Preliminary studies showed reduced tau phosphorylation following both one- and four-hour testosterone treatment, with stronger effects at four hours (data not shown). Analysis of GDX mice with four-hour testosterone treatment showed decreases in phosphorylated tau (Figs. 1A–C). GSK3β and Cdk5 are major kinases involved in tau phosphorylation (Plattner et al., 2006). To assess if androgens regulate the activation of GSK3β, we investigated the alteration of GSK3β activity by measuring its Ser9-phosphorylation (p-GSK3β). Western blotting (Fig. 1D) and densitometry measures (Fig. 1E) showed that p-GSK3β levels were significantly decreased in hippocampi from androgen depleted GDX mice. However, GDX mice treated with testosterone for 4 h showed a significant inhibition of androgen depletion-induced decrease in the level of p-GSK3β. Cdk5 is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic Cdk5 subunit and a ~25 kDa regulatory subunit (Lew et al., 1995). The p25 subunit is a proteolytic fragment of a ~35 kDa protein and is an activator of Cdk5 kinase activity (Patrick et al., 1999). We tested whether androgen modulated the expression of Cdk5 and the levels of p25 and p35. Quantitative analyses of Western blots (Fig. 1D) and showed GDX and testosterone treatment affected neither the steady-state levels of Cdk5 (Fig. 1F) nor the levels and ratio of p25 and p35 (Fig. 1G).

Inhibition of GSK3β signaling is indicated by phosphorylation of Ser9 that is driven by a cascade of upstream signaling pathways including activation of PI3K and Akt (Cross et al., 1995). To explore whether androgens affect neuronal activation of Akt, we examined the alteration of Ser473-phosphorylation (p-Akt), which is positively associated with its activation. We observed that GDX in 3xTg-AD mice was associated with decreased levels of p-Akt. Conversely, acute testosterone treatment prevented the GDX-induced decrease in p-Akt (Fig. 1H, I).

Androgens regulate the phosphorylation of tau, GSK3β, and Akt in primary neurons

Next, we used primary cultured neurons to allow detailed investigation into the mechanisms underlying androgen regulation of tau phosphorylation. Cultures were treated with a physiological concentration (10 nM) of testosterone (Fig. 2A–C) or its potent androgen metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (Fig. 2D–F) for times ranging from 5 min to 24 h, then processed for Western blot using phospho-specific (AT270, AT8) and total tau (Tau5) antibodies. We observed that cultures exposed to testosterone or DHT exhibited significant decreases in the levels of phosphorylated tau recognized by AT270 and AT8. Quantification of Western blots showed that the decreases of phosphorylated tau became significant within 15 min and remained reduced through 24 h (Fig. 2B, C, E, F). Re-probing immunoblots with Tau5 antibody showed that total tau levels were maintained across conditions, verifying a specific effect on tau phosphorylation.

To assess the potential role of GSK3β signaling in androgen regulation of tau phosphorylation, we first assessed the effects of androgens on inhibition of GSK3β by monitoring changes over time in levels of p-GSK3β. Western blotting (Fig. 3A, F) and quantitative analysis (Fig. 3B, G) showed that testosterone (Fig. 3A, B) and DHT (Fig. 3F, G) significantly increased p-GSK3β, but did not alter total GSK3β protein levels, indicating that androgens induced phosphorylation (i.e., inactivation) of GSK3β. While the time courses were similar, increased GSK3β phosphorylation remained significant at 24 h for DHT (Fig. 3B) but not testosterone (Fig. 3B). Neither testosterone (Fig. 3C–E) nor DHT (Fig. 3H–J) significantly affected levels of Cdk5 or the ratio of p25 and p35.

The inhibition of GSK3β through phosphorylation of Ser9 may be driven by a cascade of upstream events that includes the activation of PI3K and Akt (Cross et al., 1995). To explore whether androgens affect neuronal activation of Akt, we examined the level of p-Akt. Results showed that treatment of neuron cultures with testosterone (Fig. 4A, B) or DHT (Fig. 4C, D) triggered phosphorylation of Akt that reached its maximum at 5 min, and remained significantly elevated for 6 h with testosterone and 24 h for DHT. This activation of Akt in response to androgens did not alter total Akt protein levels. These results indicated that androgens activate Akt pathways.

Androgen regulation of tau phosphorylation is dependent upon a PI3K-Akt-GSK3β signaling pathway

Androgens have been reported to induce Akt activation by both PI3K-dependent (Baron et al., 2004;Sun et al., 2003) and PI3K-independent (Cinar et al., 2007) pathways. To investigate the involvement of PI3K in the observed androgen activation of Akt, we examined the effect of pharmacological inhibition of PI3K. Neuron cultures were pretreated with 10 μM PI3K inhibitor LY294002 followed by treatment with 10 nM testosterone or DHT for 30 min and 3 h. Quantitative analyses (Fig. 5B, D) of western blots (Fig. 5A, C) showed that pretreatment with LY294002 completely blocked the androgen-induced phosphorylation of Akt at both time points. These results demonstrate that androgen-induced Akt activation occurred in a PI3K-dependent manner.

Next, we asked whether PI3K-Akt signaling is upstream of the androgen-induced inactivation of GSK3β. Neuron cultures were pretreated with LY294002 for 60 min, followed by treatment with 10 nM testosterone or DHT for 30 min or 3 h. Western blot analyses showed that LY294002 blocked testosterone- (Fig. 6A, B) and DHT- (Fig. 6C, D) induced phosphorylation of GSK3β, whereas total levels of GSK3β did not significantly vary across the experimental conditions. We further asked whether PI3K-Akt signaling is involved in androgen-induced decreases of tau phosphorylation. Neuron cultures were pretreated with 10 μM LY294002 for 60 min, followed by exposure to testosterone or DHT for 30 min or 3 h. Western blot analyses showed that LY294002 treatment significantly suppressed testosterone- (Fig. 7A–C) and DHT-(Fig. 7D–F) induced reductions in phosphorylation of tau recognized by antibodies AT270 and AT8. These results demonstrate that androgen-induced inactivation of GSK3β and reduction of tau phosphorylation are dependent upon PI3K-Akt signaling.

Androgen regulation of PI3K-Akt-GSK3β signaling and tau phosphorylation are AR-dependent

Although testosterone can by converted by the enzyme aromatase into estradiol (which activates estrogen receptors), DHT is not a substrate for aromatase and is largely androgenic, suggesting that the observed androgen effects on PI3K-Akt-GSK3β signaling and tau phosphorylation are likely dependent on the androgen receptor (AR). To experimentally interrogate the role of AR, we first used knockdown of AR expression via siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Neuron cultures were transfected with siRNA directed against AR or with mismatched or noncomplementary AR siRNA for 2 d. PCR analyses show that AR mRNA was significantly reduced by the specific siRNA but not by either of the two control siRNAs (Fig. 8A). Western blot analyses revealed similar effects of the siRNA on AR protein levels with a decrease of 84% 2 d after transfection in comparison with noncomplementary siRNA control (Fig. 8B, C). These results demonstrate that the designed AR siRNA had strong inhibitory effects on AR expression at the mRNA and protein levels.

To examine the effect of AR suppression on androgen-induced activation of Akt, inactivation of GSK3β, and reduced tau phosphorylation, neuron cultures were treated for 3 h with 10 nM testosterone or DHT 2 d after siRNA transfection. In comparison with both the noncomplementary and mismatched siRNA conditions, AR siRNA significantly inhibited testosterone and DHT-induced increases in Akt (Fig. 8D, E) and GSK3β (Fig. 8F, G) phosphorylation and decreases in tau phosphorylation recognized by AT270 (Fig. 8H,I) and AT8 (Fig. 8H, J).

In a second approach to investigate the role of AR in regulation of PI3K-Akt-GSK3β signaling and tau phosphorylation, we generated lines of neuron-like PC12 cells with and without AR. We transfected PC12 cells with pcDNA3 vector containing AR to generate cell lines stably expressing AR (ARPC12) and compared these with cells stably transfected with empty pcDNA3 vector (ctrlPC12) or non-transfected wild-type PC12 cells (wtPC12). As expected, AR expression at both the mRNA (Fig. 9A) and protein (Fig. 9B) levels was absent in both wtPC12 and ctrlPC12 control lines but present in the AR-transfected ARPC12 line. Next, we compared phosphorylation of Akt, GSK3β, and tau in response to testosterone and DHT in ctrlPC12 (Fig. 9C, D) versus ARPC12 (Fig. 10) cell lines. Cultures were treated with 10 nM testosterone or DHT for 10 min – 24 h and processed for Western blot using phospho-specific and total Akt, GSK3β and tau antibodies. In comparison with vehicle-treated control conditions, testosterone and DHT increased levels of phosphorylated Akt and GSK3β, and decreased levels of phosphorylated tau in AR-expressing ARPC12 cells (Fig. 10) but not in AR-negative ctrlPC12 cells (Fig. 9C, D). These results demonstrate that androgen-induced activation of Akt, inactivation of GSK3β, and decrease of tau phosphorylation occur in an AR-dependent manner.

DISCUSSION

The present findings provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that androgens significantly reduce tau phosphorylation. While precise regulation of phosphorylation is important for tau’s normal cellular functions, aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation is believed to disrupt several cellular processes and contribute to neurodegeneration associated with AD and other tauopathies (Congdon and Sigurdsson, 2018;Gong et al., 2005). In male 3xTg-AD, we observed that androgen depletion increased tau phosphorylation as well as decreased phosphorylation of both GSK3β and Akt, suggesting the possibility of an Akt-GSK3β regulatory pathway. Acute in vivo testosterone treatment reversed these effects, yielding decreased tau phosphorylation at both Ser202/Thr205 (AT8 antibody) and Thr181 (AT270 antibody), locations associated with tauopathies. Complementary cell culture experiments showed similar but more detailed findings, demonstrating that testosterone and DHT reduce tau phosphorylation by rapidly inducing an AR-dependent pathway that involves PI3K and Akt activation and subsequent inactivation of GSK3β, a key kinase in pathological tau phosphorylation.

Androgen-mediated inhibition of tau phosphorylation is a neuroprotective action that may contribute to established relationships between testosterone, neural health, and AD risk. Our findings predict that low testosterone would create an environment that promotes tau phosphorylation. This possibility is consistent with recent observations in humans which showed that lower plasma testosterone was associated with significantly increased cerebrospinal levels of phosphorylated tau in a sample of cognitively normal, mild cognitively impaired, and AD persons (Sundermann et al., 2020). This finding was observed not only in men but also in women, for which the relationship was particularly strong in the presence of the AD genetic risk factor apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (Sundermann,Panizzon,Chen,Andrews,Galasko and Banks, 2020). Interestingly, prior works have also indicated that the neural effects of testosterone can interact with apolipoprotein E genotype (Holland et al., 2011;Panizzon et al., 2010)

Our findings corroborate and extend prior experimental evidence that androgens decrease tau phosphorylation. Early work by Papasozomenos first demonstrated the relationship by showing tau phosphorylation resulting from heat shock was reduced by testosterone in both male (Papasozomenos, 1997) and female (Papasozomenos and Shanavas, 2002) GDX rats. Interestingly, testosterone treatment also was associated with a decrease in the activity of GSK3β but not Cdk-5 (Papasozomenos and Shanavas, 2002), which is consistent with our findings. More recently, Yang and colleagues showed that testosterone treatment in neonatal male mice and cultured hippocampal neurons decreased tau phosphorylation induced by anesthesia exposure (Yang et al., 2021). We previously reported that levels of AT8-positive, tangle-like neurons in male 3xTg-AD mice were significantly increased several months following GDX, an effect that was significantly reduced by prolonged testosterone exposure (Rosario et al., 2010). Perhaps in contrast to predicted extrapolations of the current data, we found that the protective effect of testosterone was mimicked by its estrogen metabolite 17β-estradiol but not its androgen metabolite DHT (Rosario et al., 2010). In Papasozomenos’ heat shock paradigm, estrogens did not reduce tau phosphorylation in female rats (Papasozomenos, 1997) though prior works in cultured cells and female rodents have demonstrated that estrogens can inhibit GSK3β and/or reduce tau phosphorylation (Alvarez de la Rosa et al., 2005;Cardona-Gomez et al., 2004;Carroll et al., 2007;Goodenough et al., 2005;Muñoz-Mayorga et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2008). There are numerous differences in the models and methodologies of these studies that may contribute to the varying outcomes, including age, sex, and exposure period. Further, the models vary by the presence or absence of other neuronal stressors (e.g., β-amyloid), which in turn can be mitigated to varying extents by the neuroprotective actions of androgens (Pike et al., 2008). Another complicating factor is the large number of neuroactive metabolites of testosterone and their extensive network of associated receptor systems and signaling pathways.

In elucidating the mechanism of testosterone inhibition of tau phosphorylation, we considered the complexity of testosterone-associated actions. First, we observed strikingly similar outcomes with testosterone and its androgen metabolite DHT, both of which bind and activate AR as their primary mechanism of action. In the one experiment when testosterone and DHT were directly compared (Fig. 7), the magnitudes of their responses across outcomes were nearly the same. DHT is produced from testosterone by the actions of the enzyme 5α-reductase (Martini et al., 1996). Recent work by MacLusky’s group has shown that inhibition of 5α-reductase by the pharmacological inhibitor finasteride worsened pathological measures in male 3xTg-AD mice including tau phosphorylation (Mendell et al., 2020). Although these findings are consistent with an important role of DHT and subsequent AR activation, they do not exclude the possibility of significant contributions by other 5α-reduced metabolites such as 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol that are known to exert a range of neural effects (Frye, 2010). To directly address the role of AR, we used two complementary strategies: knockdown of existing AR and induced expression of in AR null cells. In cultured hippocampal neurons with high endogenous AR, we observed that AR-specific RNA interference blocked the abilities of testosterone and DHT to induce PI3K-Akt-GSK3β signaling and reduce tau phosphorylation. Next using neuronally-differentiated PC12 cells, we found that testosterone and DHT activated PI3K-Akt-GSK3β signaling and decreased tau phosphorylation only in a cell line stably transfected with AR but not in the control line lacking AR and transfected with empty vector. Given the rapid time course of the observed androgen effects, our results suggest involvement of membrane-associated AR. Like other steroid receptors, AR mediates its effects by both a classic genomic mechanism involving translocation of cytoplasmic AR to the nucleus and interaction with specific DNA response elements as well as activation of membrane-associated AR that drives Akt and MAPK pathways via activation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src and G-proteins (Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2021). Collectively, our cell culture data demonstrate a dependence on AR for the observed regulation of tau phosphorylation.

Downstream of AR, we considered potential roles of both GSK3β and Cdk5, the two kinases most implicated in pathological tau hyperphosphorylation (Gao et al., 2018). Our findings indicated no evidence of Cdk5 involvement, but dependence on GSK3β. Unlike most protein kinases, GSK3β is normally constitutively active in cells, and is primarily regulated through inhibition (Doble and Woodgett, 2003). GSK3β is inhibited via phosphorylation at a specific residue (Ser9), which allows the N terminus of the GSK molecule to bind within its own active-site-binding pocket. GSK3β is a downstream element of PI3K-Akt signaling in which PI3K activates Akt that in turn inactivates GSK3β by stimulating inhibitory phosphorylation of the kinase at Ser9 (Lesort et al., 1999;Moule et al., 1997;Salkovic-Petrisic et al., 2006). Akt requires phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 to be activated, though the phosphorylation of Thr308 is mainly constitutive while the phosphorylation of Ser473 is highly inducible. Thus, the activation of Akt is almost exclusively measured by Ser473 phosphorylation (Downward, 1998;Persad et al., 2001). Prior studies have reported androgen activation of Akt in numerous cell types, including human MCF7 breast cancer cells (Sun et al., 2003), androgen-sensitive epithelial cells (Baron et al., 2004), and neural progenitor cells (La Rosa et al., 2021). To explore whether androgens affect neuronal activation of Akt, we assessed Ser473-phosphorylation (p-Akt). Our results showed that depletion of endogenous androgens in 3xTg-AD mice resulted in a significant decrease of p-Akt, and this GDX-induced decrease was reversed by testosterone supplementation, indicating androgen activation of Akt in brain. Prior reports have varied on whether that androgen activation of Akt is dependent (Baron et al., 2004;La Rosa et al., 2021) or independent (Cinar et al., 2007) of upstream PI3K activation. To clarify whether androgen-induced Akt activation involves PI3K, we used LY294002, a selective PI3K inhibitor (Vlahos et al., 1994). Our culture results showed that pretreatment with LY294002 completely blocked androgen-induced phosphorylation of Akt. This result suggests that androgen-induced Akt activation occurred in PI3K-dependent manner. Further studies found that LY294002 blocked the androgen-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9, and phosphorylation of tau at the epitopes recognized by AT270 and AT8. Our findings are consistent with observations in cardiac myocytes in which testosterone decreases GSK3β via activation of a pathway involving PI3K-Akt signaling (Duran et al., 2016). Together, our findings demonstrate that androgens induce an AR-dependent, PI3K-Akt pathway that results in reduced activation of GSK3β and decreased of tau phosphorylation.

In summary, these studies provide new evidence that androgens reduce tau phosphorylation. Importantly, the results also define the underlying mechanism, which involves rapidly-acting, AR-dependent activation of a PI3K-Akt-GSK3β signaling pathway. Combined with the established ability of androgens to inhibit Aβ formation, these findings suggest that the relationship between low testosterone and increased AD risk in men likely involves the loss of protective androgen actions that inhibit formation of the two primary pathological lesions in AD, accumulation of Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau. Unclear is the extent to which these protective androgen actions can be exploited for the prevention and or treatment of AD and related disorders. The development of selective androgen receptor modulators, which have shown neuroprotective efficacy in preclinical models (George et al., 2013;Jayaraman et al., 2014) represents a potentially powerful interventional approach that would reduce potential risks of current androgen therapies. However, recent clinical findings have shown limited efficacy of testosterone therapy in aging men across systems (Snyder et al., 2018). Thus, while advances in our understanding of protective androgen actions have strong therapeutic promise, additional work is needed to effectively translate these findings for clinical use.
