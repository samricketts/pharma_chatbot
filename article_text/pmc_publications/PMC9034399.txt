pmcIntroduction

The accuracy with which claims-based diagnostic codes capture Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) may vary across healthcare settings,1 thereby affecting the validity of research, risk-adjustment, or population-health management strategies predicated upon these measures. Ascertainment of ADRD using diagnostic codes from hospital encounters may be biased by fragmented access to relevant clinical information, the impact of acute illness on cognition,2–4 and the inclusion of problematic diagnostic codes within common claims-based definitions of ADRD. Indeed, delirium, a potential neuropsychiatric complication of hospitalization,5 may be conflated with dementia and is included in the common Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) claims-based definition of ADRD. To illustrate, we described the performance of the CCW ADRD definition in discriminating clinician-adjudicated disease status across healthcare settings.

Methods

We used longitudinal, individual-level data from the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Accountable Care Organization to construct a cohort of 37,200 Medicare beneficiaries whom we observed from 01/01/2016–12/31/2018,6 as approved by the MGB Institutional Review Board. Additional methodological details of our inclusion criteria, sample, and reference standard construction are available in a prior publication.6 We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.

Three expert clinicians reviewed electronic health record data to adjudicate ADRD status. We compared beneficiaries’ clinician-adjudicated classification with their qualifying claims-based dementia diagnoses under the CCW ADRD definition. We classified beneficiaries meeting CCW criteria, but without ADRD on the review of the electronic record as “false-positives,” and those with clinician-adjudicated ADRD as “true-positives.”

We described the characteristics of true- and false-positives based on the healthcare setting in which their qualifying CCW ADRD diagnostic codes were documented: a) hospital-only claims; b) outpatient-only claims; or c) claims from ≥2 distinct health care settings (hospital, emergency department, outpatient, skilled nursing facility, home health carrier, and hospice). We estimated three logistic models in which we regressed clinician-adjudicated dementia on the CCW classification of ADRD for each healthcare setting subgroup. We reported the prevalence of true- and false-positives, as well as the mean and 95% confidence interval for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). We summarized the prevalence of the most frequently assigned diagnostic claims under the CCW ADRD definition by setting.

Results

Table 1 displays the characteristics of the 3873 beneficiaries with claims-based diagnoses meeting the CCW ADRD definition.

Among beneficiaries with hospital-only ADRD diagnoses (n=566), 69% were false-positives, as compared to 52% of beneficiaries with outpatient-only diagnoses (n=455), and 23% of beneficiaries with diagnoses from at least two distinct healthcare settings (n=490) (Table 2). The accuracy of the CCW definition was poorest among beneficiaries with hospital-only ADRD diagnoses (AUROC 0.51, 95% CI: 0.49–0.52). Accuracy improved somewhat for those with outpatient-only ADRD diagnoses (AUROC 0.57, 95% CI: 0.54–0.60) and substantially for diagnoses from multiple distinct healthcare settings (AUROC 0.81, 95% CI: 0.78–0.84).

The most common diagnostic codes among false positives were either noncognitive (e.g., age-related physical debility) or corresponded to distinct neuropsychiatric syndromes (e.g., delirium) across each healthcare setting.

Discussion

Greater than two-thirds of beneficiaries whose CCW ADRD diagnoses were present only within hospital claims were classified as false-positives by the reference standard. When operationalized using hospital-only diagnoses, the CCW ADRD definition performed no better than chance in discriminating clinician-adjudicated dementia status. This setting-dependent decrement in diagnostic accuracy is consistent with the known challenges of discerning ADRD during hospital encounters.4 Caution is warranted in the interpretation of research findings, risk-adjustment, or population health management interventions predicated upon hospital-only ADRD diagnoses. The incorporation of metadata regarding the setting or frequency of diagnostic claims could improve the accuracy with which ADRD is ascertained for research, population health, or reimbursement purposes.
