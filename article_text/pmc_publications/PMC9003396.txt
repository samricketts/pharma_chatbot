Social determinants of health (SDH) may be associated with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), which is a precursor for Alzheimer’s disease. The main aims of this study were to examine the association between SDH and SCD; to determine if there is an indirect pathway between SDH, depression, and SCD; and to examine the related gender and racial/ethnic disparities. Cross-sectional data were obtained from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (N=6,509; 2530 men and 3978 women aged ≥45). Path analyses (stratified by gender and race) were used to determine the relationship between an SDH index, depression, and SCD. After controlling for gender, age, income, education, employment, and other health-related behaviors, SDH were positively associated with SCD among the overall population, men and White populations. SDH were associated with depression, and depression was associated with SCD among men, women, White and Black populations. After adjustment for confounders, the indirect pathway between SDH, depression, and SCD was statistically significant for men (β=0.035, p&lt;0.001), women (β=0.040, p&lt;0.001), White (β=0.034, p&lt;0.001) and Black (β=0.036, p=0.026) populations. Gender and racial/ethnic disparities existed in the relationship between SDH, depression, and SCD. Future research should assess alternative mediational pathways between SDH and SCD.


pmcIntroduction

Social determinants of health (SDH) are the varying daily and economic conditions in which people are born, develop, and age that impact a person’s overall health and well-being (World Health Organization, 2020). These SDH are accountable for health inequities that vary considerably depending on race and gender. These differences have been constructed on a social, environmental and economic level, which means these factors can be modified to promote fair and equal health outcomes (O’Brien, 2019). SDH may also include employment (Ahonen et al., 2018), education (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2020), and income (CDC, 2020a). There are evident racial/ethnic disparities in SDH, with non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native participants experiencing higher rates of poverty (25.4%, 22.6%, and 26%, respectively), lower education attainment rates (20%, 15%, and 14%, respectively), and higher rates of uninsured individuals (11%, 19.5% and 21%, respectively) compared to non-Hispanic White and Asian participants (Singh et al., 2017).

SDH, such as access to health care and discrimination, can increase the risk of mental health issues (Allen et al., 2014). Individual and household-level social and demographic factors, such as race/ethnicity, gender, education, and income are key predictors and mediators of mental health status. Furthermore, there are consistent disparities between races regarding the prevalence of depression due to factors such as parent’s educational attainment and household income, which influenced overall reported depressive symptoms in a culturally diverse study sample of adolescents in high school (Respress et al., 2013). Other SDH, such as housing and food insecurities, have been associated with mental distress and depression (Liu et al., 2014). These studies have examined the association between SDH and depression but did not assess the potential role of subjective cognitive decline or memory impairment.

Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is defined as a person’s perceived decline in memory or other cognitive abilities compared to their prior self-reported performance level, without receiving a diagnosis of any type of neurodegenerative disease (Rabin et al., 2017). Factors contributing to SCD include age (M. J. Brown et al., 2020), education (M. J. Brown et al., 2020), genetic factors (APOE e4) (Ali et al., 2018), comorbidities (cardiometabolic illnesses) (Taylor et al., 2020), and modifying factors (e.g. smoking (Joo et al., 2021), physical activity (Joo et al., 2021), stress (Jenkins et al., 2021; Joo et al., 2021) and sleep (Joo et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021). SCD can be a precursor of Alzheimer’s disease (Studart &amp; Nitrini, 2016) and mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety. SCD can also affect one’s emotional status, social functioning, and overall quality of life (Brigola et al., 2015; Rabin et al., 2017).

Depression has been associated with the risk of acquiring dementia or other cognitive disorders (Balash et al., 2013). Indeed, research has shown that depression can impair memory and attention, especially among older adults (Perini et al., 2019). As depression and its symptoms increase, research has shown that SCD increases, as well as memory complaints (Hohman et al., 2011). However, there is a lack of studies examining the associated gender and racial disparities and how SDH may impact SCD.

Research has revealed racial (Blazer et al., 1997) and gender (Brown &amp; Patterson, 2020a; Strand et al., 2018) differences in cognitive decline and depression. A disparity in cognitive decline has been shown between Black and White populations (Blazer et al., 1997); however, other studies have not shown a significant difference by race for SCD (Wilson et al., 2010). This inconsistency warrants further research in examining the role of race/ethnicity in SCD. With respect to gender, research has shown that men had higher reports of memory complaints compared to women, that men had higher odds of reporting subjective cognitive decline compared to women, and that among both men and women, problems with memory decreased as level of education and overall life satisfaction increased (Brown &amp; Patterson, 2020a; M. J. Brown &amp; Patterson, 2020b; Strand et al., 2018). However, other studies have shown that being female (Wang et al., 2020), along with lower levels of education (Holmen et al., 2013), living in poverty (Koster et al., 2005), and being older (Holmen et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2020) were associated with a higher number of memory complaints. These findings focused on SDH and SCD but did not examine the mediating role of depression. In addition, gender and racial differences have been found in depression where more women tend to report depression (M. J. Brown et al., 2020). Racial/ethnic minorities tend to have a lower prevalence of depression than White populations (Bailey et al., 2019). Indeed, gender differences have been found in the association between depression and SCD where the association was higher among women (M. J. Brown et al., 2020).

The theoretical model of stress and illness is a model examining social and psychological factors of stress, such as resources, exposure to stress and vulnerabilities, which may lead to stress and impact the physiological responses by the body. The model explores how these exposures and factors directly affect one’s health outcomes (Vitaliano et al., 2003). Adaptation of this model may help in assessing the relationship between SDH (resources), which may be negatively associated with depression (body’s response), which may be positively associated with SCD (health outcome).

Over the past two decades, studies have increasingly focused on SDH and the implementation of interventions to improve health inequities (Brown et al., 2019). Indeed, research has shown that SDH may be associated with depression (Allen et al., 2014), depression may be associated with SCD (Perini et al., 2019), and SDH may be associated with objective cognitive decline (CDC, 2020b). However, there is a lack of research specifically studying the relationship between SDH and SCD. This information is important because if a person is exposed to adverse SDH, these negative factors may be associated with depression, which may also impact SCD. Assessing potential SDH risk factors for depression and SCD can lead to identifying specific target groups in need of intervention and prevention programs geared towards reducing depression and improving SCD.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the association between SDH and SCD; to determine if there is an indirect pathway between SDH, depression, and SCD; and to examine the related gender and racial/ethnic disparities. The lack of research analyzing SDH and SCD illustrates a need for knowledge to further address health inequities. We hypothesize that if individuals are exposed to adverse SDH, then those individuals are more likely to experience SCD, and that there will be an indirect pathway between SDH, depression and SCD.

Methods

Data Source and Study Population

Data were obtained from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Survey. The BRFSS is an annual national telephone survey in the US established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (CDC, 2018). This survey collects data on health behaviors and conditions and use of preventive screening services among the non-institutionalized adult population. Although national in scope, the BRFSS is administered at the state level. In addition to the core set of questions, states are given the opportunity to include additional optional modules, such as those focused on SCD and SDH. Georgia and Mississippi asked the SCD and SDH modules, which was only asked of participants 45 years of age or older. A total of 6,848 participants were asked questions on SCD. A total of 56 participants did not provide valid responses to SCD and were excluded from the sample. Therefore, 6,792 provided valid responses on SCD. An additional 283 participants were excluded who were missing on SDH questions. Therefore, the total sample size was 6,509.

A sample record is defined as one telephone number in the list of all telephone numbers that are randomly selected to be dialed (CDC, 2018). To meet the BRFSS standard, each state must justify sample records as a probability sample of all households with telephones in the state. Georgia and Mississippi used a disproportionate stratified sample (DSS) design for their landline samples (CDC, 2018). To be eligible, participants had to provide valid responses to the question on SCD and SDH.

Ethical Standards

All human and animal studies have been approved by the appropriate ethics committee and have therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Participants participating in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System provided verbal consent.

Primary Measures

Social determinants of health were operationalized by an index as a binary variable (poor (1) vs. better (0)) combining variables that encapsulated SDH as asked in the BRFSS, 2017: 1) Inability to pay mortgage, rent or utility bills (yes vs. no); 2) Perception of how safe from crime the respondent’s neighborhood is (unsafe and extremely unsafe vs. safe and extremely safe); 3) Food did not last, and there was no money to get more (often true and sometimes true vs. never true); 4) Inability to afford balanced meals (often true and sometimes true vs. never true); 5) How finances work out at the end of the month (not have enough money to make ends meet vs. end up with some money left over and have just enough money to make ends meet; 6) how often the respondent has felt stress within the last 30 days (some, most, all of the time vs. a little, none of the time). If any of these constituent variables were negative, we assigned “poor social determinants of health”.

Depression was operationalized by the question: (Ever told) you have a depressive disorder (including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression)? (Yes vs. no)

Subjective cognitive decline was operationalized by the question: During the past 12 months, have you experienced confusion or memory loss that is happening more often or is getting worse?” (Yes vs. no). This question has been used in previous research (Brown &amp; Patterson, Anderson et al., 2015; 2020b; Taylor et al., 2018).

Confounders were considered if they have been shown to be associated with SCD. Since gender, age, income, education, and employment differences have been found in SCD (Brown &amp; Patterson, 2020b), adjusted models controlled for gender (male vs. female), age (45-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+), income (&lt;$15,000, $15,000-&lt;$50,000 vs.≥$50,000), education (&lt;high school, high school, &gt;high school) and employment (employed, unemployed, retired). Health-related variables were also considered as potential confounders. Participants were asked if a doctor, nurse, or other health professional ever told them that they had any of the following, myocardial infarction (yes vs. no), coronary heart disease (yes vs. no), stroke (yes vs. no), diabetes (yes vs. no). Participants were also asked if they smoked cigarettes (every day and some days vs. not at all), if they participated in binge drinking in the past month (yes vs. no), and physical activity in the past month (yes vs. no).

Analytic Approach

Descriptive statistics (weighted proportions and Chi-square tests) were used to determine the distribution of sociodemographic characteristics overall and by SDH (poor vs. better) and SCD (yes vs. no) status with appropriate weights to account for the BRFSS’ complex survey design. We used _LLCPWT to obtain weighted prevalence estimates. We hypothesized that SDH would be associated with depression, which would be associated with SCD. A correlation matrix was obtained using phi coefficients for 2x2 tables and Cramer’s V statistic for all other tables. We examined the direct effects of SDH on depression, depression on SCD, and SDH on SCD based on the mediational model. Using bootstrapping confidence intervals, the direct and indirect pathways of the relationship between SDH (risk factor), depression (mediator), and SCD (outcome) were tested using the CAUSALMED procedure in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., 2017). The overall model was examined, as well as models stratified by race and gender. Model fit was assessed using Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), and Standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) (Supplemental Table 1). Good model fit indices have been shown to be CFI &gt;0.95 (Shi et al., 2019), GFI &gt; 0.95, and SRMR &lt; 0.08. All models assessed showed good model fit.

Results

Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 shows the correlation matrix of the primary variables and potential confounders. Table 2 shows the distribution of sociodemographic characteristics by SDH and SCD. Statistically significant differences in SDH by gender, age, race/ethnicity, income, education, and employment were seen. Respondents reporting poorer SDH tended to be women, ≤69 years, non-Hispanic Black, earned &lt;$50,000 per year, obtained less than a high school education, and were unemployed. Statistically significant differences in SCD by age, income, education, employment status were also observed. Respondents with SCD tended to be older than 60 years, had a yearly income of less than $50,000, had less than a high school education, and were unemployed. In addition, among those with SCD, approximately half reported depression (51.4%). However, among those who did not report SCD, 86.1% reported depression (data not shown).

Gender and Racial/Ethnic Disparities in the Direct Associations Between SDH, Depression and SCD

Table 3 shows the direct association between SDH and depression, depression and SCD, and SDH and SCD. SDH were associated with depression among the overall population (β = 0.193, p&lt;0.001), men (β = 0.157, p&lt;0.001, women (β = 0.237, p&lt;0.001), White (β = 0.193, p&lt;0.001 and Black (β = 0.175, p = 0.002) populations, and depression was associated with SCD among the overall population (β = 0.193, p&lt;0.001), men (β = 0.169, p = 0.048), women (β = 0.169, p&lt;0.001), White (β = 0.178, p&lt;0.001) and Black (β = 0.203, p = 0.001) populations. SDH and SCD were associated among the overall population (β = 0.172, p = 0.001), men (β = 0.086, p = 0.006), and White (β = 0.067, p = 0.014) populations.

Gender and Racial/Ethnic Disparities in the Indirect Association between SDH, Depression and SCD

Table 4 shows the indirect effects of the relationship between SDH, depression, and SCD. After adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related characteristics, the indirect pathway between SDH, depression, and SCD was statistically significant for the overall population (β = 0.037, p&lt;0.001), men (β = 0.035, p&lt;0.001), women (β = 0.040, p&lt;0.001), White (β = 0.034, p&lt;0.001) and Black (β = 0.036, p = 0.026) populations.

Discussion

The main findings were that after adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related variables, there was a direct positive association between poorer SDH and SCD among men, and White populations; a direct positive association between poorer SDH and depression, and between depression and SCD among men, women, White and Black populations. In addition, after adjusting for control variables, the indirect pathway between SDH, having ever been diagnosed with depression (treated and untreated) and SCD was statistically significant for men, women, White and Black populations. We were unable to determine the adjusted associations among Other races/ethnicities (n=37) and Hispanic (n=23) populations due to small sample sizes.

There was a direct positive association between poorer SDH and SCD among men and White populations. SDH has been linked to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (CDC, 2020b). For example, education, access to health care and the built environment have been shown to impact brain health. Higher levels of education were shown to be linked to lower SCD. Consistent access to health care may improve brain health via early diagnosis of dementia. The built environment may provide space for physical activity, which may also impact brain health. The gender differences in this association may be due to the higher odds of SCD seen among men compared to women (Brown &amp; Patterson, 2020b). However, even though the prevalence of SCD tends to be higher among Black populations (Reed et al., 2019), the impact of SDH may be more evident among White populations.

In the current study, poorer SDH was positively associated with depression among men, women, White and Black populations. Using a nationally representative sample of US residents, race and household income was found to be associated with major depressive episode in the past year (Assari, 2017). Among Hispanic women, education was found to be negatively associated with depression (De Oliveira et al., 2017). Gender has also been shown to be an effect measure modifier in the association between income and risk of major depressive episode where the relationship is stronger among women (Assari, 2017).

The association between depression and SCD was positive and statistically significant for men, women, White and Black populations. SCD was found to be positively associated with depression after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and objective cognition among a clinic-based sample of older adults (Zlatar, Muniz, Galasko, et al., 2018). This relationship persisted despite the severity of SCD, cognition and among patients with mild to moderate depression. Zlatar et al. found that SCD was positively associated with depression even after adjusting for memory and global cognition among older Hispanic adults in community health clinics (Zlatar, Muniz, Espinoza, et al., 2018). These findings suggest that the relationship between depression and SCD may persist despite gender and/or race.

After adjustment for control variables, the indirect path between SDH, depression and SCD was statistically significant as hypothesized for men, women, White and Black populations. The theoretical model of stress and illness conceptualizes that resources, exposure to stress and vulnerabilities can impact psychological distress, which is linked to health outcomes. Therefore, resources may be represented by SDH and health outcomes may be represented by SCD. Reiterated, poorer SDH are positively associated with depression, which may be a risk factor for SCD. This indirect pathway also suggests that depression may play a mediating role between SDH and SCD. However, longitudinal studies, establishing the temporal sequence among variables are needed to determine if these associations persist. Future research should also explore the indirect and direct effects of stress and vulnerability as well as their subsequent potential physiological manifestations on SCD. Studies on these relationships incorporating more Hispanic populations and other races/ethnicities are also warranted.

Nevertheless, there are some limitations to keep in mind while interpreting the study’s findings. The study is cross-sectional; therefore, the temporal sequence cannot be established between exposure to poorer SDH, depression and SCD. Reverse causation between depression and SCD, and also between SDH and depression could be an explanation for the results. Data were self-reported, which could lead to underreporting or overreporting of measures. This reporting bias (Delgado-Rodriquez &amp; Llorca, 2004) could result in underestimates or overestimates of the “true” association between SDH, depression and SCD. The measure on SDH did not include important factors such as racism and discrimination and is exploratory. SCD was only based on one question and may include people with acute (and reversible) memory change as well as populations with longer term cognitive decline such as that which occurs in Alzheimer’s disease. Further, those with severe SCD may have been unable to participate in the survey. There was no cognitive testing conducted in the survey. Depression was operationalized with one question as ever being diagnosed with a depressive disorder (including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression) and did not include people who may have experienced depressive symptoms (without a diagnosis) and did not consider symptom severity. In addition, treated and untreated individuals with varying severity are placed in the same category. The analysis could not account for other potentially important factors that may influence SCD, such as history of HIV, brain injury, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, etc., because these measures were not available in the BRFSS. Data were only available from two southern states, Georgia and Mississippi and may not be generalizable to other populations. However, both of these states have a disproportionately high proportion of Black residents (38% in Mississippi, 31% in Georgia compared to 12% nationally) (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2020), which enabled us to better examine the race-specific role of SDH on depression and SDH.

Implications for Gerontological Nursing

The findings suggest that depression played a mediating role in the relationship between SDH and SCD regardless of gender or race (Black vs. White). Understanding the role that SDH and depression can play in SCD can inform interventions geared towards older adults with early cognitive decline. Nurses can play an important role in reducing the modifiable risks, including medical, psychosocial, lifestyle, and nutritional risks, of cognitive decline (Hope 2020). Educating nurses on the importance of considering the role that depression and SDH may play in cognitive decline will help to inform gerontological practice via intervention design and delivery. In addition, adequately treating depression (Hope 2020) may help to reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Structural interventions that target improvement of modifiable SDH may also have an impact on cognitive decline.

Conclusion

In considering the impact of SDH on depression, policies and social inequities in health should be assessed (Liang et al., 2012). Longitudinal studies examining the relationship between SDH, depression, and SCD are warranted to determine if these associations persist. Future research may also use more comprehensive operationalizations of depression and SCD such as SCD plus (Sanchez et al., 2018), and assess alternative pathways between SDH and SCD, for example, examining the mediating role of substance use and abuse. In addition, future studies should assess validation of SDH measures. These findings suggest that an indirect pathway may exist between SDH, depression and SCD for men, women, Black and White populations. However, additional studies examining alternative indirect pathways through which SDH impact cognitive decline are also warranted.
