Microglia are the innate immune cells of the central nervous system that adopt rapid functional changes in response to Damage Associated Molecular Patterns, including aggregated β-Amyloid (Aβ) found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). microRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional modulators that influence the timing and magnitude of microglia inflammatory responses by downregulating the expression of inflammatory effectors. Recent studies implicate miR-155, a miRNA known to regulate inflammatory responses, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including multiple sclerosis, ALS, familial Parkinson's disease, and AD. In this work, we asked if miR-155 expression in microglia modifies cellular behaviors in response to fibrillar Aβ1-42 (fAβ1-42), in vitro. We hypothesized that in microglia, miR-155 expression would impact the internalization and catabolism of extracellular fAβ1-42. Primary microglia stimulated with lipopolysaccharide demonstrate fast upregulation of miR-155 followed by delayed upregulation of miR-146a, an anti-inflammatory miRNA. Conditional overexpression of miR-155 in microglia resulted in significant upregulation of miR-146a. Conditional deletion of miR-155 promoted transit of fAβ1-42 to low-pH compartments where catabolism occurs, while miR-155 overexpression decreases fAβ1-42 catabolism. Uptake of fAβ1-42 across the plasma membrane increased with both up and downregulation of miR-155 expression. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that inflammatory signaling influences the ability of microglia to catabolize fAβ1-42 through interconnected mechanisms modulated by miR-155. Understanding how miRNAs modulate the ability of microglia to catabolize fAβ1-42 will further elucidate the role of cellular players and molecular crosstalk in AD pathophysiology.

pmc1 ∣ INTRODUCTION

Microglia are the specialized myeloid population of innate immune cells within the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma. They orchestrate important roles in development, fine-tuning synaptic connections between neurons and engulfing apoptotic cells. In the healthy adult brain, the microglia-mediated inflammatory response is essential for immune defense against pathogens and managing non-infectious tissue damage (Lynch, 2009; Zrzavy et al., 2018). In response to injury or disease, Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPS) serve as signals that initiate the host defense response, leading to activation of microglia and an increased neuroinflammatory environment. In this process, microglia rapidly transform their morphology, phagocytic abilities, release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, increasing expression of immunomodulatory surface antigens (Lourbopoulos, Ertürk, &amp; Hellal, 2015). Like macrophages in the periphery, microglia initiate consecutive phases of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activation in response to injury or inflammatory stimuli (Yamasaki et al., 2014). The microglia pro-inflammatory response, like macrophages, is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines or toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (Xu, He, &amp; Bai, 2016). Activated microglia perform functions important for pathogen suppression such as the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. However, these functions may cause injury to neighboring cells. In contrast, anti-inflammatory signals such as interleukins (IL)-4, −10 or −13, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β downregulate pro-inflammatory activation, initiating an anti-inflammatory response that promotes tissue remodeling and repair (Henry, Huang, Wynne, &amp; Godbout, 2009). In microglia, the expression of activation markers differs quantitatively but not qualitatively from that observed in peripheral macrophages (Zrzavy et al., 2018). Microglia respond similarly to Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and TLR activation with pro-inflammatory behaviors and downregulate pro-inflammatory activation in response to IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β. Faulty regulation of microglia phasic responses to inflammatory signals has been linked to dysfunction and destructive cascades that lead to neurotoxicity in CNS injury or disease. In chronic CNS diseases, microglia exhibit a sustained pro-inflammatory response, which can evolve to a long-term pro-inflammatory state (Butovsky &amp; Weiner, 2018). Microglia behaviors during inflammation can subsequently trigger downstream damage to neurons (direct neuronal toxicity) and excessive synaptic stripping (Butovsky &amp; Weiner, 2018). Moreover, in normal aging, microglia lose phagocytic capabilities and become less sensitive to regulatory signals (Lucin et al., 2013; Mitrasinovic &amp; Murphy Jr, 2003). One major class of molecule involved in regulating microglia behaviors are DAMPs that bind to the TLR family of surface signaling receptors. β-Amyloid (Aβ) fibrils and plaques, a dominant pathological finding in Alzheimer's disease (AD) trigger TLR signaling in microglia. Neuroinflammation is a central hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, like AD (Barrientos, Kitt, Watkins, &amp; Maier, 2015) and the resulting increased neuroinflammatory environment contributes to injury or propagation of disease pathology. However, the molecular players that regulate important functional microglial responses to AD-associated DAMPs, like phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons and/or catabolism of Aβ1-42 fibrils, are not well delineated in primary microglia.

Microglia utilize microRNAs (miRNAs) to rapidly transduce inflammatory signals into changes in gene expression in response to DAMPs, allowing for quick modulation of cellular behaviors. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs (~22 nucleotides) involved in many physiological and pathological processes. Up to 90% of human genes are potentially regulated by miRNAs (O'Connell, Rao, &amp; Baltimore, 2012). A single miRNA can regulate hundreds of genes by complete or incomplete complementary pairing with sequences in the 3-prime untranslated region (UTR) of the message. Several reports suggest that miRNAs –termed inflammatory miRNAs– play an important role in regulating the responses of innate immune cells, including microglia (O'Connell et al., 2012; O'Connell, Rao, Chaudhuri, &amp; Baltimore, 2010; Su et al., 2016; Su, Aloi, &amp; Garden, 2016). Although the effect of miRNAs on the functional outcomes of the inflammatory response in microglia has started to gain attention, the functional roles of miRNAs expression are cell-specific and remain understudied in microglia.

Of particular interest, a pro-inflammatory miRNA, miR-155, has been studied in various disease contexts, including ALS and multiple sclerosis model mice (Butovsky et al., 2015; O'Loughlin et al., 2018) where germ-line knock-out of miR-155 altered microglia polarization in vivo. Upregulation of miR-155 promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by targeting the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 (SOCS1) message for degradation and downregulating cytokines that act via the JAK/STAT pathway (Kinjyo et al., 2002; O'Connell et al, 2007; Yao et al., 2012) and NF-kB signaling. miR-155 is one of five microRNAs located on chromosome 21 flanking the β-Amyloid precursor βAPP) gene (Zhao, Jaber, Percy, &amp; Lukiw, 2017). Therefore, the pathological implications of additional copies of miR-155 have gained interest and attention in Trisomy-21 and Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis (Zhao et al., 2017).

We have previously reported a role for miR-155 in microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in a middle-cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) model. In this model, miR-155 expression in microglia targets the anti-inflammatory transcription factor c-MAF for degradation (Su et al., 2014). Further, key observations were made in the periphery that impact neuroinflammation. Macrophages quickly upregulate miR-155 expression in response to several pro-inflammatory stimuli including LPS, IFNγ, and TNFα (Durafourt et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2012; Lynch, 2009). miR-155 is considered a pro-inflammatory miRNA and its expression results in the upregulation of IL-1, IL-6, and TNFα and to downregulation of anti-inflammatory mediators IL-10 and Arg125. Therefore, miRNAs can serve to suppress or potentiate inflammatory functions by modulating inflammatory cytokine expression and resulting cellular phenotypes in a cell-type-specific manner.

Another well-studied miRNA in innate immune cells is the anti-inflammatory miR-146a. miR-146a negatively regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 and TNFα (Boldin et al., 2011). Both miR-146 and miR-155 are implicated in neuroinflammation through a novel route of pathogenic communication between the human gastrointestinal (GI)-tract microbiome and the brain, where transport of a highly pro-inflammatory systemic Bacteroides fragilis derived LPS (BF-LPS) across the blood–brain barrier (Alexandrov, Zhai, Li, &amp; Lukiw, 2019). In microglia, miR-146a expression is regulated by Presenilin 2, a protein mutated in familial AD patients (Jayadev et al., 2013). Both miR-155 and miR-146a expression is altered in the post-mortem AD brain and in mouse models of AD (Guedes et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2011). In AD an in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ADM) microRNAs that are progressively upregulated include miRNA-9, miRNA-125b, miRNA-146a, and miRNA-155 where overlapping miR-146a/miR-155 recognition features in the CFH 3' UTR, are common to the pathogenetic mechanism of Complement Factor H (CFH) deficiency that drives inflammatory neurodegeneration (Lukiw, Surjyadipta, Dua, &amp; Alexandrov, 2012). However, the role of these miRNAs in microglia activation phenotypes and functional outcomes in response to AD-relevant DAMPs at the cellular level remains largely unexplored.

In this work, we asked if miR-155 expression influenced microglia functions and affected miR-146a expression in primary cultured mouse microglia using the Cre/lox system, allowing for conditional expression of miR-155. We hypothesized that microglia responses to pro-inflammatory stimuli (e.g., LPS or fibrillar Aβ1-42) involve miR-155 and miR-146a induction in a manner similar to that observed in peripheral innate immune cells, like blood-derived macrophages. By conditional manipulation of miR-155 in primary mouse microglia, we aimed to understand how miR-155 expression levels impacted the expression of miR-146a, and in what ways conditional knock-out or overexpression of miR-155 modified microglia phenotypic activation (phagocytosis) in response to fibrillar Aβ1-42 in vitro. We identified a novel role for miR-155 expression as a key modulator of the kinetics of fibrillar Aβ1-42 catabolism in the endo-lysosomal degradation pathway.

2 ∣ METHODS

2.1 ∣ Mice

All experiments were performed in accordance with a University of Washington IACUC-approved protocol. All mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free facility and group-housed with ad libitum access to food and water on a 14/10 light–dark cycle (lights on at 0600 hr). Microglia isolated from C57/BL6 wild-type (WT) mice were used as controls in this study. Microglia isolated from floxed miR-155 mice referred to as “miR-155 flx”, possess homozygous loxP sites flanking exon 2 of the mBIC (miR-155) gene. The miR-155 overexpressing animals, referred to as “mBIC-FSF”, contain a transgene inserted into the Rosa26 Locus that contains a floxed stop sequence upstream of the mBIC gene and these were then bred to homozygosity.

2.2 ∣ Mixed glia culture generation for microglia isolation

Cortices were dissected from postnatal day (P) P3-P4 neonates of miR- 155 flx, mBIC-FSF, or WT mice to prepare a mixed glial culture system, as described previously (Su, Aloi, et al., 2016; Su, Kang, et al., 2016). After isolation from the skull and removal of all meninges and deep brain structures, cortices were mechanically dissociated and enzymatically digested with trypsin (0.25%) at 37°C for 25 min. To generate a single cell suspension, tissue was mechanically dissociated in D10C (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium high glucose [DMEM; Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY], 10% heat-inactivated horse serum [Gibco, Life Technologies], 10% nutrient mixture F-12 ham [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO], 5 mM l-glutamine [Sigma-Aldrich], 10 mM HEPES [Sigma-Aldrich]), 4–6 times in a cycle of resuspension and low-speed pelleting (1,100 rpm). The collected cell supernatant was saved and sequentially combined. The suspension was plated in tissue culture grade flasks coated with 1× poly-d-Lysine (Sigma). Cells were allowed to seed the flask for 1–3 days then the media was then changed to fresh D10C then supplemented with 20% L929 conditioned D10C. Microglia were harvested 7–10 days after initial culture preparation by agitating flasks *and recovering cells released in media. Isolated microglia were then plated in D10C with 10 ng/ml of Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (MCSF, R &amp; D; 216-MC) in 1× poly-d-Lysine (Sigma) coated tissue culture grade plates at a density specific for experiments.

2.3 ∣ Recombinant AAV vector serotype 2 (rAAV2) production, purification and titration

Initial studies were conducted with recombinant AAV vector serotype 2 (rAAV2) expressing CMV-Cre recombinase, Luciferase, GFP, or RFP (AAV-Control group) that were generated according to our previously published work (Su, Aloi, et al., 2016; Su, Kang, et al., 2016). In short, rAAV2-Cre or rAAV2-Control were prepared by calcium phosphate transfection (CaPO4 co-precipitation) into HEK293D cells with the corresponding shuttle plasmid and pDG2 packaging capsid (for rAAV2). Six hours post-transfection, media was changed to serum-free media and cultured for 48–72 hr. Cells and virus-containing medium were harvested by scraping cells off the plate and intracellular vectors were released by performing three freeze–thaw cycles (dry ice/ethanol, then 37°C water bath). rAAV2 was purified by affinity chromatography using a heparin column and concentrated using 100 K Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Titer was determined by qRT-PCR with primers targeting Cre, Luciferase, GFP, or RFP sequence. The remaining studies were conducted with rAAV2-Cre driven by the IE1a promoter, rather than a CMV promoter. This rAAV2-Cre was purchased from the Duke University viral generation core facility.

2.4 ∣ In vitro LPS treatment of cultured microglia, conditional miR-155 expression and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR)

For microRNA expression studies in WT microglia, cells were harvested from mixed glial cultures and plated in D10C with M-CSF (D10C + 10 ng/ml MCSF, R &amp; D; 216-MC) at a density of 1.0 x 105 cells per well (15 mm) in 4 or 24 well plates previously coated with 1x poly-d-Lysine. Before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of WT cells, existing D10C + MCSF media was replaced with Macrophage Specific Serum-Free Media (M-SFM, Gibco; 12065-074) for 18 hr. Media was then replaced with D10C + M-CSF containing 100 ng/ml of LPS (0111-B4, Sigma; L4391-1MG). For miRNA manipulations, microglia were harvested from mixed glial cultures prepared from miR-155 flx or mBIC-FSF mice and plated in D10C + M-CSF at a density of 1.0 x 105 cells per well (15 mm) in 4 or 24 well plates previously coated with poly-D-Lysine. One day after initial plating, media was replaced with virus-containing D10C + M-CSF at 1.0 x 109 vg and the infection continued for 7 days. At the end of viral infection or treatment, cells were harvested for RNA analysis using Qiazol lysis reagent, and RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen; 217004). We used the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies; 4368814) to generate cDNA with templates specific primers for the 5′ stem loop of miR-155 and miR-146a. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated using 15 ng of total RNA from each sample with sequence-specific primers for miR-155 (002571 mmu-miR-155-5p; 4427975) and miR-146a (000468 mmu-miR-146a-5p; 4427975) from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The Taqman Master mix (No UNG, ABI; 4440043) was used for qPCR analysis with complementary probes. To quantify changes in total levels of miRNA in each sample a standard curve was generated using equivalent amounts of cDNA synthesized from mimics for miR-155-5p and miR-146a-5p (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and total levels of transcripts were calculated and quantified using the standard curve. Data were plotted and analyzed using Prism 8.

2.5 ∣ Fibrillar Aβ1-42 synthesis, labeling, and titration for phagocytosis assays

Lyophilized β-Amyloid1-42 (Aβ1-42) protein (Bachem; 4014447) was resuspended in sterile, endotoxin-free 1× PBS in a sterile, tissue-culture environment to achieve a concentration of 100 μM of peptide. The resuspended peptide was left to aggregate and fibrilize for 48 hr at 37°C. The pH-sensitive dye, pHrodo (Invitrogen) was used to label the fibrillar (f) Aβ1-42 (fAβ1-42-pHrodo) following the manufacture's guidelines for use of the dye. Alexa 488, a non-pH sensitive dye, was used to label fAβ1-42 (fAβ1-42-488) following the Alexa 488 protein labeling kit instructions (Thermo) for labeling large proteins. The labeled forms of fAβ1-42 were aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Multiple freeze–thaw cycles were avoided.

For titration of fAβ1-42, cells were plated at a density of 1.0 x 105 cells per 15 mm well. Cells were exposed to a range of fAβ1-42-pHrodo and fAβ1-42-488 (5 μM, 1 μM, 500 nM, 250 nM) to determine the quantity of fAβ1-42 to be used for each phagocytosis assay experiment. After 6 hr, cells were washed, collected from the dish, and analyzed using the BD LSR II. Data were analyzed using FlowJo v10 and the average geometric mean of fAβ1-42-pHrodo (PE) and fAβ1-42-488 (FITC) intensity reflect the total extent of phagocytosis to late endosomes/lysosomes or internalization, respectively. We chose to use 1uM fAβ1-42-pHrodo and fAβ1-42-488 for all assays since we observed a minimum of 65% phagocytosis and clear pHrodo signal or fluorescence intensity separation of each peptide preparation.

2.6 ∣ Phagocytosis assay as a measure of microglia behavior post LPS stimulation or miRNA manipulation

Microglia were harvested from mixed glia cultures and plated at a density of 1.0 x 105 cells per 15 mm or 2.0 x 104 cells per 96 well plate. For phagocytosis assays with LPS treatment, cells treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) were treated throughout the time course with a maximum of 48 hr of LPS exposure. For conditional miR-155 expression experiments, cells were transfected for 7 days with rAAV2-Cre in D10C + M-CSF, then media was aspirated and replaced with D10C + M-CSF with 1 μM of fAβ1-42-pHrodo or fAβ1-42-488 for 6, 12, 18, or 24 hr. After the end of the time course and in both experimental paradigms, media was aspirated away from cells, and cells were trypsinized with phenol red-free 0.25% trypsin (Gibco) for 5 min at 37°C. After neutralizing the trypsin with equal volumes of FACS media (HBSS−/−, 1 mM Hepes, and 10% heat-inactivated FBS), cells were stained with DAPI (1 ng) for 5 min before preparing samples for analysis. Levels of fAβ1-42-pHrodo or fAβ1-42-488 were detected in each sample using the LSR II (BD Bioscience) or the Amnis Imaging Flow Cytometer (Millipore). Data were analyzed using FlowJo v10 or the Ideas Software (Millipore) and the average geometric mean (or mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) of fAβ1-42-pHrodo (PE) and fAβ1-42-488 (FITC) intensity reflect the extent of phagocytosis to endosomes/lysosomes or total internalization, respectively. Average MFIs were plotted and analyzed using Prism 8.

3 ∣ RESULTS

3.1 ∣ The microglia response to LPS results in rapid upregulation of miR-155, mimicking the LPS response of peripheral monocytes and macrophages

miR-155 expression in circulating monocytes and macrophages is tightly regulated by TLR/NF-kB signaling and its expression corresponds with the pro-inflammatory phase of inflammation. Therefore, we asked if miR-155 expression is upregulated in primary microglia and if the time course of this expression in response to LPS stimulation is similar to that observed in blood-derived macrophages. To answer this question, we generated mixed glia cultures from which we later isolated microglia. Isolated microglia were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of LPS for 5 days in vitro. Cells were collected for total RNA isolation every 24 hr for 5 days. Using qPCR, we quantified total changes in copy number of miR-155 and miR-146a following LPS stimulation. We found that miR-155 peaked in expression as soon as 24 hr post LPS treatment and remained at that peak after 48 hr (2 days) of LPS exposure (Figure 1a; One-Way ANOVA: F (5, 18) = 19.43, p &lt; .0001). Subsequent days of LPS treatment showed that miR-155 expression slowly began to decrease over a five-day period (Figure 1a, One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons compared to NT [not-treated], For miR-155: Day 1: p &lt;.0001, Day 2: p &lt;.0001, Day 3: p =.0016, Day 4: p = n.s. and Day 5: p = n.s.).

Expression of miR-146a is regulated by TLR/NF-kB signaling and is co-expressed with miR-155 in blood-derived macrophages in response to inflammatory stimuli. Ultimately, miR-146a expression downregulates NF-kB signaling yielding an anti-inflammatory response. We asked how the expression of miR-146a changed over the 5 days of LPS treatment in cells where we observed changes in miR-155 expression. We hypothesized that the expression of miR-146a would peak after miR-155 expression. We found that miR-146a expression slowly increased during the first 3 days post LPS treatment (Figure 1b, One-Way ANOVA: F (5, 18) = 5.660, p = .0026). Interestingly, expression of miR-146a peaked at Days 4 and 5, in a temporally opposing manner to miR-155 expression (Figure 1b; One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons compared to NT [not-treated]. For miR-146a: Day 1: p = n.s., Day 2: p = n. s., Day 3: p = n.s., Day 4: p = .0441, Day 5: p = .0018). These findings support the hypothesis that inflammatory stimulation of primary microglia with LPS results in quick-expression of miR-155 and delayed miR-146a expression, recapitulating the expected phasic response observed in peripheral myeloid cells. Therefore, these findings lead us to further explore the hypothesis that miR-155 participates in a TLR signaling mediated activation of pro-inflammatory responses and changes microglia behavior in vitro.

3.2 ∣ LPS stimulation alters the levels of fAβ1-42 in low-pH compartments in microglia

Aβ is produced from its precursor, Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), and catabolized under normal conditions, whereas the inability to clear or properly catabolize Aβ contributes to plaque AD pathology (Saido, 1998). In mouse models of AD, microglia cluster around plaques and can internalize and clear fibrillar forms of Aβ1-42 (fAβ1-42) as part of a tissue reparative activation state (He et al., 2016; Koenigsknecht-Talboo et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2013; Weldon et al., 1998). In addition, several miRNAs can indirectly modulate levels of Aβ in AD patient monocytes (Tiribuzi et al., 2014). Since we found that miR-155 drives microglia pro-inflammatory activation states, we asked if the expression of miR-155 would change microglia interaction with Aβ. We hypothesized that miR-155 would downregulate the tissue-reparative and clearance functions of microglia, therefore causing microglia to remove less fAβ1-42 from the extracellular space. To test the hypothesis that pro-inflammatory activated microglia are less likely to catabolize fAβ1-42 and therefore have decreased levels of fAβ1-42 in low-pH compartments for degradation (lysosomal pathway) we designed an assay where stimulated cells are exposed to fAβ1-42 tagged with a pH-sensitive rhodamine (fAβ1-42-pHrodo). This compound fluoresces only after it is transported into low-pH intracellular compartments and can be quantified using flow cytometry (e.g., late endosomes/lysosomes; Figure 2a). LPS exposure for 24 hours led to the highest level of miR-155 induction (Figure 1a). Therefore, we exposed primary microglia to 24 hr of LPS (100 ng/ml) after which they were exposed to 1 μM fAβ1-42-pHrodo for 6 hr. We repeatedly observed that LPS treated microglia demonstrated a significant reduction in fAβ1-42-pHrodo localized in low-pH compartments compared to unstimulated cells (Figure 2b, Unpaired t-test, p = .0039). Lysosomal pH can be highly variable in response to bacterial challenges such as LPS. Therefore, to rule out extreme lysosomal pH shifts after LPS treatment we used Lysotracker Deep Red according to the manufacturer's instructions to label lysosomes (Thermo Fischer, catalog number: L12492). This reagent is highly selective for acidic organelles, allowing us to stain lysosomal compartments in microglia before quantifying changes using flow cytometry (Figure 2c). We observed that LPS treated microglia did not show a significant difference in the acidity of low-pH organelles in our LPS treatment paradigm, relative to untreated cells (Figure 2d, Unpaired t-test, p = .4193, n.s.) Therefore, we conclude that inflammatory stimulation with LPS not only modulates miRNA induction but also alters the levels of fAβ1-42 in low-pH compartments without significantly changing the pH of compartments in primary microglia.

3.3 ∣ LPS stimulation alters the levels of fAβ1-42 in low-pH compartments while internalization of fAβ1-42 at the plasma membrane is increased in microglia

We observed that LPS stimulation influences the expression of miRNAs miR-155 and miR-146a. We also observed that upon inflammatory stimulation with LPS, microglia decrease catabolism of fAβ1-42 in low-pH compartments. To begin to tease apart the pathways by which inflammatory stimulation with LPS and miR-155 expression influences the intracellular handling of fAβ1-42, we wondered if LPS stimulation impacts the initial transit of fAβ1-42 across the plasma membrane or the trafficking of fAβ1-42 to low-pH compartments alone after initial internalization. We hypothesized that both the initial internalization from the extracellular space and transit of protein to the endosome/lysosome system would be downregulated by LPS treatment in pathways modulated by miR-155. To test this hypothesis, we exposed microglia to either fAβ1-42-pHrodo or fAβ1-42 tagged with a non-pH sensitive fluorophore (fAβ1-42-488) to evaluate internalization to intracellular low-pH compartments and total internalization, respectively. Using a different phagocytosis assay using fewer cells, microglia (2.0 x 104) were exposed to LPS (100 ng/ml) for 24 hr, the observed peak of miR-155 induction, then to fAβ1-42-pHrodo or fAβ1-42-488 for 6, 12, 18, or 24 hr. Microglia were then analyzed by imaging flow cytometry (Figure 3a) and quantitative flow cytometry (Figure 3b,c) where the signal of total internalized fAβ1-42-488 or fAβ1-42-pHrodo in low-pH compartments was quantified with each treatment and time-point. Then, the average geometric mean of each signal from three biological replicates (mixed glia cultures) was normalized to levels of fAβ1-42-pHrodo or fAβ1-42-488 of untreated (WT) microglia, plotted, and analyzed. We did not observe a main effect or significant interaction of LPS treatment over time, where fAβ1-42 in low-pH compartments was not reduced over 24 hr (Figure 3b; Two-Way ANOVA: F (3,12) = 0.07531, p = .9721). We initially predicted that the internalization of fAβ1-42 from the extracellular space (in addition to the transit of protein to the endosome/lysosome system) would be downregulated by LPS treatment.

Although we did not observe a reduction in fAβ1-42-pHrodo signal, we did observe a significant interaction of LPS treatment overtime where fAβ1-42-488 signal was increased in stimulated microglia over 24 hr (Figure 3c; Two-Way ANOVA treatment x time: F (3,12)=3.577, p = .0469). Multiple Comparisons post-hoc tests with Bonferroni correction did not elucidate significant differences at a particular time point between treatment groups, potentially due to the variability of the untreated group. However, in the absence of multiple comparisons correction, fAβ1-42-488 was increased significantly at 6 hr (p = .0451) and 24 hr (p = .0470). Additionally, there was a main effect of LPS treatment. LPS treatment had a significant impact on the levels of internalized fAβ1-42-488 with LPS increasing the levels of fAβ1-42-488 internalized (Figure 3c; Two-Way ANOVA main effect of Treatment: F (1,4) = 55.44, p = .0017). These data suggest that in microglia, LPS stimulation results in a modified activation phenotype where extracellular fAβ1-42 trafficking fluctuates over time and is not impaired at the plasma membrane.

3.4 ∣ In the absence of LPS, miR-155 overexpression is sufficient for miR-146a induction in microglia

We observed that LPS stimulation of microglia increased expression of miR-155 and miR-146a similar to patterns of expression observed in peripheral myeloid cells. Therefore, we asked if miR-155 upregulation is sufficient to induce expression of miR-146a in primary microglia, in the absence of a strong pro-inflammatory stimulus like LPS. Microglia harvested from mice harboring a flox-stop-flox mBIC transgene were infected with rAAV2-Cre for 5 days. When these cells express Cre-recombinase, the stop codon is excised, resulting in overexpression of miR-155 (Figure 4a). We employed real-time qPCR to quantify changes in expression of both miR-155 and miR-146a. We first observed that microglia overexpressed miR-155 after 5 days of Cre-recombinase expression (Figure 4b, One-Way ANOVA: F (2,9) = 139.1, p &lt; .0001) with rAAV2-Cre transfected microglia having significantly higher miR-155 expression than either control (Tukey's Multiple Comparisons; NT (non-treated) v. rAAV2-Cre: p &lt; .0001; rAAV2-Control (RFP or GFP) v. rAAV2-Cre: p &lt; .0001). In microglia with significantly higher miR-155 expression levels, we subsequently observed that miR-155 overexpression was sufficient to induce miR-146a expression (Figure 4c, One-Way ANOVA: F (2,9)=63.20, p &lt; .0001), where we observed significantly increased miR-146a expression in mBIC-FSF rAAV2-Cre transfected microglia than either rAAV2-Control or non-treated cells (Tukey's Multiple Comparisons; NT (non-treated) v. rAAV2-Cre: p &lt; .0001; rAAV2-Control (RFP or GFP) v. rAAV2-Cre: p &lt; .0001). These findings support the hypothesis that miR-155 is a coordinator of the miRNA response to TLR activation in microglia and that overexpression of miR-155 alone in the absence of an inflammatory stimulus is sufficient to induce miR-146a expression.

3.5 ∣ Targeted modulation of miR-155 expression influences the transit of fAβ1-42 into the microglia endosomal-lysosomal system

We previously observed that LPS treatment of microglia at the peak of miR-155 expression resulted in decreased internalization of fAβ1-42 to low-pH compartments in a large-scale experiment (Figure 2b). Here, we investigated if manipulation of miR-155 by conditional deletion or overexpression impacts fAβ1-42 catabolism to low-pH compartments (late endosomes/lysosomes) in microglia. Specifically, we hypothesized that deletion of a driver of microglia pro-inflammatory activation would skew cellular behaviors to upregulate the internalization and catabolism of extracellular fAβ1-42. To test this hypothesis, we transfected miR-155 flx or mBIC-FSF primary microglia with rAAV2-Cre for 7 days to conditionally knock-out (CKO) or conditionally overexpress (OX) miR-155, respectively. We quantified changes in miR-155 expression 7 days after rAAV2-Cre transfection and observed a significant impact on miR-155 expression in cultured microglia from both mouse lines (Figure 5a,b). miR-155 CKO was achieved in miR-155 flx microglia (Figure 5a; Unpaired t-test: t = 4.352, p = .0048) and miR-155 OX was achieved in mBIC-FSF microglia (Figure 5b; Unpaired t-test: t = 2.907, p = .0335). Then, we exposed microglia to 1 μM fAβ1-42-pHrodo for 6 hr. Using flow cytometry (Figure 4c; representative histograms), we observed that miR-155 CKO led to a significant increase of fAβ1-42-pHrodo signal, while miR-155 OX resulted in decreased fAβ1-42-pHrodo in low-pH compartments (Figure 4d, One-way ANOVA: F (2,11) = 76.19, p = .0001). Using Tukey's multiple comparisons correction on post hoc tests, we observed that miR-155 OX microglia showed decreased fAβ1-42 catabolism in low-pH compartments relative to Control (p = .0001) while miR-155 CKO microglia showed significantly increased fAβ1-42 catabolism in low-pH compartments relative to control (p = .0002) and miR-155 OX microglia (p &lt; .0001). Taken together, findings suggest a new pathway where miR-155 impacts the ability of microglia to catabolize fAβ1-42 in low-pH compartments.

3.6 ∣ Conditional miR-155 expression in microglia impacts both internalization at the plasma membrane and catabolism of fAβ1-42 in low pH compartments

Since we observed that miR-155 influences levels of fAβ1-42 in low-pH compartments, we asked if the influence of miR-155 expression in primary microglia impacted internalization at the plasma membrane or intracellular handling of fAβ1-42. We hypothesized that manipulation of miR-155 expression in microglia would impact both internalization and intracellular trafficking of fAβ1-42 over time. To test this hypothesis, we transfected primary microglia (2.0 × 104) from miR-155 flx or mBIC-FSF mice with rAAV2-Cre to conditionally knock-out (CKO) or overexpress (OX) miR-155. On day 7 of infection, we exposed microglia to fAβ1-42-pHrodo or fAβ1-42-488 for 6, 12, 18, or 24 hr, then measured the levels of fAβ1-42-pHrodo or fAβ1-42-488 using flow cytometry. The geometric mean of each independent fluorophore was then normalized to levels of fAβ1-42-pHrodo or fAβ1-42-488 of untreated (WT) microglia.

We observed a main effect of genotype (two-way ANOVA, F (2,5) = 18.91, p = .0047) where miR-155 CKO showed a significant increase in fAβ1-42-pHrodo (Figure 6a). There was a main effect of time (F(2.038,10.19) = 16.74, p = .0006) and an interaction of genotype and time (F (6,15) = 8.827, p = .0003)). Tukey's Multiple Comparisons further revealed that deleting miR-155 in microglia leads to a significant increase in fAβ1-42-pHrodo in low-pH compartments at 6 hr with a plateau in pHrodo signal at 12–24 hr post-fAβ1-42 exposure (Figure 6a). miR-155 CKO in microglia resulted in statistically significant higher levels of fAβ1-42-pHrodo (p &lt; .0001) compared to miR-155 OX microglia. miR-155 OX in microglia showed a trend in decreasing in fAβ1-42-pHrodo at 6 hr (p = .0588) and at 18 hr (p = 0.06) relative to miR-155 CKO microglia. Based on the results, we conclude that the significant differences in catabolism of fAβ1-42 by microglia lacking miR-155 peaked at 6 hr and plateaued after 24 hr of fAβ1-42-pHrodo exposure.

At the membrane, miR-155 CKO in microglia resulted in significantly increased fAβ1-42-488 internalization (Figure 6b, Two-Way ANOVA main effect of Genotype: F (2,6) = 104.4, p &lt; .0001). In addition, we observed an interaction of miR-155 CKO and time (F (6,18) = 4.752, p = .0046). With Tukey's Multiple Comparisons, we observed statistically significant increases in internalization of fAβ1-42-488 by miR-155 CKO microglia. miR-155 CKO led to an increase in fAβ1-42-488 internalization at 6 hr compared to control (p = .0388) and miR-155 OX microglia (p = .0287). Though we observed a trend in fAβ1-42-488 internalization at 6 hr by miR-155 OX microglia relative to control, this was not statistically significant (p = .0978). miR-155 CKO microglia showed a continued increased in fAβ1-42-488 internalization at 12 hr, though not statistically significant compared to control (p = 0.052) or miR-155 OX microglia (p = .2040). At 18 hr miR-155 CKO microglia peak in fAβ1-42-488 internalization compared to miR-155 OX microglia (p = .0214), with a plateau thereafter. These data suggest a new role of miR-155 in fAβ1-42 clearance and catabolism, where miR-155 participates in modulation of pathways that contribute to the internalization and the intracellular trafficking of fAβ1-42 in the endolysosomal pathway.

4 ∣ DISCUSSION

Neuroinflammation is a significant feature of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease. Microglia play a central role in orchestrating the inflammatory environment in the brain in response to injured and apoptotic neurons. They are the initial responders to DAMPs in the inter-neuronal space. Microglia, like peripheral immune cells, can quickly respond to infection, cell damage, and inflammatory signals such as soluble and aggregated forms of Aβ. Here we identified a novel role for miR-155, a microRNA driver of pro-inflammatory responses, in modulating catabolism of fAβ1-42 via promotion of fAβ1-42 internalization and transit to the endolysosomal degradation pathway in microglia. We demonstrate that increased expression of pro-inflammatory miR-155 led to a suppression Aβ1-42 catabolism while conditional knock-out of miR-155 improved the ability of microglia to internalize fAβ1-42 into endo/lysosomal compartments. In turn, overexpression of miR-155 decreased this process, suggesting a role for miR-155 in modulating gene expression networks influencing lysosomal function in addition to inflammatory gene expression. Our findings contribute significantly to the current knowledge of the field as they increase the understanding of the complex roles of inflammatory miRNA networks in modulating microglia activity in the context of aggregated Aβ.

4.1 ∣ Microglia interactions with Aβ1-42 in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis

Microglia are tiled throughout the brain, enabling them to survey their immediate microenvironment for pathogens, foreign materials and DAMPS stemming from apoptotic cells. Microglia inflammatory activity is silenced by inhibitory contacts with healthy neurons through the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 or TREM2 receptors as well as by astrocyte secretion of anti-inflammatory TGF-β (Butovsky et al., 2015; Colonna &amp; Butovsky, 2017; Faustino et al., 2019). Upon injury, microglia rapidly extend processes to the site of injury, then migrate to the lesion sites, recognize pathogens or tissue damage signals and release pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase expression of immunomodulatory surface antigens that lead to pro-inflammatory states (Xu et al., 2016). Activation of this host defense response alters microglia gene expression and behavior, impacting astrocytic functions and the surrounding neuroinflammatory environment. Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory tissue repair patterns of microglia activation develop in consecutive phases (Su, Aloi, et al., 2016; Su, Kang, et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2016) and faulty regulation of these phasic responses may lead to destructive inflammatory cascades and resultant neuronal injury (Xu et al., 2016). In this work, we identified a novel role for a known driver of inflammation in modulating the tissue reparative phenotypes of microglia, including clearance of Aβ. Further work should focus on identifying the targets for miR-155 that play key roles in the pathways modified after conditional miR-155 expression in microglia.

In AD patients and AD mouse models, microglia are found closely associated with and intimately surround the amyloid plaques and exhibit an “activated” morphology. Studies using radiolabeled or fluorescent labeled Aβ (Paresce et al., 1996) and direct injection of fibrillar Aβ into rat brains further demonstrated the capability of microglia to internalize Aβ. Here we identified a novel role for miRNAs in microglia regulation of internalization and lysosomal transport of Aβ1-42. We found that miR-155 was upregulated quickly in response to a pro-inflammatory stimulus (LPS) and Aβ1-42. In turn, conditional deletion of miR-155 lead to microglia upregulation of Aβ1-42 transit into the low-pH endosome/lysosomal compartments.

Continued accumulation of Aβ fibrils and neuronal debris that further activate inflammatory cell signaling pathways is thought to establish a non-resolving chronic inflammatory state (Mizuno, 2012). For example, an intracellular regulator of microglial function, Beclin1, is reduced in brains of AD patients. Beclin1 has a role in retromermediated sorting of cellular components, like TREM2, APP, BACE1, and CD36 (in the endolysosomal pathway; Lucin et al., 2013). These receptors and co-receptors are modulated or predicted to be modulated by miR-155 expression (Huang, et al, 2010; Lucin et al., 2013) and could be part of the pathways that influence Aβ fibrils removal from the extracellular space. Further work is required to understand the mechanism by which miR-155 regulates expression of receptors known to interact with Aβ fibrils, contributing to AD pathology and the ability of microglia to catabolize complex forms of Aβ.

4.2 ∣ microRNA expression impacts disease pathogenesis by altering cellular functions in response to disease-associated stimuli like Aβ

Altered expression of miRNAs leads to changes in gene expression that contribute to disease states in cancer, metabolic, and neurological disorders (Kiko et al., 2014; Mendell &amp; Olson, 2012; Pogue &amp; Lukiw, 2018; Ponomarev, Veremeyko, &amp; Weiner, 2013). Increased miRNA expression suppresses the transcript levels of their target mRNAs. Thus, disease specific patterns of miRNA expression suppress specific mRNAs which may contribute to the disease phenotype. Therefore, a reasonable potential therapeutic approach is the development of modifiers targeting and modulating microRNA levels. In the AD brain, expression of microRNAs in specific functional groups is significantly upregulated, including inflammatory microRNAs miR-155 and miR-146a (Pogue &amp; Lukiw, 2018; Tiribuzi et al., 2014). Further work focused on the role of miR-155 in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI; Henry et al., 2019) and in peripheral inflammatory responses in neuroinflammation (Woodbury et al., 2015) further elucidated the importance of this miRNA in neural health and injury. Therefore, it is established that miR-155 is functionally important in cytokine gene expression in microglia and peripheral innate immune cells. However, the specific cell types contributing to altered miRNA expression in bulk samples of AD brains, the physiological implications of this upregulation in disease processes remain largely unexplored in a mechanistic fashion when it comes to functional cellular outcomes of miRNA miR-155 expression in primary microglia. In this work, we begin to dissect the mechanisms of how miR-155 and miR-146a are interconnected in their expression in primary microglia, acting together in modulation of different stages of the innate immune response to PAMPS (LPS) or DAMPS (Aβ), in a pattern identical to blood-derived macrophages (Elton, Selemon, Elton, &amp; Parinandi, 2013; O'Connell et al., 2010). We identified a novel role for miR-155 in microglia, demonstrating that miR-155 expression is involved in catabolism of fibrillar Aβ1-42. Although focused the experiments reported here on how miR-155 gene expression changes impact microglia Aβ internalization and transit to low-pH compartments, further work should focus on how miR-146a may act downstream of miR-155 to influence microglia inflammatory behaviors and Aβ catabolism in AD.

Targeting the behavior of microglia has been suggested as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for modulating the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Microglia function could be directed toward clearance of accumulated Aβ, suppressing autoimmune attacks on the CNS, fighting CNS viral infection, or promoting tissue repair functions rather than neurotoxic inflammation in response to acute CNS injury or neurodegenerative diseases. Given the important roles for miRNAs in regulating gene expression during inflammation, we hypothesized that miRNAs could be harnessed to influence microglia activity and modulate the neuroinflammatory response in CNS disease. We showed that conditional expression of miR-155 in microglia in vitro is sufficient to alter expression of an anti-inflammatory miR-146a and to skew the protein-processing, phagocytic functions of microglia. Deletion of miR-155 leads to an increase of Aβ1-42 fibrils in lysosomal compartments, suggesting that miR-155 expression can modulate targets associated with degradation of Aβ.

Using appropriate gene therapy tools, miRNA modulation is a feasible strategy to fine-tune the immune response, skewing microglia behavior toward repair behaviors applicable to each disease setting. We further suggest that miR-155 and miR-146a are two specific miRNA molecules with demonstrated roles in microglia that are likely to serve as important future biomarkers of disease and potential therapeutic targets in several CNS disorders. Further pre-clinical work should focus on elucidating the role of these microRNAs in vivo in models of disease.

We identified a role for miR-155, an inflammatory microRNA, in modulating expression of anti-inflammatory miR-146a in microglia. In addition, we found that conditional deletion or overexpression of miR-155 altered the ability of microglia to transfer internalized Aβ to lysosomal compartments after internalization. Therefore, investigating the molecular and epigenetic regulators that mediate chronic neuroinflammation is crucial to understanding AD pathology. Future studies should focus on investigating the functions of miR-155 target genes that influence lysosome biogenesis, the transfer of Aβ to lysosomal compartments, and receptors for Aβ (like CD36 or TREM2). Overall, improved understanding of the role of miR-155 in microglia and its impact in Aβ processing will help define the pathways that contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathology.

FIGURE 1 Microglia respond to LPS with phased induction of miR-155 and miR-146a in a pattern similar to macrophages.

Primary mouse neonatal microglia were plated and exposed to 100 ng/ml of LPS for one of a set of time points, then total RNA was extracted and analyzed for changes in total microRNA expression. Quantification of (a) miR-155 and (b) miR-146a expression over time post LPS exposure demonstrates that miR-155 is upregulated quickly after LPS exposure while miR-146a is delayed and appears to be upregulated after miR-155 induction. This pattern matches that seen in peripheral macrophages. (One-Way ANOVA with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons. For non-treated (NT) v. miR-155: Day 1: p &lt; .0001, Day 2: p &lt; .0001, Day 3: p = .0016, Day 4: p = n.s. and Day 5 p = n.s. (not significant = n.s.). For miR-146a: Day 1: p = n.s., Day 2: p = n.s., Day 3: p = n.s., Day 4: p = .0441, Day 5: p = .0018. Key: *** = p &lt; .0001, ** = p &lt; .001

FIGURE 2 LPS influences microglia lysosomal transit of fibrillar Aβ1-42 without significantly shifting acidity of low-pH organelles.

Wild-type (WT) microglia were plated and treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 24 hr. Then cells were exposed to 1 μM fAβ1-42-pHrodo for 6 hr or Lysotracker Deep Red for 30 min prior to FACS analysis. (a) fAβ1-42 -pHrodo (PE) molecules localized to low-pH compartments were detected using flow cytometry (BD LSRII). The Geometric Mean of fAβ1-42 -pHrodo were calculated from biological replicates and visually appear to have lower fluorescence after exposure to LPS. (b) LPS treatment significantly downregulated transit of fAβ1-42 -pHrodo to lysosomal compartments where it would fluoresce (Unpaired t-test, p = .0039). (c) Lysotracker Deep Red (APC) representative histograms. (d) 24 hr of LPS (100 ng/ml) treatment did not significantly alter acidity of low-pH organelles (Unpaired t-test, p = .4139, n.s.).

(a) Representative images of WT microglia exposed to fAβ1-42 -pHrodo or fAβ1-42 −488 at 6 hr (where fluorophores do not colocalize) and 24 hr (where fluorophores colocalize). WT microglia were plated and treated with 100 ng/ml of LPS for 24 hr. Then, cells were treated with 1 μM of fAβ1-42 tagged with (b) pHrodo or (c) a non-pH sensitive fluorophore (488) for 6, 12, 18, and 24 hr. Total internalization and levels of fAβ1-42 located in low-pH compartments was detected using flow cytometry (BD LSRII). Geometric mean of biological replicates (n = 3) were analyzed. No change in shift to low-pH compartments was detected using fAβ1-42 -pHrodo (all n.s.). For overall internalization detected with fAβ1-42 −488 there was a significant effect of LPS treatment with increased internalization over 24 hr (Two-Way ANOVA with Tukey's Multiple Comparisons correction: Treatment: F (1,4) = 55.44, p = .0017). While the 6 hr and 24 hr timepoints appear to have particularly significant increases in internalization and the interaction of treatment by time was significant (F (3,12) = 3.577, p = .0469) the post hoc comparisons did not remain significant after multiple comparison correction

(c) Without an inflammatory stimulus, but with miR-155 induction, miR-146a expression was also increased indicating that miR-155 regulates miR-146a expression in microglia.

FIGURE 5 Microglia internalization and transit of fAβ1-42 to low pH compartments in the endosome/lysosome pathway is influenced by miR-155.

Microglia from miR-155flx/flx or mBIC-FSF mice were isolated, plated, and transfected with rAAV2-Cre for 7 days, then RNA was isolated and assayed by qPCR for changes in miRNA expression (unpaired t-test). (a) miR-155 CKO showed a significant decrease in miR-155 expression (p = .0048). (b) miR-155 OX showed a significant increase in miR-155 expression (p = .0335). These indicate that the virus is working as expected in microglia. Microglia were then treated with 1 μM fAβ1-42 for 6 hr. Lysosomal fAβ1-42 levels were detected using flow cytometry (BD LSRII). (c) Representative plots of fluorescence detected from each of the cell types analyzed.

FIGURE 6 Conditional manipulation of miR-155 expression impacts fAβ1-42 catabolism in low-pH compartments and internalization at the plasma membrane.

Microglia isolated from WT, miR-155 flx, or mBIC-FSF mice, plated, and infected with rAAV2-Cre for 7 days, then exposed to fAβ1-42 -pHrodo or fAβ1-42 −488 for 12, 18, and 24 hr. Total internalization and levels of fAβ1-42 located in low-pH compartments was detected using flow cytometry (BD LSRII). Geometric mean of biological replicates (n = 3) were analyzed. (a) Using a Two-Way ANOVA we observed an interaction of genotype and time (F (6,15) = 8.827, p = .0003) of miR-155 CKO and fAβ1-42 -pHrodo exposure over time. A significant shift to low-pH compartments was detected in miR-155 CKO microglia using fAβ1-42 -pHrodo at 6 hr compared to miR-155 OX microglia (Tukey's corrected multiple comparisons, p = .0001). (b) Using a two-way ANOVA we observed an interaction of genotype and time (F (6,18) = 4.752, p = .0046). Tukey's corrected multiple comparisons showed a significant increase in fAβ1-42-488 internalization relative to control by miR-155 CKO microglia (p = .0388) and miR-155 OX microglia (p = .0287) at 6 hr. miR-155 CKO microglia showed non-significant trends in fAβ1-42-488 internalization at 12 hr compared to control (p = .052) or miR-155 OX microglia (p = .2040). At 18 hr miR-155 CKO microglia peak in fAβ1-42-488 internalization compared to miR-155 OX microglia (p = .0214), with a plateau thereafter. Key: **** = p &lt; .0001, * = p &lt; .05
