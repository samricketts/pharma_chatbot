Objective

This study’s aims are to identify whether or not a relationship between statin use and rate of cognitive decline exists.

Background

The relationship between statins and MCI has been investigated in the past with the evidence showing mixed results.

Methods

768 subjects were identified with MCI. Subjects were stratified into 6 possible groups according to ApoE4 status and statin use and assessed for decline in cognitive function.

Results

All cognitive assessments trended towards less decline with statin use. ADAS11 showed the biggest difference in mean change between statin users and nonusers (−0.82 vs. −1.22 respectively). Change reached marginal significance on the ADAS11 when stratified by ApoE4 negative subjects.

Conclusion

All cognitive assessments trended towards less decline when subjects were concurrently treated with a statin, supporting the position that statins do not have a net negative effect on cognitive assessment and suggests a potential treatment benefit.


1.2 Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease is increasingly prevalent in the United States. As of 2015 there are an estimated 5.3 million individuals in the US suffering from Alzheimer’s. It also affects approximately 10% of the population over the age of 651. The rate of MCI progressing to dementia when thought to be of neurodegenerative origin is approximately 10% per year. The rate of decline on MMSE in Alzheimer’s disease is approximated at 3 to 3.5 points per year. In rapidly progressive cases, decline can reach 5 to 6 points annually2. Mean survival after diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease ranges from three to eight years2.

The direct effects of plasma cholesterol and related lipoproteins on the incidence of dementia and cognitive decline have long been controversial. Senile neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the pathogenic hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease and increasing evidence links brain cholesterol with both plaques and tangles3. Recent studies have shown a positive correlation between HDL levels and MMSE performance and a negative correlation between LDL levels and immediate and delayed recall4. Several epidemiological studies also showed that elevated total serum cholesterol was a significant risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, independent of ApoE status2. Lowering cholesterol levels via statins is associated with decreased β-amyloid5.

Past studies noted that subjects with incident dementia had higher total cholesterol at their first visit6. Cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis have also been found to correlate with Alzheimer’s disease7. Increased glucose levels and decreased HDL levels increase risk of incident MCI as well6. High midlife total cholesterol has been associated with decreased memory and fluency later in life8 For this reason, statins have long been purported to play a role in cognitive decline; however, the general consensus on this role is mixed. Recent studies have shown that statin use is associated with a reduced risk of dementia. Specifically lipophilic statins were found to have the greatest reduction in risk9.

Evidence that statins decrease the risk of incident dementia is convincing from an epidemiological standpoint. Some studies show that statin users had a five fold lower risk of incident Alzheimer’s disease and a three fold lower risk of MCI6. Statins have also been shown to decrease the risk of Alzheimer’s in subjects under 80 years old, after controlling for sex, education level and self-rated health10. There have been three major clinical trials investigating the role of statins in cognitive decline. The CLASP study in 2011 assessed the use of Simvastatin in probable Alzheimer’s. It showed no significant difference in cognitive decline between statin therapy and a placebo when measured by ADAS-Cog11. The LEADe trial in 2010 studied Atorvastatin therapy in mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease and showed no net benefit of statin therapy to placebo over 72 weeks12. This study focused on ADAS-Cog and ADAS-CGIC as benchmarks. These two clinical trials contradict the initial findings by Sparks in 2005 that displayed a significantly decreased rate of cognitive decline by Atorvastatin on ADAS-cog and MMSE over 6 months13. These values were also near significant at the 12 month mark as well13. All three of these trials focused on subjects with Alzheimer’s disease. The PROSPER trial also showed that Pravastatin had no significant effect on cognitive function in the elderly14. Clinical trial data on subjects with mild cognitive impairment does not exist. The severity of disease progression amongst the selected subject population may play a role. By focusing on individuals categorized as mild cognitive impairment, any relationship between progression of cognitive impairment and statin use should be teased out more easily.

The ADNI database has the unique attribute of possessing prospectively collected data, which has not been analyzed in past studies. Past epidemiological studies have focused on utilizing retrospectively gathered data. The focus of this study will be to assess whether or not cognitive decline is affected by a statin regimen. Randomized controlled trials suggest that the dementia stage of Alzheimer’s disease may be too late for significant benefits of statin therapy15, In order to assess cognitive decline at an earlier time point in disease progression, it is necessary to study subjects that have not progressed to Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment is an ideal population to assess whether or not early intervention with a statin will be beneficial.

1.3 Methods

Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

ADNI’s data requisition website was the source of all data. The analysis focused on information contained within a summary file that ADNI had compiled and a medication file containing home medications for each subject. These files were the ADNIMERGE and RECCMEDS data files respectively. This list was utilized to isolate any subject that had been prescribed a statin. Each subject was included in the database regardless of statin type or dose No other lipid lowering medications were considered when data was being collected; however, patients concurrently on other lipid lowering agents were not excluded from analysis. Of the 1737 subjects contained within the ADNIMERGE file, 939 were identified as statin users after cross-referencing with the RECCMEDS file. Statins queried include Atorvastatin, Fluvastatin, Lovastatin, Pravastatin, Rosuvastatin, and Simvastatin.

ADNI’s summary file was then utilized to isolate any subject within the database that was labeled as having a diagnosis of MCI. ADNI has broken down each subject into various levels of cognition based on the Petersen criteria for MCI16. The two levels of progression that we decided to include in our definition of MCI were the early and late MCI subjects. Within these categories 872 subjects were identified with a diagnosis of MCI. These two parameters (statin status &amp; MCI status) formed the major categorical parameters for isolating data. MCI status formed our inclusion criteria, and statin status formed the dividing line between control and test groups.

All enrolled subjects or their legal representatives sign a written informed consent approved by an Institutional Review Board (Western Institutional Review Board, Puyallup, WA). Annual visits and exams for cognition and criteria for clinical diagnoses are previously described. All assessments were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

All subjects that had two cognitive assessments at least one year apart were then identified. This would make a valuation of cognitive change over a one-year period possible and assess whether or not statins played a role in rate of change. Amongst the 872 subjects with a past diagnosis of MCI, 768 subjects also had greater than one year of cognitive assessment.

Finally, to formulate the parameters for each test group, subject’s ApoE4 allele status was evaluated. Within the ADNI database, each subject was labeled as a 0, 1, or 2 depending on how many ApoE4 alleles he or she carried. A status of 0 correlates to homozygous negative for ApoE4(−/−), 1 correlates to heterozygous for ApoE4(+/−), and 2 correlates to homozygous positive for ApoE4(+/+).

This final parameter was cross-referenced with each subject’s statin status to yield 6 total groups.

MCI, ApoE4(−/−), statin negative (n = 179)

MCI, ApoE4(−/−), statin positive (n = 198)

MCI, ApoE4(+/+), statin negative (n = 26)

MCI, ApoE4(+/+), statin positive (n = 60)

MCI, ApoE4(+/−), statin negative (n = 120)

MCI, ApoE4(+/−), statin positive (n = 185)

These 6 groups were then analyzed in three separate iterations. First, the data was analyzed as two large groups: MCI statin positive and MCI statin negative. These groups had 443 and 325 subjects respectively. The analysis of these two groups would yield information on the effect statins have on MCI independent of ApoE4 status. We then performed a second analysis comparing MCI, ApoE4 (+/+), statin positive vs. MCI, ApoE4 (+/+), statin negative (245 and 146 subjects respectively), and a second group comparing MCI ApoE4 (−/−) statin positive vs. MCI, ApoE4 (−/−), statin negative (198 and 179 subjects respectively). In this iteration, ApoE4 (+/−) and ApoE4 (+/+) were lumped together in the ApoE4 (+/+) category. The final analysis compared the 6 groups shown above. ApoE4 trait, carriers, and negatives were used as controls when comparing the effects statins had on each group respectively.

Each subject was analyzed by multiple forms of cognitive assessment yielding up to 4 possible cognitive assessments: The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale 11, Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale 13, Mini Mental Status Exam, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Each subject is given baseline scores for each cognitive assessment at the time of being entered into the ADNI database. These scores were compared to future cognitive assessment as close as possible to one year in the future. This cognitive change was the value used to assess significance.

The data was then reassessed in a mixed effects model while controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, and marital status. This analysis consisted of the same six iterations as stated above; however, utilized all data points based on how many years past baseline they occurred.

1.3.1 Statistical Methods

Demographic characteristics of statin users and non-users were evaluated using descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, frequencies and proportions. Two-sample t-tests were implemented to determine differences in means between statin users and non-users. Furthermore, chi-squared analysis was employed to test differences in proportions. Means and standard deviations of outcome differences from baseline were assessed in statin users and non-users. Two-sample T-tests were used to determine differences in outcome change from baseline. To investigate whether the ApoE4 status confounded the results, means and standard deviations of outcome differences from baseline were assessed between statin users and non-users in strata defined by ApoE4 Status (ApoE4 Negative or ApoE Positive). Further analyses were performed within the ApoE Positive stratum by further stratifying by ApoE Trait status (ApoE4-X or ApoE4-4). Finally, the Generalized Mixed Effects model was implemented to estimate the mean differences of the primary outcomes between the six APOE4/Statin groups with “MCI, ApoE4(−/−), statin negative” as our reference group. The final model adjusted for age, gender ethnicity, marital status and time from baseline. Furthermore, the interaction group, APOE4/Statin group × Time, was added to the model to ascertain whether the time from baseline modifies the association between APOE4/Statin status and the primary outcomes. Unless stated otherwise, p-values &lt;0.05 were deemed statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using STATA Data Analysis and Statistical Software (Version 14, StataCorp, College Station, TX).

1.4 Results

1.4.1 Overall demographics

Subject demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1. The mean age of the statin user and non-user population was 73 years of age. However, 62% of the statin population was male compared to 55% in the non-user population. The statin user population consisted mostly of Non-Hispanic subjects (98.2%) and Caucasian subjects (93.5%). Similarly, the Non-Hispanic and Caucasian subjects were the highest percentage within the statin non-user population (94.8% and 94.5% respectively). Gender and Ethnicity showed statistically significant differences in proportions between the statin user and non-user categories (p=0.046 and p=0.008 respectively) (Table 1).

1.4.2 MCI Outcomes between Statin Users and Non-Users

Differences in the mean change of MCI outcomes between statin users and non-users are shown in Table 2 and figure 1. ADAS11 showed the biggest difference in mean change between statin users and non-users (−0.82 vs. −1.22 respectively), followed by ADAS13 (−1.32 vs. −1.6 respectively). MMSE (statin positive = 0.74 vs. statin negative = 0.83) and MOCA (statin positive = −0.10 vs. statin negative = −0.12) showed the least differences in mean change from baseline. There were no statistical significant differences in mean change from baseline between statin users and statin non-users.

1.4.3 MCI Outcomes Stratified by ApoE4 Positive vs. Negative

Amongst the subjects who were ApoE4 positive, ADAS13 showed the biggest difference in mean change from baseline between statin users and non-users (statin positive = −1.9 vs. statin negative = −2.4), followed by MMSE (statin positive = 0.99 vs. statin negative = 1.4) and ADAS11 (statin positive = −1.3 vs. statin negative = −1.6). MOCA did not show any differences in mean change between statin users and non-users (statin positive = 0.22 vs. statin negative = 0.22). The differences in mean change from baseline for the outcomes were not statistically significant (Table 2, figures 2 and 3). Amongst the ApoE4 negative subjects, ADAS11 presented a marginally significant difference in mean change from baseline between statin users and non-users (statin positive = −0.18 vs. statin negative = −0.93, p=0.07). However, the differences in the mean changes of ADAS13 (statin positive = −0.57 vs. statin negative = −0.95), MMSE (statin positive = 0.43 vs. statin negative = 0.36), and MOCA (statin positive = −0.46 vs. statin negative = −0.36), between statin users and non-users were not statistically significant (Table 2, figures 2 and 3).

1.4.4 MCI Outcomes Stratified by ApoE4-X vs. ApoE4-4

After further stratifying the ApoE4 positive group into ApoE4-X (allele carrier) and ApoE4-4 (allele trait), ADAS11 and ADAS13 presented with the biggest differences in mean cognitive outcome changes from baseline among the ApoE4-4 subject population (statin positive = −1.6 vs. statin negative = −2.9, and statin positive = −2.5 vs. statin negative = −3.8 respectively), followed by MMSE (statin positive = 1.2 vs. statin negative = 2.1) and MOCA (statin positive = 0.88 vs. statin negative = 1.2). Although the differences in the mean change are clinically relevant, the differences were not statistically significant (Table 2). Subjects who are ApoE4 carriers yielded differences in mean change from baseline in ADAS13 (statin positive = −1.7 vs. statin negative = −2.1), MMSE (statin positive = 0.92 vs. statin negative = 1.3) and MOCA (statin positive = 0.04 vs. statin negative = −0.03). ADAS11 showed changes of −1.3 in statin users and non-users.

1.4.5 Mixed Effects model Estimating Mean difference in outcomes

The mixed effects model showing the mean differences between APOE4/Statin status and ADAS 11 ADAS 13 MMSE, and MOCA, respectively are reported in Table 3. After adjusting for selected covariates, the mean differences of ADAS 11 scores relative to the reference group were greater within the statin negative groups (ApoE4 (+/+), Statin negative Beta (95% CI) = 1.53 (0.28, 2.78), ApoE4 (+/−), Statin negative Beta= 2.13 (−0.17, 4.45)) compared to the statin positive groups (ApoE4 (−/−), Statin positive Beta(95%CI) = −0.85 (−1.95, 0.25), ApoE4 (+/+), Statin positive Beta(95%CI) = 0.72 (−0.42, 1.86), ApoE4 (+/−), Statin positive Beta(95%CI) = 1.48 (−0.16, 2.14)). Similar trends are reported with ADAS 13, MMSE and the MOCA as our primary outcome which indicates statins are positively affecting cognitive impairment relative to the scores. Finally, our analysis shows that the covariate of Time significantly modifies the association between APOE4/Statin and ADAS 11 (Beta (95% CI)= 0.45 (0.39, 0.51)), ADAS 13 (Beta (95% CI)= 0.52 (0.46, 0.59)), MMSE (Beta (95%CI)= −0.25 (−0.27, −0.21), and MOCA (Beta (95% CI)= −0.22 (−0.27, 0.18)), respectively (p&lt;0.001).

1.5 Discussion

Using the ADNI dataset and analyzing cognitive assessment in amnestic MCI for statin use with ApoE as a covariate, we identify many important findings. First, all cognitive assessments trended towards less decline when the subject was concurrently treated with a statin. This supports the position that statins do not have a net negative effect on any form of cognitive assessment.; When examining ApoE4 status as a covariate by holding statin status constant, statistical significance was found in two of four cognitive assessments in statin negative subjects, and three of four cognitive assessments in statin positive subjects. ADAS13 and MMSE in statin negative subjects and ADAS11, ADAS13, and MMSE in statin positive patients were found to have ApoE4 positivitiy. These data suggest the effect of statins is not primarily an Apo E 4 effect. Finally, although no significant numerical trends were apparent, the trending of the data does suggest a potential treatment benefit. When it comes to the mixed effects model, all iterations that were statin positive had less cognitive decline when compared to their statin negative counterparts. This trend held firm across all four cognitive assessments.

Past studies have shown that ApoE4 carriers have significantly greater mean LDL when compared to ApoE4 negative individuals17. However, no significant differences were noted in total cholesterol, HDL, total cholesterol to HDL ratio or triglyceride levels17. ApoE4 heterozygotes were also noted to have higher HDL levels and lower total cholesterol to HDL ratios when compared to ApoE4 homozygotes. Due to the significant effect that statins have on LDL, it would seem appropriate for ApoE4 carriers to have a greater reduction in rate of cognitive decline than their ApoE4 negative counterparts. Consistent with these past studies, ApoE4(+/+) subjects had higher rates of cognitive decline.

Aside from the obvious effects statins have on cholesterol and lipoprotein levels, statins have been found to have other effects that may prove effective against dementia progression. Statins have anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects that block the synthesis of isopretinoid intermediates, which serve as lipid attachments for intercellular signaling2. Not all effects of statins have proved beneficial. Statins have been shown to decrease levels of vitamin E and ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10). Research speculates that decreased levels of lipoproteins in the blood lead to subtle impairments in mental processing via vitamin E, vitamin A and other fat soluble substances2. Confounding this issue is the fact that cognitive impairments and decrements over time are associated with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, etc. Cerebrovascular changes (white matter hyperintensities) increase stroke risk, and these individuals are very likely to receive statin therapy18. For these reasons the general consensus on statins is that the current evidence is insufficient.

The limitation with the largest potential impact on this study is the possibility of confounders. ApoE4 has already been identified as a potential confounder. MCI can arise from different etiologies, and the effect of statins on these various causes cannot be extrapolated from our data. Other potential confounders could arise from the patient population. Drug interaction and other comorbidities associated with people on a statin regimen may also confound our data. Our sampling did not consist of subjects whose sole medication was a statin. Our analysis also lacks information regarding dose and duration of statin use. The ability to separate groups into high-dose and low-dose users was not possible. Our analysis consisted of cognitive assessment over a time period greater than one year. While each subject’s time points were narrowed to as close to one year as possible, potential outliers may have arisen from subjects who’s cognitive assessments were prolonged over an extended timeframe. Finally, one potentially beneficial analysis not performed is a multivariate analysis controlling for age, diabetes, cholesterol levels, heart disease or other health conditions.

Future research needs to reconcile the disparate points of view. Since we show here that statins have no adverse effect on cognition in MCI and may have a slight positive benefit, a clinical trial should be considered with sample sizes large enough to detect significant differences with statin treatment.

Research in Context

Systematic review

Mild cognitive impairment amnestic form is widely considered the prodrome of AD Dementia. Statins have been interpreted as having pro and anti cognitive benefits with mixed data showing signals in either direction.

Interpretation

Using the ADNI dataset, longitudinal data of prospectively characterized amnestic MCI subjects shows that statin use does NOT adversely affect cognition; that statin use might slow rate of progression; and that the observed effect of statins is not principally from Apo E4 carrier status.

Future directions

Statin use might continue to be beneficial. This approach from ADNI needs to be recapitulated in AD dementia. Other studies need to view whether subjects with AD dementia have lower pathological burden for AD pathology. Finally, this might make an argument for a primary prevention trial with statins.
