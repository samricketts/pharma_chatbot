Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are two neurodegenerative diseases with differing cognitive and neuropathological profiles. While both diseases ultimately result in functional disability, differences in the profiles of everyday functioning between the two groups have not been well characterized. The present study examines potential differences in the types of everyday functional limitations present in these two dementias. The present study compared individuals with AD (N = 240) or FTD (N = 13). The Everyday Cognition (ECog) scale was used to measure distinct domains of everyday cognition: everyday memory, everyday language, everyday visuospatial ability, and a variety of everyday executive abilities. A total ECog score was used to represent global disability level. The groups showed equivalent levels of global disability. However, AD group exhibited worse Everyday Memory and Everyday Visuospatial abilities than the FTD group. Contrary to expectation, FTD was not more impaired in everyday executive abilities. Results remained similar when accounting for severity of cognitive impairment or disease duration. Findings suggest that a somewhat different pattern of everyday functional difficulties can be seen across dementia types.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are two neurodegenerative diseases that cause cognitive impairment and functional disability in older adults.1,2 AD is the most common neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia among adults who are 65 years and older. It is characterized by a predominant episodic memory disturbance,3 reflecting early involvement of medial temporal structures including the hippocampus.4,5 As the neuropathology becomes more diffusely distributed throughout the brain, other cognitive impairments emerge in visuospatial abilities, language, and executive function. FTD is the second most common cause of dementia in those younger than 65 and it is characterized by a variety of dysexecutive, language and behavioral disturbances.6 The distribution of neuropathology in FTD differs from in AD, such that FTD-related pathologies are most abundantly found within the frontal and anterior temporal lobes.7 Despite the differences in the clinical and biological presentations of FTD and AD, both disorders ultimately result in functional decline and eventual loss of independence.2,8–12 However, the degree to which differences in the cognitive and behavioral presentations of the disorders result in differing functional profiles, remain unclear.

Existing studies of functional impairment in persons with FTD and AD are limited primarily to examining global measures of disability, including the assessment of basic activities of daily living (BADLs; i.e. grooming, bathing, and feeding) and/or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs; i.e. driving, managing finances, managing medications).9,10,13 While it is important to consider overall levels of disability, the limit to this method is that it combines disparate functional abilities into a single summary score. Using these global measures, a few studies have found no differences in overall BADLs and IADLs between AD and FTD.11,12,14–15 However, one study found that FTD was associated with greater impairments in BADLs but not IADLs, and another study found that the behavioral variant of FTD was associated with greater IADL impairment, particularly in certain kinds of functional activities that involve managing finances/correspondence, and engaging in outings relative to AD.10 Other areas involving the use of telephone, household chores, meal preparation, and managing medications were also more adversely affected in FTD than in AD. This highlights the importance of taking a more fine-grained approach to examining the nature of the functional differences across groups. That is, there may be aspects of everyday function that are more severely affected in FTD and areas of daily function that are more impaired in individuals with AD as a function of their differing cognitive profiles.

The purpose of the present study was to better characterize the nature of functional limitations in AD and FTD. In order to accomplish this goal, we employed a novel approach to measuring everyday function by examining an indicator of both global disability and impairment across specific domains of everyday function. The Everyday Cognition scale (ECog) was used to assess functional impairments across multiple cognitively-relevant domains: Everyday Memory, Everyday Language, Everyday Visuospatial abilities, and three Everyday Executive Functioning domains reflecting planning, organization and divided attention.17

Based on the cognitive profiles associated with AD and FTD, we hypothesized that AD would be associated with greater impairments related to Everyday Memory, whereas FTD would be associated with greater impairment in Everyday Executive Functioning domains. We also compared results using two different ways to control for disease severity (e.g. a measure of global cognitive impairment and disease duration).

METHODS

Participants

Participants were seen for a clinical diagnostic evaluation at one of 10 California Department of Public Health’s Alzheimer’s Research Centers across California (ARCC). The participating institutions included the University of Southern California, Stanford University, and the University of California (at Irvine, San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, and Davis). The sites use a standardized research data collection protocol (except for neuropsychological measures), referred to as the Minimum Uniform Dataset (MUDS).

Criteria for diagnosing Alzheimer’s Disease were followed using criteria from the National Institute of Neurological and Communication Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association.3 The diagnosis of Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) was determined following clinical criteria proposed by Neary and colleagues.18 For the purposes of this study, all three variants including behavioral variant FTD, Progressive Non-Fluent Aphasia, and Semantic Dementia were analyzed as one group due to the limited sample size.

Everyday Functioning

The ECog is an informant-based rating scale that measures different domains of everyday functioning.17 It contains 39 items; informants are asked to compare the participant’s current level of everyday functioning with how he or she functioned 10 years earlier. In this way, patients serve as their own control. Ratings are made on a four-point scale: 1 = better or no change, 2 = questionable or occasional problems, 3 = consistently a little worse, 4 = consistently much worse (there is also a “don’t know’ response option). Informants compared the patient's current level of functioning to how they were 10 years ago and their answers were rated using a four point scale with 1 corresponding to better or no change and 4 indicating that they are consistently much worse. Scores for each of the subscales and the overall instrument are calculated by dividing the sum of the items completed by the total number of items completed by the informant; if more than half of the items were missing or recorded as “I don’t know”, the score was considered missing. Higher scores correspond to greater levels of impairment. The ECog has been shown to have excellent internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.97) as well as good test re-test reliability (r = 0.82, p &lt; .001).17 Confirmatory factor analysis supports the separable functional domains reflected in the ECog: Everyday Memory, Everyday Language, Everyday Visuospatial Functions, Everyday Planning, Everyday Organization, and Everyday Divided Attention.17 In addition to its sound psychometric properties, the ECog has been shown to be sensitive to the early and subtle functional impairments in MCI as well as in dementia.

Statistical Analyses

Demographic characteristics were compared between diagnostic groups using two-sample t-tests. Because the ECog total and subdomain scores resulted in a highly skewed distribution, these measures were first transformed using the natural logarithm. Tobit regression models with a lower bound of 0 (corresponding to a 1 on the original ECog scale) were then used to compare differences between the diagnostic groups as well as to assess the associations with demographic variables. These models can account for the restricted range of the outcome as well as the high frequency of observations near the lower bound. Models were built separately for the ECog total score and each of the subdomains. Typically, in comparing groups of individuals with different types of dementia on a particular variable, some variables should be used to equate the groups or covary in some way for overall severity of illness. There are various approaches that have been used to attempt to account for illness severity, each with its own strengths and limitations (see discussion for further elaboration).12,16 In the present study, we first compared AD and FTD with no correction for disease severity. We then analyzed the groups using two different approaches to account for disease severity: informant-reported length of illness (e.g. time from the initial appearance of symptoms to the present), and the Mini Mental-State Examination (MMSE), a commonly used measure of global cognitive impairment and disease severity.19 These models included main effects for diagnosis and disease severity and the interaction between the two, if significant, to allow for the possibility that the magnitude of the group difference varied by disease severity. If the interaction term was not significant, the estimated coefficient for diagnosis was constant, regardless of the level of disease severity, and quantified how FTD differed from AD. A negative coefficient reflected that FTD was less impaired than AD. However, if the interaction term was significant, the main effect for diagnosis estimated the difference between the FTD and AD groups at a disease severity level of 0 (corresponding to 3 years for length of illness and an MMSE of 20 due to centering of these variables). The interaction term then estimated how that difference changed with an increase of one unit on the disease severity scale. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.2 and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

Demographics

Demographic information is provided in Table 1. The sample included individuals diagnosed with AD (N=240) and FTD (N=13). The average age of the overall sample was 78.3 years (SD = 8.5), the average number of years of education was 14.1 years (SD = 6.4), and 65% of the sample was female.

The participants with AD were significantly older than those with FTD (t=3.18; p=0.002), and the AD patients also had longer disease duration than those with FTD (t=4.3, p&lt;0.001). There were no significant group differences on MMSE (t=−1.4, p=0.16) or education (t=−0.25, p=0.80).

Differences in ECog profiles between AD and FTD

Table 1 depicts group differences using the unadjusted Tobit models that were uncorrected for disease severity. There were no significant differences on the Total ECog score (p= 0.33) or on four subdomains: Everyday Language (p=0.16), Everyday Planning (p=0.98), Everyday Organization (p=0.40), or Everyday Divided Attention (p=0.56). In contrast, participants with AD scored higher (more impaired) than those with FTD on the Everyday Memory (p=0.002) and Everyday Visuospatial (p=0.03) subdomains.

After controlling for duration of illness and centering at 3 years, there were no group differences on the ECog Total score at 3 years of illness (f3=−0.12, SE=0.09, p=0.22), although there were larger differences at a shorter length of illness (f3=0.10, SE=0.04, p=0.03). Evaluation of the individual ECog domains again indicated that the participants with AD were more impaired than those with FTD in the areas of Everyday Memory (f3=−0.31, SE=0.086, p&lt;0.001) and Everyday Visuospatial ability at 3 years of illness (β=−0.34, SE=0.13, p=0.01), with even larger differences among those with shorter length of illness (ECog Memory: β=0.13, SE=0.04, p&lt;0.001; ECog Visuospatial: β=0.14, SE=0.06, p=0.026) (Figure 1). As can be seen in the Figure, as length of illness increases, the difference between the groups decreases. Although the groups did not differ in the Everyday Organization subdomain at 3 years of illness (β=−0.19, SE=0.14, p=0.17), there was a trend for the AD group to have more impairment in this domain (β=0.12, SE=0.06, p=0.06) earlier in the disease process. There were no group differences in terms of Everyday Language (p= 0.13), Everyday Divided Attention (p=0.37), and Everyday Planning (p=0.75) subdomains at any level of length of illness (the interaction terms were not significant: p&gt;0.15).

Although there was not a statistically significant difference between AD and FTD with regard to their overall MMSE scores, previous studies have used this as an alternative way to equate groups. As such, the MMSE was centered at 20 points and then entered into the Tobit models as a covariate. Unlike some of the models with length of illness, the interaction between diagnosis and MMSE was not significant for any of the ECog domains (p&gt;0.2 for all), so results presented here are from models without the interaction term. Overall results were similar to those above, except that group differences were the same across all MMSE levels. The Total ECog score did not differ by group after accounting for MMSE (p=0.51). Among the individual ECog subdomains, FTD was associated with significantly better Everyday Memory (β=−0.25, SE=0.08, p=0.003) and Everyday Visuospatial ability (β=−0.25, SE=0.12, p=0.04) after accounting for MMSE. There was a trend for the FTD subjects to have worse Everyday Language (p=0.07). No differences were noted between the two groups in terms of, Everyday Organization (p=0.64), Everyday Planning (p= 0.88), and Everyday Divided Attention (p= 0.62).

Due to the conceptual overlap between the Everyday Planning, Everyday Organization, and Everyday Divided Attention domains, we collapsed these variables into a single Everyday Executive Functioning domain and repeated the analyses. The subsequent results remained the same as those presented above. There was still no statistically significant difference between diagnostic groups in the Everyday Executive composite in either the unadjusted models (p=0.99), the model adjusted for length of illness (p=0.79), or the model adjusted for MMSE (p=0.93). There was no significant interaction between group and length of illness (p=0.13) or MMSE (p=0.63).

DISCUSSION

AD and FTD are two neurodegenerative diseases with different clinical and pathological characteristics that eventually lead to functional disability. Not surprisingly, we found that overall level of disability as measured by the Total ECog score was similar across AD and FTD. However, further examination of the specific domains of everyday abilities revealed that the AD group consistently exhibited worse Everyday Memory and Everyday Visuospatial abilities than the FTD group even after accounting for overall disease severity using MMSE scores or length of illness. Contrary to our initial hypotheses, the FTD group did not demonstrate greater impairment in any of the Everyday Executive Functioning domains that were examined.

The finding that the AD group showed greater impairment in functional abilities that are dependent on memory is consistent with the idea that decrements in episodic memory are the hallmark cognitive feature of this disease.20 Previous studies have linked deficits in episodic memory to hippocampal volume loss and medial temporal dysfunction which can be seen, even in the earliest stages of AD. The present findings suggest that AD is associated not only with impairments on neuropsychological measures of episodic memory but that these deficits translate into real-world functioning (e.g. difficulty recalling conversations and remembering a few shopping items without a list). It is worth noting that not all studies have shown individuals with AD to be more impaired on neuropsychological measures of memory, than individuals with FTD.21,22 However, it is commonly accepted that the nature of the memory impairment is different in the two disorders (e.g., memory performance improves with cues in FTD as compared to AD, suggesting more of a consolidation deficit in the latter group).23

Additional findings from the present study indicate that AD is associated with greater deficits in Everyday Visuospatial functioning as compared to FTD. Abilities assessed by the Everyday Visuospatial domain include being able to follow a map to find a new location, and finding one’s way around familiar environments (e.g. neighborhood, local store, etc.). Thus, asking about these types of problems may be useful clinically when considering differential diagnoses between these two diseases. Previous work by our group has shown that greater impairment on Everyday Visuospatial domain on the ECog, is, in fact, associated with worse performance on neuropsychological measures of visuospatial abilities (as well as more poor episodic memory performance).24 Thus, the current finding that the AD group was significantly more impaired in the Everyday Visuospatial abilities compared to the FTD group is consistent with the literature demonstrating that individuals with AD tend to show more impairment on neuropsychological measures of spatial abilities as compared to those with FTD.11 It is also consistent with greater posterior cortical involvement in AD.24–26

In contrast to AD, FTD is characterized by predominant dysfunction of frontal brain regions including the prefrontal cortex and anterior temporal lobes.24 The resulting clinical impairments can include prominent executive dysfunction, characterized by issues with attention, planning, organization, and changes in social behavior and emotional regulation.1, 27–29 Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that the two diagnostic groups were equally impaired across all three areas of everyday executive functioning related to planning, organization, and divided attention. The lack of differences between the two groups in the three everyday executive functioning domains (or the composite of all three) could be the function of several factors. First, the three everyday executive abilities generally represent some of the most complex everyday abilities (e.g., developing a schedule in advance of anticipated events, keeping financial records organized, prioritizing tasks, the ability to do two things at once, etc.) so it is possible that these are particularly sensitive to functional decline regardless of the affected neural networks. It is also possible that the three everyday executive ECog domains may not be optimally sensitive to some of the particular functional problems that result from the executive problems associated with FTD. Some examples include, prominent apathy or changes in social roles and patterns of interacting that impact aspects of daily functioning. Another explanation may be that by the time someone is diagnosed with a dementia syndrome, executive-mediated functional problems are less specific to dementia type. A paper by Mioshi and colleagues highlight that differences in regional patterns of atrophy were associated with a common final pathway of ADLs impairment in AD and FTD.30 It is possible that if individuals with prodromal or very early AD and FTD were compared, we would observe additional differences in other ECog domains. In fact, our analysis using length of illness as a covariate suggests greater differentiation of functional limitation patterns earlier in the disease course, and less differentiation with greater disease length.

It is important to recognize that in the original ECog validation studies, the participant sample was demographically and cognitively diverse but included few individuals with FTD. The observed factor structure of the ECog in that initial study may not be totally invariant across vastly different clinical groups including FTD.17 In a similar sample, we have shown that neuropsychological measures of memory were independently associated with each of the ECog domains, executive functioning was independently related to the everyday executive domains of the ECog, and spatial ability was uniquely related to the ECog Visuospatial domain.31 However, the neuropsychological determinants of the ECog domains may be different in different patient populations. Finally, we have previously demonstrated that all of the ECog domains are significantly associated with both apathy and depression, independently of the cognition.32 The behavioral and neuropsychiatric correlates of the ECog domains may also vary across different clinical samples, including among those with FTD as compared to AD. These questions should be the focus of further study.

Individuals with FTD can present with various cognitive and behavioral subtypes that include aphasia syndromes.29 Consistent with this, findings from the current study showed a trend for those with FTD to have worse Everyday Language abilities compared to their AD counterparts. Such results are consistent with one previous study showing greater language-based IADL impairments in the language variants of FTD compared to AD including greater difficulty using a telephone and managing financial correspondence.10

The question of how to most appropriately control for disease severity across two different dementia types such as AD and FTD is an important one. Common methods include using a global measure of cognitive impairment (e.g., the MMSE) or length of illness.2, 33 However, there are limitations to both approaches. For instance, length of illness is a subjective, retrospective judgment made by the caregiver. Some reports suggest that FTD may be associated with a shorter disease course and controlling for length of illness may not be the best way to equate the groups.11, 16, 33 In contrast, using the MMSE is a more objective method of equating the two groups. However, it emphasizes assessment of memory and therefore may be biased towards estimating greater levels of impairment in AD. One could argue that the unadjusted models (not correcting for disease severity in any way) may provide an appropriate comparison because the groups did not differ in terms of overall disability as measured by the ECog Total score.

There are limitations to the current study. First, we used a relatively small FTD sample, and the lack of significant findings could be attributable to limited statistical power, which increased the risk of committing a Type II error (e.g. failing to reject a false null hypothesis). However, our FTD sample size is relatively comparable to other studies that have examined everyday function in FTD.24, 27 The FTD sample included in this study was comprised of a rather heterogeneous group of syndromes that included different subtypes (e.g. either the behavioral or language variants). Due to the limited sample size, it was not feasible to separate the subgroups for statistical analyses. If we had been able to separate FTD into more distinct subtypes and examine their functional profiles separately, the results may have been different. This is an important avenue for future study

The ECog is an informant-report questionnaire which presents potential for a variety of biases that can result in inaccurate ratings.34–36 Lack of opportunity to observe various functional tasks may be another source of inaccurate reporting. Despite these limitations, informant ratings have been shown to be very useful in discriminating between clinical groups and correlated with objective measures of disease including cognitive functioning and other biomarkers.26,34, 37–40

In summary, AD and FTD are two distinct syndromes with different cognitive and neuroanatomical presentations. Further, while our two clinical groups did not differ in terms of overall functional disability, when domains of everyday function are measured more precisely, somewhat different functional profiles emerged. AD was associated with greater impairments in functional activities that are highly dependent on memory and visuospatial abilities compared with FTD. In terms of clinical applications, in cases where dementia type is not clear, the present study suggests that, along with clinical history and other aspects of a diagnostic work-up, the nature of informant-reported functional deficits may also aid in determining dementia type.
