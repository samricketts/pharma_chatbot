This study evaluated the utility of baseline and longitudinal MRI measures of medial temporal lobe brain regions collected when participants were cognitively normal and largely in middle age (mean age 57 years) to predict the time to onset of clinical symptoms associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Furthermore, we examined whether the relationship between MRI measures and clinical symptom onset was modified by Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and level of cognitive reserve (CR). MRI scans and measures of CR were obtained at baseline from 245 participants who had been followed for up to 18 years (mean follow-up 11 years). A composite score based on reading, vocabulary, and years of education was used as an index of CR. Cox regression models showed that lower baseline volume of the right hippocampus and smaller baseline thickness of the right entorhinal cortex predicted the time to symptom onset independently of CR and ApoE-ε4 genotype, which also predicted the onset of symptoms. The atrophy rates of bilateral entorhinal cortex and amygdala volumes were also associated with time to symptom onset, independent of CR, ApoE genotype, and baseline volume. Only one measure, the left entorhinal cortex baseline volume, interacted with CR, such that smaller volumes predicted symptom onset only in individuals with lower CR. These results suggest that MRI measures of medial temporal atrophy, ApoE-ε4 genotype, and the protective effects of higher CR all predict the time to onset of symptoms associated with MCI in a largely independent, additive manner during the preclinical phase of AD.

Introduction

There are very few large, longitudinal biomarker studies that have followed cognitively normal/asymptomatic individuals over extended periods of time to determine whether MRI biomarkers of brain atrophy are reliably associated with the subsequent development of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The NIA/AA working group on preclinical AD (Sperling et al., 2011) and Jack et al.’s (2013) model of AD biomarkers specifically discussed this lack of data and the resulting limitations it imposes on our understanding of the preclinical phase of AD and associated biomarker changes. For example, it was noted that “we have not yet established a firm link between the appearance of any specific biomarker in asymptomatic individuals and the subsequent emergence of clinical symptomatology” (Sperling et al., 2011, pg. 3) because current knowledge is based primarily on cross-sectional and short-term follow-up studies. Even less is known about the relationship of MRI biomarkers of brain atrophy to other important factors that might alter risk for progression to MCI among asymptomatic individuals, including genetic risk factors and cognitive reserve. Given that the hypothetical model of AD-biomarker changes proposed by Jack et al. (2010) was recently updated (Jack et al., 2013) to incorporate other factors besides biomarkers that might influence the time course of the AD-pathophysiological cascade, data on the relationship of MRI biomarkers, genetic risk alleles and cognitive reserve in asymptomatic subjects are critically needed. The present study is the first, to our knowledge, to examine these issues by reporting on the relationship between baseline and longitudinal MRI measures of atrophy, genetic risk for AD, and level of cognitive reserve in a cohort of 245 individuals who were cognitively normal at baseline and have been followed for up to 18 years.

Many studies have shown that MRI measures of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in subjects with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD are significantly different from controls (e.g., Atiya et al., 2003; Kantarci and Jack, 2004). Atrophy of MTL regions, as measured by MRI, is thought reflect tau-related neuronal injury, one of the hallmarks of AD (Bobinski et al., 2000; Jack et al., 2002; Whitwell et al., 2008; Zarow et al., 2005). In fact, the MTL appears to be the earliest site of AD-related tau accumulation, with tangles initially appearing in the transentorhinal and entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (Braak et al., 2006; Braak and Braak, 1991).

Most of the data to date about medial temporal lobe MRI changes during the preclinical phase of AD come from cross-sectional and short-term longitudinal studies (&lt; 5 years follow-up) (Apostolova et al., 2010; Blasko et al., 2008; Csernansky et al., 2005; Jack et al., 2004; Jagust et al., 2006; Rusinek et al., 2003, but see Miller et al., 2013, and Younes et al., 2014 for two recent studies with long-term follow-up). Overall, the results from these studies are consistent with the hypothesis that MRI measures of neurodegeneration become abnormal during the preclinical phase of AD and are associated with increased risk of progression. For example, between-group comparisons have reported greater rates of atrophy in the hippocampus (Apostolova et al., 2010; Jack et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2013), entorhinal cortex (Jack et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2013), amygdala (Miller et al., 2013), and total MTL volume (Blasko et al., 2008; Rusinek et al., 2003) among individuals who progressed to MCI or dementia, relative to individuals who remained cognitively normal.

The present study expands on prior investigations by examining whether baseline and longitudinal MRI measures of MTL injury predict the time to onset of clinical symptoms associated with MCI and whether these associations are altered by genetic risk for AD, as measured by the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene and by level of cognitive reserve. The ApoE-ε4 allele is the major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (Corder et al., 1993; Farrer et al., 1997). Some cross-sectional studies have reported smaller MRI volumes and greater rates of atrophy of MTL structures among cognitively normal ApoE-ε4 carriers than in ε4 non-carriers (Burggren et al., 2008; Chiang et al., 2011; Cohen et al., 2001; Donix et al., 2010; Honea et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2011). However, these studies did not include long-term clinical follow-up and diagnostic outcomes that are necessary for determining whether these changes were related to the subsequent diagnosis of MCI. By comparison, the long follow-up period of the current study allowed us to address this issue.

Cognitive reserve (CR) is a theoretical concept proposing that certain lifetime experiences, including education, degree of literacy, and occupational attainment, increase the flexibility, efficiency, and capacity of brain networks, thereby allowing individuals with higher CR to sustain greater levels of brain pathology before showing clinical impairment (for a review, see Stern, 2009). In support of the concept of CR, cross-sectional studies of individuals across the continuum of AD have reported greater levels of atrophy among individuals with higher CR compared to those with lower CR despite similar levels of cognitive functioning, suggesting that the effects of atrophy on cognition are reduced in individuals with higher reserve (Arenaza-Urquijo et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2012; Querbes et al., 2009; Reed et al., 2010; Sole-Padulles et al., 2009). There have not, however, been any longitudinal investigations to determine whether individual differences in CR modify the relationship between structural MRI measures and risk of developing cognitive impairment among asymptomatic individuals. The current study addresses this issue by testing for the presence of interactions between level of CR, ApoE-ε4 genotype, and MRI measures of MTL volume in relationship to the time to progress from normal cognition to clinical symptom onset. Of note, the primary outcome variable in the current study is the age of onset of clinical symptoms, a time point that tends to precede the diagnosis of MCI by several years. Given that most prior studies have used the age of diagnosis of MCI or dementia as the outcome of interest, the present study addresses an even earlier time in the disease course.

Material and Methods

Study Design

The overarching goal of the current study (known as the BIOCARD study) is to identify variables among cognitively normal individuals that could predict the subsequent development of mild to moderate symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The study was initiated at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1995. By design, approximately 75% of the participants had a first degree relative with a history of dementia of the Alzheimer type. The study was stopped in 2005 for administrative reasons. While at the NIH, subjects were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery annually. MRI scans, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood specimens were obtained approximately every two years. In 2009, a research team at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine was funded to re-establish the cohort, continue the annual clinical and cognitive assessments, collect blood, and evaluate the previously acquired data. CSF and MRI scans have not been collected since the study has been at Johns Hopkins, due to funding constraints. See Figure 1 for a schematic representation of the study design.

Selection of Participants

Recruitment was conducted by the staff of the Geriatric Psychiatry branch of the intramural program of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Subjects were enrolled over time, beginning in 1995 and ending in 2005. At baseline, all participants completed a comprehensive evaluation at the NIH, consisting of a physical and neurological examination, an electrocardiogram, standard laboratory studies, and neuropsychological testing. Individuals were excluded from participation if they were cognitively impaired, as determined by cognitive testing, or had significant medical problems such as severe cerebrovascular disease, epilepsy or alcohol or drug abuse. For additional details regarding the evaluation of participants at enrollment, see Albert et al. (2014).

A total of 349 individuals were initially enrolled in the study, after providing written informed consent. MRI scans were obtained from 325 participants at their baseline visit and 219 participants had at least one additional MRI scan in subsequent years. The analyses presented here are based on 245 participants of the 325 participants who had at least one scan. The reasons for the exclusion of participants are provided in Table 1. The subjects included in the present study were drawn from the same subject population as the studies by Miller et al. (2013) and Younes et al. (2014), which addressed different questions from those presented here.

Clinical and Cognitive Assessment of Participants

The annual cognitive assessment at the NIH consisted of a neuropsychological battery covering all major cognitive domains. A clinical assessment was also completed annually. Since the study has been conducted at Johns Hopkins, annual clinical and comprehensive cognitive evaluations continue to be performed, with each covering similar domains as the evaluations given at the NIH. All of the tests that are administered at Johns Hopkins were also given at the NIH, with the exception of the Grooved Pegboard, which is included in the Johns Hopkins battery but was not given at the NIH (see Albert et al., 2014, for a description of the Johns Hopkins neuropsychological battery). Additional tests were given at the NIH, but were not continued, primarily because of time constraints. These tests were not used in the diagnostic process (see below). The clinical evaluation includes a physical and neurological examination, record of medication use, behavioral and mood assessments, family history of dementia, history of symptom onset, and a Clinical Dementia Rating, based on a semi-structured interview (Hughes et al., 1982; Morris, 1993).

Consensus Diagnostic Procedures

Our consensus diagnostic procedure follows the same procedures implemented by the 27 Alzheimer’s Disease Centers in the US supported by the National Institute on Aging (see Albert et al., 2014 for details about the diagnostic process). Briefly, each participant included in our analyses received a consensus diagnosis by the staff of the BIOCARD Clinical Core at Johns Hopkins, which includes neurologists, neuropsychologists, research nurses, and research assistants. Each case was handled in a similar manner: (1) clinical data pertaining to the medical, neurologic and psychiatric status of the subject were examined, (2) reports of changes in cognition by the subject and by collateral sources were reviewed, and (3) decline in cognitive performance, based on review of longitudinal testing from multiple domains, was established (test scores were compared to standardized norms, but cut-points were not employed). We followed the diagnostic recommendations incorporated in the NIA/AA working group reports for the diagnosis of MCI (i.e., Albert et al., 2011) and dementia due to AD (e.g., McKhann et al., 2011). First, a determination was made concerning whether the subject was clinically impaired. Second, if the subject was impaired, the likely etiology of the impairment was identified. Then, the age at which the clinical symptoms began, the primary outcome variable in this study, was estimated, based primarily on the reports of the subject and the collateral source, as reflected in the CDR interview. The version of the CDR used in the present study was specifically adapted to include questions about the types of problems that very mildly impaired patients experience. The age of symptom onset was established for the first visit at which the subject was deemed to be impaired and was reconfirmed on subsequent visits; thus there is a single age of symptom onset for each subject with a diagnosis of MCI or dementia. In most instance, the estimated age of onset of clinical symptoms preceded the date of diagnosis. (For additional studies using the age of onset of clinical symptoms as the outcome of interest, see Albert et al., 2014; Moghekar et al., 2013; Pettigrew et al., 2013; Soldan et al., 2013). The clinical diagnoses were blinded to the results of the MRI analyses.

MRI Assessments and Brain Volume Reconstructions

The MRI scans acquired at the NIH were obtained using a standard multi-modal protocol using GE 1.5T scanner. The scanning protocol included localizer scans, Axial FSE (Fast Spin Echo) sequence (TR = 4250, TE = 108, FOV = 512 × 512, thickness/gap = 5.0/0.0 mm, flip angle = 90, 28 slices), Axial Flair sequence (TR = 9002, TE = 157.5, FOV = 256 × 256, thickness/gap = 5.0/0.0 mm, flip angle = 90, 28 slices), Coronal SPGR (Spoiled Gradient Echo) sequence (TR = 24, TE = 2, FOV = 256 × 256, thickness/ gap = 2.0/0.0 mm, flip angle = 20, 124 slices), Sagittal SPGR (Spoiled Gradient Echo) sequence (TR = 24, TE = 3, FOV = 256 × 256, thickness/gap 1.5/0.0 mm, flip angle = 45, 124 slices).

The volumes of the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala were reconstructed from the coronal SPGR scans using a semi-automated procedure, as previously described (Miller et al., 2013). Briefly, for each of the three regions of interest, landmarks were placed manually in each MRI scan to mark the boundaries of the ROI, following previously published protocols (see Csernansky et al., 1998, for the hippocampus; Munn et al., 2007, for the amygdala, and Miller et al., 2013 for the entorhinal cortex). Additional details about the procedure and the ROI boundary definitions can be found in http://caportal.cis.jhu.edu/protocols. Next, a template was created for the left and right entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala by hand segmenting these structures in a control subject. The same set of landmarks was placed in this template as in the individual subject scans. After landmarking, region-of-interest large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (ROI-LDDMM) was used to map the template to the individual subject scans. This method uses both landmark matching (Joshi and Miller, 2000) and volume matching (Beg et al., 2005) and generates the segmented binary volumes. The procedures were implemented using custom code written in C++. A trained rater then reviewed each segmentation in native MRI space and made edits where necessary. This method is very reliable and has been validated previously in many studies of cognitively normal individuals, as well as in patients with MCI and AD-dementia (e.g., Csernansky et al., 1998; Csernansky et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2009; Younes et al., 2014). For example, for the amygdala, the inter-rater reliability for 9 scans yielded a mean kappa score of 0.895 for left and right segmentations (Miller et al., 2014). The resulting segmented binary images for the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala were used to calculate the volume of each structure, by hemisphere, by summing the number of voxels within the volume. See Figure 2 for an example of the volume reconstructions for one subject.

The thickness of the entorhinal cortex was modeled by first generating a smooth surface from the segmented gray matter volume. Then the gray/white surface was extracted from the closed surface by curvature based dynamic programming delineation of the extremal boundaries so that the surface closest to the white matter was retained (see Miller et al., 2013 for further details). The laminar thickness was calculated as a single parameter based on the ratio of volume/-surface-area in units of millimeters.

The volumetric measurements of the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala were normalized for head size by including total intracranial volume (ICV) as a covariate in all regression models (Sanfilipo et al., 2004). ICV was calculated using coronal SPGR scans in Freesurfer 5.1.0 (Segonne et al., 2004). The measures of cortical thickness were not adjusted for ICV. Although not a focus of the current study, including ICV as a covariate in all models also allowed us to assess whether ICV, a measure of maximal brain volume, is itself a risk factor for cognitive impairment, as has been proposed by some (Schofield et al., 1995; Wolf et al., 2004).

APOE Genotyping and Coding

APOE genotype was established in all but one of the study participants (n = 348). Genotypes were determined by restriction endonuclease digestion of polymerase chain reaction amplified genomic DNA (performed by Athena Diagnostics, Worcester, MA). APOE ε4 and ε2 carrier status were coded by creating separate indicator variables, with ε4 carriers coded as 1 if they had at least one ε4 allele and non-carriers coded as 0. A similar indicator variable was created for ε2 status, but its relation to time to onset of symptoms was not examined given the small number of ε2 carriers.

Cognitive Reserve Composite Score

We created a CR composite score based on three measures thought to reflect Cognitive Reserve: (1) baseline scores on the National Adult Reading Test, NART (Nelson, 1982), (2) baseline scores on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Revised (WAIS-R) vocabulary subtest (Wechsler, 1981), and (3) years of education. These three measures were highly correlated with one another and loaded on a single factor in a factor analysis (using Principal Component Analysis), which accounted for 71.5% of the total variance. The factor loadings were 0.80 for education, 0.87 for the NART, and 0.87 for WAIS-vocabulary. To calculate the composite CR score, these individual measures were transformed to z-scores and then averaged. CR composites such as these have construct validity (Siedlecki et al., 2009) and appear to be more sensitive proxies of CR than years of education alone (Manly et al., 2005; Pettigrew et al., 2013). Note that by operationalizing CR in this manner, the proxy variables represent a set of lifetime experiences that have previously been associated with better clinical outcomes, including reduced dementia risk. We are not making assumptions regarding the neural / cognitive mechanisms underlying any effects of CR, although potential mechanisms are presented in the Discussion section.

Statistical Methods

ApoE genotype and baseline CR in relation to MRI measures

We first tested if there were differences in the baseline MRI measures as a function of APOE ε4 genotype and CR. In addition, we wanted to determine if CR directly influences the rate of MTL atrophy over time. These associations were tested using linear regressions, with the MRI volume (or rate of change in volume) as the dependent variable and the CR composite score, APOE ε4 status, APOE ε2 status, age, gender, and ICV as the independent variables. Both ε4 and ε2 indicators were included in all models to test the effect of each allele independently of the other, using ε3/ε3 status as the reference group. For these analyses, the rate of change in each MRI volume was calculated as the difference in MRI measurements between last follow-up visit and the baseline visit, divided by the corresponding difference in time.

Baseline MRI measures in relation to time to onset of clinical symptoms

Cox regression models (i.e., proportional hazards models) were used to test whether the baseline MRI measures predict the time to progress from normal cognition to onset of clinical symptoms. Data from two groups were included, based on the diagnosis at their last visit: (1) subjects who remained cognitively normal (n = 188) and (2) subjects who received a diagnosis of MCI (n=44) or dementia (n=13) (total n = 57). Two types of baseline models were performed for each MRI measure: a simple model and a full model. For both types of models the outcome variable was the estimated age of clinical symptom onset. The simple models tested the association between the MRI measures and the time to symptom onset including covariates for baseline age, gender, and ICV (except in the case of entorhinal cortex thickness). The full models tested whether the associations observed in the simple models remained the same when further adjusted by ApoE genotype and level of CR at baseline. They included the following additional predictors: baseline CR composite score, indicators for ApoE ε4 and ApoE ε2 status, as well as interaction terms (cross-products) testing the two-and three-way interactions between the MRI measurement, baseline CR score, and ApoE ε4 status. If the three-way interaction term was not significant, it was removed from the model and the analysis was repeated to test the two-way interaction terms. If no two-way interactions were significant, the final model included only the main effects for each variable.

Prior to these analyses, the MRI values were converted to z scores. For both the baseline and the rate-of change models (see below), the censoring time was defined as the last date of diagnosis. We adjusted for left truncation in the data because individuals were required to be symptom free at baseline (Wang et al., 1993). Separate analyses were performed for left, right, and bilateral volumes/ thickness, with the latter calculated as the sum of the left and right measures.

Rate of atrophy of MRI measures in relation to time to onset of clinical symptoms

Additional Cox regression models were used to test if the rate of change of the MRI measures predicted the time to progress from normal cognition to clinical symptom onset independent of the baseline measures. Only subjects with two or more MRI scans were included in these analyses (M = 3.04 scans per subject), which consisted of 121 subjects who remained cognitively normal and 42 subjects who received a diagnosis of MCI or dementia at their last visit. Both a simple and a full Cox regression model were performed for each brain region. These models were identical to the baseline models described above, except that the time-dependent rate of change in MRI measures (i.e., atrophy; described below) was additionally included as a predictor. As for the baseline models, non-significant three and two-way interaction terms were successively removed from the models.

In the Cox models, the rate of change in the MRI measure for each subject was calculated as the slope of the individual changes in MRI values over time, which was then converted to a z-score, i.e., a ‘normed’ slope. The following procedure was used: (1) the MRI measurement at each follow-up time (time t) minus the MRI measurement at baseline was calculated, and divided by the difference in the time between these two measurements [(measurement at follow-up time t) − (measurement at baseline 0)] /t. (2) each of these individual slope values were then centered and standardized across subjects; thus, the rate of change had a mean of zero and a variance of 1. These standardized slope values were used as time-dependent covariates in the Cox regression models, with each subject contributing a standardized slope value for each follow-up assessment that was available (e.g., 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, etc.). These measurements were not smoothed, but were instead treated as a ‘step function’, where the rate of change was not varied between the individual follow-up intervals.

We also calculated hazard ratios (i.e., the relative hazard) for variables in all baseline and rate of change Cox models. Because all measures were standardized, the hazard ratios for each predictor can be directly compared to one another. The hazard ratio (HR) indicates the change in relative risk of progression per one unit change in the predictor. For example, if the HR for the baseline hippocampus volume is 0.74, the relative hazard of clinical symptom onset is reduced by a factor of 0.74 (i.e., by 26%) for each standard deviation increase in this MRI value. Likewise, if the HR for ApoE ε4 status is 1.51, the relative hazard of clinical symptom onset is increased by a factor of 1.51 (i.e., by 51%) in the presence of an ε4 allele.

Group differences in demographic and baseline characteristics were assessed using two-tailed t-tests, with a significance level of p &lt; .05, uncorrected for multiple comparisons (see Tables 1 and 2). All data analyses presented here used R, version 2.14.1.

Results

Baseline characteristics for the whole sample (n = 349) vs. those in the present analyses are shown in Table 1. Baseline characteristics for subjects in the present analyses who remained normal at their last visit vs. those who subsequently received a diagnosis of MCI or dementia are shown in Table 2. The data presented here exclude subjects with a diagnosis of ‘Impaired Not MCI’ but results were comparable when these individuals were included in the group of normal subjects (unless stated otherwise). The mean time from baseline to onset of clinical symptoms for the participants who developed symptoms was 6.53 years (SD = 3.51) for subjects in the baseline analyses and 6.98 years (SD = 3.41) for subjects in the rate of change analyses. For subjects in the rate of change analyses, the mean interval between the baseline MRI scan and the last follow-up MRI scan was 4.23 years (SD = 2.03) and the mean number of scans per subject was 3.04 (SD = 0.99, range = 2-6).

Baseline Cognitive Reserve and ApoE Genotype in Relation to MRI Measures

The linear regression analyses showed that the baseline MRI measures did not differ by APOE e4 genotype (all p &gt; 0.16) or by level of CR at baseline (all p &gt; 0.10). Similarly, there were no associations between baseline CR score or ApoE-ε4 genotype and the rate of atrophy of the MRI measures (all p &gt; 0.30).

Baseline MRI Measures in Relation to Time to Onset of Clinical Symptoms

The results from the simple Cox regression analyses evaluating the association between the baseline MRI measures and the time to onset of clinical symptoms are shown Table 3. The baseline volume of the right hippocampus and the baseline thickness of the right and bilateral (i.e., total) entorhinal cortex predicted the time to onset of clinical symptoms, such that smaller volume or thickness were associated with a reduced time to symptom onset. For the left hippocampus and bilateral entorhinal cortex volumes, the associations were in the same direction, but did not reach significance. ICV was not a significant predictor in any baseline model (data not shown).

Table 3 also shows the results from the full Cox regression models. There were no significant three-way interactions between CR score, ApoE ε4 status and any of the MRI measures. ApoE ε4 status was a significant predictor of time to symptom onset in all models (all HR ≥ 1.99, all p &lt; 0.04), but did not interact with any of the MRI measures or with the CR composite score. This suggests that the likelihood of progressing from normal cognition to symptom onset was doubled for 4 carriers relative to non-carriers, independent of the baseline volumes of MTL structures and level of CR. The CR score was also a significant predictor of the time to onset of clinical symptoms in all models (all HR &lt; 0.50, all p &lt; 0.0001).

For the hippocampus and the amygdala volumes, there were no significant interactions between baseline CR score and the MRI measures in relation to time to symptom onset (all p &gt; 0.2). Consistent with the simple baseline models, after accounting for CR and ApoE genotype, smaller right and bilateral (i.e., total) hippocampus volumes (both HR ≤ 0.69, both p ≤ 0.03) and smaller right entorhinal cortex thickness (HR = 0.76, p = 0.05) were associated a faster time to symptom onset. Significant interactions between baseline MRI measures and CR score were observed for the left and bilateral volume of the entorhinal cortex (both p &lt; 0.05) and marginally for the thickness of the left entorhinal cortex (p = 0.07). To clarify the meaning of these interaction effects, participants were split into two groups, one group with CR scores less than the median and the other group with CR scores at or above the median. Separate Cox regression models for each group indicated that in the low CR group, smaller baseline entorhinal cortex volume was associated with a faster time to progress to clinical symptom onset (HR = 0.64, p = 0.03 for bilateral volumes; HR = 0.64, p = 0.04 for left volume). For the high CR group, these associations were not significant (both p &gt; 0.9).

Rate of Atrophy of MRI Measures in Relation to Time to Onset of Clinical Symptoms

The simple Cox regression models indicated that after accounting for the baseline MRI measures, the rate of change of the right and bilateral amygdala volume, as well as of the left, right, and bilateral entorhinal cortex volume, predicted the time to onset of clinical symptoms (see Table 4).

Table 4 also shows the results from the full Cox regression models. In these models, only one region, the left amygdala, demonstrated an interaction between the rate of atrophy and ApoE 4 genotype with respect to the time to onset of symptoms (HR = 0.23, p = 0.02), though this interaction was not significant when the participants with a diagnosis of ‘Impaired, not MCI’ were included in the group of normal subjects (p &gt; 0.08). Separate follow-up Cox-models for 4 carriers and non-carriers indicated that in carriers, greater atrophy of left amygdala volume was associated with a faster time to onset of symptoms (HR = 0.22, p = 0.008), but in individuals without an e4 allele this association was not significant (HR = 0.82, p = 0.44). For all other MRI regions, there were no significant interactions between ApoE ε4 genotype, CR score, and rate of atrophy of the MRI measures, indicating that these variables have independent effects on the risk of progression.

Consistent with the simple Cox models, after accounting for the baseline MRI measure, ApoE ε4 genotype, and baseline CR score, a greater rate of atrophy of the right and bilateral amygdala volumes and of the left, right, and bilateral entorhinal cortex volumes significantly predicted the time to onset of clinical symptoms (all HR &lt;=0.56, all p &lt;=0.003). Both ApoE genotype and the CR composite score were also significantly associated with the time to symptom onset in all models, while ICV was not a significant predictor in any model (data not shown).

Discussion

The present study examined, for the first time to our knowledge, the association between MRI measures of MTL atrophy, APOE genotype, and level of CR in relation to the time to onset of clinical symptoms in a relatively large sample of individuals who were cognitively normal at baseline. There were several notable findings, which extend both previous research as well as our understanding of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease.

Medial Temporal Lobe MRI Measures during Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease

First, lower baseline volumes of the hippocampus and thinner baseline measures of the entorhinal cortex, particularly in the right hemisphere, predicted the time to progress from normal cognition to clinical symptom onset. These results are consistent with and extend prior findings by Csernasky et al. (2005), demonstrating that not only baseline hippocampus but also baseline entorhinal cortex measures are associated with the time to progress from normal cognition to cognitive impairment. More importantly, the present findings show that baseline differences in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are predictive of outcome in younger individuals than those included by Csernasky et al. (2005) and more than 6 years prior to clinical symptom onset. This is a slightly earlier time point than the date of diagnosis of MCI and suggests that MTL atrophy associated with AD begins several years prior to the manifestation of mild clinical symptoms.

Second, our findings show, that independent of the baseline MRI measurements, the rate of atrophy of entorhinal cortex and amygdala are also associated with time to progress to clinical symptom onset. These findings are in line with previous studies reporting greater MTL atrophy among individuals who progressed from normal cognition to cognitive impairment relative to individuals who remained normal (Apostolova et al., 2010; Jack et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2013; Rusinek et al., 2003). Overall, our findings provide support for hypothetical models of the development of Alzheimer’s disease pathology (Jack et al., 2013; Sperling et al., 2011), suggesting that MTL volumetric changes on MRI scans become evident during the preclinical phase of AD when individuals are still cognitively normal. These results are also in line with findings in individuals with familial AD (due to a dominant mutation) showing increased MTL atrophy in asymptomatic individuals several years prior to the onset of symptoms (Ridha, Barnes, Bartlett, et al., 2006) or estimated onset of symptoms (Benzinger, Blazey, Jack, et al., 2014).

Our findings are also consistent with pathological studies showing early AD-related neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the entorhinal cortex that subsequently spreads to the hippocampus, and then moves into other regions (Braak et al., 2006; Braak and Braak, 1991). Supporting the view that atrophy of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus precedes atrophy in other MTL regions, we found that the rate of atrophy of the amygdala, but not the baseline amygdala volume, is predictive of the time to symptom onset. Given that the baseline measure was obtained further away in time from symptom onset than the rate of atrophy measure, these results suggest that amygdala atrophy occurs after entorhinal and hippocampal atrophy, as both of these latter measures showed a significant association with symptom onset at baseline. This interpretation is consistent with recent structural MRI findings showing Alzheimer’s disease-related atrophy initially in the entorhinal cortex, followed by the hippocampus, and later other MTL regions (Kerchner et al., 2013; Kerchner et al., 2010; Younes et al., 2014). Interestingly, baseline thickness of the entorhinal cortex was more predictive of progression than volume, whereas change in volume but not change in thickness was associated with the risk of progression. This may suggest that entorhinal atrophy begins in localized regions or layers of the EC, initially affecting thickness measures only, and then spreads to other regions, leading to reductions in total volume. This interpretation would be consistent with neuropathological findings, which indicate that the superficial cellular layer pre-α of the entorhinal cortex shows more severe neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the early stages of AD than other entorhinal regions (Braak, et al., 2006).

We cannot exclude the possibility that lower baseline measures of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in the participants who progress reflect life-long individual differences in brain morphology rather than Alzheimer’s disease-related atrophy. However, the finding that the rate of change in the volume of the entorhinal cortex was also predictive of symptom onset suggests that at least for the entorhinal cortex, the lower baseline measures likely reflect an alteration related to the disease process.

Interestingly, the rate of atrophy of the hippocampus was not associated with the time to progression, although the direction of the association was in the expected direction. One possible explanation for this finding is that hippocampal atrophy is highly localized during the preclinical phase of Alzheimer’s disease and that by averaging across the entire hippocampus, the sensitivity to detect localized change is greatly reduced. Consistent with this interpretation, volumetric and thickness changes in the hippocampus during the preclinical and early symptomatic phases of Alzheimer’s disease tend to be localized (mainly to the CA1 region, e.g., Miller et al., 2013, Csernansky et al., 2005, Kerchner et al., 2010, 2013), whereas the amygdala appears to show more global morphometric change (Miller et al., 2013) over the basolateral and basomedial core areas (Miller et al., 2015).

Association between APOE-ε4 genotype and Medial Temporal Lobe MRI Measures During Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease

In regards to genetic status, individuals with at least one ApoE ε4 allele were at greater relative risk of transitioning from normal cognition to clinical symptom onset, in line with numerous previous studies (Corder et al., 1993). Interestingly, with one exception, ApoE ε4 genetic status did not modify the association between the baseline and atrophy measures of the MTL structures and time to onset of symptoms, suggesting that these variables confer independent risk on progressing from normal cognition to clinical symptom onset. Only the left amygdala demonstrated an interaction between the rate of atrophy and ApoE ε4 genotype in relation to symptom onset, such that there was an association between left amygdala rate of atrophy and outcome in ε4 carriers but not in non-carriers.

While a number of cross-sectional (e.g., Burggren et al., 2008; Honea et al., 2009) and short-term longitudinal studies (e.g., Chiang et al., 2011; Cohen et al., 2001; Donix et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2011) of cognitively normal older individuals have reported smaller volumes or greater atrophy of medial temporal regions among ε4 carriers vs. non-carriers, other studies have not found such differences (Hostage et al., 2013; Protas et al., 2013; Tupler et al., 2007). Given that prior studies lacked clinical outcomes, they could not differentiate whether MRI differences based on ApoE genotype reflected a faster rate of atrophy among the ε4 carriers, or the fact that the ε4 carriers were simply further along the preclinical trajectory of Alzheimer’s disease. The present results showing largely independent effects of ApoE ε4 and the MRI measures on time to progression are more compatible with the latter interpretation. One caveat to this interpretation, however, is that many subjects in our study did not develop clinical symptoms until after their last MRI scan. It is possible therefore, that the rate of MTL atrophy is greater for ε4 carriers during the time immediately preceding the onset of symptoms for which we do not have sufficient MRI data. An additional potential explanation for the lack of an effect of ApoE ε4 on MTL volumes and atrophy is that the ApoE ε4 allele primarily affects amyloid pathways (Kim et al., 2009), as opposed to MTL neurodegeneration, which has been more closely linked to tau pathology. Moreover, amyloid accumulation tends to begin in neocortical regions and expands into the MTL only in later stages of the disease (Thal, et al., 2002).

Association between Cognitive Reserve and Medial Temporal Lobe MRI Measures During Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease

Across all analyses, each one standard deviation increase in the level of CR was associated with approximately a 50% reduction in relative risk of clinical symptom onset, indicating that CR, and by inference lifetime cognitive activity, reduces the likelihood of transition from normal cognition to clinical symptom onset (Stern, 2009). Furthermore, the protective effects of CR were found to be independent of the baseline hippocampus and amygdala volumes and of the rate of atrophy of the hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex. These results suggest that during the preclinical phase of AD, CR serves to delay the onset of clinical symptoms, independent of the degree of MRI atrophy. These findings further suggest that the MRI measures are equally useful in predicting progression from normal cognition to MCI in individuals with higher and lower levels of CR (at least within the range of CR levels observed in this study).

The only exception to the above results was an interaction between CR and left baseline entorhinal cortex volume on time to onset of symptoms; for this interaction, smaller left baseline entorhinal cortex volume was associated with faster time to clinical symptom onset in individuals with low CR, but not in individuals with high CR. One possible explanation for why this interaction was observed for the baseline entorhinal cortex volume (but not baseline hippocampus or amygdala volume) may be related to the fact that atrophy in the entorhinal cortex tends to precede atrophy in the other two regions. That is, during the phase of the disease when MTL pathology is limited to the entorhinal cortex, higher levels of CR might be able to fully compensate for the effects of pathology. However, as the entorhinal cortex continues to atrophy and pathology becomes more extensive, spreading to the hippocampus and amygdala, high CR is no longer sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of pathology, though it continues to have a protective effect on outcome.

Prior cross-sectional studies have reported that at a comparable level of cognitive performance, individuals with higher CR tend to have more MRI atrophy than individuals with lower CR, across the spectrum of AD (Arenaza-Urquijo et al., 2013; Querbes et al., 2009; Sole-Padulles et al., 2009). These results suggest that at a given level of MRI atrophy, individuals with higher CR tend to function at a higher level clinically than those with lower CR. The present findings are consistent with this interpretation by showing that cognitively normal individuals with higher CR have a reduced relative risk of progressing to cognitive impairment, largely independent of the degree of MTL atrophy. Likewise, consistent with theoretical conceptualizations of CR (Stern, 2009), the results from the linear regression models indicate that CR does not appear to modify the rates of MTL atrophy themselves, but instead serves to modify the clinical expression of that pathology. A similar conclusion has been reached by other studies, both with respect to hippocampal volume and other Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers (Lo and Jagust, 2013; Soldan et al., 2013).

While there are a number of theoretical models that have been proposed to account for the beneficial effects of CR on clinical outcomes (reviewed in Barulli and Stern, 2013), the mechanisms by which CR operate remain poorly understood. One possibility is that individuals with higher CR are able to select and better utilize optimal cognitive strategies to perform a given task, allowing them to maintain higher levels of cognitive function despite the presence of pathology (for evidence, see Barulli et al., 2013; Czernochowski et al., 2008; Woods et al., 2010). From a neural perspective, this would mean that individuals with high and low CR rely on different (or only partially overlapping) functional networks to perform the same task or they use the same functional network to different degrees. A related possibility is that the brains of high CR individuals are able to compensate for pathology in primary task-related networks by relying on additional brain regions or alternative brain networks to perform the same task. By this account, high CR individuals may not consciously be adopting a different cognitive strategy, but rather their brains show a better capacity for functional reorganization/ compensation than those of individuals with lower CR (e.g., Reuter-Lorenz and Cappell, 2008; Springer et al., 2005; Steffener et al., 2011). A third possibility is that brains of individuals with higher CR have certain physiological characteristics prior to the advent of pathology or aging that allow them to function despite the pathology, such as improved neurovasculature or neurometabolic coupling, the presence of more dendrites, synapses, or receptors, neurotropic differences, or greater neural efficiency and capacity (e.g., Habeck et al., 2005; Hutchison et al., 2013; Speer and Soldan, 2015). Lastly, higher CR may be associated with reduced development of pathology (Valenzuela et al., 2008; Wirth et al., 2014). This perspective emphasizes the neuroprotective effects of CR that prevent pathology from forming in the first place. In general, the plasticity of the brain in response to experience suggests that there is a complex interplay between the experiences associated with higher CR (such as education, occupational complexity, and cognitive activity), brain function, brain structure, and pathology.

Similar to the concept of cognitive reserve, it has been proposed that larger maximum brain size (as measured by ICV or head circumference) may protect against the impact of AD neuropathology on cognition (Farias et al., 2012; Schofield et al., 1995; Wolf et al., 2004). In the present study we did not find a relationship between ICV and the time to onset of clinical symptoms associated with MCI, suggesting that at least during the preclinical phase of AD, overall brain volume does not modify the risk of developing cognitive impairment. Our findings are consistent with other studies that have failed to find a relationship between brain size and age-related cognitive decline or dementia risk (e.g., Edland et al., 2002; Jenkins et al., 2000; Staff et al., 2004).

Limitations of this study

The present study has several limitations. Subjects in the BIOCARD study represent a sample of convenience; in addition, they are well educated, primarily Caucasian, and have a strong family history of dementia. These cohort characteristics limit the generalizability of our results. Furthermore, the mean interval between the baseline and the last MRI scan was 4.2 years, so we cannot preclude the possibility that a direct association between CR and MTL atrophy would be observed with additional longitudinal MRI measures. Going forward, it will be important to examine the relationship of measures of Alzheimer’s disease vulnerability in a more diverse group of participants with additional follow-up scans. Analyses comparing those with a family history of dementia to those without will require longer follow-up as we do not yet have a sufficient number of outcomes to stratify along this variable. While our study examined verbal intelligence, vocabulary, and educational background as components of CR, we acknowledge that factors related to an enriched environment – such as occupational complexity and participation in leisure and social activities – are also important components of CR. Therefore, future studies are needed to address the generalizability of our findings to other proxy measures of CR. We note, however, that education, vocabulary knowledge, and reading ability tend to have similar clinical effects on dementia risk and cognitive aging as these other components of CR (Richards and Sacker, 2003; Scarmeas et al., 2001), suggesting that our findings are applicable to the broader concept of CR.
