INTRODUCTION:

Growing evidence suggests that some common infections are causally associated with cognitive impairment; however, less is known about burden of multiple infections.

METHODS:

We investigated the cross-sectional association of positive antibody tests for herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, and Toxoplasma gondii with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and delayed verbal recall performance in 575 adults aged 41–97 from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study.

RESULTS:

In multivariable-adjusted zero-inflated Poisson regression models, positive antibody tests for cytomegalovirus (p=.011) and herpes simplex virus (p=.018) were individually associated with poorer MMSE performance (p=.011). A greater number of positive antibody tests among the five tested was associated with worse MMSE performance (p=.001).

DISCUSSION:

Cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and the global burden of multiple common infections were independently associated with poorer cognitive performance. Additional research that investigates whether the global burden of infection predicts cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease biomarker changes is needed to confirm these findings.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Dementia, which is most commonly caused by Alzheimer’s disease (AD), remains a growing public health problem, affecting primarily older adults. In the United States (U.S.), the number of adults aged ≥65 with AD is expected to reach 13.8 million in 2050.1 Despite decades of research, no clinically meaningful and effective treatment is currently available2 and, despite a focus on the role of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in AD, the efficacy of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies for AD treatment is still debated.3 Research on modifiable risk factors as a means of reducing the risk of AD and related dementias (ADRD) is needed.4 Although several chronic non-infectious diseases (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease) are associated with higher risk of AD, growing evidence suggests that infection with common pathogens may also increase risk and play a causal role in development of ADRD.5

Numerous infections are prevalent in populations across the lifespan. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are common and become more common with increasing age.6 In the U.S., HSV-1 seropositivity prevalence is slightly less than 50% in young adults and increases to 90% in individuals aged 70 older.7 CMV and EBV both affect up to 90% of adults8,9 and Toxoplasma gondii (TOX), a neurotropic obligate intracellular protozoan, affects approximately 25% of the U.S. population, a proportion that increases with increasing age.10 Varicella zoster virus (VZV) primarily affects children, infecting &gt;90% of the population in childhood, and although infection rates have dropped since the VZV vaccine was introduced, most adults currently carry antibodies.11 VZV vaccination would be expected to increase the levels of antibodies to this virus but not to other agents. Overall, most older adults carry the serologic evidence of having been infected by several of these agents.

Older adults have less efficient immune systems than younger adults and are thus more likely to experience central nervous system (CNS) reactivation of pathogens present in the body.12 This age-related reactivation triggers the body’s pathogen-clearing immune response12 which, through processes such as pro-inflammatory signaling and microglial priming,13,14 may increase risk of ADRD via neuronal death15 and Aβ and phosphorylated tau accumulation.16 Studies have shown persons with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD are more likely to have had HSV-1 and higher antibody titers, which are linked to smaller brain volume in AD-specific regions.17 Moreover, CMV is associated with faster cognitive decline and double the risk of AD18 and higher EBV antibody levels are associated with an increased risk of MCI.19 Limited research has tied TOX to poorer cognition;20,21 a higher prevalence of TOX among persons with AD than in those without has also been reported.22

However, the extent to which common infections affect ADRD risk and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Further, because most studies have investigated individual infectious agents separately, it is unclear whether there is a dose-response relationship, with more common infections associated with poorer cognitive performance. The only published study we could find reported no independent main effect for CMV or HSV-1, but showed that together they were associated with a nearly five-fold increase in AD.23 Because prevalence of infection with multiple pathogens increases with age while the immune system declines, older individuals may be more susceptible to the effects of infection, so age may be an effect modifier. Similarly, viral infection24 and AD25 prevalence vary by sex, but little is known about how infections interact with sex to affect AD. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is associated with greater Aβ aggregation and risk of AD, with evidence showing that ε4 carriers with HSV-1 had an increased risk of AD, perhaps based on susceptibility to the virus and its effects,26 but others have suggested Aβ may protect against HSV-1 infection.27 Studies are needed examining infection-APOE ε4 interactions, especially in racially diverse cohorts, given racial and ethnic differences in APOE ε4 status, and prevalence of infections and ADRD, which may impact susceptibility to infection and its effects.24,28 Here, we investigate the association of seropositivity to five common infections (i.e., HSV-1, CMV, EBV, VZV, TOX) with cognitive performance in a diverse sample of adults from a population-based cohort and examine age, sex, race, and APOE ε4 status as effect modifiers.

METHODS

Cohort and participants

Data for this study were obtained from the Baltimore site of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Study, an NIMH-commissioned study to estimate the prevalence and incidence of, and treatment seeking for mental disorders in adulthood.29 Baltimore was one of five study sites (others included New Haven, St. Louis, Raleigh/Durham, and Los Angeles) and at its initial wave in 1981, 3,481 East Baltimore residents aged ≥18 years were enrolled. There have been four follow-up assessments, conducted in 1982 (Wave 2), 1993–1996 (Wave 3), 2003–2004 (Wave 4), and 2016–2022 (Wave 5). This analysis used cognitive test data from Wave 4, at which in-person interviews were completed with 1,071 participants. Of these, 63% were women, 62% were White, 35% were Black, and 3% identified as other racial/ethnic groups; all participants were older than 40 years. We used data from 575 participants aged 41–97 (mean=58.7, standard deviation (SD)=12.5) with complete infection, genetic, and cognitive test performance data. This study was approved by the Johns Hopkins University Internal Review Board and informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Measurement of Infection

At Wave 4, all 1,071 participants were asked to donate blood or buccal sample. Of these, 888 (83%) agreed; (683 donated blood and 291 donated buccal tissue, with some donating both).30 Immunoglobin G (IgG) antibodies to HSV-1, CMV, EBV, VZV, and TOX were measured in stored blood using microplate solid-phase enzyme immunoassays following previously described methods.31 The presence of antibodies indicates that an infection has occurred in the past and the levels of antibodies reflect the antigenic load. Because most initial infections with herpesviruses or TOX occur during childhood, the levels of antibodies to these agents in older adults are likely indications of reactivation. IgG class antibodies are the main antibodies that arise following infection.32 They are generated by plasma cells following the processing of antigens and circulate in the blood. They appear weeks after the initial infection and persist for several years. In the case of persistent infections (e.g., herpesviruses, TOX), their levels are enhanced by reactivation of the organisms and regeneration of the antibodies.33 IgG class antibodies were measured by solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using techniques detailed elsewhere.34 If serum IgG levels were in the highest quartile based on the distribution of IgG serum levels measured in control subjects, they were considered elevated. We first examined the quantitative antibody levels and then interpreted the results by comparing them to units calculated with standard curves generated on each solid phase microplate and qualitatively based on comparison with pre-established cut-offs.34

Cognitive Measures

At Wave 4, participants completed the Modified Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a word-list learning and memory task. The MMSE is a brief global cognitive assessment that measures orientation to place and time, simple attention and working memory, memory, language, and visuospatial ability.35 Scores reflect the total number of items correct and range from 0–30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. Auditory verbal learning and memory were assessed with a word-list memory (WLM) test from the Iowa Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly project.36 Participants were read a list of 20 words and were asked to repeat as many as possible in any order (immediate recall). Participants were asked to recall as many words as they could 20 minutes later (delayed recall), and were subsequently asked whether certain words were new or had been presented previously (recognition). We used the delayed recall measure as an outcome because delayed recall is the aspect of memory most affected by AD.37 Higher scores indicated a greater number of words recalled (i.e., better performance).

Other Measures

Participants’ sex, race, age, and years of education were collected in the standardized in-person interviews. APOE ε4 status (carrier vs. non-carrier) was assessed using DNA isolated from blood or buccal samples, using an Autopure (Gentra Systems, Inc.) automated workstation. APOE genotype measured by a TaqMan assay.

Statistical Methods

We compared the number of positive antibody tests (0–5) with demographic covariates and APOE ε4 genotype using Chi-squared and t-tests. We examined the distribution of MMSE score and WLM and noted that the data did not fit a normal distribution. We inverted MMSE scores to create a count of errors. We tested the fit of delayed verbal recall and inverted MMSE score against normal and Poisson distributions. WLM fit a Poisson distribution, which has only one parameter, λ, which is both the mean and variance of the distribution. Inverted MMSE did not fit normal or Poisson distributions, due to a large proportion of zeroes (35.6% of the sample). Inverted MMSE more closely fit a zero-inflated Poisson distribution, which is a discrete (i.e., countable) probability distribution. We used Poisson regression for all models examining the association of infections with WLM and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression for all models examining the association between infections with inverted MMSE. In ZIP, the dependent variable is modeled as a mixture of two processes, one of which generates excess zeroes, and is modeled as a logit, and the other of which follows a usual Poisson count process, and is modeled using Poisson regression. ZIP regression yields separate results for the logit and count models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, years of education, and APOE ε4 status (i.e., 0, coded as 0 versus 1 or 2 alleles, coded as 1). We also explored interactions of infections with age, sex, race, and APOE ε4 status.

RESULTS

Among all participants, EBV seropositivity was most common (79.3%), followed by VZV (70.2%), HSV-1 (68.5%), CMV (67.5%), and TOX (24.7%). Participant characteristics by number of total positive antibody tests (0–5) are in Table 1. Most participants (N=488, 84.9%) had between 2 and 4 positive antibody tests with a mode of 3 positive tests (N=210, 36.5%). It was rare for participants to have 0 (N=7, 1.2%) or 1 (N=33, 5.7%) positive tests and few had 5 (N=47, 8.2%). The number of positive antibody tests differed by sex (χ2 = 23.807, df = 5, p&lt;.001) and race (χ2 = 22.599, df = 5, p&lt;.001), with a greater proportion of women and non-White participants represented as the number of positive antibody tests increased. Additionally, older age and lower educational attainment were both associated with a greater number of positive tests (p&lt;.001 for both). There were no differences in APOE ε4 carrier status by number of positive antibody tests (χ2 = 8.1249, df = 5, p-value = .1495).

In the total sample, the mean number of items missed on the MMSE was 1.68 (SD=2.35, range 0–17) and the mean number of items on the delayed recall test was 5.50 (SD=2.92, range 0–16). In ZIP regression models, positive CMV (β=0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06, 0.55, p=.011) and HSV-1 (β=0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04, 0.40, p=.018) antibody tests were associated with a greater number of items missed on the MMSE (Table 2). When examining the total number of positive antibody tests (0–5) as the predictor, a greater number of positive tests was associated with a greater number of MMSE items missed (β=0.14, 95% CI 0.05, 0.22, p=.001) and with lower scores on the delayed recall test, although the latter was only at the trend level of significance (β=−0.03, 95% CI −0.07, 0.004, p=.079). The dose-response association between number of positive tests and cognitive performance showed a clear pattern of decreasing cognitive performance with number of positive antibody tests. The number of MMSE items missed (i.e., incorrectly answered) increased steadily as positive antibody tests increased from zero to four, with participants with four and five positive antibody tests showing similar scores (Figure 1). There was no significant association, between number of positive tests and delayed recall, although the number of words correctly recalled on the delayed word recall test decreased with an increasing number of positive antibody tests (Figure 2).

We next examined whether associations differed by sex, age, race, and APOE ε4 status. Across age, sex, and race, visual inspection of the data showed the same pattern—that a greater number of positive tests was associated with poorer performance on both the MMSE (Supplementary Figure 1) and delayed word recall (Supplementary Figure 2). Further, there was no statistical evidence of interactions by sex (p-value for interaction = .926.), age (p = .552), years of education (p = .416), or race (p = .238). Some differences were apparent, however, in plots stratified by APOE ε4 status (Figure 3). Compared to ε4 non-carriers, fewer ε4 carriers were represented among participants with 4 or 5 positive tests, and a smaller proportion of those with a higher burden of positive tests had very poor performance on the MMSE. Although there was no difference in an omnibus Chi-2 test (p=0.149), in stratified analyses, a greater number of infections was associated with poorer MMSE score among non-carriers (β=0.12, p=.003) but not among ε4 carriers (β=0.04, p=.551).

In sensitivity analyses, we included self-reported diabetes, heart trouble, hypertension, and current smoking status as covariates, but found this did not meaningfully affect the coefficients or levels of significance (results not shown).

DISCUSSION

We investigated the association of infection with HSV-1, CMV, EBV, VZV, and TOX with cognitive performance in 575 adults aged 41–97 from the population-based Baltimore ECA cohort. After adjusting for potential confounders, a greater number of positive antibody tests for these common infections was significantly associated with poorer global cognitive performance, measured by the MMSE, and we observed a trend towards an association with poorer delayed verbal recall. Additionally, where individual infectious agents were concerned, positive antibody tests for CMV and HSV-1 were associated with poorer performance on the MMSE. In general, these findings suggest an additive effect of individual infections on cognitive performance. We did not observe evidence of effect modification by sex, age, or race; however, there was a potential interaction by APOE ε4 genotype, with a stronger association between a greater number of infections and worse MMSE performance among ε4 non-carriers than among carriers.

These results support the growing literature suggesting that common infections are associated with cognitive decline and the development of ADRD. In another study with a population-based, racially diverse sample, CMV antibodies were associated with faster cognitive decline and double the risk of developing AD over 5 years.18 Additionally, mounting evidence suggests that two neurotropic members of the Herpesviridae family, HSV-1 and VZV, are associated with increased risk of AD;38,39 indeed, a study of over 8,000 people in Taiwan showed that those who had documented active HSV infections were 2.5 times more likely to have AD.40 Although most prior studies have investigated the association between individual infections and ADRD, it is common to have multiple infections across the lifecourse. Indeed, most of the participants in this study had antibodies for two to three of the common infections under study. To our knowledge, the one other study that has investigated the additive effect of different infections on AD dementia diagnosis was a case-control study, showing that while CMV antibodies were not associated with an AD diagnosis, the presence of both CMV and HSV-1 antibodies was associated with an almost 6-fold increased odds of AD.23

Our finding that the cumulative burden of infections is more robustly associated with poorer cognitive performance than individual infections raises questions about mechanisms that might account for this. It seems that a greater number of different infections and the body’s response to them impact ADRD pathology. One hypothesis is that these viruses, when they enter the CNS, can induce an immune response in the form of microglial and astrocyte activation and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. This can, in turn, drive Aβ production, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuronal death, which are hallmarks of AD pathology and have been hypothesized as potential causal mechanisms5,13,14 It is not necessarily the initial infection that promotes these long-term inflammatory effects, but rather the reactivation of antibodies, particularly in aging individuals, that may stimulate these processes. For example, latent HSV-1 and CMV increase proinflammatory markers that are associated with cognitive decline (e.g., cytokines, C-reactive protein). Latent CMV infection CD8+ cell fluctuations are also associated with increased interferon-γ,41 leading to increased inflammatory cytokines and eventual Aβ accumulation.16 Similarly, HSV-1-infected cells (compared to uninfected cells) can interfere with autophagy, disrupt intracellular calcium levels, produce Aβ plaques, and promote tau hyperphosphorylation.5 Further, TOX cyst reactivation in the brain can increase inflammation, which can impede dopaminergic function and stimulate neuronal death. Among immunocompetent individuals, regardless of age, TOX and human herpes viruses tend to cycle between latent and active states42 and evidence suggests they may contribute to ADRD development in either a dormant or latent state. Indeed, with or without clinical symptoms, reactivated human herpesviruses are linked to increased AD dementia risk.43

Extending the concept of the inflammatory immune response, the anti-microbial hypothesis of AD states that Aβ, an anti-microbial peptide, acts as a protective immune response against infection.44,45 This framework posits that in response to infection, the body traps and neutralizes pathogens in Aβ.46 In vitro, Aβ inhibits the growth of some of the most common, clinically important human pathogens, including S. pneumoniae and C. albicans, which cause bacterial meningitis and neurocandidiasis, respectively.45 Studies in transgenic murine AD models show that Aβ oligomers inhibited HSV-1 in vitro and in vivo were protective against acute viral encephalitis.44 Thus, presence of HSV-1 (and additionally potentially other infections) may increase Aβ levels as a protective response, but Aβ accumulation may lead to tau hyperphosphorylation, neuronal death, and ADRD.

Given this mechanistic pathway, APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers may be differentially affected by infection because APOE ε4 carriers have higher Aβ accumulation and greater risk of AD than non-carriers. HSV-1 reactivation is associated with substantially increased risk of AD in APOE ε4 carriers but not among non-carriers.26,47,48 Similarly, HSV-1 is associated with greater episodic memory decline among APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers.48 Mechanisms explaining the interaction between APOE and HSV-1 have been proposed, including that ε4 carriers have immune systems that are less able to fight off HSV-1; ε4 carriers are less able to repair the damage done by HSV-1 in the brain; and the fact that HSV-1 and APOE use the same binding site (heparan sulfate proteoglycans) to enter the cell.47 HSV-1 may compete for a binding site more effectively against ε4 than ε3; thus, more cells become infected with HSV-1 in ε4 carriers, making them more susceptible to the AD-promoting effects of infection.47 In the presence of multiple infections, a ceiling effect may occur, whereby viruses are able to compete more effectively against ε4 but only up until a certain point. If more than one virus is present, a single virus (e.g., HSV-1) must compete against both ε4 and other viruses, so a single virus would lose its “edge” over ε4. Therefore, if considering a single virus, ε4 carriers may be more susceptible to the effects of the virus (e.g., HSV-1), but if more than one virus is considered, it may be that ε4 carriers may be less susceptible. This is suggested in our findings, because we observed that a greater number of common infections was associated with poorer cognitive performance in non-carriers but not carriers. To our knowledge, APOE ε4 status has not previously been explored as an effect modifier in the association between infections other than HSV-1 (e.g., CMV, EBV, VZV, TOX) and cognitive outcomes. Thus, the findings in this study are novel and further investigation in larger samples of how APOE may act as an effect modifier in the association between infection and cognition, perhaps based on the number of viruses present, is needed.

Despite our novel findings and the study strengths – including measurement of multiple infections, a diverse sample, and population-based design – the findings must be viewed within the context of the study’s limitations. First, although our sample size was on par with similar studies,18,23 there was limited power for investigation of effect modification and confounding. We did not adjust for neighborhood-level factors that might capture important aspects of socioeconomic status that confound the observed associations. Future studies are needed that account for these variables. Further, there may have been bias, such that ε4 carriers with multiple infections may have selected out of the ECA due to illness, reduced function, severe dementia, or death—reducing their representation in APOE-stratified analyses and leading us to observe a spurious protective effect of the ε4 allele. Given the suggestion here that APOE status interacts with infection, prospective studies in larger population-based samples to investigate these differering risk patterns are needed. Second, the cross-sectional design does not allow us to investigate potential reverse causality. It may be that even mild CNS injuries can lead to both a weakened immune system, and thus susceptibility to infection, and ADRD-associated neuronal damage accumulation.49 Further, cognition was measured at only one time point in this study, but studies that investigated HSV and CMV independently showed infected individuals had faster cognitive decline over extended follow-up time.18,48 We anticipate addressing this with the completion of Wave 5.5 of the ECA. In Wave 5.5, we will assess viral specific CD8 T-cell response, which is essential to understand cellular immunity status with regards to aging.50 This longitudinal design will also allow us to examine the association between total number of positive antibody tests and risk of developing ADRD over time, which will be important for expanding this research and will provide more information about absolute risk. This will offer more information regarding the clinical significance of potential effects of infection on cognition. Because although our coefficients were comparable to those in similar studies 18, interpreting the clinical relevance of the effect sizes observed can be difficult.

Considerable research is needed to understand the relevance of infections as a potentially ubiquitous risk factor of ADRD. Larger sample sizes with longitudinal follow-up will help us to understand the impact of common infections throughout the lifecourse on risk of developing ADRD. Epidemiological studies are primed for investigating the roles of these viruses – and their vaccinations and anti-viral treatments – on impact of ADRD at a time when it is seemingly more critical than ever.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Systematic review: The authors reviewed the literature from traditional sources (e.g., journal articles indexed in PubMed) and meeting abstracts and presentations. The role of common infections over the life course on risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has not been widely studied, but there is a growing body of recent evidence showing a link. We have cited the relevant studies.

Interpretation: Findings suggest a dose-response relationship between the burden of common infections and cognitive performance, with positive antibodies to a greater number of common infections (rather than individual infections) associated with worse performance. Cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus may individually negatively affect cognition.

Future directions: Whether the number of positive common infections is associated with accelerated cognitive decline and higher risk of dementia should be confirmed in independent cohorts and longitudinal studies, including possible underlying mechanisms (e.g., inflammation, Aβ pathology), and interactions with AD risk genes (e.g., APOE ε4, AD polygenic risk). Findings are particularly relevant given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Conflicts of Interest: Alexandra Wennberg receives payment from Janssen Pharmaceutica NV for a separate collaboration. Adam Spira received payment for serving as a consultant for Merck and he received honoraria from Springer Nature Switzerland AG for guest editing special issues of Current Sleep Medicine Reports.
