pmcPrimary tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases in which tau protein aggregates constitute the main underlying neuropathologic process. Tau proteins are a group of six isomers that bind to and stabilize microtubules and play a role in axonal transport. Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD) are considered 4-repeat (4R) tauopathies based on the predominant tau isomer in the aggregates1 and there are currently no effective pharmacological treatments for these disorders. Experimental therapeutic trials designed to slow or halt disease progression have mostly been conducted for PSP and less frequently for CBD. Although several promising disease-modifying drugs of different targets and proven efficacy on animal models have been implemented in well-designed human clinical trials (Figure), all have failed to slow or halt disease progression. In the view of the wide gap between basic research and its translation into clinic, here we reviewed relevant experimental therapeutic trial steps, including participant selection, therapeutic targets, and experimental platforms. Key considerations for advancing the translation of future therapeutic approaches into successful disease modifying agents are provided (Table).

Participant Selection

Important limitations in the recruitment of participants into clinical trials include both misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis. Accuracy of PSP and CBD clinical diagnostic criteria on which clinical trials rely to include participants is largely impacted by overlapping clinical presentations of underlying pathologies. Both, as well as other neurodegenerative disorders, can present with a corticobasal syndrome, progressive non-fluent aphasia, PSP-Richardson syndrome, or frontal dementia phenotype.2 Therefore, a mix of patients with various underlying pathologies may be included in current PSP and CBD clinical trials, especially when inclusion of non-classical or possible or suggestive levels of clinical diagnostic certainty is allowed. The Movement Disorders Society diagnostic criteria for PSP (MDS-PSP) increased the sensitivity of the clinical diagnosis compared to the previous National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Society for PSP (NINDS-SPSP) criteria by providing working definitions for the non-Richardson PSP phenotypes and suggestive criteria. However, this heightened sensitivity was obtained at the expense of lower specificity.3 Inclusion of non-classical phenotypes in PSP clinical trials has been avoided so far due to their less known specificity. Relying only on clinical features has not allowed the development of accurate PSP clinical diagnostic criteria for early stages.4 Core clinical features, such as slowing of vertical saccades and supranuclear gaze palsy, occur later in the disease course5 or are often missed at the clinical visits, which considerably delays the diagnosis. Although latency to diagnose PSP has decreased from 3–4 to 2–3 years in the recent years,6 the diagnostic delay is still quite significant for its short lifespan. At the time patients are included in clinical trials they have already developed severe neurodegeneration which decreases their potential benefit from disease modifying agents. Unlike Parkinson’s (PD) and Alzheimer’s diseases (AD), PSP and CBD do not have a long, clearly identifiable prodromal phase, nor as in AD, accurate biomarker-based diagnostic criteria.

Reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau was reported to identify PSP at group level, but not at single-individual level.7 Specific CSF 4R-tau Real-time Quaking-induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) assays were developed for PSP and CBD,8 but require further refinement to be highly accurate diagnostic biomarkers. However, more recent CSF studies in autopsy-confirmed PSP, CBD, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), AD, and non-tau disorders have identified possible CSF tau biomarkers that may change the future of 4R-tauopathies trials.9 This study identified two CSF tau microtubule-binding-region fragments (MTBR-tau275/total-tau, MTBR-tau282/total-tau) as biomarkers specifically decreased in CBD (area under the curve at least 0.8 against above disorders). It also found that CSF pT217/T217 ratio differentiates AD from primary tauopathies.9 If confirmed, these important findings will allow inclusion of patients accurately diagnosed in therapeutic trials.

Different MRI measures such as simple or combined MR planimetry, volumetry, voxel-based morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging, diffusion weighted imaging, free water imaging, and diffusion kurtosis imaging are valuable in increasing our diagnostic accuracy of the PSP-Richardson phenotype in the clinic,10 and especially magnetic resonance Parkinsonian index (MRPI) could be used as a measure of disease progression.11 However, these measures cannot diagnose PSP or CBD at early stages or identify their underlying molecular pathology. Current first and second-generation tau positron emission tomography (PET) tracers are expensive and mostly developed to identify AD 3R and 4R tau, although there have been recent efforts to develop 4R-specific tau PET tracers.12

The novel CSF CBD and AD biomarkers, in addition to previously described biomarkers, will be added to support the clinical PSP and CBD criteria and rule out mimicking diseases, specifically AD and transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) pathology.13 Of note, the unsuccessful attempt to validate the CBD criteria that led to the inclusion of AD patients was caused due to omitting the use of exclusionary biomarkers.14,15

On the other hand, because PSP-Richardson progresses at a faster rate than all the other phenotypes, even with the same baseline severity,16 it is also important to classify and stratify patients’ samples based on phenotypes or progression rates to control for confounding effects on clinical trials results. The MDS PSP-Richardson probable and possible phenotypes have considerable overlap with PSP-Parkinsonism5 despite the use of the multiple allocation extinction or MAX rules.17,18 Further refinement of the MDS-PSP criteria and sample stratification based on progression rates will improve the accuracy of future clinical trials.

Definition of 4-Repeat Tauopathies Targets

There are mutations in the MAPT gene that induce tau aggregation and lead to frontotemporal dementias with 3 or 4-repeat tau pathology. However, at present, the critical mechanism for the development of sporadic primary 4-repeat tauopathies is unknown. Only a few environmental factors are associated with the disease and heritability is very low (about 6%) in PSP compared to many other neurodegenerative disorders such as AD or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.19 There is reason to believe that tau might be the main target. Genetic phenocopies of PSP and CBD, accompanied with similar brain tau pathology, mostly involve exon 10 of the MAPT gene or its surrounding intronic region.20 These mutations usually lead to an increased 4R:3R tau ratio, and can induce a 4R-tauopathy in animal models.21 Association of the tau H1 haplotype with PSP pathology and the PSP Richardson phenotype supports pathogenicity of tau overproduction and isomer imbalance since the H1 haplotype increases tau expression, predominantly 4R isomers.22 Multiple lines of evidence from in vitro and animal model studies point to various tau pathogenic mechanisms including overproduction and isomer imbalance, abnormal post-translational modifications and decreased degradation.23 Sporadic PSP pathology is complex, and no single mechanism other than tau mutations can fully explain the occurrence of disease pathology. Since consistent success has been shown with genetically supported targets,24 drugs targeting this mechanism are expected to be more successful in clinical trials, such as antisense oligonucleotides (NCT04539041) currently in a phase I trial (Figure).

Despite transgenic mouse studies showing the monoclonal antibodies tilavonemab and gosuranemab targeting the N-terminal extracellular tau were effective, both drugs failed in clinical trials. Target engagement was measured for tilavonemab showing a decrease in free plasma and CSF tau after drug administration.25 However, there was no change in the degree of tau pathology on postmortem brain tissue of treated patients26 suggesting that the tau fragment measured in plasma and CSF was unrelated to the pathogenic brain mechanism. It is currently hypothesized that the fragment involved in the spread of the disease is the MTBR fragment. This fragment is increased in both PSP and CBD affected areas and CSF (Horie et al, personal communication). Alternatively, since basic science evidence of disease pathogenesis in human is hard to obtain, one might argue that the theory of prion-like spread might not be relevant in humans or it might not be the rate-limiting step in disease pathogenesis, and if it is, it is yet not known if this process could be vulnerable to monoclonal antibodies.

Multiple other tau-centered disease modifying mechanisms of action, involving various abnormal tau post-translational modifications or abnormal tau clearance, have so far failed in clinical trials despite promising results in mice transgenic studies. Studies targeting other factors such as oxidation, or inflammation have not been promising in clinic thus far (Figure). The translational failure could be partly explained by shortcomings of animal models to replicate disease pathology. Transgenic P301S and P301L mice are the most frequently used animal models in preclinical therapeutic studies. However, while mice express only 4R tau isomers, rats, like humans, express all six tau isoforms.27 A recently developed rat model expressing human tau28 or ideally non-human primates may increase success in translation to clinical trials.

Alternatively, as targeting a single pathogenic mechanism of action has not been beneficial to date, it could be hypothesized that a variable mix of different pathogenic processes induce tau pathology, and that a single approach could not sufficiently be effective. It is unclear if severe neurodegeneration at advanced stages of starting experimental treatments could serve as further justification to simultaneously target multiple mechanisms. Depending on the phenotype tau pathology starts in neurons but spreads through neurons or glia.29 In this regard, it is unknown whether different therapeutic approaches should be used according to the phenotype or if multiple approaches are needed.

Finally, alternatively or simultaneously, if reprogramming glia to neurons, shown to be very successful in PD mice models,30 is translated into clinic, this could be a promising new development that could allow regeneration of lost neurons leading to meaningful benefits.

Target Engagement and Monitoring Effects

Clinical outcome measures, including the PSP Rating Scale as the primary outcome measure and secondary neuropsychological scales, are used in all recent clinical trials. A shorter modification of the PSP rating scale, to be used virtually, was also recently developed and validated.31 However, clinical measures have inherent limitations including inter- and intra-rater variability, and confounding factors such as fatigue or mood. There may also be insensitivity to small changes leading to the need for large sample sizes to detect benefit.32 To overcome these limitations, sensitive biomarkers could be used as monitoring and/or surrogate endpoints. Such biomarkers, especially if intended as surrogate endpoints, should have acceptable correlation with clinical outcomes as well as high analytical validity.33 Surrogate endpoints are less susceptible to placebo effect and allow smaller sample size and shorter duration to observe effects.34 Although controversial, recent FDA approval of Aducanumab for treatment of early AD was based on improvement on amyloid beta PET, a surrogate endpoint with unknown clinical validity.35 This points to the importance of clinical validity studies being conducted in parallel with studies to develop biomarkers.

CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) may predict PSP disease severity and could be explored as a monitoring biomarker in PSP trials.36 A few tau PET tracers, such as [18F]-PI-2620 and [18F] APN-1607 have shown increased 4R-tau binding and ongoing studies evaluate their usefulness as a diagnostic biomarker. In the future, these could be evaluated as a surrogate endpoint.37 More studies are needed for development of PSP- and CBD-specific tau tracers.

Trial Designs

Several clinical trials evaluating disease-modifying therapeutics in PSP patients were well designed, powered, conducted, and interpreted. However, almost all trials used the traditional parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled design protocol, had high number of dropouts, and did not include diverse populations. Considering the low prevalence of primary tauopathies, basket design protocol was used to study the effect of a single treatment in multiple tauopathies.38 Studies in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis have shifted towards a more advanced master protocol design using the platform trial in which several drugs are randomized and used simultaneously in one disease with a common placebo control.39 This design allows decreasing the number of patients randomized into the study, the patients in the placebo arm, the cost of trials, and the time needed to conduct the studies. Platform design allows personalized approaches by identifying and recruiting patients based on their specific disease mechanisms. Currently available biomarkers, such as specific genetic variants as the H1 haplotype and high risk alleles found on genome-wide association studies, neuroinflammation PET biomarkers,40 and mitochondrial risk alleles,41 could be used to stratify participants based on their specific biomarker status in a platform master protocol.42 More studies are required in order to develop new predictive biomarkers for better stratification of participants based on the mechanism of action of drug candidates. Allowing home-based virtual evaluations31 and the use of wearable sensors to measure treatment effects will decrease attrition rates and increase participation rates in the current and future therapeutic clinical trials.

In conclusion, while there are multiple challenges in current clinical trial designs that need to be addressed, numerous possible solutions can improve the therapeutic success of future trials for patients with primary tauopathies such as PSP and CBD.
