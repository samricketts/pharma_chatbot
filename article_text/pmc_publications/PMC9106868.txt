Currently, of the few accessible symptomatic therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), memantine is the only N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blocker approved by the FDA. This work further explores a series of memantine analogs featuring a benzohomoadamantane scaffold. Most of the newly synthesized compounds block NMDARs in the micromolar range, but with lower potency than previously reported hit IIc, results that were supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Subsequently, electrophysiological studies with the more potent compounds allowed classification of IIc, a low micromolar, uncompetitive, voltage-dependent, NMDAR blocker, as a memantine-like compound. The excellent in vitro DMPK properties of IIc made it a promising candidate for in vivo studies in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. Administration of IIc or memantine improved locomotion and rescues chemotaxis behavior in C. elegans. Furthermore, both compounds enhanced working memory in 5XFAD mice and modified NMDAR and CREB signaling, which may prevent synaptic dysfunction and modulate neurodegenerative progression.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major and rising public health concern due to not only its increasing global prevalence, but also the lack of effective treatment options.1–3 To date, only four drugs have approval for treating AD. Unfortunately, these drugs only improve cognitive and behavioral symptoms without modifying the course of the disease. Despite intensive efforts to develop new AD pharmacotherapeutics,4 progress has been slow and difficult. For example, a new drug, aducanumab,5 has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, its approval is mired in controversy due to risk of severe side effects and conflicting reports of efficacy.6–9

The first drugs developed for AD, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), aim to revert the cholinergic deficit responsible for the cognitive impairment of patients.10 In addition to currently available AChEIs (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine), multiple AChEIs have been developed over the last few years. However, few novel AChEIs have reached clinical trials and none have arrived at the market.11–16

Another drug approved by the FDA is memantine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) uncompetitive antagonist.17–18 Memantine acts as an open channel blocker that is thought to prevent NMDAR overactivation and glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity in the pathogenesis of AD.19–20 It has better therapeutic tolerability and favorable safety relative to other NMDAR channel blockers because of its ability to preferentially block extrasynaptic NMDARs, which have been associated with activation of cell death pathways.21 Memantine is characterized by faster blocking/unblocking kinetics, strong voltage dependency, and moderate affinity for NMDAR.22 Due to its excellent drug profile, numerous companies and academic groups have developed new analogs of memantine. Although only neramexane has reached clinical trials,23 much effort is still ongoing for developing new NMDAR open channel blockers with pharmacological profiles similar to memantine for use as potential therapies for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.24–34 In addition, other NMDAR open channel blockers are also currently being developed for the treatment of tinnitus and as a new class of drugs with fast-onset antidepressant effects.35–41

Recently, our research group has synthesized new memantine analogs based on a novel benzopolycyclic ring (Figure 1). First, compounds with the general structure I were synthesized, but they were found to be less potent than memantine (e.g., Ia and Ib).42–43 Interestingly, the replacement of the oxygen atom at the C8 position of Ia (IC50 = 98 ± 26 μM) by a methylene unit led to the seven-fold more potent amine IIa (IC50 = 13.6 ± 3.4 μM). Thereafter, further variations at the C9 position in the general structure II generated compounds with promising potency, in the low-moderate micromolar range. Indeed, three of these derivatives displayed potencies very similar to (IIc and IIg) or even stronger than (IIb) memantine (Figure 1).44

In our endeavor to find novel analogs of memantine, herein we report further structure-activity relationships (SAR) on the benzohomoadamantane scaffold, i.e., derivatives of general structure III, in order to select a proper candidate for additional in vitro pharmacokinetic studies, and subsequently perform an in vivo study in a 5XFAD murine model of AD.

2. Results and discussion

2.1. Design and synthesis of new NMDAR channel blockers

First, to explore alternative substituents at the C9 position, we synthesized 2 (Scheme 1). It is known that H/D bioisosteric replacement may lead to compounds with the same activity and selectivity.45–47 Furthermore, considering that the C9 position is susceptible to being metabolized, the presence of deuterium may be a good strategy to avoid rapid metabolization and prolong the pharmacokinetic stability of the compound.48 The approach followed for the synthesis of 2 was similar to that previously applied to the preparation of IIb.44 Thus, the reaction of known alcohol 144 with thionyl bromide followed by radical dehalogenation of the unstable bromo intermediate, generated the amine 2 in moderate overall yield (Scheme 1). We have previously reported that the NMDAR antagonist activities of amantadine and its ring-contracted analogs are of the same order of magnitude.49 Consequently, we also designed the ring-contracted analog 6, by removing a methylene group from IIb and bonding positions C7 and C9 (Scheme 1). The synthesis of amine 6 involved four steps: a) reaction of known alcohol 350 with mesyl chloride; b) reaction of the corresponding mesylate with NaI in the presence of H3PO3 to furnish iodide 4; c) radical photochemical carboxylation of 4 to carboxylic acid 5; and, d) Curtius rearrangement of 5 to generate primary amine 6.

We have previously synthesized and described several derivatives of I and II, but, so far, we have not explored the impact of introducing substituents on the aromatic ring of the benzohomoadamantane scaffold. Although IIb (IC50 = 0.70 ± 0.12 μM), IIc (IC50 = 1.93 ± 0.21 μM) and 2 (IC50 = 1.2 ± 0.1 μM) are more potent NMDAR antagonists than IIa (IC50 = 13.6 ± 3.40 μM, see below), we first decided to screen the NMDAR blocking activity of benzene-substituted derivatives based on IIa, because this amine shows an excellent compromise between acceptable potency as NMDAR channel blocker and better synthetic availability. Therefore, we prepared a series of ten derivatives of general structure III (R1 = Me, X = CH2) which are analogs of IIa, by introducing a variety of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating group on the aromatic ring. The key introduction of the substituents in the aromatic ring was accomplished using two alternative procedures (Schemes 2–4).

In the first approach, electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions on known chloroacetamide 743 or acetamide 1651 were carried out for the synthesis of 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 20. Thus, from the known chloroacetamide 7, following a classical approach that involved aromatic nitration and cleavage of the chloroacetyl group, amine 9 was obtained. Catalytic hydrogenation of 9 furnished aniline 10. Additionally, Friedel-Craft acylation of 7, followed by deprotection afforded amine 12 in good yield. A Friedel-Craft reaction of the known 1343 led to amine 14 and a reductive alkylation of 9 provided amine 15 (Scheme 2).

A first attempt to obtain amine 20, through catalytic hydrogenation of 8 followed by a classical Sandmeyer reaction and removal of the chloroacetamide group, met with failure. Thus, 20 was prepared from the known acetamide 1651 through a four-step process that involved aromatic nitration, catalytic hydrogenation, Sandmeyer reaction, and hydrolysis (Scheme 3).

A different synthetic strategy was undertaken for the synthesis of the aromatic substituted compounds 37–40, which involved the construction of the benzohomoadamantane scaffold starting from a suitably mono- or disubstituted o-phthaldialdehyde (Scheme 4). Thus, once the substituted o-phthaldialdehydes 21,52 22,53 23,54 and 2455 were obtained via procedures previously reported, a synthetic route that included a Weiss-Cook condensation,56 hydrolysis, decarboxylation, and dehydration led to the corresponding diketones 25–28. Subsequently, the treatment of these ketones under Wittig olefination and Ritter-type transannular cyclization conditions furnished the chloroacetamides 33–36 that after deprotection provided the desired amines 37–40.

In order to determine the effects of different aromatic substituents on NMDAR block, the potency of the new benzo-substituted amines 9–10, 12, 14–15, 20 and 37–40 was tested (see below) and compared with that of the unsubstituted IIa (Table 1). Briefly, the introduction of substituents in the aromatic ring resulted in a decrease in the potency as NMDAR blockers for the majority of compounds regardless of the position, size or electronic character of the substituent (9, IC50 = 164 μM; 10, IC50 = not active; 12, IC50 = 323 μM; 14, IC50 = 566 μM; 15, IC50 = 309 μM; 20, IC50 = 34.7 μM; 37, IC50 = 30.9 μM; 38, IC50 = 517 μM; 39, IC50 = 13.2 μM; 40, IC50 = 77.4 μM) (see below and Table 1). An exception to this trend is amine 39, with a fluorine atom at the C1 position, the potency of which (IC50 = 13.2 μM) was similar to that of IIa (IC50 = 13.6 μM). Thus, once this screening was completed with derivatives of IIa, and considering the electrophysiological studies carried out with IIb, IIc and 2 (see below), amine 44 was envisaged as a promising compound. 44 contains two fluorine atoms at C1 and C9 and was synthesized starting from the diketone 27, through a four-step sequence that involved a selective mono-Wittig olefination, followed by a Ritter-type transannular cyclization, substitution of the hydroxyl group by a fluorine atom and final removal of the chloroacetamide group (Scheme 5).

The new amines, 2, 6, 9–10, 12, 14–15, 20, 37–40, and 44, were fully characterized as hydrochlorides through their spectroscopic data and elemental analyses or HPLC/UV (see Experimental Section and supporting information for further details).

2.2. NMDAR blockers activities and SAR

To evaluate whether the synthesized compounds were able to block NMDARs, we measured their effect on increases in intracellular calcium evoked by 100 μM NMDA (in the presence of 10 μM of glycine) on rat cultured cerebellar granule neurons using a previously reported Fura 2 assay (Table 1).57

As expected, the substitution of the hydrogen atom at C9 in IIb by a deuterium atom did not affect the biological potency of 2 (IC50 = 0.70 ± 0.12 μM for IIb vs IC50 = 1.16 ± 0.07 μM for 2). However, the ring contraction from IIb to 6 resulted in a dramatic drop in potency (IC50 = 0.70 ± 0.12 μM for IIb vs IC50 = 111 ± 18.8 μM for 6).

Regarding the aromatic substitution, it can be concluded that the functionalization of the aromatic ring is highly deleterious for the compound’s NMDAR channel blocking potency (Table 1), regardless of the electron donor or acceptor character of the substituent (compare IIa vs 9, 10, 12, 20, 37–40). However, size and substitution position exerted a certain influence on potency. Small size substituents such as chlorine (20) and fluorine (37) at C2 were less deleterious for potency than bigger substituents such as a nitro (9) or an acetyl (12) group. More importantly, the introduction of a fluorine atom at C1, as in 39 (IC50 = 13.2 ± 1.07 μM) does not alter the IC50 value in respect to the unsubstituted IIa (IC50 = 13.6 ± 3.4 μM), unlike 37 (IC50 = 30.9 ± 4.70 μM) which possesses the fluorine atom at C2. Overall, within this series of new amines featuring a methyl group at C9, 39, with its fluorine atom at C1, emerged as the most interesting derivative. Due to the effect of the C1 fluorine atom and our finding that the replacement of IIa’s methyl group at C9 with a fluorine atom, as in IIc, resulted in a remarkable increase of potency, we synthesized amine 44. Unexpectedly, 44 (IC50 = 29.0 ± 11.9 μM) was a less potent NMDAR channel blocker than IIc (IC50 = 1.93 ± 0.21 μM).

Finally, within this new series of benzohomoadamantane derivatives, tertiary amines were clearly less potent than the corresponding primary amines (9 vs 15 and 12 vs 14), in contrast to the trend observed in reference compounds IIa and IIb.

Overall, with the sole exception of the deuterated amine 2 (IC50 = 1.16 ± 0.07 μM), all the amines herein reported were less potent as NMDAR channel blockers than the previously described amines IIb (IC50 = 0.70 ± 0.12 μM) and IIc (IC50 = 1.93 ± 0.21 μM). Particularly striking is the marked decrease in potency when going from IIb to its ring-contracted analog 6 (IC50 = 111 ± 18.8 μM).

2.3. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations

Electrophysiological studies (see discussion below in electrophysiology section) confirmed NMDAR channel blocking ability for compounds investigated in this study. However, to better understand molecular mechanisms of how these channel blockers occlude ion permeation and to rationalize the differential binding affinities of these benzohomoadamantane derivatives caused by ring contraction, the exchange of substituent at the C9 position, or introduction of different groups on the aromatic ring, we used molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. We have developed a computational structural model of the NMDAR (GluN1/2A) transmembrane domain with a closed gate. We selected four compounds, IIa, IIb, IIc and 6, to generate initial docking-based protein-ligand complex structures for NMDAR-IIa, NMDAR-IIb, NMDAR-IIc and NMDAR-6. The complexes then were embedded in a POPC lipid bilayer and solvated in water and 0.15 M NaCl solution. 200 ns molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for each of the structures to allow for equilibration of the ligand in the channel in native-like conditions. From these simulations we obtained atomic level insights on binding modes and their stabilities to analyze how their structural and dynamic features correlate with the reported difference in the binding affinities of these compounds.

During MD simulations, all compounds showed stable binding in a “flipped down” conformation (Figure 2) with the NH3+ groups facing the intracellular side of the membrane. In this flipped down conformation the NH3+ groups formed H-bond interactions with the asparagine (ASN) clusters at the tips of the M2 helices of GluN1 (N616) and GluN2A (N614) subunits. The hydrophobic aromatic core of the compounds stabilized between the protein channel sub-pockets created by the hydrophobic side chains of L642 and A643 of GluN2A, and V644, A645 and M641 of GluN1 inside the channel (Figures 2A–C). Similar flipped down binding modes were reported for memantine and MK-801 in the GluN1/2B NMDAR channel.58

For all compounds that stabilized in flipped down conformations, we observed mobility of the blocker’s hydrophobic core in the plane of its phenyl ring. This mobility allowed for different binding pose occupancies within the sub-pockets created between M3 helices of GluN1 and GluN2A (Figure 3). Similar flexible orientations were reported in MD simulations of MK-801 in the GluN1/2B NMDAR channel.58 Orientationally different poses are indeed stable in flipped down binding conformations (Figure S1) and could easily block ion conduction by physical occlusion of the permeation pathway.

Comparing MD simulation results provided further insights into binding differences among IIa, IIb and IIc. For example, very close contact of the methyl at C9 in IIa (Figure 2A) with the side chain hydroxyl groups of the threonines (T648 – GluN1 and T647 – GluN2A) inside the channel cavity may cause an energetic penalty on binding, which could explain the reduced binding affinity of IIa in comparison to IIb (Figure 2B). In contrast, due to the smaller size of the fluorine at this position in IIc, there is no steric clash with threonine side chains, which may explain the more similar potencies of IIb and IIc (Figure 2C). These observations also suggest that any substitution larger than hydrogen or fluorine will result in a steric clash with the hydrophobic wall and would require a wider channel opening to accommodate such a compound. Furthermore, the simulations showed that heavy atoms of the protein side chains are within 4Å of the phenyl ring (Figure 2). This suggests that any substitution on the aromatic ring will negatively affect binding since it will clash with the hydrophobic wall. Indeed, consistent with simulations, only unsubstituted derivatives of the phenyl ring (IIa-g and 2) and their fluorinated analogs (37, 39 and 44) showed acceptable potency (Figure 1 and Table 1).

Finally, MD simulations performed with 6 showed a flipped down binding mode similar to IIa, IIb and IIc where the NH3+ of 6 maintains H-bonding interaction to ASN cluster through the majority of the MD simulation time (Figure 2D). However, we observed a slight instability of the flipped down conformation. This could be explained by the presence of water molecules in the channel cavity between the hydrophobic core of compound 6 and the hydrophobic residues of the channel, which is likely due to the smaller size of the ring-contracted 6 (Figure 2D). Considering that hydrophobic residues in the NMDAR channel cavity play an important role in the binding of channel blockers,59 the loss of the interaction between 6 and hydrophobic channel residues provides an explanation for the reduction of the potency of this amine.

2.4. Functional block of NMDAR by benzohomoadamantane derivatives IIb, IIc, and 2 compared with memantine

We next selected compounds with similar potency to memantine (IIb, IIc and 2) and measured functional block of NMDAR. To measure the properties of the newly synthesized amines, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from tsA201 cells transfected with expression plasmids codifying for rat GluN1 and GluN2A subunits.28,60

Figure 4A shows representative current traces obtained using a protocol that allowed us to quickly screen NMDAR inhibition by the compounds of interest at two membrane potentials. While clamping the cell at −60 mV, NMDAR currents were elicited with 100 μM NMDA plus 10 μM glycine. After NMDA-mediated currents had reached a steady state, a blocking compound (either memantine, IIb, IIc or 2) was applied for 40 seconds in the presence of agonist. During blocker application, the membrane voltage was jumped to +60 mV for 5 seconds and returned to −60 mV. Blocker then was removed to allow blocker unbinding and recovery of the current from inhibition, during which another 5 second jump to +60 mV was performed before returning to −60 mV and subsequent removal of agonists.

Although memantine, IIb, and 2 show a similar degree of NMDAR inhibition, inhibition by IIc was noticeably weaker (69.1 ± 1.2 % for IIc vs. 86.2 ± 1.4 % for memantine p &lt; 0.0001; one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test; Figure 4B). While no differences were observed in percentage of block for 2 in comparison to memantine (89.3 ± 3.1 %; p &gt; 0.05), IIb appeared to block slightly more efficiently than memantine (94.1 ± 1.4 %; p &lt; 0.05). Regarding blocking kinetics (measured as the time needed to reach approximately 2/3 of the maximal block; τweighted (weighted time constant) in seconds; see experimental section), all compounds tested presented values similar to memantine (around 1 second), although development of block by IIc was faintly slower (Figure 4C).

Inhibition by all known NMDAR channel blockers depends on membrane voltage, with potency increasing as membrane voltage is hyperpolarized. We assessed the voltage dependence of the compounds tested by applying two positive voltage steps to +60 mV in the presence of the blocker or after blocker washout (Equation 1). We observed that IIc showed strong voltage dependent block similar to that of memantine (Figure 4D). IIb and 2 showed weaker apparent voltage dependence of block: % block at +60 mV was 26.9 ± 4.7 % for IIb and 20.6 ± 5.9 % for 2 compared to −3.9 ± 2.5 % for memantine (p &lt; 0.001 for both compounds vs. memantine). It is likely that these results reveal that IIb and 2 exhibit both weaker voltage dependence, and slower unblocking kinetics (Figure 4F), than memantine or IIc.

Importantly, a potential memantine-like compound should have similar unbinding kinetics. Therefore, we calculated the percentage of current recovery 40 seconds after removal of the blocker for the selected compounds and we compared it with that of memantine (93.6 ± 3.3% recovery of current). Note that, because of the interposed depolarization, current recovery will depend on the drugs’ unblocking kinetics both at −60 and at +60 mV. IIb showed less current recovery than memantine (69.0 ± 3.6 % recovery; p &lt; 0.0001 vs. memantine), whereas current recovery for IIc and 2 was similar to memantine (Figure 4E). The lower current recovery after 40 seconds observed for IIb suggested that its unbinding kinetics are slower than memantine’s, a conclusion supported by the observed unblocking kinetics (quantified as τweighted; see experimental section; τweighted = 18.1 ± 4.2 s for IIb vs. 6.4 ± 1.4 s for memantine; p &gt; 0.001; Figure 4F).

Since our main aim was to select the best memantine analog for an in vivo study, IIb and 2 were discarded as candidates due to their relatively weak voltage dependence, despite their high potency. Although IIc did not block to the same degree as memantine, it showed a similar electrophysiological profile and IC50 value, making it a suitable candidate for additional in vitro experiments and a subsequent in vivo study.

2.5. Characteristics of NMDAR inhibition by IIc

We next further quantified the potency and voltage dependence of NMDAR inhibition by IIc using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from tsA201 cells expressing GluN1/2A receptors. Inhibition by IIc was measured as a function of drug concentration (Figure 5A) and used to calculate the IIc IC50 in cells held at −65 mV. The IC50 of IIc was found to be 4.40 ± 0.15 μM. (Figures 5B, C), well within the range of therapeutically beneficial NMDAR antagonists (e.g. ketamine IC50 ~ 1 μM; memantine IC50 ~ 1 – 2 μM; amantadine IC50 ~ 40 – 75 μM).28,61–68 This IC50 value slightly differs from the IIc IC50 measured using intracellular Ca2+ measurements from cerebellar granule neurons (1.93 ± 0.21 μM; Table 1), consistent with previous similar comparisons of NMDAR channel blocker IC50s.28 The discrepancy may result from differences in recording technique and/or from expression of GluN2 subunits other than GluN2A by cerebellar granule neurons.69–71

NMDAR channel blockers share overlapping binding sites in the NMDAR channel.72–75 Thus, many organic NMDAR channel blockers (e.g. amantadine, memantine, and ketamine) show competitive binding with the endogenous blocker Mg2+.68,74,76–78 To ascertain whether IIc inhibits NMDARs via channel block, we tested the effect of extracellular Mg2+ on IIc potency. As predicted, the inclusion of 0.2 mM Mg2+ in the recording solution led to a substantial rightward shift in the IIc IC50 curve and a significant increase in IIc IC50 (IC50 = 4.40 ± 0.15 μM in 0 Mg 2+ vs 21.41 ± 0.56 μM in 0.2 mM Mg2+; p &lt; 0.0001, two-sample Student t-test, n = 10 and 6, respectively; Figures 5B, C). This roughly 5-fold decrease in IIc potency suggests a competitive interaction between Mg2+ and IIc in the NMDAR channel. We next determined the voltage dependence of inhibition by 10 μM (~2-fold IC50 at −65 mV) IIc. As predicted of a positively charged channel blocker, inhibition by IIc was markedly weaker at depolarized potentials (Figures 5D–F). Equations 3 and 4 were used to quantify V0, the change in voltage (in mV) that results in an e-fold change in the IC50 of a drug, and δ, an estimate of the fraction of the total transmembrane voltage field felt by the blocker at its binding site.79 Inhibition of GluN1/2A receptors by IIc is strongly voltage-dependent, as reflected by the drug’s small V0 (25.43 ± 0.54 mV) and large δ (1.01 ± 0.02). The IIc V0 and δ values are similar to previously reported values for monovalent organic channel blockers (e.g. V0 ~ 26 – 30 mV, δ ~ 0.8 – 1.0 for memantine, ketamine, and recently synthesized polycyclic amines).28,63,68,80–81 The profound dependence of IIc inhibition on [Mg2+] and on membrane potential strongly supports the conclusion that IIc inhibits NMDARs by binding in and blocking the NMDAR channel.

2.6. In vitro DMPK profile, hERG safety and cytotoxicity of IIc

This compound was characterized in terms of microsomal stability (human and mouse species), hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) inhibition, cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition, Caco-2 and predicted brain permeability (PAMPA-BBB assay), to confirm its suitability as a candidate for in vivo studies in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and in the 5XFAD mouse model. Results from these measurements are given in Table 2.

IIc showed high metabolic stability in human and mice liver microsomes, which are widely used to determine the likely degree of primary metabolic clearance in the liver. Next, cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition was evaluated through a fluorescence-detection method using human recombinant cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Pleasantly, the compound did not significantly inhibit the evaluated cytochromes. hERG channel is an ion channel which is commonly used as an important toxicology screen because of its known association with cardiotoxicity. Interestingly, IIc, at 10 μM, did not significantly inhibit hERG. The Caco-2 cell permeability model was used to evaluate the permeability of the compound. Apparent permeability values (Papp) were determined from the amount permeated through the Caco-2 cell membranes in both apical-basolateral (A-B) and basolateral-apical (B-A) directions. Satisfactorily, IIc showed good permeability. Any AD drug should cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), so we used the PAMPA-BBB assay to predict the ability of IIc to permeate BBB. IIc had a positive predicted BBB permeability. Next, the cytotoxicity of IIc was tested using the MTT assay in Neuro2a cells. Interestingly, the selected compounds did not show cytotoxic at the highest concentration tested (100 μM) (see section 4.7. for further details).

Overall, IIc has low micromolar activity, an excellent electrophysiological profile as a NMDA receptor blocker, favorable DMPK properties, and non-cytotoxicity. Thus, IIc was deemed a suitable candidate for the in vivo studies.82

2.7. In vivo efficacy studies

To evaluate the effectivity of IIc to ameliorate cognitive impairment through the modulation of NMDAR-mediated neurodegenerative pathways, we performed a series of in vivo studies in C. elegans and in the 5XFAD mouse model.

It has been reported that memory in C. elegans is mediated by NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors.83 This nematode expresses two NMDA-type subunits, NMR-1 and NMR-2, homologous to mammalian GluN1 and GluN2A subunits, respectively.84 Thus, C. elegans has been described as a suitable model for the study of NMDAR-mediated neurotoxicity.85–86 The 5XFAD mouse model, which displays altered NMDAR function,87 is one of the most used AD mouse models to evaluate pharmacological interventions.88

Considering that IIc has proven to be a memantine analog in terms of potency and electrophysiological behavior, we incorporated memantine as a standard to analyze if these analogies persist in the in vivo efficacy studies. Of note, just a single study has been published on the effects of memantine in C. elegans, using the transgenic strain CL2006,84 and only two studies have been published describing effects of memantine on 5XFAD mice.89–90

2.7.1. Concentration-response effect of memantine and IIc on paralysis induced by Aβ expression in CL2006

The analysis of locomotor deficits has been traditionally used to discriminate between N2 wild-type (WT) and CL2006 mutant C. elegans. Herein, the N2 WT strain was used as a positive control and CL2006 worms, which constitutively expresses human Aβ1–42, served as an AD model.91 As expected, CL2006 worms presented paralysis (measured as defective locomotion) compared to N2 WT, which exhibited a significantly lower percentage of defective locomotion (Figure 6A). After treatments, we found that memantine and IIc reduced defective locomotion over a range of concentrations (0.1 to 10 μM) in CL2006 nematodes (Figure 6A–B). These initial results in nematodes showed the capability of IIc, as well as memantine, to rescue the motor deficits in an AD model.

2.7.2. Treatment with NMDAR channel blockers rescues chemotaxis behavior of CL2355 nematodes disrupted by Aβ expression

The impressive chemotaxis behavior of C. elegans is well known as a suitable model to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of new compounds. To evaluate the effect of NMDAR antagonists on the chemotaxis behavior of C. elegans, the transgenic strain CL2355, which shows Aβ aggregates as well as deficits in chemotaxis, and CL2122, a positive control strain, were used.91 Therefore, we performed a chemotaxis assay as previously described.92 As expected, CL2355 showed disrupted chemotaxis behavior and a reduced chemotaxis index (CI) in comparison to CL2122. Interestingly, both memantine and IIc treatments significantly reversed the disrupted chemotaxis behavior, suggesting that IIc might protect against Aβ toxicity-related neuronal dysfunction in a fashion similar to memantine (Figure 6C).

2.7.3. NMDA channel blockers memantine and IIc rescue working memory impairment in 5XFAD

To determine the effects of the administration of memantine and IIc on AD-like symptoms, 5XFAD mice, a model of familial AD, were treated with either memantine or IIc at 5 mg / day for 4 weeks. A novel object recognition test (NORT) was used to evaluate short- and long-term working memories in 5XFAD mice. As described previously,88,93 6-month-old 5XFAD mice presented robust cognitive deficits compared to WT (Figure 7). We found that memantine treatment resulted in the recovery of cognitive function by increasing the discrimination index (DI) in both short-term (Figure 7A) and long-term (Figure 7B) memory tests. Importantly, IIc also enhanced working memory function in 5XFAD mice, with treated mice showing a significant DI increase at both tests (Figure 7).

2.7.4. NMDAR molecular alterations in 5XFAD mouse model after IIc treatment

NMDARs are heterotetramers composed of two GluN1 subunits and typically two GluN2 subunits, of which there are four subtypes (GluN2A-D). In the adult forebrain, GluN2A and GluN2B are the two predominant subtypes. GluN2A subunits, incorporated into synaptic NMDARs, mediate long-term synaptic plasticity and their activation is associated with neuroprotective pathways. Therefore, selective activation of NMDARs containing GluN2A subunits would have a beneficial effect on AD pathology.94–95

Western-blot analysis showed that 5XFAD mice exhibit less GluN2A protein levels than control mice, and interestingly, IIc treatment was able to rescue GluN2A to control levels (Figures 8A–B).

Extrasynaptic NMDARs are enriched in GluN2B subunits and are believed to promote neuronal death, as occurring in neurodegenerative diseases. The activation of NDMARs containing the GluN2B subunit may be increased by Aβ, contributing to neurodegenerative and apoptotic pathways.96 Memantine preferentially blocks extrasynaptic NMDARs over those located at the synaptic cleft, contributing to the clinical tolerability of this drug.21,97–98

Additionally, GluN2B-subunit-containing NMDARs may induce synaptic NMDAR internalization after dephosphorylation, disrupting normal synaptic function.99 Furthermore, phosphorylated Fyn kinase (p-Fyn) is responsible for phosphorylation of GluN2B at tyrosine 1472, which prevents GluN2B endocytosis and maintains NMDARs at the synaptic surface, preventing neuronal death.100 To evaluate GluN2B subunit and Fyn kinase phosphorylation in control mice and the effects of memantine and IIc on 5XFAD mice, the p-GluN2B(Tyr1472) / GluN2B and p-Fyn / Fyn ratios (Figures 8A, 8C–D) were determined. Of note, we found that treatment of 5XFAD mice with memantine or IIc increased Fyn phosphorylated levels and correspondingly elevated GluN2B phosphorylation at Tyr1472. These findings support the literature relating GluN2B -subunit phosphorylation at Tyr1472 and the prevention of NMDAR internalization, which may prevent synaptic dysfunction.101–102

2.7.5. IIc treatment modifies CREB pathways leading to synaptic improvements

Fyn activity is related to proteins implicated in cell-survival, such as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB).103 Therefore, we evaluated p-CREB protein levels in cytosol and nuclei. p-CREB levels were found to be dysregulated in 5XFAD compared to WT. p-CREB protein in the nucleus was reduced in 5XFAD mice compared to the WT group, whereas treatment with memantine or IIc significantly increased p-CREB protein levels in the nucleus compared to untreated 5XFAD mice. The enhanced p-CREB translocation to the nucleus of the treated groups (Figure 9A, 9B) indicated a beneficial effect of NMDAR antagonists by modulating signaling pathways involved in cell survival.

To further evaluate the effect of memantine and IIc on AD-related proteins, the calciumdependent protein calbindin was evaluated. Calbindin D-28K is a Ca2+ binding protein and an important regulator of Ca2+ homeostasis found to be dysregulated in AD animal models.104 Remarkably, we found a significant, unprecedented dysregulation of calbindin protein levels in 5XFAD mice (Figure 9A, 9C), suggesting the important role of calbindin in the Aβ pathology presented by this transgenic mouse model. We also demonstrated that treatment with memantine or IIc reverts calbindin D-28K protein levels to WT levels (Figure 9A, 9C). It is noteworthy that p-CREB is a transcription factor that increases the expression of several proteins implicated in neuroprotection and neuronal signaling.105 Interestingly, we found that treatment with memantine or IIc rescues expression of postsynaptic density protein (PSD) 95 in 5XFAD mice (Figure 9D). Together, these data may explain the improvement in working memory observed in 5XFAD after treatment with NMDAR channel blockers.

Overall, we provide promising evidence that IIc treatment rescues Fyn-GluN2B-CREB signaling and PSD95 expression in 5XFAD mice. Our results suggest a mechanism by which IIc may improve cell survival and synaptic function in AD through increasing the activity of cell-survival signaling pathways and preventing internalization of synaptic NMDARs. Thus, IIc could be a feasible candidate for further testing as a new clinically therapeutic NMDAR channel blocker.

3. Conclusions

Despite scientific efforts to develop new clinically useful NMDAR blockers, memantine remains the only noncholinergic drug approved for symptomatic AD treatment. Therefore, we further explored the benzohomoadamantane scaffold with the main aim to develop new memantine analogs. Although most of the changes in the chemical structure of benzohomoadamantane negatively impact potency at NMDARs, 2, IIa and IIc showed low micromolar potencies. Furthermore, these results were rationalized and strongly supported by MD simulations. Subsequently, of the most active derivatives, IIc was found to possess electrophysiological characteristics similar to memantine, including similar potencies, voltage dependencies, and blocking sites. Additionally, our DMPK studies (microsomal stability, cytochrome and hERG inhibition, Caco-2 and PAMPA assays) revealed that IIc was a good candidate for in vivo studies. The administration of IIc to both C. elegans and the 5XFAD mouse model of AD reverted the condition of the animals to that of controls, both at the behavioral and the biochemical levels. The effect observed was comparable with that produced by memantine, demonstrating that IIc could be a feasible and promising candidate for a new clinically therapeutic NMDAR blocker.

Thiourea (56 mg, 0.74 mmol) and glacial acetic acid (0.46 mL) were added to a solution of 43 (240 mg, 0.74 mmol) in absolute ethanol (14 mL) and the mixture was heated at reflux overnight. The resulting suspension was then tempered to rt and concentrated under vacuum. Crude was partitioned in H2O (30 mL) and DCM (30 mL) and the phases were separated. Then the pH of the aq phase was adjusted to 12 with 5 N NaOH solution and extracted with further DCM (3 × 40 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anh Na2SO4, then filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The hydrochloride of 44 was obtained by adding an excess of HCl / Et2O to a solution of the amine in ethyl acetate, followed by filtration of the resulting white precipitate (167 mg, 79% yield).

4.2. Intracellular calcium-based determination of IC50 of NMDAR channel blockers

A functional assay of antagonist activity at NMDA receptors was performed using primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons that were prepared according to established protocols.49 Cells were grown on 10 mm poly-L-lysine coated round glass cover slips and used for the experiments after 6–9 days in vitro. Cells were loaded with 6 μM Fura-2 AM (ThermoFisher) for 30 min. After loading, a coverslip was mounted on a quartz cuvette containing a Mg2+-free Locke-HEPES buffer using a specialized holder. Measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer LS-55 fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a fast filter accessory, under mild agitation and at 37 °C. Analysis from each sample was recorded real-time over 1600 s. After stimulation with NMDA (100 μM, in the presence of 10 μM glycine), increasing concentrations of the compound to be tested were added after signal stabilization. The percentage of inhibition at every tested concentration was analyzed using non-linear regression curve fitting (variable slope) using the software Prism 5.04 (GraphPad Software Inc.).

4.3. Molecular docking and MD simulations

To understand structural aspects of ligand binding using molecular docking and MD simulations, we used an MD-refined computational structural model of the NMDAR (GluN1/2A) transmembrane domain with the channel gate closed. Simulations of receptor-bound IIa, IIb, IIc and 6 were initiated with the compounds in their protonated forms docked into the channel oriented in a “flipped down” conformation such that their amines were interacting with the asparagine (ASN) cluster on the tip of M2 helices. Docking was performed in AutoDock Vina,106 which predicts interactions between small molecules and proteins. Protein and ligand coordinate files were converted to pdbqt format using AutoDock Tools, where non-polar hydrogen atoms were merged to the bonded heavy atoms. The active site of the protein was designated as a box with size of 26 × 26 × 40 at 1Å grid spacing. Docked receptor-ligand complexes of NMDAR-IIa, NMDAR-IIb, NMDAR-IIc and NMDAR-6 were built and assembled with POPC membrane using CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder.107–108 All systems were solvated with TIP3P water and neutralized by adding Na+ and Cl− ions to the bulk solution until the salt concentration was 0.15M, leading to a total system size of approximately 169,070 atoms and box size of 127 × 127 × 101 Å. All initial membrane-protein-ligand complex model systems for MD equilibration simulations were built with tleap program in AMBERTOOLS18.109 FF14SB force field parameters were used for the protein;110 Amber Lipid14 FF for POPC lipid111 and general AMBER force field112 (GAFF) was used for all four ligands. To confirm convergence in binding stability of ligands, we used two replicates for each of NMDAR-IIa, NMDAR-IIb, NMDAR-IIc and NMDAR-6 systems.

All 8 initial membrane-protein-ligand complex model systems were energy minimized for 500 cycles of each steepest-descent and conjugate gradient algorithm while keeping restraints on the protein Cα atoms. Water and ions were equilibrated at constant volume as the temperature was gradually increased from 0 to 300K with restraints of 40 kcal/mol/Å on all protein and lipid heavy atoms. This was followed by equilibration for 20 ns at 1 atm and 300 K with a time step of 2 fs using the pmemd.cuda program of the AMBER18 molecular dynamics package.109 The restraints on the protein residues were gradually reduced from 20 to 0.5 kcal/mol/Å. For each system, MD production runs without any restraints using AMBER18 were performed for 200 ns. The NPT equilibration and production MD simulations were performed with an integration time step of 2 fs while pressure and temperature of the simulated system were maintained at 1 bar and 300 K respectively. We used Langevin thermostat with damping coefficient of 1 ps−1 and a semi-isotropic pressure scaling algorithm as implemented in AMBER18, with pressure relaxation time of 5 ps. During whole simulations, hydrogen bonds were constrained via the SHAKE algorithm.113 Periodic boundary conditions and all atom wrapping were employed in all simulations as implemented in AMBER18. Long range electrostatics were calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald method114 where Non-bonded Lennard-Jones and Coulombic interactions were truncated at 8Å. Results were viewed and analyzed with VMD115 and CPPTRAJ tools.116

4.4. Cell culture, transfection, recording, and analysis for electrophysiology experiments

Electrophysiological characterization of memantine-like compounds for Figure 4 was carried out using tsA201 cells transiently transfected with plasmids codifying for NMDAR subunits. tsA201 (Sigma catalog #85120602) is a cell line derived from HEK293 cells stably expressing the temperature sensitive gene for SV40 T-antigen to allow plasmid replication using the SV40 origin and thus enabling high levels of recombinant proteins. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% streptomycin/penicillin as described.60 Prior to transfection, cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/coverslip in glass coverslips previously coated with poly D-lysine (0.1 mg/ml). 24 hours after plating, cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg total cDNAs using PEI transfection reagent (1 mg/ml) in a 3:1 ratio (PEI:DNA). Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the rat GluN1 subunit, rat GluN2A subunit and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) for identification of transfected cells. cDNA ratios of 0.5 eGFP: 1 GluN1: 1 GluN2A were used. Culture medium was supplemented with the competitive NMDAR antagonist D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (dl-APV, Sigma, 200 μM) at the time of transfection to prevent NMDAR-mediated cell death.

Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained on tsA201 cells 18–30 hours after transfection. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillary tubing (OD = 1.5 mm, ID = 0.86 mm; Harvard Apparatus) using a P-97 electrode puller (Sutter Instruments) and subsequently fire-polished to a resistance of 2 – 5 MΩ using a MF-830 forge (Narishige). Intracellular pipette solution contained contained (in mM): 140 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 4 Na2ATP and 0.1 Na3GTP with pH adjusted to 7.25 with CsOH. Extracellular recording solution contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES and 10 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.42 with NaOH.

Whole-cell currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices). Current signal was low-pass filtered at 1 kHz, and sampled at 2 kHz in pClamp10 (Molecular Devices). Solutions containing agonists (100 μM NMDA and 10 μM glycine) or blockers (10 μM) were applied by piezoelectric translation (P-601.30; Physik Instrumente) of a theta-barrel application tool made from borosilicate glass (1.5 mm o.d.; Sutter Instruments). All recordings were performed at rt.

The percentage of channel block, unblock, and recovery were measured with the following protocol: At a holding of −60 mV, NMDA (100 μM) and glycine (10 μM) were applied until current reached a clear steady-state. Then, IIb, IIc or 2 were rapidly applied by piezo control (1 ms solution exchange) for 30 seconds as described.28 During the application of the blocker, a 5 s jump to +60mV was performed to study the voltage dependence of channel block.

Blockers were then removed in the presence of the agonists to allow recovery of the current. During this period (around 1 min) a second jump (5 s duration) to +60mV was performed. Finally, agonists were removed. Percentage of block was calculated by dividing steady state current in the presence of the blocker by steady state current in the absence of the blocker. Percentage of unblock was calculated by dividing the steady state current after blocker removal by the steady state current before blocker application. Finally, the voltage dependence (% of block at +60mV) was calculated by using Equation 1: %ofblock=100(1−I+60(Drug)I+60(Agonist))

where I+60(Drug) is the current after 5 second at the holding voltage of +60mV in the presence of the blocker and I+60(Agonist) is the current after 5 seconds at +60mV in the absence of the blocker. The kinetics of blocking and unblocking of NMDAR responses were fitted according to a double-exponential function to calculate the weighted time constant (τweighted): τweighted=τf(AfAf+AS)+τS(ASAf+AS)

where Af and τf are the amplitude and time constant of the fast component of recovery and As and τs are the amplitude and time constant of the slow component.

For Figure 5, cells were maintained as previously described.117 Briefly, tsA201 cells (European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures) were cultured and plated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 18–24 hours after plating, the cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Promega) with cDNA coding for enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), WT rat GluN1-1a (GluN1; GenBank X63255), and GluN2A (GenBank M91561 in pcDNA1). GluN1-1a and eGFP were expressed using a plasmid containing cDNA encoding eGFP inserted between the promoter and the GluN1 open reading frame.118 dl-APV was added to the medium at the time of transfection to prevent NMDAR-mediated cell death.

For Figure 5, all whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed at rt 18–30 hours after transfection. Pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate capillary tubing (OD = 1.5 mm, ID = 0.86 mm) using a Flaming Brown P-97 electrode puller (Sutter Instruments) and fire-polished to a resistance of 3.0 – 4.0 MΩ. The intracellular pipette solution contained (in mM): 130 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 10 BAPTA, and 4 MgATP; adjusted to pH 7.2 ± 0.05 with CsOH. Pipette solution osmolality was 275 ± 10 mOsm. Extracellular recording solutions contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.01 EDTA, and 0.1 glycine; adjusted to pH 7.2 ± 0.05 with NaOH and to osmolality 290 ± 10 mOsm with sucrose. Concentrated stocks of glutamate, MgCl2, and/or IIc were diluted in extracellular solution on the day of experiments (glutamate stock = 1 M; MgCl2 stock = 1 M; IIc stock = 10 mM in 140 mM NaCl and 2% DMSO, maximum [DMSO] = 0.075%). Extracellular solutions were applied to the patched cell via an in-house built fast perfusion system.117 Whole-cell currents were recorded and digitized using an Axopatch 200A patch-clamp amplifier and Digidata 1440A digitizer (Molecular Devices). The current signal was low-pass filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz using pClamp 10.7 (Molecular Devices). Series resistance was compensated 85 – 90% in all experiments. An empirically determined −6 mV liquid junction potential between the internal and external solutions was corrected in all experiments.

Concentration-inhibition relations were measured using the protocol shown in Figure 5A. Glutamate (1 mM) was applied until current reached steady-state, then sequentially increasing concentrations of IIc were applied for 10 s in the presence of glutamate. Glutamate alone was reapplied for 80 s following IIc application to allow recovery from inhibition. Cells in which current did not recover to 90% of steady-state current during the initial glutamate application were excluded from analysis to prevent underestimation of potency. We estimated IC50 by fitting Equation 2 to concentration-inhibition data: IIIcIGlu=11+([IIc]IC50)nH

where IIIc is mean current steady state current during application of IIc, IGlu is the average of the mean steady state currents before and after application of IIc and nH is the Hill coefficient. IC50 and nH were free parameters during fitting. IIIc and IGlu were measured as the mean current over the final 1 s of each application. Baseline current was subtracted from all current measurements. For Mg2+ competition experiments, IIc IC50s were measured in the constant presence of extracellular 0.2 mM Mg2+.

We measured the voltage dependence of block by IIc using the protocol shown in Figure 5D. Inhibition by IIc was measured in each cell at nine voltages ranging from −105 to +55 mV. During each voltage step, the cell was exposed to: 5 s in extracellular solution following the voltage step; a 10 s application of 1 mM glutamate; a 15 s application of IIc with 1 mM glutamate; a second application of 1 mM glutamate for 15 s to allow drug unbinding; application of extracellular solution for 2 s to allow a return to baseline current. Voltage was then returned to −65 mV for 3 s before the next voltage jump was made. Voltage dependence of block was quantified using Equation 3: IIIcIGlu=11+[IIc](IC50−65mV)eVm+65 V0

where IC50−65mV is the IC50 at −65 mV (calculated from concentration-inhibition experiments), Vm represents the holding potential, and V0 represents the change in voltage (in mV) that results in an e-fold change in the IC50 of the drug. IIIc and IGlu were measured as in analysis of concentration-inhibition data. V0 was the only free parameter during fitting. The fraction of the total membrane voltage field felt by the blocker at its binding site (δ)119 was estimated using Equation 4: δ=RTV0ZF

where R is the ideal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, z represents the valence of the blocker, and F is the Faraday constant. Note that while δ is useful for comparing voltage dependence of blockers, permeant ions influence the voltage dependence of NMDAR channel block.120 Therefore, δ only provides a rough estimate of the location of a channel blocker’s binding site in the voltage field.

4.5. In vitro DMPK

4.5.1 Microsomal stability

The human, rat, and mouse pooled microsomes employed were purchased from Tebu-Xenotech. The compound was incubated at 37 °C with the microsomes in a 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4) containing 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NADP, 10 mM glucose-6-phosphate and 1 U/mL glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase. Samples (75 μL) were taken from each well at 0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 min and transferred to 4 °C in a plate containing 75 μL acetonitrile and 30 μL of 0.5% formic acid in water, which were added to improve the chromatographic conditions. The plate was centrifuged (46000 g, 30 min) and supernatants were taken and analyzed in a UPLC-MS/MS (Xevo-TQD, Waters) using a BEH C18 column and an isocratic gradient of 0.1% formic acid in water: 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile (60:40). The metabolic stability of the compounds was calculated from the logarithm of the remaining compounds at each time point studied.

4.5.2 Permeability

The Caco-2 cells were cultured to confluency, trypsinized and seeded onto a 96-filter transwell insert (Corning) at a density of ~10,000 cells/well in DMEM cell culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Confluent Caco-2 cells were subcultured at passages 58–62 and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Following an overnight attachment period (24 hours after seeding), the cell medium was replaced with fresh medium in both the apical and basolateral compartments every other day. The cell monolayers were used for transport studies 21 days post seeding. The monolayer integrity was checked by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), obtaining values ≥ 500 Ω/cm2. On the day of the study, after the TEER measurement, the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with pre-warmed (37 °C) Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) buffer to remove traces of medium. Stock solutions were made in DMSO, and further diluted in HBSS (final DMSO concentration 1%). Each compound and reference compounds (Colchicine, E3S) were tested at a final concentration of 10 μM. For A → B directional transport, the donor working solution was added to the apical (A) compartment and the transport media as receiver working solution was added to the basolateral (B) compartment. For B → A directional transport, the donor working was added to the basolateral (B) compartment and transport media as receiver working solution was added to the apical (A) compartment. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 hours with gentle stirring.

At the end of the incubation, samples were taken from both donor and receiver compartments and transferred into 384-well plates and analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS. Detection was performed using an ACQUITY UPLC /Xevo TQD system. After the assay, Lucifer yellow (LY) was used to further validate the cell monolayer integrity, cells were incubated with LY 10 μM in HBSS for 1 hour at 37 °C, obtaining permeability (Papp) values for LY of ≤ 10 nm/s confirming the well-established Caco-2 monolayer.

4.5.3 Cytochrome P450 inhibition assay

The objective of this study was to screen the inhibition potential of the compound using recombinant human cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 (BFC) and CYP3A4 (DBF)) and probe substrates with fluorescent detection. Incubations were conducted in a 200 μL volume in 96-well microtiter plates (COSTAR 3915). The addition of the mixture buffer-cofactor (KH2PO4 buffer, 1.3 mM NADP, 3.3 mM MgCl2, 3.3 mM glucose-6-phosphate and 0.4 U/mL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), control supersomes, standard inhibitors (furafyline, tranylzypromine, ketoconazole, sulfaphenazole and quinidine; Sigma Aldrich), and previously diluted compound to plates was carried out by a liquid handling station (Zephyr Caliper). The plate was then preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of prewarmed enzyme/substrate (E/S) mix. The E/S mix contained buffer (KH2PO4), c-DNA-expressed cytochrome P450 enzymes in insect cell microsomes, substrate (3-cyano-7-ethoxycoumarin, for CYP1A2 and CYP2C19; 7-methoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin for CYP2C9; 3-[2-(N,N-diethyl-N-methylammonium)ethyl]-7-methoxy-4-methylcoumarin for CYP2D6; and 7-benzyloxytrifluoromethyl coumarin (7-BFC) and dibenzylfluorescein (DBF) for CYP3A4) in a reaction volume of 200 μL. Reactions were terminated after various times (a specific time for each cytochrome) by addition of STOP solution (ACN/TrisHCl 0.5 M 80:20 or 2 N NaOH). Fluorescence per well was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Tecan Infinity M1000 pro) and percentage of inhibition was calculated.

4.5.4 hERG inhibition assay

The assay was carried out on a CHO cell line transfected with the hERG potassium channel. 72 hours before the assay, 2500 cells were seeded on a 384 well black plate (Greiner 781091). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 hours and at 30 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 48h plus. hERG activity was measured by using the FluxorTM Potassium Ion Chanel Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher F10016). Medium was replaced for 20 μl Loading Buffer and the cells were incubated for 60 minutes at RT, protected from direct light. After incubation, Loading Buffer was replaced with Assay buffer and the compounds were incubated for 30 minutes at RT. 5 μl of Stimulus Buffer was added to each well and the fluorescence was read (λex = 490 nm, λem = 525nm) using imaging plate reader system (FDSS7000EX, Hamamatsu®) every second after the establishment of a baseline line. Astemizole (IC50 = 152 nM) was used to validate the assay.

4.5.5 Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeation Assays-Blood-Brain Barrier (PAMPA-BBB)

To evaluate the brain penetration of the compounds, a parallel artificial membrane permeation assay for blood-brain barrier was used, following the method described by Di et al.121 The in vitro permeability (Pe) of fourteen commercial drugs through lipid extract of porcine brain membrane together with the test compounds were determined. Commercial drugs and assayed compounds were tested using a mixture of PBS:EtOH (70:30). The assay was validated by comparing experimental and reported Pe values of a set of fourteen commercial drugs (Table S2), and the following correlation was obtained: Pe (exp) = 1.6662 Pe (lit) – 1.4174 (R2 = 0.9334). On the basis of this equation and the limits established for BBB permeation,119 the threshold for high BBB permeation (CNS+) was set at Pe (10−6 cm s−1) &gt; 5.247; low BBB permeation (CNS−) was set at Pe (10−6 cm s−1) &lt; 1.915; and the range for uncertain BBB permeation (CNS±) at 5.247 &gt; Pe (10−6 cm s−1) &gt; 1.915. Three different experiments, each performed in triplicate, were carried out for each compound.

4.6.1 Worm strains, maintenance, and general methods

Strains used are listed in Table S3. Standard methods were used for culturing and examination C. elegans.92 Wild-type strains were cultured at 20 °C, while transgenic strains were cultured at 16 °C in a temperature-controlled incubator on solid nematode growth medium (NGM) seeded with Escherichia coli (E. coli) OP50 strain as a food source. To collect age synchronized populations of eggs, adults were treated with alkaline hypochlorite solution (0.5 M NaOH, ~2.6% NaCl) for 5–7 min. Fertilized eggs were re-suspended in S-medium for 12 hours, and L1 larvae were incubated to hatch overnight in the absence of food.

4.6.2 Compound Preparation and Treatment

The compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO. Each concentration was then dissolved in MilliQ purified water to achieve a final concentration between 100 mg/L and 16 mg/L in 1% DMSO in well. For the locomotion assay, treatments were carried out in liquid culture for 4 days at 20 °C. Each well contained a final volume of 60 μL, consisting of 25–30 animals in the L1 stage, compounds under study at the appropriate doses, and OP50 inactivated by freeze-thaw cycles and incubated in S-medium complete to a final optical density of 595 (OD595) of 0.9–0.8 measured in the microplate reader. For the chemotaxis assay synchronized CL2355 and CL2122 strains were treated with DMSO or compounds on NGM plates seeded with inactivated E. coli (OP50). They were cultured at 16 °C for 36 hours, and then at 23 °C for 36 hours.

4.6.3 Locomotion assay

A locomotion assay of NMDA receptor channel blockers was run to obtain a dose-response profile and evaluate their effects on motor function of the CL2006 transgenic strain. The animals were synchronized by alkaline hypochlorite treatment, and the OP50 bacteria OD595 was adjusted to 0.9 to perform the assay. WT strain (N2), and the transgenic strain (CL2006) were treated in liquid media for 4 days at 20 °C with continuous shaking at 180 rpm, starting at the L1 stage. On day 5 of age, the nematodes were moved from the 96-well plates to an unseeded NGM plate for 45 minutes before starting the trial, allowing the plate to dry. Locomotion assays were conducted in 30 mm NGM plates, where the entire plate was covered by OP50. 5 to 10 adult nematodes were positioned in the center of a circle (1 cm diameter) in seeded 30 mm NGM plates. After 1 minute, the number of animals remaining inside the circle were considered locomotor defective. A locomotor defective score (LD) was calculated by dividing the number of worms inside the circle by the total number of worms on the plate. Motor behavior assays were run with a total of at least 200 animals tested per compound concentration. The motor index score ranges from 0% (animals that exhibit the same motor defect as untreated CL2006 animals) to 100% (animals that exhibit motor behavior comparable to WT animals). All results included in the figures are calculated using the following formula: Motorindex(%)=LDCL2006vehicle−LDCL2006drugLDCL2006vehicle−LDWvehicle×100

4.6.4 Chemotaxis assay

Nematodes were sampled after the treatments with memantine and IIc and washed with M9 buffer (3 g/L KH2PO4, 6 g/L Na2HPO4, 5 g/L NaCl, 1 mL/L 1 mM MgSO4, 800 mL/L ddH2O). In brief, the assay was performed in 100 mm NGM plates. 10 μL of odorant (0.025% benzaldehyde in 96% ethanol) was added to the “attractant” spot, and on the oppose side of the NGM, 10 μL of control odorant (96% ethanol) was added. Then, 70–80 worms were positioned in the center of the plate. Assay plates were incubated at 23 °C for 1 hour and were scored according to the chemotaxis index (CI) as follows: CI = (number of worms at attractant-number of worms at control)/(number of worms at attractant spot + number of worms at control spot). Two trials were performed in triplicate. In each experiment, at least 250 worms from each group were analyzed.

4.6.5 5XFAD mice

The 5XFAD strain is a well-established and suitable transgenic AD mouse model expressing five familial mutations of human AD. 5XFAD mice also exhibit early-onset cognitive impairment and Aβ pathology.88 Six months old female Wild Type (WT) and 5XFAD mice (n = 43) were randomly divided into four groups: WT (n = 14), 5XFAD Control (Control) (n = 8), 5XFAD treated with memantine (Mem) (n = 11) and 5XFAD treated with IIc (IIc) (n = 10). Animals had free access to food and water under standard temperature conditions (22 ± 2 °C) and were maintained on 12 hour : 12 hour light-dark cycles (300 lux/0 lux). Water consumption was controlled each week; drug concentrations were adjusted accordingly to reach the appropriate dose for each cage. Memantine and IIc were dissolved in 1.8% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and administered at 5 mg/kg/day through drinking water for four weeks and up to euthanasia. Studies were approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee (CEEA) at the University of Barcelona. All efforts were made to reduce the number of animals used and their suffering.

4.6.6 Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT)

NORT is a cognitive test used to assess short- and long-term recognition memories. The apparatus used consisted of a 90 °, two-arm, 25-cm-long, 20-cm-high, and a 5-cm-wide black maze of black polyvinyl chloride. The objects to be discriminated were made of plastic and chosen not to frighten mice and without any part likely to be bitten. The test was performed over 5 days. On the first three days, animals were individually habituated to the apparatus for 10 min each day. On the fourth day, the animals were individually exposed during 10 min to the apparatus and were allowed to freely explore the zone inside the apparatus (First trial / Familiarization) where we had placed two identical novel objects (A+A’ or B+B’) at the end of each arm. After 10 min, the animals were removed and returned to their home cage, and 2 hours later the retention trial (second trial) was performed. In this second trial, objects A’ and B’ were swapped (A+B’ or A’+B) and the mice were allowed to explore the maze for 10 min. Twenty-four hours after the first trial, animals were exposed again to the apparatus, and in this case, objects A’ and B’ were substituted by two new objects with different shapes and colours (A+C or B+C’), and animals were allowed to explore them for 10 min. The time exploring the novel object (TN) and the old object (TO) were measured and recorded using a camera. Exploration of an object was defined as pointing the nose towards the object at a distance ≤ 2 cm and/or touching it with the nose. Turning or sitting around the object was not considered exploration. To avoid object preference biases objects A and B were counterbalanced so that one-half of the animals in each experimental group were first exposed to object A and then to object B, whereas the other half first saw object B and then object A. Finally, to quantify cognitive performance, the Discrimination Index (DI) was calculated, which is defined as (TN−TO) / (TN+TO).

4.6.7 Brain Tissue Preparation

Mice groups were euthanized by cervical dislocation and brains were immediately removed from the skull. For molecular experiments, the hippocampus was isolated and frozen in powdered dry ice. Hippocampi were maintained at −80 °C for further use for protein extraction, RNA and DNA isolation. For thioflavin-S staining, mice were anesthetized (ketamine 100 mg / kg and xylazine 10 mg / kg, intraperitoneally) and then perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution intracardially. Brains were removed and postfixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C. Afterwards, brains were changed to PFA + 15% sucrose. Finally, the brains were frozen on powdered dry ice and stored at −80°C until sectioning. Brain coronal sections of 30 μm were obtained (Leica Microsystems CM 3050S cryostat, Wetzlar, Germany) and kept in a cryoprotectant solution at −20 °C until use.

4.6.8 Protein Level Determination by Western Blotting

For Western Blotting (WB), aliquots of 15 μg of hippocampal protein extraction per sample were used. In brief, tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Cocktail II, Sigma-Aldrich). Total protein levels were obtained, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Protein samples were separated by Sodium dodecyl sulphate-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (8–20%) and transferred onto Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). Afterwards, membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) solution containing 0.1% Tween 20 TBS (TBS-T) for 1 hour at rt, followed by overnight incubation at a 4 °C with the primary antibodies listed in Table S4. Then, membranes were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at RT. Immunoreactive proteins were viewed with the chemiluminescence-based detection kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol (ECL Kit, Millipore), and digital images were acquired using ChemiDoc XRS+ System (BioRad). Semi-quantitative analyses were done using ImageLab software (BioRad), and results were expressed in Arbitrary Units (AU), considering control protein levels as 100%. Protein loading was routinely monitored by immunodetection of Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).

4.6.9 Data Acquisition and Statistical Analysis

Data analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism ver. 6 statistical software. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of at least 3 samples per group. Statistical analysis was performed by way of two-tail Student’s t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey post-hoc analysis. Statistical significance was defined as p-value &lt; 0.05. Statistical outliers were determined with Grubbs’ test and, when necessary, were removed from the analysis. The cognitive analysis was performed blindly: an experimenter unaware of the treatment groups performed the tests and recorded the number of animals. Another experimenter analyzed the videos and the behavioral scoring.

4.7. Cytotoxicity

The cytotoxicity of IIc was measured in Neuro2A cells. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 40.000 cells/well and grown under conventional conditions (0,2 mL per well in RPMI medium 10%FBS and supplemented with pyruvate and antibiotics). The day after, cells were exposed during 24h to 1, 10 or 100 μM EV-19. Afterwards, cell viability was assessed using the MTT method. Briefly, 20 μL of a solution of 5mg/ml of 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide in PBS was added in each well and after 1h in the cell incubator the supernatant was discarded and cells lysed with 200 μL DMSO. After shaking, absorbance was measured at 595 nm in a Biotek PowerWave HT plate reader. Assays were performed in triplicate and no difference was found between controls and drug-treated cells at any concentration.

[82] Oral administration of IIc (5 mg/kg) to mice led to its fast absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching a maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 1.12 ± 0.76 μM after 45 min. Interestingly, a much higher concentration of UB-ALT-EV was found in brain as compared to plasma, indicating a fast and very high BBB penetration. A Cmax of 17.10 ± 6.06 μM was determined in brain which was reached after about 1 h (Tmax = 56 min). Thus, the Cmax in brain was 15-fold higher than that in plasma. A brain/plasma ratio of 32 was observed after 1 h at Cmax (brain).
