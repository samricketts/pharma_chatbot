Background:

More than 50% of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) remain undiagnosed. This is specifically the case for home healthcare (HHC) patients.

Objectives:

This study aimed at developing HomeADScreen, an ADRD risk screening model built on the combination of HHC patients’ structured data and information extracted from HHC clinical notes.

Methods:

The study’s sample included 15,973 HHC patients with no diagnosis of ADRD and 8,901 patients diagnosed with ADRD across four follow-up time windows. First, we applied two natural language processing methods, Word2Vec and topic modeling methods, to extract ADRD risk factors from clinical notes. Next, we built the risk identification model on the combination of the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS-structured data collected in the HHC setting) and clinical notes-risk factors across the four-time windows.

Results:

The top-performing machine learning algorithm attained an Area under the Curve = 0.76 for a four-year risk prediction time window. After optimizing the cut-off value for screening patients with ADRD (cut-off-value = 0.31), we achieved sensitivity = 0.75 and an F1-score = 0.63. For the first-year time window, adding clinical note-derived risk factors to OASIS data improved the overall performance of the risk identification model by 60%. We observed a similar trend of increasing the model’s overall performance across other time windows. Variables associated with increased risk of ADRD were “hearing impairment” and “impaired patient ability in the use of telephone.” On the other hand, being “non-Hispanic White” and the “absence of impairment with prior daily functioning” were associated with a lower risk of ADRD.

Conclusion:

HomeADScreen has a strong potential to be translated into clinical practice and assist HHC clinicians in assessing patients’ cognitive function and referring them for further neurological assessment.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) affects about 5 million people in the United States, approximately 11% of the older adult population.1 Despite national efforts for timely diagnosis of patients with ADRD, more than 50% of ADRD patients remain undiagnosed and unaware of their cognitive decline.2

The lack of timely ADRD diagnosis often happens because of patients’ limited knowledge about early symptoms of cognitive decline,3 clinicians’ insufficient time to assess patients for ADRD,4 and the limited availability of biomarkers (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid and magnetic resonance imaging).5 Given the projection of 13.2 million ADRD patients by 2050,6 and the associated cost of more than $1.1 trillion, the development of a robust screening tool for early identification of older adult patients with ADRD has been recognized as a critical research priority by many healthcare organizations, including the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation,7 and US Congress.8

Home healthcare (HHC) is a unique setting where nurses interact with patients in their homes, potentially allowing them to identify symptoms of cognitive impairment and provide tailored interventions. However, HHC nurses are often not familiar with complex neurological assessment tests and are limited by the time constraints of their HHC visits. As a result, HHC patients at risk for ADRD might be missed and not referred for further, more thorough neurological examination for ADRD diagnosis.

In settings other than HHC, previous studies have developed ADRD risk models using administrative claims,9 patients’ structured data in electronic health record systems,10,11 and health surveys.12 For example, one study used administrative claims and electronic health record data from hospitals and primary care settings to predict the onset of dementia, achieving a sensitivity of 47%.9 Our previous research in HHC showed that clinicians tend to document a significant portion of ADRD risk factors (e.g., neuro-psychiatric symptoms of ADRD) in clinical notes that might not be captured in administrative and structured assessment data.13 Incorporating risk factors extracted from clinical notes can potentially improve ADRD risk prediction.14,15 None of the previous studies have used data from HHC settings, including information from clinical notes, for proactive prediction of ADRD risk.

We propose to address barriers to early identification of ADRD in HHC by developing a risk identification model called HomeADScreen. The goal of HomeADScreen is to assist HHC nurses in evaluating patients’ cognitive function and referring them for further comprehensive neurological assessment. Specifically, we aimed to: 1) examine the most informative variables for identifying patients at risk for ADRD, and 2) build an ADRD risk identification model using a combination of structured data and information extracted from clinical notes.

METHODS

This retrospective cohort study with secondary data analysis was conducted at the largest not-for-profit home health agency in the United States, VNS Health. This study was approved by the participating organization’s Institutional Review Board (reference # 1585549-7).

Study dataset and variables

The cohort consists of 56,652 HHC patients served by VNS Health, a large non-profit HHC provider in the U.S. The data include the federally mandated Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) clinical assessment administered at the start of an HHC episode, linked with Medicare claims data for a 6-month look-back period and four years of follow-up.

HHC episode refers to a 30–60 day period of time during which HHC services are provided to a patient. Patients were included in the sample if they were admitted to HHC during the period of July 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012 with any diagnosis and had complete Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) data for the look-back and follow-up periods. Complete FFS data was defined has having all months of interest enrolled in Medicare FFS, with no interruptions due to Medicare Advantage enrollment. If a patient had more than one admission between 7/1/2010 and 12/31/2012, the first admission was selected as the index admission upon which the 4-year follow-up period was anchored. Claims data spanned the calendar years of 2010–2016, allowing for uniform timeframes.

Figure 1 shows the diagram for computing the analysis sample of the study.

For each patient in the sample, we collected data from OASIS and clinical notes from VNS Health’s electronic health records system. OASIS includes ~100 structured variables designed for HHC patient evaluation, administered on admission and upon completion of an HHC episode. Clinical notes include a narrative assessment of patients’ clinical status by HHC nurses. We had two types of clinical notes: n=788,564 visit notes (describing the patient’s conditions and provided care) and n= 973,470 care coordination notes (describing communication between clinicians and other administrative activities related to the patient’s care) for the sample of the study.

Study outcome

The study’s outcome was the presence or absence of ADRD diagnosis in a 4-year follow-up period from HHC admission. This outcome was derived from the Medicare claims data using the pre-defined Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW) flag16 for ADRD combined with the indicator of the date of the first occurrence of ADRD diagnosis (see Appendix A). The dataset was constructed for a prior study examining longitudinal care trajectories for home care patients with different ADRD diagnostic statuses. The four-year follow-up period was selected to account for the long disease trajectory of ADRD, using the maximum length of follow-up available within the existing dataset.

Analysis of clinical notes using natural language processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is a set of techniques that offer methodological approaches for automatically collecting clinical concepts from narrative notes and creating structured information for further computing processes, such as building risk identification models. We used two NLP methods to identify potential risk factors. First, we used a semi-supervised Word2Vec method (further referred to as Word2Vec) to extract specific pre-defined HHC ADRD risk factors. In addition, we used unsupervised topic modeling to identify topics emerging from the clinical notes. Further sections provide additional information about each of the NLP methods.

Natural language processing (NLP) method #1: Extracting ADRD risk factors using semi-supervised Word2Vec NLP.

This NLP method is a semi-supervised approach in which vocabularies of terms are first created and then applied to large bodies of text to extract specific concepts. We used this method to extract risk factors associated with risk for ADRD in HHC. Specifically, we created the following NLP pipeline consisting of four components. Component 1: we created an initial list of risk factors using ADRD-related literature and a discussion with the study team’s subject matter experts, a neurologist specializing in dementia care and a HHC nurse with experience caring for patients with ADRD. Overall, we identified seven categories (cognitive, behavioral, psychological, physiological, functional, caregiver stress, and interventions) and 28 specific risk factors (see Appendix B for details). Component 2: we expanded the initial list of risk factors by identifying their synonyms using the Unified Medical Language System- a compendium of a wide range of standardized health terminologies. For example, for the risk factor “memory loss,” we found synonyms such as “forgetful,” “cannot recall,” and “memory deficits.” Component 3: we used a Word2Vec model to further expand the vocabulary of synonyms. Word2Vec is an NLP technique for inferring vector representation of words from a large body of text- clinical notes in this study. The vector representations can be queried to identify synonyms for a pre-defined list of risk factors. We used NimbleMiner,17 an open-source, publicly available NLP software that efficiently implements Word2Vec for synonym detection. NimbleMiner has an interactive, user-friendly interface that allows the study team to identify appropriate synonyms. Component 4: The NLP algorithm was applied to entire clinical notes to evaluate the accuracy in identifying risk factors. For each category of ADRD-related concepts, 30 clinical notes in which the algorithms identified subcategories were extracted to determine whether the algorithms correctly identified the information regarding subcategories. Finally, we used NimbleMiner to search for ADRD risk factors in all clinical notes available for the study sample.

Natural language processing (NLP) method #2: Extracting risk factors using topic modeling method.

Topic modeling is an unsupervised NLP technique built on statistical methods for discovering hidden patterns of word distribution (hidden semantic structure) in a large corpus of text data, such as clinical notes. The identified patterns are usually presented as words indicating a topic. The number of identified topics varies depending on the size of the textual data. This study used the topic keyword model (TKM) technique18 to automatically identify topics in the clinical notes corpus. We created this corpus by combining all clinical notes available for each patient. See Appendix C for more information about topic modeling and the TKM technique.

Feature selection method for identifying the most informative variables associated with the risk of ADRD

To identify the most informative variables associated with the risk of ADRD, we applied the recursive feature elimination method to the combination of the OASIS dataset with semi-supervised Word2Vec NLP risk factors and topics from topic modeling, resulting in 150 variables. Combining all variable sets enables recursive feature elimination to compute the correlation among all variables and to reduce the redundancy among selected variables. F1-score (the harmonic mean of sensitivity and precision) has been used as a criterion to eliminate variables, i.e., a variable was eliminated if its removal did not result in the reduction of the global F1-score.

The most informative variables selected using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method for predicting risk of ADRD were presented in Table 2 (and Appendix F). RFE does this by recursively removing features and building a model with the remaining ones, then evaluating the model performance. The feature eliminated in each round is the one which, when removed, leads to an increase (or even the smallest decrease) in model performance. The process is repeated until a desired number of features is reached. Using this approach, RFE considers both the individual and joint contributions of features to the model’s performance when selecting important features. Overall, the most informative variables according to RFE are those whose presence most positively impacts the performance of the predictive model.

After this selection process, we applied Logistic Regression to those RFE -selected variables to compute the odds ratio and the associated 95% confidence interval. We used logistic regression method as it’s an explainable method and provides interpretable coefficients for each variable in the context of all other variables.

Machine learning algorithms used to develop the risk identification model HomeADScreen

Next, we applied several machine learning models to develop the risk identification model HomeADScreen. We used different discriminative machine learning algorithms, including: 1) Logistic Regression (LR) as the baseline algorithm, 2) ensemble decision trees, specifically: Random Forest, Extra Trees, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and 3) support vector machine (SVM) as a parametric machine learning algorithm with the ability to use linear and non-linear kernels. See more information about these machine learning algorithms in Appendix D.

Evaluating the performance of risk identification models

Standard performance metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy of machine learning models, including Area Under Curve-Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC), sensitivity (recall), positive predictive value (Precision), and F1-score. We used stratified ten-fold cross-validation to provide a better picture of the generalizability of the risk identification algorithm on unseen data. Since the sample size for newly-diagnosed and never-diagnosed patients is imbalanced, we computed the best cut-of-values on the AUC-ROC curve using the F1-score method because it computes the optimized cut-off-value using the harmonic mean of sensitivity and precision, two important metrics for evaluating the usability of a screening algorithm in clinical settings (see Appendix F for more information).

Statistical analysis

All data analyses were performed using Sklearn, Scikitplot of Python Programming language. For all study variables, we computed means (standard deviations) for continuous variables and counts (percentages) for binary/categorical variables.

RESULTS

Patient Characteristics

The analysis sample includes 24,874 patients who were either: (i) without an ADRD diagnosis and alive at the end of the 4-year follow-up period (64%); or (ii) diagnosed with ADRD during the follow-up time (36%). Selected patient characteristics indicated in the OASIS assessment upon HHC admission are shown in Table 1. Findings on the full set of characteristics examined are shown in Appendix E.

“The study’s sample consisted of a diverse group of home healthcare patients, with the largest demographic being Non-Hispanic White (16,515 individuals), followed by Black or African American (3,814), Hispanic (2,827), and Asian/Pacific Islander (1,232). The distribution between control and ADRD case groups was balanced across races and ethnicities: Non-Hispanic Whites (63.1% controls, 36.9% ADRD cases), Black or African American (65.5% controls, 34.5% ADRD cases), Hispanic (67.0% controls, 33.0% ADRD cases), Asian/Pacific Islanders (66.3% controls, 33.7% ADRD cases), and the ‘Other’ group (69.8% controls, 30.2% ADRD cases).”

Upon HHC admission, patients who would be diagnosed with ADRD tended to be older (mean age of 82 vs. 73 years old) and were more likely to be non-Hispanic White (68% vs. 65%). They were also more likely to have documentation of prior impaired decision (5.4% vs. 2.6%), memory loss (3.5% vs. 0.8%) and urinary incontinence (18.6% vs. 9.7%). They were also identified as being at risk for hospitalization during the SOC assessment due to recent mental decline (12.9% vs. 7.5%), frailty, or having a (30.2% vs. 22.8%) history of falls (20.8% vs. 11.3%). All items were statistically significant at the p-value level &lt;0.001, except for sex, where the p-value = 0.048.

Variables highly associated with the risk of ADRD

Table 2 presents the 18 most informative variables selected by the recursive feature elimination method for a four-year ADRD diagnostic time window. Most informative variables for the first, second, and third-year ADRD diagnostic time windows were presented in Appendix F.

For the four-year time-window, fourteen were from the OASIS dataset, three were from the topic modeling methods, and one was from the Word2Vec method among selected variables. Among the OASIS variables, several items were significantly associated with ADRD diagnosis. Patients with documentation of “pain interventions” (odds ratio [OR] = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.40–0.46) and “high frequency of pain Interfering activity/movement” (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.83–0.87) had significantly lower odds of ADRD. Non-Hispanic White patients had 20% lower odds for ADRD than patients of other races/ethnicities. HHC patients with limitation prior functioning IADL/ADL” also had lower odds for ADRD (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.78– 0.88 ). A significant increase in odds for ADRD among HHC patients was noted for patients with the presence of symptoms of impaired cognitive functioning (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.14–1.30), presence of urinary incontinence or urinary catheter (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.29–1.46), history of falls (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.33–1.57), impaired prior ability in the management of oral medications (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.34–1.57), impaired patient’s ability in the use of the telephone (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.35–1.69), and hearing impairment (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.61–1.85).

Among Word2Vec NLP risk factors we identified in clinical notes, memory loss was associated with risk for ADRD with OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.58–1.89. For variables identified using topic models, the type of medication with OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.25–1.39 was associated with a higher risk for ADRD. In comparison, two other topics indicated lower risk, namely caregiver support (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93–0.98) and diabetes management (OR=0.91, 95% CI: 0.88–0.94).

Certain variables like “Management of oral medication”, “Fall risk assessment,” and “Caregiver provides assistance with supervision and safety”, as listed in table 2, exhibit odds ratios close to or crossing 1 within their confidence intervals. This indicates that individually, these variables might not have a significant association with the outcome. Despite this, their inclusion in the model can still improve its predictive accuracy, as they might interact with other variables in a way that enhances prediction. It’s not uncommon in risk prediction models to include variables that may not have significant odds ratios but provide additional information that aids in risk stratification when combined with other variables.

Risk identification performance of the machine learning models

Table 3 describes the performance of machine learning models measured at the default cut-off value of 0.5 for each iteration, with OASIS as a baseline and additional variables added from Word2Vec and topic-modeling NLP across four follow-up time windows. For the first-year time window, adding variables extracted with NLP (F1-score = 0.16) to structured OASIS data (F1-score = 0.1) improved the overall performance of the risk identification model by 60%. We found similar trends of increasing the overall performance of the model when NLP-extracted variables were added to structured OASIS data for the second year (~27% improvement in F1-score), third year (~12% improvement in F1-score), and fourth year (~4% improvement in F1-score). Similar to the first year, for the other time windows, the GBM algorithm had the best performance for OASIS data, and the LR algorithm had the best performance for the combination of OASIS and NLP-extracted variables. We observed that the performance of machine learning algorithms improved markedly as the time window increased; the F1-score increased from 0.16 for the first-year time-window to 0.53 for four-year time-window, a more than three-fold improvement.

Figure 2 visualizes the trends in sensitivity, precision, and F1-score changes across four years for models built on only OASIS data and a combination of OASIS and NLP-extracted variables at default cut-off value = 0.5. Overall, the added value of NLP decreased over time; during the first year time-window, NLP improved model performance by 60% (from F1-score 0.1 to 0.16), while in year four, only minor performance gains were achieved (4%, from F1-score 0.51 to 0.53).

Table 4 includes the optimized cut-off value for the best-performing machine learning algorithm (Logistic Regression) based on OASIS data and NLP-extracted variables across the four follow-up time windows. Overall, we developed a well-performing risk identification model with an F1-score = 0.62 at year four. Across all model performance metrics, there was a significant increase in performance over time. Specifically, when comparing the first-year time window to the fourth-year time window, sensitivity improved by 30%, precision improved by 80%, and the F1-score improved by 59%. Appendix G includes information on the optimized cut-off value using G-means and Youden’s J statistic and the performance of machine learning algorithms on the cut-off values.

DISCUSSION

This study is the first to use HHC data to develop a risk identification model called HomeADScreen for the proactive screening of HHC patients at risk for ADRD. We utilized NLP and machine learning algorithms to analyze HHC patients’ data, including the OASIS dataset and clinical notes, to develop HomeADScreen. Our final optimized risk prediction models achieved increasingly better performance over time, with a four-year risk model achieving an AUC of 0.76 and F-1 score of 0.63. This performance is comparable to or better than the risk performance of other studies that developed ADRD risk prediction models among older adults in settings other than HHC (e.g., primary care).15,19,20

Our study found that using NLP to extract variables from clinical notes improved model performance for predicting ADRD across different time windows, with an increase in sensitivity, precision, and F1-score compared to models built on OASIS data alone. However, the initial significant added value of NLP decreased over follow-up in four years. These findings suggest that NLP may be a valuable tool for extracting essential risk factors for ADRD from clinical notes, which may not always be explicitly documented in structured data. Additionally, these findings highlight the importance of ongoing monitoring and evaluation of risk factors for ADRD, as the relative importance of different risk factors may change over the course of the disease.

We used the recursive feature elimination method to identify 18 variables highly associated with ADRD risk. Our analysis revealed that patients with pain interventions and a high frequency of reported pain interfering with activity/movement had lower odds of ADRD. This may be attributable to the fact that ADRD patients may experience pain that goes unrecognized, resulting in clinicians recording fewer instances of reported pain, as suggested by previous studies,21,22 indicating a low prevalence of reported pain in ADRD patients.

Additionally, Non-Hispanic White patients had lower odds of being diagnosed with ADRD. This finding is consistent with literature suggesting that non-Hispanic White patients are at lower risk of ADRD than other racial/ethnic groups.23 On the other hand, limitations in ADLs, such as difficulty using the telephone, and a history of falls, were strongly associated with a higher risk of ADRD. These findings are consistent with prior research confirming the increased risk of falls and ADL limitations in ADRD patients because of impairment in memory, executive function,24 difficulties in performing learned motor tasks, and dystonia/akathisia symptoms.25–27 Additionally, hearing impairment was strongly linked to ADRD risk over the four years follow-up, as prior research has shown a higher prevalence of hearing impairment in ADRD patients.28,29

Analysis of clinical data using NLP methods showed that patients with ADRD had higher odds of having memory issues documented in their clinical notes during home health care. This is consistent with previous studies that found memory loss to be more frequent among ADRD patients compared to other cognitive risk factors, such as disorientation and executive function problems.30,31 Among topics identified by the topic modeling, caregiver support and diabetes management were associated with lower odds of ADRD. Previous studies have found that having a socially active life and receiving support from family, and diabetes management of diabetes may be related to a lower risk of ADRD.32–35

These results have significant clinical implications. First, HomeADScreen can be applied to routinely collected HHC data to identify patients at risk for ADRD. HHC clinicians can then facilitate more timely follow-up and neurological assessments and potentially reduce the number of underdiagnosed ADRD cases in HHC. Second, identifying patients at risk for ADRD might prompt timely interventions, such as providing support services around home safety, increasing caregiver support, and addressing other needs of patients with ADRD (e.g., medication management and advance care planning) in a timely manner.

When applying the HomeADScreen model for predicting ADRD risk in HHC clinical settings, it is essential to balance several factors. The four-year model offers superior predictive accuracy, vital for precise intervention strategies, but may not be the best fit for patients needing immediate intervention. On the other hand, the one or two-year models enable earlier detection, which can be beneficial for initiating lifestyle changes and medications to manage symptoms and slow down disease progression. Healthcare resources also play a significant role in this decision; the shorter-term models could require more frequent evaluations and interventions, straining limited resources, while the four-year model might allow for more efficient allocation by concentrating on those at higher risk. Additionally, patient and caregiver preferences must be considered; some families might prefer early knowledge for proactive planning, while others might focus on immediate quality of life.36–38 Ultimately, the choice between these models should be made considering predictive accuracy, resource allocation, and the preferences and well-being of patients and caregivers.

Limitations

Although this study was conducted at one of the largest non-profit HHC organizations in the US with a racially diverse population, the findings might not be generalizable to other HHC settings. Further investigation is required to evaluate the performance of HomeADScreen in other HHC settings. Although we explored the performance of various machine learning and NLP methods for the development of this ADRD risk algorithm, other data science methods, such as deep neural networks and transformer-based natural league processing methods, remain unexplored. As part of our future studies, we plan to measure the added value of transformer-based NLP methods in improving the performance of HomeADScreen.

There are potential inaccuracies in relying on claims-based algorithms, such as the CCW flag, to identify ADRD diagnoses, in that there is the potential for a claim to include an ICD code pertaining to ADRD if a provider had assessed for the condition but had not necessarily verified the diagnosis. Although we are cognizant of this potential limitation, the CCW flag is deemed reasonably accurate for our current purposes and has been widely used in research on ADRD in the home care population.39–41

CONCLUSION

We developed HomeADScreen, a robust risk identification model for proactively identifying patients at risk for ADRD using routinely collected clinical data in the HHC setting. Analysis of both HHC OASIS data and clinical notes highlight the importance of considering both structured and unstructured data in risk prediction models. More heterogeneous patient populations from other HHC settings are needed to evaluate the universal applicability of this risk identification model for screening patients with ADRD.

Appendix C. Description of topic modeling techniques used in this study to identify hidden topics in clinical notes

A topic keyword model18 (TKM) is a technique used to identify the topics present in a collection of documents and to generate a set of representative keywords for each topic. TKM has several advantages over other topic modeling techniques. First, it can identify both general and specific topics in a document, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the content document context. Second, TKM uses statistical and linguistic techniques to identify the most relevant keywords for each topic, making the output more interpretable and valuable for downstream tasks. Finally, TKM can be easily integrated into a wide range of applications, such as information retrieval and text classification, making it a flexible and useful tool for various tasks.

Appendix D. A brief introduction of machine learning algorithms used in this study to model the relationship between input variables (from OASIS and clinical notes) and risk of ADRD

Logistic Regression uses a logistic function, an optimization function, to estimate the coefficient of each input variable (predictor) in predicting the outcome variables. The Logistic Regression performance is often used as a baseline binary machine learning classification model because of its simplicity and efficiency in implementation.42

Random Forest43 and Extra Trees44 are both Bagging methods that use decision trees as weak learners. Both algorithms generate and train multiple decision trees independently and combine their predictions to make a more accurate prediction. However, there are some differences between the two methods. Random Forest generates each weak learner from a bootstrapped sample of the data, while Extra Trees fits each weak decision tree on the entire original sample. Both algorithms randomly select a subset of features at each split point (node) to grow the decision trees, but Extra Trees uses a completely random selection process for choosing the split point, whereas Random Forest uses a greedy algorithm. This difference in selection process leads to Extra Trees having a higher reduction in variance and bias compared to Random Forest.

AdaBoost45 and XGBoost46 are two popular ensemble learning algorithms that belong to the class of gradient boosting methods. These algorithms work by sequentially generating weak learners (small decision trees), taking into account the error of the previous weak learner, and weighting them based on their performance to ultimately produce a strong learner. The main difference between AdaBoost and XGBoost is the way in which they combine weak learners to form a strong learner. XGBoost uses gradient descent to find the optimal combination of trees, while AdaBoost uses boosting to adjust the weighting of the training data. Additionally, while both algorithms use optimization parameters to select features and split points for growing trees, XGBoost also utilizes regularization parameters to reduce the complexity of the model and mitigate bias-variance trade-off. AdaBoost generates weak learners with a single split, known as decision stumps, while XGBoost allows for more complex weak learners by computing their depth through optimization parameters.

Support Vector Machines47 (SVMs) are a type of kernel method, which means that they rely on inner products of data vectors in order to make predictions. This allows them to generate non-linear boundaries for linear classification, and to operate on data without fixed-dimensional vector space representation. SVMs are built upon several key concepts,48 including the separating hyperplane for dividing data based on their labels, the maximum-margin hyperplane for maximizing generalizability, and the soft margin which uses a regularization parameter to balance the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing misclassification error. SVMs also utilize a kernel function, which is a function that uses similarity measures to transform data and reduce vector dimensions, improving separability and reducing complexity in high-dimensional feature space.

Appendix F. The most informative variables for predicting the risk of ADRD over first, second, and third year time window.

Overall, among variables identified using OASIS dataset, there was no significant difference in the risk factors (odd ration &gt;1) of ADRD over the four years time-windows. Risk factors that were consistently associated with higher odds ratios (&gt;1) for predicting ADRD across all time-windows are “inability to use telephone,” “dependency on managing oral medications prior to their most recent illness,” “hearing impairment,” “cognitive functioning,” “presence of urinary incontinence or urinary catheter,” “management of oral medication,” “caregiver provides assistance with supervision and safety,” and “type of inpatient facilities that the patient discharged: community referral.” The odd ratios for these variables, however, were not consistent across the four time windows. For example, the odd ratio for “hearing impairment” and “type of inpatient facilities that the patient discharged: community referral” increased over time, while the odd ratio for “management of oral medication” decreased over time. Also, for the third and fourth-year follow-up windows, risk of hospitalization: history of falls” and “fall risk assessment,” were observed as significant variables with odd ratio &gt; 1. Among significant variables with odd ratio &lt;1, “impairment with prior functioning ADL/IADL” and “frequency of pain interfering with activity/movement” were common across all four years of follow-up,. However, “pain intervention” were only observed as significant variables in the third and fourth-year follow-up windows, and “non-Hispanic White” was only observed in the four-year time-window.

The semi supervised Word2Vec NLP system identified “memory loss” as a common variable over the four years time-windows. However, “confusion” and “ADRD mentions” were specifically important risk factors with odds ratios &gt;1 in the first and second-year time windows. On the other hand, according to the TKM topic model, “diabetes management” and “type of medication” had significantly lower odds for predicting ADRD over the four years time windows. In contrast, “appetite disorder” and “functional issues” had lower odds in the first-year time window, but they did not appear in the second, third, and fourth-year time windows. Instead, caregiver support had significantly lower odds for the second, third, and fourth-year time windows, but this variable did not appear in the first-year time window.

Appendix G: Computed the best cut-off values using G-means, Youden’s J, and F1-score

Since the sample size for newly-diagnosed (patients with ADRD) and never-diagnosed patients (patients without ADRD) were imbalanced, we computed the best cut-of-values on the AUC-ROC curve using different methods, F1-score, G-means, and Youden’s J statistic.

F1-score: The F1 score can be interpreted as a harmonic mean of positive predictive value (precision) and recall (sensitivity) F1-score=2×(precision×recall)/(precision+recall)

Youden’s J: Youden’s J statistic (also called Youden’s index) is a single statistic that captures the performance of a dichotomous diagnostic test. It is calculated as: Youden′s J=sensitivity+specificity-1

G-means: Similar to Youden’s J, G-means (Geometric means) is the combination of sensitivity and specificity into a single score to provide an overall picture of the performance of a diagnostic test. G-means=sqrt(Sensitivity*Specificity)

Summary Table

What was already known on the topic?

ADRD risk prediction models have been developed for older adults in other clinical settings (e.g., primary care).

Patients with ADRD had low prevalence of reported pain in clinical data.

Limitations in daily functioning such as difficulty using the telephone, history of fall incidents, and memory issues were strongly associated with a higher risk of ADRD

Non-Hispanic White patients had lower odds of being diagnosed with ADRD.

What this study added to our knowledge?

HomeADScreen is the first risk identification model for ADRD using HHC data, with a four-year risk model achieving an AUC of 0.76.

Natural language processing improved model performance for predicting ADRD, extracting essential risk factors from home healthcare clinical notes, but its added value decreased over time.

This study corroborates the ADRD risk factors previously identified in other studies.

Highlights

The study developed a risk identification model called HomeADScreen to identify patients at risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) among home healthcare (HHC) patients. The model used a combination of structured data and information from HHC clinical notes.

The top-performing algorithm of HomeADScreen achieved an Area under the Curve of 0.76 for a four-year risk prediction time window, showing its effectiveness in predicting ADRD. The addition of clinical note-derived risk factors significantly improved the model’s overall performance by 60% in the first year.

The study revealed that hearing impairment and difficulty using the telephone were risk factors associated with an increased risk of ADRD, while being non-Hispanic White and absence of impairment in prior daily functioning were linked to a lower risk.

HomeADScreen can be translated into clinical practice to aid HHC clinicians in assessing patients’ cognitive functions and referring them for further neurological assessment, thereby potentially reducing the number of underdiagnosed ADRD cases in HHC.

Balancing factors like predictive accuracy, resource allocation, and patient/caregiver preferences is essential when implementing HomeADScreen in clinical settings.
