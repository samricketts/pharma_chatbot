Intracellular protein trafficking via the endosomes plays a key role in the maintenance of normal neuronal function. Although many diseases of the central nervous system exhibit specific pathological hallmarks, abnormalities of the endosome system are common traits for several of them including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Three main routes originate from the endosomes: the recycling, the degradation and the retrograde pathway. Studies have shown that the majority of Down syndrome subjects develop AD pathology and manifest altered morphology and number of endosomes, abnormalities in lysosome acidification and exosome secretion suggesting that dysfunction of one of these pathways could play a functional role in the AD-like phenotype of the syndrome. Two of the major endosomal routes are mediated by the retromer complex, a multimeric system responsible for transport of cargo from the endosome to the trans-Golgi network or to the cell membrane. Recently, a new endosome system structurally related to the retromer, called “retriever’, has been reported. While we know a lot about the neuropathophysiology of the retromer complex, no precise pathogenic role for the retriever has been identified yet. Here, we will review the neurobiology of the endosome system and its role as key player in the development of AD-like pathology in Down syndrome. Additionally, we will discuss current knowledge on these two main endosome systems, retromer and retriever, and their potential as novel therapeutic targets.

Introduction

Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common genetic abnormality resulting from a partial or complete triplication of chromosome 21 (HSA21), it affects one of every 700 births in the United States and is the leading cause of genetically defined intellectual disability 1. Individuals with DS have a significant increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and clinical studies estimated that by the age of 40-50 more than 60% of all individuals with DS will display classical AD-like neuropathology and cognitive decline, and for this reason they are referred as AD-DS cases 2. Interestingly, DS and AD share some pathophysiological aspects as supported by genetic evidence and neuronal mechanisms. Thus, genetic alteration in DS might somewhat parallel those in AD because an additional copy of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) is present on HSA21. Further, polymorphism of presenilin-1 (PSEN-1) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genes, two well-known risk factors for AD, occur more frequently among mothers of DS children versus controls 3. Regarding the neuronal mechanisms, recent evidence has clearly shown altered protein homeostasis, as reflected by protein trafficking defects, in both AD and DS. In particular, it has been reported that in brains form individuals with DS, like in AD, the endosome system is the first site of amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, suggesting that the subcellular localization of APP more than its absolute levels may be critical during the early stages of AD-DS pathogenesis 4. Under physiological conditions, early endosomes mature into late endosomes and the invagination of late endosomal membrane forms intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), which will then mature into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). MVBs are delivered to the lysosomes for degradation of the cargo, or to the plasma membrane and released as exosomes 5. In DS and AD, the higher level of ILVs release as exosomes in the extracellular space is generally ascribed to the higher level of MVBs production 6 (Figure 1) since early exosomes blood biomarkers are found in patients with sporadic AD and DS 7. Like in AD, DS also manifest lysosomal dysfunction, which can be characterized by acidification insufficiency, altered enzymatic activity and decreased turnover 8 (Figure 1). Considering that the endosomal system is responsible for protein recycling to the cell membrane or degradation to the lysosomes, in recent years its dysfunction has gained considerable attention as the potential biologic link between AD and DS 9. A key regulator of endosome protein sorting is the retromer complex, a multimeric system responsible for retrograde transport of cargo from the endosome to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Initially, dysfunction of the retromer complex has been primarily involved with Aβ processing and brain amyloidosis, more recently new evidence demonstrated that the complex is down-regulated in primary tauopathy and tau transgenic mice independently from Aβ suggesting for the first time that the system is also an active player in the development of tau pathology 10. Similar to AD, retromer complex anomalies have been also recently reported in post-mortem brain tissues and fibroblasts derived from DS subjects when compared with matched controls 11. Although the retromer complex is a major controller of protein sorting, there are numerous cargoes including α5β1 integrin, which do not depend on it 12. This observation indirectly indicated for the first time the existence of additional system/mechanism working in parallel with the classical retromer. Thus, a homologous endosome trafficking system known as the “retriever complex”, comprising of some subunits structurally equivalent to the retromer complex, has been recently identified 13. In mammals, the retromer and retriever complexes can bind to different and common cargo subunits, which are members of the “membrane-associated sorting nexins” (SNX). Typically nexins form dimers and are composed by different combinations of SNX1, SNX2, SNX5, SNX6, SNX27, which then directly control the formation and stabilization of tubules that protrude from the endosomes 14. Given that, similar to AD, protein trafficking dysfunction is considered an upstream event in DS pathophysiology, it is obviously important to elucidate the mechanisms whereby the two systems, retromer and retriever, could contribute to aberrant protein trafficking and ultimately the neuropathology of the syndrome. In this review, we will summarize some of the aspects of the complex neurobiology of the endosome system, and will focus specifically on these two complexes and their biologic link(s) to the pathophysiology of DS.

Protein trafficking: overview of the endosome system

Membrane trafficking is a highly regulated process which facilitates intracellular sorting and degradation of proteins, small vesicles, lipids, and other organelles firstly into specific membrane carriers, and then into specific compartments to their final destination. In the central nervous system (CNS) these processes are important especially for protein turnover at the pre- and post-synaptic terminals since they preserve the continuity of synthesis and degradation of different materials that ultimately ensure neuronal health and synaptic plasticity 15.

The first subcellular organelle charged with internalizing of cargoes is the early endosome (EE), a dynamic compartment enriched of phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) 16. The entry into the EE network begins with the endocytosis of integral membrane proteins from the cell surface through clathrin-dependent or independent mechanisms, as well as through phagocytosis and pinocytosis 17. A simplified view of this phenomenon shows three possible sorting pathways originating from EE: recycling route to the plasma membrane (PM), degradation route through the lysosome, and retrograde transport to the TGN 18. First, the recycling route allows the transport of cargo protein from the EE to the endosome recycling compartment (ERC), composed by tubovescicular membranes, and from the ERC to the PM. This route is divided into two steps: a ‘fast’ or direct that occurs from EEs, and ‘slow’ or indirect that occurs from the ERC, both controlled by various GTPases and utilized for instance during transferrin recycling by interacting directly with Rab11 protein, a member of the GTPase family and marker of the recycling pathway. Besides Rab11, also Rab35 is present in sorting endosomes and endosomal tubules and controls trafficking between the PM and endocytic compartments 19 (Figure 2, route I). Second, cargoes targeted for lysosomal degradation are organized into the ILVs, which once formed allow endosome biogenesis from early to late forms trough the endosome sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). Then, the late endosome (LE) fuses with the lysosome generating the endo-lysosome, which then follows a unidirectional fate of end-dead 20. Rab GTPases, especially the switch between Rab5 and Rab7, control diverse signaling and cell functions of the endosomes: Rab5 regulates EEs uptake and fusion, while the switch to Rab7 is required for initiation and maturation of early-to-late endosome; both have been shown to actively participate in cargo trafficking and lysosomal degradation 21 (Figure 2, route II). Third, cargoes could take a different route to reach the TGN via the retrograde pathway. In the endosome-to-TGN trafficking cargoes emerge from the endosomes, travel along cytoskeleton tracks, tether at, and then fuse with the TGN (Figure 2, route III). Similar to other endosome trafficking routes, this retrograde path is highly conserved from yeast to human and involves small GTPases, coat proteins, SNX, and SNARE proteins.

The major player which orchestrates retrograde pathway is the retromer system (Figure 3), a heteromeric complex, consisting of two sub-complexes: a constitutive trimer of vacuolar proteins sorting (VPS) VPS26-VPS29-VPS35, also known as the retromer recognition core, and the membrane association different sorting nexin (SNX) dimers. Although, VPS recognition core is thought to operate together with the SNX within the same complex, a recent study supports that the two major components can also operate independently from each other 22.

As the retromer, the retriever is a functional and evolutionary conserved multimeric complex composed of three main units: C16orf62, containing a HEAT-repeat protein fold and considered the analog to the VPS35; DSCR3, a paralogue of VPS26; and VPS29, which is identical to the one present in the retromer recognition core 23 (Figure 3). The retriever system was first identified following proteomic studies in search for proteins that potentially cooperate with the sorting nexin SNX17 in the endosome to cell surface recycling pathway. These experiments revealed that SNX17 bind and forms a stable trimer with the retriever as well as the subunits of the CCC complex, the coiled-coil domain-containing proteins (CCDC) 22 and 93 and the Copper Metabolism MURR1 (Mouse U2af1-rs1 region 1) domain (COMMD) proteins 23. Moreover, the CCC complex requires the association of the WASH complex to orchestrate the SNX17-retriever dependent retrieval and recycling process 24.

Endosome system dysfunction in Down syndrome

The endosome system is a vital component for the cell biology since it acts as an extension of the PM in regulating cell signaling and function. Because of this important physiologic aspect, any dysfunction will have a significant impact at the cellular level and potentially influence the pathophysiology of numerous disorders. Thus, progressive and persistent endosome dysregulation leads to a corrupted and failed system of protein sorting and trafficking, which ultimately results in the accumulation of abnormal proteins and disrupted cellular proteostasis.

One of the earliest reports associating endosome dysfunction with DS is a paper in which compared with matched controls, brains from DS subjects had an abnormal accumulation of endosomes 25. Another study demonstrated that the enlargement of endosomes could serve as an early marker for DS neuropathology since it is frequently detected already at the fetal stage (28 weeks of gestation) 26. Although morphological changes in the endosomes have been found in DS patients post-mortem brain tissues and in the CNS of Ts65Dn mice (a transgenic mouse model of DS) 27, enlarged endosomes are also observed in the periphery such as blood mononuclear cells and lymphoblastoid cells from DS individuals 4. Another protein which has been associated with endosomal abnormalities in DS is synaptojanin 1 (SYNJ1) a brain-enriched lipid phosphatase 28. The biologic link between SYNJ1 and DS has been supported by studies showing a significant increase of enlarged endosomes in a neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y cells) and human DS fibroblasts over-expressing this protein 4. Additionally, SYNJ1 can be phosphorylated by a serine/threonine kinase encoded by the dual-specificity tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) gene, which is located in the critical region of HSA21 29. Currently, major efforts are being made in developing selective DYRK1A inhibitors for therapies of many neurodegenerative disorders including DS. To this end, a recent study showed that pharmacological inhibition of DYRK1A ameliorates behavioral deficits in Ts65Dn mice 30. Intersectin 1 (ITSN1), another gene mapping to HSA21, has been reported to be potentially involved in endosomal abnormalities found in DS. Its product is a scaffolding protein known to regulate endocytosis, neurotransmitter release, and cell signaling 31, 32. ITSN1 knockout in mice, in C. Elegans and in Drosophila results in endosomal vesicles trafficking defects in neurons 33-36. The active involvement of ITSN1 in regulating endocytosis would predict that any deregulation of its level could be deleterious for this pathway. Interestingly, a study has demonstrated that ITSN1 is up-regulated in the CNS of DS patients when compared with controls 37. Besides the enlargement of endosomes, the total number of endosomes is also considered as a marker of its altered function in DS. The number of endosomes under physiological condition is proportional to the rate of endocytic and endosome uptake, however since during neurodegenerative processes the number of endosomes is typically increased this proportion is lost 25. Interestingly, by morphometric analysis, the number of EEA-1 (early endosome-associated protein-1) positive endosomes of all size is increased in primary fibroblast from DS patients compared to diploid controls, and the majority of them were identified particularly as large-sized endosomes 38. In DS retromer complex function can be also indirectly affected by changes in the expression level of the microRNA-155 (miR155), a chromosome 21-encoded microRNA that by negatively regulating C/EBPβ reduces levels of SNX27, an important component of the sorting nexin dimer. Interestingly, up-regulating SNX27 in the hippocampus of DS mice rescues synaptic and cognitive deficits, whereas in DS patients CNS miR155 up regulation is strongly correlated to DS dementia 39, 40 (Table 1).

Moreover, recent data have suggested a potential link between endosome dysfunction and abnormalities in exosome secretion, a phenomenon that can be easily assessed by measuring the expression levels of CD63, a marker associated with membranes of intracellular vesicles, and the exosome-related protein Rab35. Thus, it has been shown that frontal cortices of DS patients and brains from 12-month-old Ts2 mice express much higher levels of CD63 and Rab35 compared with controls 41 (Table 1).

Endosomal-lysosomal system in Down syndrome

The delivery of ubiquitinated cargoes to lysosomal acid hydrolases for degradation occurs after transient or complete fusion events occur between LE and the lysosomes, which ultimately form hybrid organelles, called endo-lysosomes. This is considered the main intracellular site of the endo-lysosomal system, and comprises of a series of dynamics membranous organelles specialized for regulating intracellular trafficking but most importantly cellular proteostasis 42. While decades of research in non-neuronal cells have revealed important regulatory mechanisms for endo-lysosomal trafficking system 43, only recently studies have begun to unveil remarkably complex and spatially compartmentalized mechanisms regulating this system within the CNS 44. Interestingly, up-regulated endocytosis and progressive endo-lysosomal disruption have been considered as emerging characteristics of DS neuropathology 45. Some evidence suggests that an early dysfunction in the lysosomal degradative capacity could be dependent on the third copy of the APP gene on HSA21, since the excessive amount of endogenous APP would favor the conversion of normal lysosomal function into lysosomal disruption. However, defects of lysosomal lumen such as its insufficient acidification, cathepsin D (CTSD) inactivation, and altered hydrolases activity could also contribute to the deregulated endo-lysosomal system in DS independently from the extra copy of APP. The maintenance of acidic pH (4.2–5.3) is essential for regulating many functions of lysosomes as well as for CTSD to operate optimally. However, both parameters are altered in human DS fibroblasts and primary cortical neurons from Ts2 mice reflecting an abnormal turnover of endocytic substrates 46, 47 (Table 1).

Retromer and retriever in Down syndrome: in vivo evidence

As mentioned earlier, endocytic trafficking involves a dynamic and continuous maturation of specific endosomal compartments, with some cargos predominantly sorted at the EE while others at the LE level. Regarding protein trafficking processes, the retromer complex is the most appreciated regulator that drives the endosome-to-TGN protein sorting pathway.

Interestingly, the complex is directly involved in the transport of several important cargo proteins which have been linked and considered relevant to the risk of developing AD in DS subjects. Among them Sorla, the endocytic receptor for APP, and the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), which transports the lysosomal protease CTSD, were found down-regulated in cortices from young DS individuals compared to controls 11 (Table 1). Interestingly, a variant of this receptor has been found in association with AD in adults with DS 48. Another protein cargo, the beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) enzyme, a transmembrane protein involved in APP cleavage rapidly internalized from the cell surface and transported to early endosomes where can be recycled by the retromer complex, has also been reported up-regulated in DS 49. Interestingly, in addition to the retromer a clathrin adaptor Golgi-localized γ-ear-containing ARF binding protein 3 (GGA3) has been recently shown to play a key role in the sorting and trafficking of BACE1 to the lysosomes, where it is normally degraded. GGA3 depletion results in BACE1 accumulation both in vitro and in vivo, its levels are reduced and inversely related to BACE1 levels in post-mortem brains of AD patients, and a GGA3 rare variant co-segregates with increased risk for late-onset AD 50.

Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 1 (LRP1) is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein. It has been demonstrated that LRP1 can affect APP trafficking and processing through APP binding interactions with LRP1 extracellular and intracellular domains [20-22].

Finally, the AMPA receptors (AMPARs), a group of cation-permeable ionotropic glutamate receptors involved in synaptic transmission, are internalized at the level of the EE in hippocampal neurons 51. These receptor use the retromer complex for basal dendritic trafficking 52,53 and have been reported significantly altered in the hippocampus of Ts65Dn mice 54.

The retromer is expressed in multiple tissues but play a noticeable role in the SNC where its dysfunction and/or altered expression of its components have been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, studies showed that expression of the retromer recognition core is down-regulated in AD brain, and contributes to amyloidogenic APP processing and Aβ generation, whereas in vitro studies showed that its down-regulation increases the Aβ formation. Additionally, genetic reduction of VPS35 in the Tg2576 mice, a model of AD-like brain amyloidosis, results in higher levels of Aβ peptides and plaques, cognitive impairments and synaptic dysfunction 55. Levels of VPS35 and the other two components of the retromer recognition core module (i.e., VPS26 and VPS29) are decreased in an age- and region-specific manner in the same mouse model, suggesting an early involvement of the system in the onset and development of the AD-like phenotype 56. Importantly, a gain of function of VPS35 in the CNS of the triple transgenic AD mice rescued their phenotype including amelioration of long-term memory, lower Aβ levels, and decrease in pathological tau. On the other hand, down-regulation of VPS35 results in worsening of the phenotype in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy, the P301S transgenic mice 6.

Interestingly, dysregulation of VPS35 has been also linked to early and late onset Parkinson’s disease (PD), the most common movement disorder, and similar to AD the consensus is that a loss of function in the retromer complex is responsible for it. PD was first linked to the retromer complex in 2011 when exome sequencing revealed a mutation in residue 620 (D620N) in the VPS35 orthologue 57. Additionally, post-mortem analysis of brain tissues revealed decreased protein levels of VPS35 in the substantia nigra of PD patients 58. Using a Drosophila model, one study found that RNAi-mediated Vps35 knockdown led to aberrant alpha-synuclein degradation in the lysosome, specifically, via impaired delivery of CTSD to the lysosome [38]. In cellular models, studies indicate that D620N VPS35 mutation resulted in defective CIMPR sorting as well as altered localization of the AMPA receptors indicating a link between retromer and post-synaptic transmission 59.

Given that EE enlargement is a key feature of DS, in a recent study we examined the status of the retromer complex system in DS using both postmortem brain tissues and patient-derived fibroblasts from individuals with DS and unaffected controls. To start establishing a temporal profile of retromer dysregulation within the context of the evolution of DS phenotype, we investigated the retromer core and associated proteins in young patients prior to significant Aβ deposition (age 15–30 years), and older subjects (age 40–65 years) at a time when virtually all the individuals with DS display Aβ plaques. VPS35 and VPS29 were significantly decreased in the cortex, and all three recognition core proteins were reduced in the hippocampus of the oldest subgroup of DS patients when compared to controls (Table 1). Surprisingly, we found that retromer deficiency was not primarily age-related in DS subjects. Dysregulation of the retromer complex was also observed in younger patient subgroups, suggesting that the dysfunction may begin prior to full development of AD-like pathology and cognitive symptoms in DS. Interestingly, in both young and aged subjects, retromer depletion was most evident in the hippocampus. Additionally, we examined the relationship between retromer proteins and both soluble and insoluble Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 peptide levels for all subjects. Although reduction of retromer proteins seems to precede Aβ deposition, we found that the degree of retromer depletion for all retromer core proteins significantly and inversely correlates with the accumulation of both Aβ peptides in cortex and hippocampus. While we recognize that the observed inverse correlation between retromer and Aβ does not necessarily indicate causation, we believe that our finding further supports the evidence that in DS retromer dysfunction and neurodegeneration are closely associated 7. Although many SNX components have been shown to regulate intracellular trafficking, SNX27 is the only one comprising a cargo-binding domain, involved in endosomal trafficking, highly expressed in the CNS and co-localized with EE and recycling endosomes. Interestingly, it has been shown that in DS up-regulation of the miR155, which is encoded in HSA21, results in a significant reduction of SNX27 expression. This observation supports the hypothesis of a possible involvement of this nexins in DS pathogenesis since SNX27 normally interacts with the PS-1 of the γ-secretase complex and inhibits APP cleavage and Aβ generation 39. Moreover, lower levels of SNX27 were reported in the brains of Ts65Dn mice 60 (Table 1). In addition to SNX27, some other retromer components may also be associated with DS 10. DS critical region 3 (DSCR3), a gene located in HSA21, is up-regulated in adult DS brain 61. DSCR3 is considered to be a VPS26 analog as it adopts an arrestin-like fold as found in the VPS26 family, and is a major component of the retriever complex. The retriever together with the WASH complex, can also regulate SNX17-mediated sorting of different proteins 23, some of which are involved in synaptic plasticity and Aβ clearance 62, 63. Although to date, it is known that the retriever and the retromer share similarities in their structure, evidence of direct interaction between them is currently lacking and further investigations is required to study for a potential biologic link between the two systems, and the role of their concurrent dysfunction in DS pathogenesis.

Retromer and retriever as therapeutic targets

From the data presented it is evident that overall the CNS health is particularly dependent on the normal function this endosomal complex system and highly sensitive to its dysfunction. Interestingly, so far all the pathological processes secondary to these abnormalities have been linked to a loss rather than a gain in retromer complex system function 64, 65. The balance between cargo degradation and recycling involves the integrity of the whole retromer complex as a functional unit in which VPS35 has emerged as central scaffold responsible for the structural assembly and stability of the entire complex. Thus, VPS35 could considered as a novel therapeutic target given that its loss would induce pathology, while restoring defects by increased its level would normalize protein sorting and trafficking processes and ultimately halt or delay disease progression 66-68. Similarly, the up-regulation of the retriever complex system could be achieved not only by exogenous molecules as pharmacological targets but also trough reinforcement of endogenous proteins directly interacting with the retriever complex 69.

Taking into consideration all the available data, particularly on the retromer complex (i.e.,VPS35) in diseases like AD, PD and DS it is obvious that while we do not know in its entirety the precise molecular mechanisms involved in each of them, we know that at least so far they are all characterized by a loss rather than a gain of function. With this concept in mind, it is easy to envision a condition in which a recovery of the retromer function will potentially have a therapeutic effect for these diseases. To this end, early work showed indeed that in a Drosophila model of PD, mutant LRRK2 flies, overexpression of the VPS35 or VPS26 ameliorates the eye phenotype, significantly protects from the locomotor deficits and rescues their shortened lifespan 70. Moreover, in an animal model of AD with amyloid beta plaques and tau tangles the gain of function of the retromer complex achieved by genetically over-expressing VPS35 in the CNS, rescues the entire AD-like phenotype 71. Interestingly, in both cases no evidence of any cytotoxic effect was reported.

Recently, pharmacological chaperones, small molecules that selectively target, bind, and stabilize a protein and increase its cellular steady-state concentration, have emerged as potential facilitators of cargoes trafficking. The possible application of pharmacological chaperones to target a multiprotein complex such as the retromer represents a new idea because originally it was not considered that this type of drug could bind to a complex that does not have an allosteric site. A recent paper has identified and then validated two pharmacologic chaperones named R55 and R33 (both thiophene thiourea derivates), which were able to stabilize the retromer recognition core against thermal denaturation 72. Subsequent in vitro studies showed that indeed these compounds up-regulate endogenous levels of VPS35 and other major components of the recognition core resulting in an increase of APP trafficking out of the endosomes and reduced Aβ formation 56. Interestingly, other reports have also demonstrated that these drugs can modulate levels of tau protein and its phosphorylated isoforms in hiPSC-derived neurons 73 and neuronal cell stably expressing all six tau isoforms (N2A-Htau cells) 10 independently from any effect on APP and Aβ. On the other hand, a recent preclinical study using the 3xTg AD mouse model has provided evidence for the efficacy of chronic treatment with a pharmacologic chaperone against the onset of the AD-like phenotype (Aβ, tau and behavioral impairments) 74.

The specific mechanism of action of many pharmacological chaperones could represent an advantage from a therapeutic point of view for several diseases including DS if one considers also their efficacy at low concentrations, lack of off-target effects and good bioavailability 75, 76

Therefore, the possibility of targeting the retromer and retriever complex systems by implementing a pharmacological chaperone approach in DS is now becoming not only an interesting but also a feasible opportunity. This approach will be a significant departure from previous ones that have been implemented in DS as well as other neurologic diseases. In fact, while most of the therapeutic strategies adopted so far have aimed at a specific protein or enzyme which is often considered part of a metabolic pathway or regulatory feedback, the pharmacologic chaperone approach will by contrast target a cellular mechanism which is universal and at the base of cell health and homeostasis.

Conclusions and future directions

Based on the available literature, consistent evidence clearly points out that like in AD one of the earliest neuropathologic features of DS are abnormalities of protein sorting and trafficking, a process in which the endosomal system functions as a master regulator. Although in recent years significant progress in this field has been made, and important basic new knowledge on the physiopathology of these processes has been gained, several areas remain to be investigated, which underscore an incomplete understanding of the neurobiology of the endosomal system, its regulatory mechanisms and changes that occur during the disease pathogenesis. Identification of some the mechanisms involved in the retromer system dysfunction and DS has certainly helped us to move the field forward. However, the recent discovery of the retriever, an additional system central to sorting and trafficking of protein and of which we know very little, has added an extra layer of complexity and challenge for this area of research.

While useful model systems such as murine models of DS (Ts2 and Ts65Dn mice), human fibroblasts, and neurons derived from DS iPSC are widely available and are allowing the elucidation and exploration of unchartered endosomal mechanisms and pathways, we have to recognize that all of them have some limitations and there is an urgent need for better ones.

Future investigation on the endosomal system in DS should focus not only of the cell biology of these two major systems, but also on the accurate characterization of other aspects such as cellular type contribution and brain region distribution and relative roles for each of them. Moreover, work should focus on some open questions like: can one system (i.e., retromer) compensate for the deficit of the other (i.e., retriever)? Is the effect of their simultaneous dysfunction synergistic/additive or independent? Since they share some sub-unit (i.e., VPS29) targeting one will have an effect on the other?

We believe that addressing these questions not only will shed important new lights on these two systems and their interplay as early and active contributors to DS pathogenesis, but most importantly will provide a new therapeutic framework for DS patients.

Figure 2. Protein trafficking routes.

Extracellular proteins are targeted (as cargoes, C) to allow their internalization through plasma membrane (PM) invagination. Within the cell, the targeted cargo enters into the early endosome (EE) through membrane receptors, and further redirected to the proper destination, via three different routes. I) The recycling route allows the transport of the cargo protein to the endosome recycling compartment (ERC), and from the ERC to the PM. Rab GTPases, such as Rab11 and Rab35, participate in the recycling. II) Late endosome (LE) formation initiates cargo proteins transport to the lysosome where there they are degraded by proteases. The process is mediated by Rab5 to Rab7 switch, and by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). III) During the retrograde pathway, the cargo is released from the EE. The retromer and retriever complexes facilitate cargo transport to the Golgi apparatus (GA) (Trans network), along the cytoskeleton (CSK).

Figure 3. The retromer and retriever complexes.

The retromer recognition core Vps35–Vps29–Vps26 trimer (1) recruits subcomplexes, such as the SNXs-BAR (a) and WASH (b), and Rab7a (c) and SNAREs (d) proteins to promote cargoes sorting. Targeted cargoes, including cation independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) (e), SorLa (sortilin-related receptor) (f) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) (g), are transported from the endosome to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) by the retromer complex. The retriever complex (DSCR3–C16orf62–VPS29) (2), associated with sorting nexin 17 (SNX17) protein, WASH and CCC (h) complexes, cooperates with the retromer complex to mediate the endosomal protein sorting process.
