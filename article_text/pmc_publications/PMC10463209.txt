Background:

At-home self-collection of specimens has become more commonplace due to measures taken in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Self-collection of hair cortisol is important because chronic stress is present in many populations, such as older adults living with Alzheimer’s disease and their family caregivers. For the evaluation of chronic stress, scalp hair can be used as a predictive biomarker because it examines the cumulative, retrospective stress from previous months.

Objectives:

To provide a study procedure for at-home, scalp hair self-collection for cortisol concentration analysis from dyads consisting of a person living with Alzheimer’s disease and their family caregiver.

Methods:

After informed electronic consent is obtained, a package containing the necessary tools for self-collection of hair samples from the dyad is mailed to the participant’s home. Participants are provided detailed print and video multimedia guides outlining how to obtain the hair samples. Ideally, the hair samples are obtained during the virtual data collection meeting with research personnel. Participants mail back the hair sample in a prepaid package to the biomedical laboratory for analysis.

Discussion:

At-home, self-collection of hair provides potential advantages such as reduced participant burden, especially for vulnerable populations where transportation and different environments are challenging. At-home sample collection options may increase research participation and can be applied to multiple research foci. Research considerations for dyads, such as people living with Alzheimer’s disease and their caregivers, are discussed.

pmcCortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. While cortisol is important for many functions, the accumulation of prolonged or irregular patterns of cortisol secretion resulting from chronic stress can be maladaptive and adversely affect health (Kim et al., 2022; McEwen, 2004; Wright et al., 2015). Because of the effect of time of day and stressors on endogenous cortisol levels, methods differ for studying long-term (chronic) stress versus short-term (acute) stress (Russell et al., 2012). For the evaluation of chronic stress, scalp hair can be used as a predictive biomarker because it examines the cumulative, retrospective HPA activity from previous months (O’Brien et al., 2013; Russell et al., 2012). One centimeter of hair most proximal to the scalp reflects cortisol levels the month prior to collection (Gow et al., 2010). Thus, hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) provide further insight into chronic physiological stress (Russell et al., 2012).

Remote research options are now more common in response to distancing measures related to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak of 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic). Remote options can reduce participant burden, especially in vulnerable populations, such as those living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Collection of hair cortisol by the research participants in an at-home environment (Toly et al., 2022) minimizes difficulties, such as travel and exposure to viruses. If collected properly, hair cortisol self-collection is equivalent to professionally collected hair and can be used reliably as a method for obtaining cortisol levels outside of a laboratory setting (Enge et al., 2020; Ouellet-Morin et al., 2016).

This current paper outlines a dyadic, at-home, hair cortisol self-collection procedure for people living with AD and their family caregivers. The purpose of the overall pilot study includes examining pain in people living with AD and their caregivers, associations of stress (as measured by HCC) and pain in the dyad, and how this affects caregiver burden. HCC is a reliable, low-participant burden biomarker in older adults (Wright et al., 2015). Recent work supports the feasibility and use of hair cortisol to measure stress in people living with dementia (Kim et al., 2022).

Methods

After institutional review board approval and electronic-consenting (e-consenting), the supplies for hair self-collection are mailed to study participants’ mailing addresses as non-biohazard priority mail. Because of the remote nature of the study, all supplies (parting comb, blunted scissors, hair clips, and stamped and pre-addressed return mail packaging) are included in the mailed package. A print copy of instructions is included in the package and also emailed to participants as a downloadable attachment. The day before scheduled data collection (including hair sample collection), the research personnel place a reminder phone call, and participant receipt of the hair sample collection supply package is confirmed. Table 1 provides a list of all supplies needed.

Detailed step-by-step written instructions for at-home self-collection for both longer and shorter-length hair are provided for the family caregiver to collect their own hair sample and the sample of the person living with AD (procedure detailed in Wright et al., 2018). This protocol for hair sample home collection is included as Supplementary Digital Content. The caregiver and person living with AD have the option to receive assistance from another individual to obtain their hair samples. A link to a brief instructional video showing where on the scalp to obtain the sample, how to section the hair, and how much hair to collect is also provided (Wright et al., 2018). The caregiver is encouraged to collect their hair sample along with the person living with AD’s hair sample during the data collection videoconference meeting or another scheduled meeting. This allows research personnel to answer any questions or concerns during the process and highlight proper collection techniques, labeling, and packaging of the hair samples. However, if the caregiver is unable (because of time, energy, etc.) or is uncomfortable providing the sample while on video, they can do so while not on the camera. To promote flexibility, the option of a phone call for data collection is also available.

Once both hair samples have been collected, they are placed in respective pre-labeled and prepaid packaging (one for the caregiver and one for the person living with AD) and mailed directly to the laboratory for processing. The package is tracked via online tracking from the time the supplies are sent to the participants until the package is delivered to the laboratory. Ford et al. (2021) contain laboratory methods for hair cortisol sample processing. A research team member emails laboratory personnel once a sample is enroute. Laboratory personnel document the receipt of hair samples and the results in a secure research drive. The participants (the caregiver and the person living with AD) are each compensated with a $75 gift card (for $150 total per dyad) and a thank you card for taking part in the overall study (including other quantitative and qualitative data collection). Table 2 provides a checklist for sample self-collection.

For this study, in addition to hair samples, caregiver interviews, and self-reported survey data are collected. Study data are collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) hosted at The Ohio State University. REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing: (a) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; (b) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; (c) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and (d) procedures for importing data from external sources (Harris et al., 2009). The Hair Care Survey asks questions about hair washing frequency; the use of dyes, heat, and styling; and medications, such as steroids or hormones, which may affect hair cortisol levels. The Hair Care Survey also confirms if the participant agrees to provide a hair sample for the study. If not, reasons why they opt out are recorded. Additional surveys include data on participant demographics, current medication, multidimensional clinical pain, anxiety, and depression for the caregiver and the person living with AD. Surveys are commonly used to measure stress in individuals and including measurements of HCC adds a new dimension of data and supports participants’ survey responses.

Discussion

Dyadic self-collection of hair cortisol from people living with AD and their caregivers is novel and fills a gap in scientific literature. A collection method that can be implemented outside a laboratory or clinical setting, and without the need for a skilled professional, is relevant with transitions to remote research as a result of distancing measures beginning in 2020 in response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (Toly et al., 2022). At-home, self-collection decreases the risk of exposure and alleviates the need for personal protective equipment that may be in low supply during times of high demand.

At-home and remote research options can reduce participant burden by decreasing the cost and time that may be associated with travel and transportation to and for research activities (Wehrhahn et al., 2020). Reducing participant burden is particularly essential for vulnerable populations, such as people living with AD and their caregivers, as this population may face a higher risk associated with exposure and may experience more difficulty with transportation and travel. At-home collection also allows participants to be more comfortable and remain in a familiar environment during participation in a research study (Hill et al., 2021). These factors may lead to increases in recruitment and reduced attrition and can also broaden the geographic area available for recruitment.

Additional benefits of hair cortisol samples include the noninvasive nature, the simple method of collection using common household supplies, and the lack of storage requirements. In an at-home collection study, participants reported that the self-collection of hair was easier than expected (Toly et al., 2022). Hair samples are also a lower burden to many patients, while a blood test can cause patient discomfort, fear, and pain; a salivary test may be difficult because of dry mouth; and a urine test can be difficult to complete for individuals living with cognitive impairment, such as AD. Timing and time of day are crucial for capturing acute cortisol levels, and participants may not be able to consistently collect the samples at the required time. This time-of-day caveat increases confounding variables and may reduce the accuracy of results for acute stress measures. Adherence to strict collection protocols with accurate timing is often a requirement for grant and journal submissions. The use of HCC avoids this confounder because it is not sensitive to time of day, as it measures cortisol accumulation over time, acting as a marker for longer-term stress.

There are limitations to dyadic in-home HCC self-collection. For example, research personnel must allocate additional time to package and mail hair sample collection supplies. Time must also be allowed for the delivery of the packet to participants’ mailing addresses prior to samples being collected. Therefore, this extra time must be built into scheduling for data collection. For the study described in this paper, researchers scheduled the virtual data collection one full week after consenting. There may be delivery-related delays in the hair collection package delivery and the return of hair samples. Therefore, using tracking on packages to inform research personnel of the shipment progress is helpful. Researchers should also stay in contact with the participants to remain aware of when the participants mail the samples and if any delays may prohibit the participants from mailing the samples back as scheduled. The cost of packaging and mailing may also be considered a limitation, depending on the research budget. Mailing services that include flat-rate options may help when budgeting for study costs, and if possible, estimated costs for postage should be included in grant applications for funding. For this study, costs were $18.20 in 2022 per dyad for flat-rate postage for both the package of supplies and the prepaid return package for the hair sample.

For participants in different time zones than that of the research team, research personnel need to make sure that virtual appointments are scheduled and labeled accordingly. Additionally, poor internet or phone connections may disrupt data collection, which may be frustrating for the participants. To mitigate this, researchers should be flexible and inform participants early on that such delays are possible and request more time than usually needed for in-person collection so that data collection is not rushed. For example, our research team requests a 2-hr block of time for all data collection for the study described here, including collection of hair samples and survey responses from the person living with AD and their caregiver and an audio-recorded interview with their caregiver. Also, individuals may lack familiarity and understanding of online options, including email and electronic signatures; they may be unable, intimidated by, or unwilling to participate in remote research involving virtual meetings, which may complicate or prevent e-consenting and virtual data collection.

Some older adults may lack the dexterity to collect and/or self-collect the sample(s). Therefore, it is suggested that the dyad seek help with collection from another individual who can be in the home if needed. If not collected properly, samples are more likely to be of inadequate quantity and have HCC values below the detectable threshold (Enge et al., 2020). However, detailed instructions, availability to answer questions, and the option to collect during a virtual meeting can mitigate this risk. Potential reasons for an inability to provide a hair sample include hair constraints, such as thin hair, braids, hair extensions (e.g., weaves or wigs), baldness, or alopecia (Toly et al., 2022).

Data collection is ongoing for this pilot study. Thus far, five dyads have enrolled and fully completed all study procedures. In evaluating our process to date, we found that each self-collected hair cortisol sample received was of adequate weight and length, correctly labeled, and of sufficient quality for lab analysis. Participants expressed that the process of hair self-collection was easy to complete. A few considerations with hair sampling included obtaining the sample before and not after a scheduled haircut and making note of chemicals used on the hair. The online nature of this study has gone smoothly overall for our participants and research personnel. The greatest challenge thus far has been the need to walk a caregiver through their email platform to locate forms for the virtual consent process during a videoconferencing visit. During this step, the participant stayed connected to the meeting but lost the ability to maintain the video image of the research personnel on their screen while simultaneously accessing their email to obtain the consent forms for signing. This was initially confusing for them; however, the visit was able to continue successfully.

Conclusion

This procedure uses an innovative process that fills a gap in the literature for the self-collection of hair cortisol from a dyadic sample of people living with AD and their caregivers that was developed based on needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using scalp hair—as opposed to other common methods for measuring stress (blood, urine, and saliva)—is less invasive and allows for a deeper insight into stress experienced by an individual over an extended period. Collecting the sample in an at-home setting provides many advantages for both the participants and the research team, including reduced participant burden and potentially increased research participation. This procedure can also be applied to other research areas and adapted for other populations to allow research to continue, even during a pandemic.
