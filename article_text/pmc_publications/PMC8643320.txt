Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative brain disorder that affects tens of millions of older adults worldwide and has significant economic and societal impacts. Despite its prevalence and severity, early diagnosis of AD remains a considerable challenge. Here we report an integrated acoustofluidics-based diagnostic system (ADx), which combines triple functions of acoustics, microfluidics, and orthogonal biosensors for clinically accurate, sensitive, and rapid detection of AD biomarkers from human plasma. We design and fabricate a surface acoustic wave-based acoustofluidic separation device to isolate and purify AD biomarkers to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Multimodal biosensors within the integrated ADx are fabricated by in-situ patterning of the ZnO nanorod array and deposition of Ag nanoparticles onto the ZnO nanorods for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and electrochemical immunosensors. We obtain the label-free detections of SERS and electrochemical immunoassay of clinical plasma samples from AD patients and healthy controls with high sensitivity and specificity. We believe that this efficient integration provides promising solutions for the early diagnosis of AD.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive, age-related neurodegenerative disorder that leads to a rapid decline of physical, cognitive, and behavioral abilities, such as memory loss, impaired motor functioning, and difficulty communicating (Golde et al., 2018). AD affects more than 15 percent of people aged 65 and older worldwide, and the annual healthcare costs associated with AD are over $300 billion (Kaushik et al., 2016). The current standards for the clinical diagnosis of AD pathology rely largely on neuroimaging and neuropsychological characterization, which have many drawbacks such as poor accuracy, invasiveness, high cost, long operating time, and limited accessibility. These significantly limit their widespread use as screening tools and leave many AD patients undiagnosed, leaving many patients unaware of their condition until the disease has progressed to a very late stage (Brazaca et al., 2020). Given that AD is a terminal illness with no cure (Brazaca et al., 2020; Kaushik et al., 2016), accurate diagnosis is essential to help patients identify their condition earlier in life, and to improve recruitment for preventative and therapeutic studies of early-stage AD, which can accelerate the development of effective treatment strategies and significantly improve the quality of life of affected patients.

As AD progresses, several hallmark abnormal structures begin to form in the brain of affected individuals (Kametani and Hasegawa, 2018). For example, senile plaques are induced by the extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides around neurons; neurofibrillary tangles are formed by the intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Clinical studies have shown that abnormal reductions of Aβ peptides and elevations of tau proteins compared to normal are observed in AD-positive individuals up to 10–15 years before the appearance of symptoms (Benzinger et al., 2013; Blennow et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2020). Thus, Aβ peptides and tau proteins have been established as clinical biomarkers to serve as critical pathological tools to diagnose and monitor the disease progression of AD patients (Busche and Hyman, 2020; Lee et al., 2019; Nakamura et al., 2018).

In recent years, liquid biopsy, which involves analysis of circulating biomarkers (such as proteins, exosomes, and nucleic acids) from samples of blood and other bodily fluids, has emerged as a powerful diagnostic and monitoring tool for many diseases and has shown great potential for applications in AD diagnosis and management (Hampel et al., 2019). The abundance and accessibility of these circulating biomarkers may greatly facilitate the real-time and noninvasive assessment of AD patients in point-of-care settings. However, difficulties involved in the isolation and detection of circulating AD biomarkers remain obstacles towards developing an accurate and reliable liquid biopsy (Brazaca et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020).

Because AD biomarkers are found in extremely low concentrations in blood plasma, there is a significant need to purify AD biomarkers prior to detection. To date, several different kinds of isolation methods, such as differential ultracentrifugation (Amor-Gutiérrez et al., 2020; Sardar Sinha et al., 2018), immunoaffinity capture (Carneiro et al., 2017; Razzino et al., 2020), magnetic filtration (de Oliveira et al., 2020; Li et al., 2019), and microfluidics (Choi et al., 2012; Chou et al., 2008), have been implemented for AD biomarker purification to achieve sensitive detection performance. However, these methods typically suffer from long processing times, low yields, and/or poor reproducibility. In addition, although several biosensors have been developed to detect AD biomarkers, these systems are unimodal and only measure one unique sensing parameter, such as electrical, optical, or fluorescent properties (Bilal et al., 2020; Carneiro et al., 2020; Sangubotla and Kim, 2018; Scarano et al., 2016). In real-world settings, unimodal biosensors often result in limited versatility and accuracy, preventing widespread adoption. For example, SERS biosensors have proven to be effective for measuring trace analytes, but they are typically not very specific (Sharma et al., 2012). Similarly, electrochemical immunosensors are very specific, but they are also known to suffer from stability and reproducibility (Ronkainen et al., 2010). Therefore, there is still an unmet need for developing cross-validated multimodal tools that can improve the diagnosis of AD patients.

Herein, we report using acoustofluidics (i.e., the fusion of acoustics and microfluidics) as a multimodal platform for isolating and detecting AD biomarkers in human plasma. Our platform combines an acoustofluidic separation chip for isolating AD biomarkers containing Aβ peptides and tau proteins and an acoustofluidic mixing-based multimodal biosensors (i.e., surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and electrochemical immunosensors) for AD biomarker sensing (Figure 1). Acoustofluidics-based sample purification was demonstrated to efficiently remove contaminating bioparticles and improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the analyte signals. The multimodal SERS/electrochemical immunosensor platform is established using ZnO nanoarray-patterned gold electrodes. By combining the advantages of both biosensing mechanisms synergistically, we can improve the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of our acoustofluidic multimodal biosensors, thus demonstrating this device as a vital tool that has excellent potential as a clinical translational device for early AD diagnosis.

2. Materials and methods

2.1 Experimental setup for acoustofluidic separation

The acoustofluidic separation chip was placed on a thermoelectric cooling plate (Peltier module Hebei TEC1–12730b) and powered by a Tekpower TP1505D variable linear DC power supply. The inlet fluids were individually operated by an automated syringe pump (neMESYS, Cetoni, Germany). The flow rates of the sample flow, the upper sheath flow, the lower sheath flow, and the sheath flow of the second separation module were 6, 9, 2, and 11 μL/min, respectively. An upright Olympus BX51WI microscope was used to record the isolation process. Interdigital transducers (IDTs) were energized using an Agilent E4422B function generator and an RF amplifier (Amplifier Research 100A250A). Particle size distributions of plasma samples before and after treatment were analyzed using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA, Malvern Panalytica).

2.2 In-situ patterning of ZnO nanorod array

The synthesis of ZnO nanomaterials was carried out using a two-step seeding and growth method. The Au electrode system with a working electrode diameter of 2 mm was fabricated using standard photolithography and e-beam evaporation techniques same as above. Polyimide was used to passivate the unused area of the electrode lines and to expose the working electrode region for ZnO patterning (Park et al., 2014). During the seeding step, two inlet solutions, one containing Zn(OAc)2 (2.5 mM in ethanol) and the other NaOH (5 mM in ethanol), were pumped into the acoustofluidics-based sharp edge microreactor with a same flow rate of 1 μL/min at room temperature. The growth step was realized by using aqueous solutions of Zn(NO3)2 (2.5 mM) and HMTA (2.5 mM) at a reaction temperature of 90 °C. After a certain time period (15–90 min), the electrode was cleaned and dried for further use. The deposition of Ag nanoparticles onto the ZnO nanorod array was conducted using a similar experimental protocol as above. Briefly, two aqueous fluids, one containing AgNO3 (1 mM) and the other NaBH4 (3 mM), were pumped into the sharp-edge microreactor with an applied signal frequency, voltage, and fluid flow rate of 108 kHz, 10 V, and 1 μL/min, respectively.

2.3 SERS sensing of Aβ42 and clinical blood samples

Aβ42 monomer solutions were prepared by a modified protocol based on previous literature (Chou et al., 2008). Briefly, lyophilized Aβ42 peptides were dissolved in DMSO. Then, an aliquot of the solution was added into PBS (pH 7.4) to create a 10 μM stock solution. The Aβ42 solutions were diluted with PBS to the concentrations of interest and stored at 4 °C before being delivered into the microchamber. After incubating Aβ42 with the sensing substrate for 10 mins, a HORIBA Jobin Yvon Raman spectrophotometer equipped with an Olympus BX41 microscope was employed to focus the excitation laser (785 nm) on the sensing substrate. The analysis protocol of clinical blood samples with and without acoustofluidic separation was like the procedure for Aβ42 solutions. SERS measurements of every sample were independently conducted five times for comparison between healthy control and AD groups (Carlomagno et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2018).

2.4 Electrochemical measurements

The electrochemical performance of the three-electrode immunosensors was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). To stabilize the potential of the electrode system, Ag/AgCl ink was applied to the reference electrode. For the detection of Aβ42 and tau in prepared solutions and clinical samples, the electrode was incubated with the sample of interest for 15 min at room temperature. After binding, the sensor device was rinsed with water and finally immersed in a solution of KCl (0.1 M) containing [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− (1 mM) as the redox probe. All measurements were carried out using a CHI832B electrochemical analyzer.

The detailed experimental conditions and characterizations are included in the supplementary materials.

3. Results and discussions

3.1 Acoustofludic screening of AD biomarkers

AD biomarkers, such as free Aβ peptides, free tau proteins, and exosomes containing these proteins, are present in the human plasma (Dage et al., 2016; Roher et al., 2009). Effective isolation and purification of AD biomarkers from human plasma should significantly facilitate the sensing and detection process by removing non-specific signals. Here we developed an acoustofluidic chip to isolate AD biomarkers from patient plasma. As shown in Figure 2A–C, the acoustofluidic separation chip includes two separation modules arranged in series. Each module was driven by two different pairs of IDTs operating at different frequencies to generate surface acoustic waves (SAW) that can achieve high-purity isolation of the target AD biomarkers. We used a 20 MHz, lower frequency pair of transducers to screen out micrometer-sized contaminants for the upstream separation module. A 40 MHz, higher frequency pair of transducers was used for the downstream separation module to screen out the submicrometer-sized contaminates. Each IDT was fabricated using standard photolithography and e-beam evaporation techniques (Figure S1) (Gu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2019a, 2019b).

Bioparticles with larger sizes should experience a stronger radiation force, which will laterally displace them more effectively from high acoustic pressure areas to pressure nodes that are parallel to IDTs (Figure 2A) (Chen et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2020; Ozcelik et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020b, 2020a; Zhu et al., 2021). In contrast, smaller bioparticles experience a far weaker radiation force and thus experience little lateral displacement. When the fluid microchannel is oriented at a specific angle (α) to the pressure nodes, larger bioparticles are displaced into the waste outlet while the smaller ones continue to flow through the channel (Figure 2A). We can easily adjust the cutoff sizes for bioparticle separation by changing the applied voltage, which controls the acoustic radiation force. Therefore, in the first module (20 MHz), micrometer-sized plasma components can be removed, such as cell debris and apoptotic bodies (Crescitelli et al., 2013). The second module with a higher frequency (40 MHz) is designed to fractionate submicrometer microvesicles, leaving nanosized AD biomarkers remaining in the final collected samples (Cizas et al., 2010; Ren and Sahara, 2013).

To validate the isolation performance of our acoustofluidic separation chip, we analyzed the bioparticle distributions present in the plasma samples before and after acoustofluidic separation using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). As shown in Figure 2D, untreated plasma bioparticles showed a broad size range from the nanometer scale to larger than micrometer scales. Whereas, the final collected bioparticles processed by the acoustofluidic separation chip showed a relatively narrower size distribution ranging from a few nanometers to around 200 nm (Figure 2E). These results demonstrated the successful isolation and purification of nanosized bioparticles, such as free proteins and exosomes, from human plasma samples. Plasma bioparticles processed with and without acoustofluidics were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to visually evaluate the distribution of bioparticles present before and after acoustofluidic separation. SEM images showed that micrometer- and submicrometer-sized membrane vesicles were clearly observed from plasma before acoustofluidic separation (Figure 2D-inset), whereas only nanosized bioparticles were present in the samples after acoustofluidic separation (Figure 2E-inset). In addition, SEM images from the samples of waste outlets showed that only micrometer- and submicrometer-sized vesicles were present (Figure S2). Western-blot analysis further showed that both AD biomarkers (Aβ42 and tau) are clearly present in the human plasma samples and that there was no noticeable AD biomarker loss before and after isolation (Figure S3). These observations are well in agreement with the NTA results, suggesting the efficient purification of AD biomarkers from plasma. In addition, the isolation process only needs several seconds, making it a promising technique for real-time point-of-care AD diagnosis.

3.2 Acoustofludic engineering of functional ZnO nanoarray

To achieve sensitive and accurate detection of AD biomarkers, robust biosensor materials are needed to improve signal transduction and amplification of the low concentrations of biomarkers present in each sample. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanomaterials have recently received considerable attention as a strong candidate for biosensing due to their excellent electrical properties, such as wide bandgap (3.37 eV), high exciton binding energy (60 meV), and large bulk electron mobility (205–300 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Hao et al., 2019, 2020c; Jin et al., 2018). However, despite their demonstrated potential across several research areas and suitability for advanced electrical detection, controllable fabrication of ZnO nanostructures, especially three-dimensional (3D) structures on specified regions, remain difficult and has rarely been achieved (Dorfman et al., 2006; Hao et al., 2020a). Here, we utilized a PZT plate-assisted acoustofluidic mixing approach for the in-situ patterning of a ZnO nanorod array on an Au electrode surface. This technique differs from conventional batch reactors and passive microfluidic reactors, as the presence of bulk acoustic waves could facilitate greatly enhanced mixing especially on a microscale, improving the efficiency of 3D functional nanostructure fabrication.

The acoustofluidic reactor device consisted of a PZT piezoelectric transducer and a T-type PDMS microchannel containing extruded sharp-edges (Figure 3A), which were fabricated using standard photolithography and soft lithography techniques (Figure S4 and S5). When electrically actuating the PZT transducer, the sharp-edges oscillate and generate a pair of counter-rotating vortices (i.e., acoustic streaming, Figure 3B) for facilitating mass diffusion and mixing. To characterize the fluid flow pattern of the acoustofluidic sharp-edge microreactor, fluorescent microbeads (1 μm) were delivered into the microchannel. As shown in Figure 3C, there was no obvious perturbation of the fluid flow when the PZT transducer was inactivated (i.e., acoustics off), whereas strong acoustic streaming was observed around the tip of the sharp-edges in the presence of acoustic waves. COMSOL simulations were conducted to validate that the acoustic streaming phenomenon only happened when the piezoelectric transducer was activated (Figure S6). These results demonstrate that acoustic streaming induced by PZT-actuated sharp-edges holds great promise as a method to enhance the mixing of reactants by disrupting laminar fluid flow. To further examine the mixing performance of the acoustofluidic sharp-edge microreactor, we injected water into one inlet and rhodamine B solution into the other. As shown in Figure 3D, when the PZT transducer was off, no obvious mixing was observed as indicated by the clear laminar flow pattern. However, when the piezoelectric transducer was activated, the two inlet fluids were rapidly and homogeneously mixed after passing through the first few sharp-edge regions. By analyzing the fluorescent intensity distributions of cross-sectional locations (marked by yellow dash lines in Figure 3D), it was found that there was a clear difference in fluorescent intensities between the two fluids when the PZT transducer was off. Whereas, a relatively uniform distribution of fluorescent intensities was observed across the channel width in the presence of acoustic streaming, when the PZT transducer was on (Figure 3E). In addition, the mixing distance from unmixed to completely mixed regions was less than two millimeters and the required time to completely mix the two fluids was less than one second. These results demonstrate the robust functionality of acoustofluidic sharp-edge microreactors as a tool for rapid and effective mixing of reactants.

To fabricate 3D functional ZnO nanomaterials, we utilized a two-step seeding and growth method. A shown in Figure 3F, a microchamber-based continuous flow setup was employed in-situ to pattern ZnO nanostructures directly onto the desired surface of the central Au electrode through the aid of a PDMS microchamber. The seeding step was carried out by forming ethanol solutions of zinc acetate and sodium hydroxide, and then delivering the combined solutions into the microchamber after mixed by sharp-edge microreactor. Similarly, the growth step was then performed by continuously delivering aqueous solutions of zinc nitrate and hexamethylenetetramine into the microchamber. After the growth process, SEM imaging was performed to visually observe the presence of ZnO nanorods on the surface of the Au electrode (Figure 3F). From the SEM images, it can be clearly seen that a relatively uniform and dense ZnO nanorod array was immobilized onto the substrate surface (Figure 3G–H and S7). The average diameter and height of the ZnO nanorods were 183 nm and 1.2 μm, respectively, with a 30 min growth time. These results demonstrate the efficient mixing of the inlet reactant flows enabled by acoustofluidic sharp-edge microreactor. However, there was no regular nanoarray formed when the PZT transducer was inactivated (Figure S8). In addition, the length of ZnO nanorods can be tuned by adjusting the growth time (Figure 3I). These results highlight the strong potential for acoustofluidic sharp-edge microreactors as a tool for engineering biosensor nanostructures.

3.3 Acoustofluidic fabrication of plasmonic nanoarray for SERS biosensing

Given that the SERS effect occurs when analytes approach the plasmonic nanostructure surface, plasmonic ZnO-Ag nanoarray should significantly improve the sensing performance by providing efficient spatial access to analytes (Xie et al., 2014). In addition, the near-field electromagnetic enhancement effects originating from the metallic nanoparticles when coupled with a metallic film substrate can be further magnified (Chen et al., 2016; Lei et al., 2012; Mock et al., 2008). To accomplish this, we first used the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to simulate the electromagnetic field distribution of the energized nanoarray using different parameters, including varying substrate materials, Ag nanoparticle concentrations, and gap distances between two neighboring nanorods. To simplify the simulation process, spherical Ag particles were attached onto the surface of ZnO nanorods, modeled as cylinders, with a height of 1.2 μm and a diameter of 180 nm. The Ag nanospheres were randomly distributed onto two identical ZnO nanorods. When the ZnO-Ag nanorods were vertically aligned on the glass substrate, a strong electromagnetic field was generated around the plasmonic Ag nanoparticle surface upon excitation (Figure 4A-i). When the glass substrate was replaced with an Au film in the simulation, a larger magnified electromagnetic field strength was observed due to the synergistic coupling effect between Ag nanoparticles and the Au film (Figure 4A-ii) (Chen et al., 2016; Lei et al., 2012; Mock et al., 2008). However, in the absence of Ag nanoparticles, the electromagnetic field enhancement was much weaker, even when the ZnO nanorods were patterned onto the Au film substrate (Figure 4A-iii). Given the fact that the fabricated ZnO-Ag nanorods were tilted at different angles rather than perfectly vertically aligned, the resulting nanoarray can further facilitate the generation of hot-spots. This was replicated in simulations by designing two ZnO-Ag nanorods vertically aligned with a narrower gap distance, a dramatically enhanced electromagnetic field was observed due to the generation of intense hot-spots (Figure 4A-iv). These simulation results suggest that gold is an effective substrate for plasmonic ZnO-Ag nanoarrays to efficiently generate hot-spots, enabling near-field electromagnetic enhancement that can be used for signal amplification in SERS, thus motivating our material selection for electrode fabrication for the SERS active plasmonic nanoarray biosensor in the final device.

To functionalize the ZnO nanoarray for the SERS detection of AD biomarkers, we utilized the acoustic sharp-edge microreactor to perform in-situ deposition of plasmonic silver (Ag) nanoparticles onto the ZnO nanorod array. The deposition of Ag nanoparticles was carried out by using a direct reduction of silver nitrate with sodium borohydride using similar acoustofluidic parameters as the ones used for patterning the initial ZnO nanoarray (Figure 4B). After continuously driving the reactant solutions in the microreactor for 30 min, the surface of Au electrode darkened, visually indicating the immobilization of Ag particles. TEM was then conducted to examine the structural changes of the nanoarray. Before the deposition process, the ZnO nanorods exhibited a relatively smooth surface, whereas a coarse surface was observed after Ag deposition (Figure 4B–C). TEM images showed that nano-sized spherical particles were successfully immobilized onto the surface of ZnO nanorods. The presence of Ag was further confirmed by the use of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Figure S9), showing that nearly 4.7 wt% of elemental Ag was present on the nanorods. Statistical size distributions showed that the Ag particles had an average size of 26 nm and were mainly within a size range between 10 and 40 nm (Figure S9-inset). Additionally, when continuously increasing the reaction time, a nanoflower-like Ag morphology was observed (Figure S10), suggesting the tunability of acoustofluidic sharp-edge microreactors for engineering different plasmonic structures.

To assess the label-free SERS sensing performance of our plasmonic ZnO-Ag nanoarray for detecting AD-relevant biomarkers, we used the Aβ42 peptide as a model biomarker (Figure S11). Aβ42 peptide is a well-established, high-profile biomarker that is associated with the onset and progression of AD. SERS spectra of Aβ42 peptide were collected using a Raman spectroscope after the samples were introduced into the microchamber containing the SERS biosensor. As shown in Figure S12, after an aqueous solution of 100 nM Aβ42 peptides was delivered to the plasmonic ZnO-Ag nanoarray biosensor (green line), with sharp peaks ranging from 400 to 1400 cm−1 clearly observed. A plasmonic ZnO-Ag nanoarray biosensor was fabricated on glass as a control, and tested using an aqueous solution of 100 nM Aβ42 peptides for comparison. Raman spectra collected from the glass substrate plasmonic ZnO-Ag nanoarray showed relatively low signal intensity (blue line), which is in good agreement with the FDTD simulation results (Figure 4A). The major peaks observed from the SERS spectra were located at 442 cm−1 (Gly), 491 cm−1 (Met), 569 cm−1 (C-C), 677 cm−1 (Tyr), 718 cm−1 (Met), 776 cm−1 (Ala), 793 cm−1 (Tyr), 842 cm−1 (Tyr), 954 cm−1 (C-C), 1001 cm−1 (Lys, Asn), 1069 cm−1 (Lys, Arg, Gln, Asn), 1139 cm−1 (Val, Ile), 1163 cm−1 (Val, Ile), 1187 cm−1 (Phe, Tyr), 1216 cm−1 (Phe, Tyr), 1252 cm−1 (Amide), 1311 cm−1 (Amide), and 1355 cm−1 (C-C, C-H) (Chou et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2003; Podstawka et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2020). It should be noted that these spectral peaks were clearly observable in concentrations of Aβ42 was down to 1 pM in the ZnO-Ag nanoarray on Au electrodes (Figure S12-red line). The limit of detection (LOD, signal-to-noise ratio=3) of the biosensor was determined to be 120 fM, suggesting its superior performance for label-free AD diagnosis in comparison to other SERS sensors (Table S1) (Choi et al., 2012; Chou et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2020, 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). The enhancement factor of the SERS substrate was calculated to be ~7.5×105 (see calculation details in the supplementary materials). Furthermore, there were no distinguishable SERS peaks present in the collected spectra of the 100 nM Aβ42 peptide samples when using pure ZnO nanoarrays, which has an enhancement factor on the order of 102 (Figure S12-black line), which further validates the FDTD analysis.

3.4 SERS analysis of clinical plasma samples

To assess the feasibility of our acoustofluidics-enabled plasmonic ZnO-Ag nanoarray biosensor in processing clinical samples for AD diagnostics, we examined the plasma samples of 10 AD patients and 7 healthy controls with similar ages and physiological conditions (IRB number: Pro00085997). Plasma samples were analyzed with Raman spectroscopy before and after acoustofluidic separation to investigate the effects that acoustofluidic isolation had on spectral detection of AD-relevant biomarkers. As shown in Figure 4D, before acoustofluidic separation, the plasma sample showed a major spectral band in the 1300–1400 cm−1 region, which was attributed to lipids and phospholipids present in the sample prior to acoustofluidic separation (Dong et al., 2003; Hao et al., 2020a; Lee et al., 2015). In contrast, the isolated plasma sample exhibited many sharp spectral peaks ranging from 400 to 1400 cm−1. These results highlight the gain in performance of the acoustofluidic separation chip due to the improved fingerprint signals the SERS active biosensor generates.

To investigate the spectral differences between healthy control and AD groups, SERS spectra were randomly collected at five different regions from each sample. The spectra were then averaged to compare the differences in the peak locations and intensities (Carlomagno et al., 2020; Stefancu et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2018). As shown in Figure S13, spectral peaks from both groups show similar peak wavenumbers, but vary significantly in intensities. To better compare the SERS spectral intensities between healthy controls and AD patients, difference spectra matrices were created by subtracting the spectra of healthy controls from the spectra of AD patients. Positive bands in the resulting average difference spectrum are interpreted as being more abundant in healthy control samples, whereas negative bands are more abundant in AD patient samples (Carlomagno et al., 2020; Cervo et al., 2015; Fălămaș et al., 2020; Fornasaro et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2015). The main differences in terms of peak intensities were located at 417, 999, ~1150, ~1250, and 1290 cm−1 (Figure 4E). These characteristic peaks were found to be attributed to xanthine (417 cm−1) (Premasiri et al., 2016), uric acid (999 cm−1 and ~1250 cm−1) (Goodall et al., 2013), and ascorbic acid (~1150 and 1290 cm−1) (Li et al., 2016). Xanthine and uric acid are mainly purine metabolites involved in the salvage pathway in the brain (Carlomagno et al., 2020; Stefancu et al., 2019), while ascorbic acid is an antioxidant present in human brain that is known to be correlated with the rate of cognitive decline in AD patients (Bowman et al., 2009). Loss of cognitive function and dementia have been shown as a result of these changes (Bowman et al., 2009; Carlomagno et al., 2020; Premasiri et al., 2016), which was reflected in the Raman spectra. Additionally, differences in the 600–700 cm−1 spectral region from the subtracted spectra, further suggesting the possibility of reduced levels of Aβ42 in the AD group (Chou et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2020). These results demonstrate Raman spectral analysis as a powerful tool for rapidly identifying key biochemical differences in human blood plasma between healthy control and AD groups, and establishes feasibility for the technique as a label-free strategy for point-of-care testing.

To statistically analyze spectral differences between healthy control and AD groups, we employed linear discriminant analysis to discriminate and to classify spectra between healthy control and AD groups (Avram et al., 2020; Carlomagno et al., 2020; Stefancu et al., 2019). The normalized spectra were first transformed using principal component analysis, which is an unsupervised multivariate technique to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the data variability (Avram et al., 2020; Carlomagno et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2018). The principal components were then applied to obtain the canonical variable for comparison using a Mann-Whitney U test (Figure 4F). Significant difference (P&lt;0.05) between healthy control and AD groups suggests that the SERS active biosensor is capable of distinguishing between healthy control and AD spectra using Aβ42 as a spectral biomarker.

3.5 Development and characterization of ZnO-antibody nanoarray for electrochemical biosensing

To achieve multimodal sensing, an electrochemical immunosensor was also integrated into the ZnO nanoarray by functionalizing pure ZnO nanorods with antibodies specific for key AD biomarkers (Figure 5A). The functionalization process was firstly carried out by attaching N,N’-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) molecules to the array to activate the nanorod surfaces (Hao et al., 2020b; Letchumanan et al., 2019). The activated nanorods were then conjugated with streptavidin via their primary amine groups, followed by conjugation of biotinylated antibodies, specifically anti-Aβ42 and anti-tau. To suppress non-specific protein adsorption, BSA was employed to block the remaining reactive sites (Carneiro et al., 2017; Islam et al., 2017; Park et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2018). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques were used to monitor the current changes in the presence of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− as the electroactive indicator.

Due to their superior features, such as their large surface-to-volume ratio, fast electron transfer rate, and high isoelectric point, ZnO nanostructures hold great promise as a material for electrochemical biosensing applications (Hao et al., 2020c; Lei et al., 2011; Pradhan et al., 2010). To characterize the performance of our in-situ patterned ZnO electrochemical immunosensor, we first compared the CV profiles of bare Au and Au-ZnO electrodes using an aqueous solution of 1 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] and K4[Fe(CN)6] in 0.1 M KCl. As shown in Figure 5B, The CV response of both bare Au and Au-ZnO electrodes showed typical sigmoidal redox peaks at different scale rates (5, 20, 60, 100, 150, 200 mV/s). However, the redox peaks of Au-ZnO were significantly larger than those obtained from the bare Au device, suggesting a higher effective surface area associated with the in-situ patterning of the ZnO nanoarray onto the Au electrode. In addition, the distance between the redox peaks did not show any obvious changes as the scan rate increased, indicating that the introduction of the ZnO nanoarray did not interfere with the electrochemical reversibility of Au electrodes (Li et al., 2015; Park et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2011). It was further observed that the oxidation/reduction peak currents (ip) of CV were proportional to the square root of the scan rates for both devices (Figure S14), suggesting a diffusion-limited process (Park et al., 2014; Sabaté del Río et al., 2019). To quantitatively assess the difference in effective surface area between bare Au and Au-ZnO electrodes, we used the Randles-Sevcik equation (Park et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2011): ip=(2.69×105)n3/2D1/2CAv1/2

where ip, n, D, C, A, and ν are the reduction peak current, the transferred electron numbers for the redox reaction, the diffusion coefficient, the molar concentration of ferricyanide, the electroactive surface area, and the scan rate, respectively. After carrying out CV at different scan rates, the effective surface areas of the electrode devices were determined using the slope obtained from a linear regression model. The calculated average electroactive surface area of the Au-ZnO electrode was 3.1 times higher than that of bare Au electrode. Although the increase in effective surface area was lower than the theoretical value in which the entire surface area of the ZnO nanorods was utilized in the electrochemical reaction, the abundance of accessible sites and good electrical conductivity allow the sensitive detection of analytes. To effectively utilize the high surface area of ZnO nanorods, the conductivity of ZnO can be improved by using metal doping (Jin et al., 2020). These results demonstrate that the in-situ patterning of ZnO nanoarrays onto Au electrodes can successfully enhance the electrochemical current response and thereby improve the detection sensitivity.

To characterize the detection performance of the biosensor, we used Aβ42 antibody-conjugated nanorods as a proof-of-concept AD diagnostic test using the protocol described in Figure 5A. The stepwise conjugation of streptavidin, Aβ42 antibody, and BSA onto the ZnO nanoarray modified Au electrode was confirmed by monitoring the DPV current generated from the [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− system. Stepwise addition of the immunoassay components onto the electrode surface blocked the redox system of the [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− electrolyte solution, and thus in turn attenuated the DPV current signals (Islam et al., 2017). As shown in Figure S15, the decrease of current signals accompanying the stepwise addition of each individual component confirmed the successful fabrication of an Aβ42-conjugated electrochemical immunosensor. To determine the sensitivity of the electrochemical immunosensor, we measured the DPV response of PBS containing Aβ42 at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 100 pg/mL (Figure 5C). The relative changes of peak currents linearly increased with increasing concentrations of Aβ42 (Figure 5D) and the limit-of-detection was found to be 62.3 fg/mL, demonstrating a lower limit-of-detection than other detection platforms (Table S2).

In addition, the reproducibility of the electrochemical immunosensor response was also evaluated. After fabricating eight duplicates of the device under the same experimental conditions, Aβ42 was then added and the DPV response was measured in the presence of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−. As shown in Figure S16, the changes of the peak currents were nearly constant for the devices before and after the addition of Aβ42, suggesting excellent reproducibility of the electrochemical immunosensor from batch to batch.

3.6 Electrochemical analysis of clinical plasma samples

To further investigate the capability of the electrochemical immunosensor to diagnose AD, we tested the biosensor response using anti-Aβ42- and anti-tau-conjugated nanoarrays to function as Aβ42 and tau biosensors. The acoustofluidic separation unit was used to purify plasma samples from healthy control and AD groups prior to introducing the samples into the electrochemical immunosensor unit. Due to the high specificity of the selected biomarkers (Aβ42 and tau) for diagnosing AD (Kim et al., 2020), our electrochemical immunosensor was expected to differentiate AD patients from healthy controls. After the purified plasma samples were introduced to the antibody-conjugated ZnO nanoarray, increases in peak currents were observed that corresponded to increases in the levels of target biomarkers present in the plasma samples (Figure 5D and S17). As shown in Figure S18, the peak current changes of the healthy control samples were higher on average than that of the AD sample using Aβ42 biosensors, suggesting lower concentrations of Aβ42 present in AD than in healthy samples; while the peak currents of AD samples changed to a larger degree than that of healthy control sample using tau biosensors, suggesting higher concentrations of tau present in AD than that in healthy samples. To analyze the statistical differences between healthy control and AD groups, each sample was recorded using DPV in three independent measurements, and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to determine the statistical significance of changes in biomarker levels between healthy control and AD affected patients. As shown in Figure 5E, the average Aβ42 levels in healthy control plasma samples were 3.2 times higher than those in AD (P&lt;0.01). In addition, the estimated average concentration of tau protein in healthy control plasma samples was 2.4 times lower than those in AD (P&lt;0.05, Figure 5F). The measured plasma levels of Aβ42 and tau not only are comparable to the reported values in clinical studies (Feinkohl et al., 2020; Janelidze et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2020; Lue et al., 2017; Razzino et al., 2020), but are also in agreement with the reductions of Aβ peptides and elevations of tau proteins typically observed in AD affected patients.

To characterize the diagnostic performance of our electrochemical immunosensor for discriminating AD patients from healthy individuals, we carried out receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. The ROC analysis curve is a standard quantitative statistical tool and has been widely used in pharmacology, clinical chemistry, and physiology for describing and comparing the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of diagnostic tests (de Oliveira et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020). In ROC curves, the sensitivity was plotted against 1-specificity for different cutoff values. A good diagnostic test should have low false-positive and false-negative rates (i.e., ~100% sensitivity and specificity). The area under the curve (AUC) quantifies the overall probability of the diagnostic tests. The closer the AUC is to 1.0, the better the test is, which means that better diagnostic tests would have larger AUC values. As shown in Figure 5G, analysis of ROC curves demonstrated that Aβ42 electrochemical immunosensor achieved 90.0% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity. In contrast, tau biosensor differentiated AD patients from healthy controls with 71.4% sensitivity and 70.0% specificity. The AUC values of Aβ42 and tau immunosensors were 0.97 and 0.84, respectively. These results indicated that our electrochemical immunosensor, especially anti-Aβ42-functionalized ones, can be successfully applied for distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls with good sensitivity and specificity.

4. Conclusions

In summary, we have developed an acoustofluidic multimodal sensing platform for isolating and detecting AD biomarkers in human blood plasma for use in clinical AD diagnostics. Further, we have also shown that acoustofluidics is a robust tool capable of purifying biofluid samples to obtain nanosized bioparticles of interest and can be used as an in-situ fabrication method for ZnO nanoarrays to form multimodal biosensors for purified biomarker samples in an efficient, reproducible manner. The acoustofluidic separation chip successfully isolated samples within several seconds. The acoustofluidic sharp-edge microreactor facilitated the formation of the ZnO nanoarrays used for both label-free SERS and electrochemical immunosensor. Because of the improved surface area, we modified Au electrodes with ZnO nanorods significantly improved the biochemical detection of AD-related biomarkers present in human blood plasma compared to bare Au electrodes. Additionally, acoustofluidic isolation of the plasma samples efficiently removed non-specific bioparticles, improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the ZnO nanoarray SERS biosensor. Multivariate linear discriminant analysis revealed a significant statistical difference between the Raman spectra collected from healthy control and AD groups. Similarly, acoustofluidic isolation of AD biomarkers also significantly improved the performance of the electrochemical immunosensor. The high sensitivity achieved with these acoustofluidics-enabled biosensors allows for easy classification between healthy and AD-affected patients. ROC analysis further validated excellent specificities and sensitivities achieved by our device. These findings highlight the potential of acoustofluidics for sample purification and biosensor development.
