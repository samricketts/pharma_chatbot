INTRODUCTION

The prevalence, mortality and healthcare impact of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are unknown for Alaska Native and American Indian (ANAI) people.

METHODS

We conducted a cohort study of electronic health record data that compared healthcare service utilization in patients with and without an ADRD diagnosis. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression with robust standard errors was used to estimate utilization rates.

RESULTS

Compared to patients without ADRD, utilization rates were similar before but higher after ADRD diagnosis. For those with diagnosed ADRD, utilization increased gradually over time with sharp upward change during the year of diagnosis.

DISCUSSION

This is the only study quantifying changes in healthcare service utilization before and after ADRD diagnosis among ANAI people, which is crucial for tailoring geriatric care for ANAI populations.

1. Background

In 2018, the number of people in the United States suffering from Alzheimer’s disease was estimated to be 5.7 million and expected to increase to 14 million by 2050 [1–3]. The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) has been studied in white, Hispanic, and African-American groups, but much less so among Alaska Native and American Indian (ANAI) people. Smaller, regional studies have included ANAI people, but knowledge is still limited because participant numbers were small and results mixed [4–9]. Several of these studies reported the prevalence of ADRD or mortality among ANAI people to be the same as or less than non-Native groups [6–9]. More recently, Mayeda et al. found people that self-report ANAI race/ethnicity had the second highest dementia incidence compared to five other racial and ethnic groups from 2000–2013 [4], underscoring the need for more careful inquiry.

Health factors linked to increased risk of ADRD are common in the ANAI population [10 11]. According to 2016 estimates in Alaska approximately 37% of Alaska Natives (AN) smoked[12]; 21% reported binge drinking [13]; 38% were obese [14]; 35% had diagnosed hypertension [15]; almost 10% had diabetes [16]. Age, of course, is most commonly associated with developing ADRD [17]. Consistent with national predictions, ANAI communities are aging and life expectancy is increasing, though less rapidly than for non-Hispanic whites [18]. As the number of older ANAI adults grows, so will the need for effective methods to detect and manage ADRD, and to provide for the needs not just of persons diagnosed with ADRD, but for family members who care for them [19].

Healthcare service utilization and expenditure increase substantially for patients with ADRD [20–23]. Such increases are linked to injuries, falls, or fractures; chronic manifestations of disease such as uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and weight loss; and increased mortality [24–27]. Geldmacher et al. showed that service utilization and expenditure is higher for ADRD patients in the year prior to their diagnosis compared to matched controls: the increase was mostly in outpatient services [28]. Another study revealed that home-health and skilled nursing are used more often by ADRD patients in the year prior to diagnosis compared to matched controls [29]. Research has also compared utilization after ADRD diagnosis and observed that ADRD patients had increased service utilization after diagnosis compared to matched controls [30 31]. These and other healthcare service utilization changes are unknown for ANAI populations and could be different than other populations, perhaps attributable to tribal health organization structures, cultural interpretations of cognitive changes, or community approaches to caring for older ANAI adults [5 32–36].

This article describes characteristics of ANAI people with diagnosed ADRD and identifies patterns of service utilization within a tribal health organization before and after ADRD diagnosis and compared to patients without ADRD. ANAI specific health services research is sorely needed due to the widespread presence of health factors that increase ADRD risk [10 11] and the growing number of older ANAI adults [18 37]. A better understanding of the impact of ADRD on healthcare organizations serving ANAI people promises to improve early detection and management, with possible reductions in patient and family burden.

2. Methods

2.1 Design

This article reports a cohort study of patients represented in a clinical dataset obtained from electronic health records (EHR) from October 2011 until March 2017 documenting services provided by a major tribal health organization in urban Alaska.

2.2 Setting

Southcentral Foundation is part of a tribally owned and operated, closed healthcare system in Alaska [38]. The population-based healthcare system includes primary care clinics, specialty clinics, and in-patient hospital services. Southcentral Foundation operates the primary care clinics under a model wherein patients have a care team of interdisciplinary healthcare professionals including physicians, nurses, and behavioral health consultants among others [39]. Southcentral Foundation serves over 65,000 ANAI people living in urban and rural communities in southcentral Alaska [38 39].

Cerner® and Tier® are the two EHR databases at Southcentral Foundation [40 41]. Cerner contains all medical service data; Tier contains the behavioral health data. These EHRs have been in place since October 2011, which framed data selection for this study.

2.3 Sample and ADRD Diagnosis Definition

The study sample was drawn from de-identified secondary EHR data (Figure 1). It included ANAI patients with geographical limitations imposed to minimize confounding by access to services. Access in rural villages is limited to care provided by health aides or flights to urban healthcare settings, therefore patterns of utilization can be different in these settings and warrant separate study. Specifically, the sample was from Anchorage and surrounding towns within 50 miles; more distant rural locations were excluded. Patients were 45 years old or older and had to be active in the Southcentral Foundation healthcare system. Patients with at least two ADRD diagnoses identified by ICD-9 (290.xx, 294.xx, 331.xx) or ICD-10 (F01-F06, G30-G31) codes were defined as meeting our criteria for diagnosed ADRD. A second diagnosis was required to exclude people with a single diagnosis of a vague condition like presenile dementia uncomplicated (290.1), unspecified senile psychotic condition (290.9), or other persistent mental disorders due to conditions classified elsewhere (294.8). The first ADRD diagnosis for each person beginning October 2011 was defined as the date of diagnosis for ANAI adults with ADRD.

Using the same EHR, patients with diagnosed ADRD were matched with their counterparts without ADRD of the same gender and age in decades who also visited the healthcare system in the same calendar year as those with ADRD diagnoses. Frequency matching was used to match up to three randomly selected patients without ADRD to improve power.

2.4 Covariates

Data were extracted from the EHR using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Demographic factors were gender and age. Clinical factors included Medicare or Medicaid status between 2011 and 2017; ever having a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [42]; clinical documentation of an advanced directive; most recent BMI; a prescription for donepezil, galantamine, memantine, rivastigmine; and health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, stroke, vascular dementia, or behavioral health conditions like depression, anxiety, mood disorders, or substance disorders.

2.5 Outcomes

Service utilization was operationalized in terms of number of visits to primary care clinics; emergency department or urgent care facilities; inpatient hospital stays; behavioral health consultants; and home health services. Emergency department and urgent care visits were aggregated because Southcentral Foundation has a triage system at the emergency front desk that directs patients to the most appropriate facility for their presenting condition. Count of visits was by year from 2011 to 2017.

2.6 Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics of demographic, clinical, and service utilization variables were calculated as frequency and percent. Data for inferential analyses were structured in long format with multiple yearly observations for each person from years 2011 up to 2017 unless the year of death or the year the patient left the health organization was earlier. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to examine the association between yearly service utilization and ADRD status because the outcome variables were zero-inflated and overdispersed. Model fit statistics such as Akaike’s Information Criteria showed large improvement for negative binomial compared to Poisson models and modest improvement for zero-inflated compared to non-inflated models (Supplementary Table). Logistic regression with the same independent variables as the negative binomial model was used to model the process for excess zeroes. We used generalized estimating equations regression with robust standard error estimation because our focus was population-averaged effects rather than within-subject correlation or the individual-specific time trend [43 44]. Robust estimation calculates appropriate standard errors and confidence intervals when the data are correlated. Generalized estimating equations also accounted for differing lengths of study follow-up by allowing multiple yearly observations per person.

ADRD status was modeled using dummy variables; patients before ADRD diagnosis, patients after ADRD diagnosis, and patients without ADRD were the reference group. Models were adjusted for age, gender, and an indicator for whether the patient died during the observation period. Age was modeled as a time-varying covariate. Although we sought to match ADRD and non-ADRD patients on age and gender so statistical adjustment for these variables would be unnecessary, too few older non-ADRD patients were available for analysis. Therefore, we included age and gender as covariates in the regression models to adjust for residual confounding. All service use during the year of ADRD diagnosis was considered post-diagnosis utilization regardless of diagnosis date. Models included an offset to adjust for partial years of observation. Results are presented as the average adjusted prediction for yearly service utilization rate and average marginal rate differences between the ADRD groups, with 95% confidence intervals [45 46].

To examine the service utilization pattern before and after diagnosis among patients with ADRD, we estimated service use during the calendar year of diagnosis and each calendar year before and after diagnosis. Models were similar to those described above, with number of years since ADRD diagnosis modeled using dummy variables. Results are presented in figures showing the average adjusted prediction for yearly service utilization rate according to number of years before or after ADRD diagnosis. All analyses were conducted using Stata 15.1 [47].

2.7 Human Subject Protections

This study was deemed a quality assurance and quality improvement project by Southcentral Foundation research review, rendering it exempt from Institutional Review Board review [48].

3. Results

A cohort of 509 ANAI patients with diagnosed ADRD and 1082 without ADRD was included in the analysis. Patients with diagnosed ADRD were followed, on average, for 4.7 years (1.9 years before ADRD and 2.8 years after ADRD diagnosis); those without ADRD were followed for an average of 5.0 years. Slightly more than half of the patients were female (56% with ADRD, 55% without) (Table 1). On average patients with ADRD were older than those without ADRD in 2011 (mean = 72 vs. 68 years). Patients with ADRD more often had greater Medicare and/or Medicaid coverage, lower BMI, and higher prevalence of some health conditions. People with ADRD had a higher prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and vascular dementia; those without ADRD had higher prevalence of high cholesterol. Very few patients either with or without ADRD had diagnosed behavioral health conditions (1–2%). Of patients with ADRD, 90 (18%) had a prescription for ADRD medication; donepezil was the most common prescription. Overall, very few patients had an advanced directive or documentation of a mini-mental state exam.

Compared to patients without ADRD, those with diagnosed ADRD had more yearly visits to all health services (Table 1). In the primary care clinics, 54% of patients with ADRD had 4 or more visits/year compared to 36% of those without. In the emergency department and urgent care, 15% of patients with ADRD and 6% without had 3 or more visits/year. Inpatient hospitalization was also more frequent among patients with ADRD (67% vs. 31% had at least 1 hospitalization) with similar trends in visits to a behavioral health consultant and home health.

Average yearly service utilization rates for people with an ADRD diagnosis (both before and after diagnosis) and without ADRD are presented in Table 2. Rates were less than one visit per year for all services except primary care. The yearly rate for primary care before ADRD diagnosis was 3.21 (95% CI= 2.76–3.65) which was slightly lower than the yearly rate for those without ADRD (rate=3.68, 95% CI= 3.41–3.94). After diagnosis, the yearly rate increased to 5.43 (95% CI= 4.86–6.01). The excess zeroes in the zero-inflated model were mainly observed in people without an ADRD diagnosis.

Compared to those without an ADRD diagnosis, ADRD patients had similar utilization rates for most healthcare services before ADRD diagnosis (Table 3). The exception was in the emergency department or urgent care where people with ADRD had higher rates of utilization prior to ADRD diagnosis (rate difference= 0.36, 95% CI= 0.20, 0.52). In contrast, ADRD patients after diagnosis had higher utilization rates for all healthcare services compared to those without an ADRD diagnosis. The smallest difference in yearly utilization rate between ADRD patients after diagnosis and patients without ADRD was for home health visits (difference= 0.11, 95% CI= 0.05, 0.17) while the largest difference was for primary care visits (difference= 1.76, 95% CI= 1.12, 2.39).

We saw an increase in all service utilization rates from before to after ADRD diagnosis (Table 3). The smallest yearly increase after diagnosis was for home health visits (difference= 0.12, 95% CI= 0.07, 0.18) while the largest increase was for primary care visits (difference= 2.22, 95% CI= 1.60, 2.85). There was a moderate increase after compared to before ADRD diagnosis for emergency department and urgent care utilization, inpatient hospitalization, and behavioral health visits.

Service utilization according to time since ADRD diagnosis exhibited an overall gradual increase or consistent use in the years prior to diagnosis, a sharp increase during the year of diagnosis, and a decrease in use after diagnosis to rates that remained elevated compared to before diagnosis (Figures 2 and 3). Exceptions to this pattern included primary care, in which service use increased steadily both before and after ADRD diagnosis (Figure 2) and emergency department or urgent care where service use increased in the years preceding diagnosis (Figure 3).

4. Discussion

ADRD is under-studied in the ANAI population, yet important because of the high prevalence of related risk factors. Alaska has the fastest growing population of people 65 years and older compared to any other state; moreover, ANAI people make up 20% of the Alaska’s population [18]. Therefore, healthcare systems will need to tailor their services in anticipation of an increase in the number of patients suffering from ADRD.

This is the first study to compare healthcare utilization among ANAI people diagnosed with ADRD to gender- and aged-matched controls absent this diagnosis. Certain characteristics were more frequent among the former, notably, lower BMI and higher prevalence of many comorbidities. Before diagnosis, only emergency department and urgent care visits were much more frequent for patients with ADRD compared to those without. After diagnosis, all service utilization rates were higher for patients with ADRD. We calculated changes in rates of service utilization in the years before and after diagnosis to determine if these increases corresponded to disease progression. There was a gradual increase in number of visits per year before diagnosis, a sharp increase during the year of diagnosis, and continued elevation of number of visits in the years after diagnosis for all services.

In this study sample, nearly a fourth of patients with diagnosed ADRD were less than 65 years old compared to less than a tenth of Medicaid patients with ADRD in Alaska [49]. Vascular risk factors are common in the ANAI population[10 15 16], which could increase the prevalence of ADRD among those less that 65 years old. Younger onset of ADRD can impact families, caregivers, and the healthcare system. We observed increases in utilization across all service types. Increased utilization of the emergency department is especially problematic, but common because of the complexity of co-morbidities as age increases. In this light, efforts for early ADRD detection targeted in frequently used services and improvements in outpatient services to prevent emergency department usage and inpatient hospitalization become a high priority for structuring appropriate care.

With respect to the current literature on service utilization among other populations, we found similar healthcare service utilization prior to diagnosis between patients with ADRD and those without [28 30]. Consistent with other studies, increased utilization was evident after ADRD diagnosis, though our study did not find the substantial increase in home health care that others did [30]. Most home health services are provided outside Southcentral Foundation’s healthcare system and not captured in our data, which may explain this difference.

The limitations of this study include identifying ADRD by ICD-9 codes, which does not include patients with ADRD who have not been diagnosed due to limited access to healthcare services, patient and family lack of awareness, or atypical presentation of the disease. We also did not have a measure of the severity of the disease and therefore could not adjust for it when analyzing rates of service utilization. Due to limitations in the data, all service use during the year of ADRD diagnosis was considered post-diagnosis utilization regardless of diagnosis date. Service utilization may be higher preceding the diagnosis because of the referrals and work up to confirm a diagnosis, and thus should not be considered normal rates of utilization before ADRD diagnosis. The use of EHR data limited our ability to adjust for potential confounders such as educational attainment and comorbid conditions synchronized with the timing of ADRD diagnosis. Patients with ADRD were, on average, older than those without ADRD and there may be residual confounding due to age. Predicted differences in service utilization may have been different if proper adjustment for these covariates was possible. Other limitations in these data have to do with capturing complete service utilization counts. Southcentral Foundation provided limited home health services during the study period, so patients may have turned to outside organizations for home health services; service utilization outside of the Southcentral Foundation healthcare system was not included. Nevertheless, this robust healthcare system and sophisticated EHR allowed us to conduct the first assessment of ADRD among ANAI patients.

The National Alzheimer’s Project Act prioritizes improved care for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and advocates for decreases in disparities for ethnic and racial minority populations at higher risk for Alzheimer’s disease [50]. This study reaffirms the need to attend to connecting ADRD patients to primary care and support services. It also highlights higher utilization in the emergency department before diagnosis, suggesting early detection interventions. These insights can enable healthcare systems to better prepare for the emerging needs of the older adult population and hold promise for improving the quality of life among those who suffer from ADRD. Future studies among ANAI people with diagnosed ADRD are needed to understand the implications of their service utilization for the structure and financing of related care.

Research In Context

Systematic Review

The authors reviewed the literature using PubMed. Changes in service utilization have been studied over the course of Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, but not specific to Alaska Native and American Indian (ANAI) people. We point to reports of prior service utilization together with limited inquiry into cognition or related factors among ANAI people.

Interpretation

Our findings led to new insights into how ANAI people with diagnosed ADRD use tribal healthcare services in an urban setting. These results are consistent with other racial and ethnic populations.

Future Directions

A better understanding of healthcare utilization is needed. Our research suggests how healthcare systems can improve care of older ANAI adults. Examples of future research revolve around the Native understanding of cognitive decline, healthcare systems and community support for older adults, the best path of referral services, and which healthcare services can address higher utilization rates.
