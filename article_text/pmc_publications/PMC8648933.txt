Background:

This study examined the risk of mortality in older adults with newly detected cognitive impairment or dementia.

Methods:

Data from the Australian cohort of the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial were examined. The ASPREE clinical trial compared daily low-dose aspirin to a placebo and involved 16,703 individuals aged 70 years and over, who were without major cognitive impairment, physical disability, or cardiovascular disease at recruitment. During the trial, evidence of cognitive impairment, based on cognitive testing and medical record information, triggered dementia adjudication of participants using DSM-IV criteria. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare mortality rates across the dementia, trigger-only, and no-trigger groups.

Results:

Over a median 4.7-year follow-up period, 806 participants triggered dementia adjudication, with 485 (60.2%) judged to have dementia. Following recruitment, mortality risks were 32.9, 33.6, and 10.8 events per 1000 person-years in the dementia, trigger-no-dementia, and no-trigger groups, respectively. In the fully adjusted model, mortality risks remained higher in the dementia and trigger-no-dementia groups, with hazard ratios of 1.7 (95% CI: 1.3–2.1) and 1.9 (95% CI: 1.5–2.6), respectively. There was no discernible difference between the dementia and trigger-no-dementia groups in mortality rates following recruitment, or following a dementia trigger. These two groups were more likely to die from sepsis, respiratory disease, and dementia, but less likely to die from cancer than the no-trigger group, χ2 = 161.5, p &lt; 0.001.

Conclusion:

ASPREE participants who triggered for a dementia evaluation experienced a substantially higher mortality rate than those who remained cognitively intact. The increase was indistinguishable among persons who met DSM-IV criteria for dementia vs. those who triggered for a dementia evaluation but failed to meet DSM-IV criteria. Future work should investigate whether earlier detection of cognitive decline can be used to identify and prevent early mortality.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Mild cognitive impairment and dementia are associated with high mortality rates,1–5 with increasing severity of impairment associated with higher mortality. 5–10 The resulting loss in years of life varies with gender, age of onset, and dementia type and severity of cognitive impairment.11

As opposed to studies based on prevalent cases or drawn from individuals seeking services in the healthcare setting, studies using incident cases identified from the community which often include individuals in the general population with early cognitive, helps to better understand how mortality changes as cognitive impairment progresses.5,10 Using this approach, we examined the mortality rates and causes of death among community-dwelling older people recruited for the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial who developed cognitive impairment, including dementia, during the trial.

METHODS

Data were derived from the Australian cohort of the ASPREE trial, a primary intervention trial of low-dose aspirin among community-dwelling older people without dementia, physical disability, or cardiovascular disease and with a Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) score of more than 77 at enrollment.12 Full details have been reported previously.12–14 The Australian cohort included 16,703 participants aged 70 years or more at enrollment, recruited via their primary care physicians, and followed prospectively for an average of 4.7 years through quarterly telephone contact and annual in-person clinical assessments.12 ASPREE was a registered clinical trial12 and was approved by Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee.

Dementia and death

Over the follow-up period, participants triggered for dementia adjudication if (1) they scored less than 78, or had a drop of more than 10 points from the 5-year long term predicted score on the 3MS, (2) they reported memory or cognitive problems to a specialist, or (3) their medical records included a clinician’s diagnosis of dementia or prescription of a cholinesterase inhibitors.15 Self-reported memory or cognitive problems and a 3MS score less than 78 were the most common dementia triggers.15

Follow-up for dementia triggers comprised: (1) in most cases, additional cognitive and functional testing (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale—Cognitive subscale, Color Trails, and the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living scale) 6 weeks after the trigger timepoint to minimize the possibility of delirium affecting cognitive performance, and (2) collection of relevant documentation (e.g., cognitive assessments, dementia screening pathology, brain imaging) from clinicians, hospitals, and families.15

A binational and multidisciplinary committee adjudicated incident dementia using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria, requiring evidence of memory impairment plus at least one of the following: aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or executive dysfunction.16 Additionally, the cognitive impairment must have caused social and occupational dysfunction and represented a decline from a previously higher functioning level.16

Participants were categorized as (1) triggered and met DSM-IV criteria for dementia (i.e., the dementia group), (2) triggered, but did not meet the dementia criteria (i.e., the trigger-no-dementia group), or (3) did not trigger (i.e., the no-trigger group).

Death was identified through routine trial activities and confirmed via data linkage with the National Death Index.13 After a death was identified, the underlying cause, defined as the single disease most likely to have initiated the trajectory toward death, was determined by two experts using information from healthcare providers, death certificates, and, where available, autopsy.13 Where relevant records were unavailable, the underlying cause was based on the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes recorded on the death certificate, or by reports in the National Death Index.13

Data analyses

All statistical analyses were performed in R (Version 3.6.3). For baseline sample characteristics and cause of death, chi-square statistics were used to examine differences across the three groups. Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the risk of mortality adjusted for differences in baseline prognostic factors. These included treatment status, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, alcohol use, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, frailty, body-mass index (BMI), and cancer history (Table 1). These variables were selected based on previously reported predictors of mortality among older people.14 Age, sex, and risk factors with p &lt; 0.1 in univariate models were included in multivariate analyses. Schoenfeld residual tests were used to evaluate the proportional hazard assumptions.

RESULTS

Of 806 participants triggered for dementia adjudication during the median 4.7-year follow-up period, 485 (60.2%) were adjudicated as meeting the DSM-IV dementia criteria and 321 (39.8%) did not. The latter group included 56 (17.4%) participants with insufficient information to determine whether DSM-IV criteria were met.

At baseline, those in the dementia group were older and frailer, and less likely to be female, overweight or consume alcohol than those in the trigger-no-dementia and no-trigger groups. Those in the trigger-no-dementia-group were most likely to have diabetes (Table 1).

Dementia triggers were more likely to occur 2 years postenrollment. At the time of dementia trigger, participants subsequently adjudicated with dementia were older than those in the trigger-no-dementia group (Table S1).

Mortality rate

Deaths were most likely to have occurred 3 years or more after enrollment (Figure 1). The rates of all-cause death were 32.9, 33.6, and 10.8 events per 1000 person-years in the dementia, trigger-no-dementia, and no-trigger groups, respectively. The unadjusted Cox model found that mortality risks were higher in the dementia and trigger-no-dementia groups, with hazard ratios (HR) of 2.8 (95% CI: 2.3–3.6) and 3.0 (95% CI: 2.3–4.0), respectively, both p &lt; 0.001. Higher mortality risks in the two groups persisted after controlling for baseline prognostic factors, with HR of 1.7 (95% CI: 1.3–2.1) and 1.9 (95% CI: 1.5–2.6) for the dementia and trigger-no-dementia groups respectively, both p &lt; 0.001.

There was no statistical difference in the risk of death between the trigger-no-dementia and dementia groups during the trial period, p = 0.927, or in the median 1.6-year post-trigger follow-up period, p = 0.78 (Figure S1).

Underlying causes of death

There were statistically significant differences in the causes of death across the three groups (χ2 = 161.5, p &lt; 0.001). The dementia and trigger-no-dementia groups were less likely to have died from cancer, and more likely to have died from sepsis or respiratory disease and dementia or other neurological diseases (Table 2).

Separate analyses were conducted excluding the 56 trigger-no-dementia participants with insufficient information. The results regarding the differences in socio-demographic variables, mortality risks and causes of death were the same as those using the entire sample (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

In a cohort of older persons without major cognitive impairment, cardiovascular disease, or physical disability at recruitment, we found that mortality risk after 4.7 years was twice as higher among those developing incident cognitive impairments than among those who remained cognitively intact. Importantly, higher mortality risks were observed regardless of whether the impairment met DSM-IV criteria for dementia. These results were consistent with previous findings that both cognitive impairment and dementia are associated with higher mortality,1–5 and the mortality risks reported here are consistent with those reported in previous studies.1,17

Over the 4.7-year follow-up period, incident cognitive impairment was most likely to occur after the first 2 years and death after the first 3 years postenrollment. For those with incident cognitive impairment, deaths occurred within a relatively short time (i.e., a median of 1.6 years) following the detection of cognitive impairment. For some participants, this may result from cognitive impairment developed coincidentally with a life-threatening illness, such as stroke. In others, this might be due to terminal cognitive decline,18 particularly if individuals had cognitive impairment that had progressed well before they were triggered for dementia evaluation. Life-limiting diseases associated with dementia, such as falls with injury, could also have contributed to the shortened time to death. Our results emphasize the importance of commencing advance care planning for individuals with cognitive impairment and dementia as early as possible. It also highlights the importance of thoroughly investigating incident cognitive impairment in older adults. Future research is required to identify pathways that lead to rapid death following cognitive impairment and dementia.

Our findings indicate that regardless of whether cognitive impairment meets the DSM-IV criteria for dementia, it is associated with higher mortality risks. One possible explanation is that participants were free of dementia at enrollment and experienced a relatively short observation period after the detection of cognitive impairment. This likely resulted in a narrow range of severity of cognitive decline, which could impede the search for differences in mortality rates in our trial. Secondly, the trigger-no-dementia group was diverse, including participants not meeting the DSM-IV dementia criteria for various reasons (such as no evidence of impairment in a second cognitive domain, no evidence of functional impairment, or not being able to exclude another condition as the cause for cognitive impairment), and our finding may be a function of the conservative requirements used in the trial to identify incident dementia. Finally, our finding might also be related to the relatively small sample sizes of the dementia and trigger-no-dementia groups.

We found that sepsis and respiratory disease were the leading causes of death for people with dementia, followed by dementia or other neurological diseases, and then cardiovascular disease. These results echo those of previous studies showing that pneumonia-associated death is common among patients with dementia.19 Fewer cancer-related deaths in the dementia and trigger-no-dementia groups may be the result of individuals dying of ‘competing’ causes or surveillance bias (e.g., patients with dementia might be less likely to have a formal diagnosis of cancer confirmed).20,21

Strengths and limitations

The ASPREE trial has several strengths. First, cognitive testing was extensive, and adjudication for dementia rigorous according to strict criteria, involving experts who considered both cognitive testing and clinical notes. Second, cognitive impairment was evaluated systematically across all participants and the full period of the trial, which allowed us to examine risk of mortality from the time of the initial detection of cognitive impairment.

There were limitations. ASPREE participants were required to be free from cardiovascular disease at enrollment. Second, as most Australian participants were Caucasian, the ASPREE sample may not suitably represent populations with a different ethnic mix. Third, as noted earlier, the ASPREE trial may have missed cases which would have met DSM-IV criteria for dementia had sufficient documentation been available. Finally, on average, individuals experienced a relatively short follow-up period after the detection of cognitive impairment. To address this limitation, the ASPREE-XT (eXTension) follow-up study is currently being conducted to reveal longer term outcomes among ASPREE participants.

CONCLUSION

In a population of older initially healthy individuals, mortality risks were twice as higher among participants with either incident dementia or cognitive impairment than in participants who remained cognitively intact. This result confirms previous findings that both cognitive impairment and dementia are associated with higher mortality and suggests that the onset of cognitive impairment signifies an increased risk of early mortality. This finding highlights a need for more research to identify the pathways to early mortality among those with cognitive impairment and to explore whether opportunities might exist to reverse both cognitive impairment and its associated mortality risk.

Why Does this Paper Matter?

The onset of cognitive impairment signifies an increased mortality risk and early detection of cognitive decline might help to prevent mortality.
