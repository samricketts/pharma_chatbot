Background/Objectives:

The AD8 informant-based screening instrument has been validated with molecular biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD) but not with the gold standard of neuropathologic AD. The objective of this study was to validate the AD8 with neuropathologic AD and compare its predictive performance with that of the Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE) and both participant- and informant-derived subjective memory complaint (SMC) regarding the participant.

Methods:

This longitudinal cohort study at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University included 230 participants, ages 50–91 years, who later had neuropathological examination. Four dementia screening instruments from their baseline assessment were evaluated: the AD8, MMSE, participant SMC, and informant SMC. The primary outcome was a neuropathologic diagnosis of AD.

Results:

The average participant age at baseline was 80.4 years, 48% were female. All four dementia screening tests were predictive of neuropathologic AD. There was no significant difference in the predictive performance of the AD8 compared with the other instruments, but the AD8 had superior sensitivity and combined Positive and Negative Predictive Values.

Conclusion:

The AD8 is a brief and sensitive screening instrument that may facilitate earlier and more accurate AD diagnosis in a variety of care settings.


Introduction

The prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasing as the population ages.1 In 2017 there were an estimated 6 million individuals in the United States with AD dementia, and the number of affected persons is projected to more than double to 15 million by 2060.2 The annual cost of comprehensive AD care is estimated to reach over one trillion dollars in the United States by 2050.1 Primary care providers remain on the front lines of this growing public health concern and provide the majority of cognitive and functional assessments and subsequent AD diagnosis.3 However, missed or delayed clinical diagnoses of AD are common, especially at the very mild stage where therapeutic interventions, future care planning, and clinical trial enrollment for possible disease-modifying therapies may be most effective.3–5 There are multiple reasons for missed or delayed AD diagnosis, including the lack of practical, reliable, and sufficiently accurate screening and case-finding strategies. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expanded coverage for a new Annual Wellness Visit for Medicare patients effective in 2011 that includes a provision for the “detection of cognitive impairment.”6 However, no specific recommendation was made for the choice of screening instrument or methodology.

There are many validated instruments for AD screening in a variety of care settings.7–12 Although there is utility to a single screening question for subjective memory complaint (SMC), structured screening instruments increase the diagnostic yield.7 The Ascertain Dementia-8 Item Questionnaire (AD8) is a brief and sensitive informant-based screening instrument that was derived from the standardized clinical assessment protocol that determines the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR).13–15 The AD8 is an 8-item questionnaire completed by a knowledgeable informant for the participant who responds to a series of yes/no questions related to changes in the participant regarding in memory, problem solving ability, orientation, and function in daily activities that are caused by cognitive decline. This assessment of intra-individual decline due to cognitive loss differs from performance-based cognitive screening instruments, such as the widely-used Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),16 that assess current performance against standardized population norms (inter-individual comparison). Two or more positive responses on the AD8 indicates cognitive impairment.14 The AD8 has been validated against standardized clinical assessment with CDR assignation, performance on neuropsychological testing, and in vivo molecular biomarkers of AD.13–15 However, because of the long time frame of AD progression, the AD8 has not been validated against the diagnostic gold standard of neuropathologic confirmation of AD.

The objective of this study was to validate the AD8 using neuropathologic confirmation of AD, and to compare the predictive performance of the AD8 with three other dementia screening measures, the MMSE, participant SMC, and informant SMC regarding the participant. We hypothesized that a baseline positive AD8 screen would be predictive of neuropathologic changes of AD, and can be considered as a concise and accurate screening test for AD that can be implemented in the Annual Wellness Visit for Medicare recipients.

Methods

Study Design, Setting, and Population

Research participants of the longitudinal Memory and Aging Project (MAP) at the Washington University Alzheimer Disease Research Center who were age 50–91 years and had a clinical assessment between September 2005 and December 2016 and later came to autopsy were identified for inclusion in the study cohort (n=230). MAP participants undergo a comprehensive clinical and cognitive assessment by experienced clinicians and are assigned a CDR of 0 (cognitively normal), 0.5 (very mild dementia), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), and 3 (severe dementia). The CDR is a standardized method of determining the presence and, when present, the severity of dementia that encompasses the domains of memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, and performance in community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care.17 When dementia is present, its etiology is diagnosed in accordance with standard criteria.18The Human Research Protections Office at Washington University School of Medicine approved this research project.

Measurements and Outcome Measures

Demographic information was collected at the time of the clinical assessment and included age, gender, race, and education level. Additional clinical information collected included the participant CDR both at the baseline clinical assessment and at the time of death, apolipoprotein E-ε4 (APOE4) status, and age at death. Four dementia screening strategies were evaluated: the AD8, MMSE, participant SMC, and informant SMC regarding the participant.

The AD8 asks a collateral source a series of eight yes/no questions that queries cognitive and functional decline in the participant caused by cognitive impairment as compared with the individual’s previously attained cognitive abilities. The number of affirmative responses from the informant yields the AD8 score, with a score of ≥2 considered a positive screen suggestive of cognitive impairment.

Participants were also administered the MMSE, which is a global, multidomain cognitive screen with a potential score ranging from 0 (worst) to 30 (best). For a positive screen suggestive of cognitive impairment, we used a cutoff score of &lt;26 which has been found to balance the sensitivity of the screen while minimizing missed cases.19,20 A positive participant SMC was determined by an affirmative response to item 10 on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale,21 which asks, “Do you feel you have more problems with memory than most?” A positive informant SMC was determined by an affirmative response to the final question of the AD8, which asks the informant whether the participant has “daily problems with thinking and/or memory.13

The primary outcome measure was a neuropathological diagnosis of AD on postmortem examination and was determined with dichotomous outcomes of either neuropathologic AD or non-neuropathologic AD using the National Institute on Aging (NIA)-Reagan Institute criteria.22 Neuropathologic AD was present when the NIA-Reagan criteria yielded results that corresponded with either high or intermediate likelihood of AD. Patients classified as no neuropathologic AD had either no evidence for AD or a low likelihood of AD with the NIA-Reagan criteria.

Statistical Analysis

We examined baseline demographics, APOE4 status, age at death, CDR at the index clinical assessment and at death, and the results of the AD8, MMSE, participant SMC, and informant SMC stratified by neuropathologic diagnosis of AD. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to separately estimate the probability of neuropathologic AD as a function of the individual dementia screening tests, and were adjusted for age at the time of clinical assessment, interval year to death, and APOE4 status. The null hypothesis that two screening tests were the same was tested using multivariable logistic regression models that included the two screening tests in addition to interval year, APOE4 status, and age at the time of the clinical assessment, by testing on the difference of the two regression coefficients for the two (binary) screening tests. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of the individual dementia screening tests to evaluate their diagnostic capabilities. We used McNemar’s test to compare sensitivity then specificity of the screening tests relative to the AD8. We also calculated the positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) based on the following equations:

PPV = (sensitivity*prevalence) / [(sensitivity*prevalence) + (1-specificity)*(1-prevalence)],

NPV = [specificity*(1-prevalence)] / [ (1-sensitivity)*prevalence + specificity*(1-prevalence) ],

Prevalence = n+ / N, where n+ = number of participants with AD, and N = total number of participants in the study = 230.

All analyses were conducted using Statistical Analysis System (SAS version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We considered p≤0.05 to indicate statistical significance.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the 230 study participants stratified by neuropathologic diagnosis of AD are described in Table 1. The average participant age was 80.4 years and 48% were female. Ninety-five percent of the study cohort were white, which is a greater proportion compared to the overall cohort of MAP participants (79%); this discrepancy likely reflects the lower rate of brain autopsy consent in under-represented groups compared with non-Hispanic whites.23 There were no differences for participants with and without neuropathologic AD for mean age at death, gender, or mean years of education. Participants with neuropathologic AD were more likely to be APOE4 carriers than participants who did not have neuropathologic AD (62% versus 19.5%, p&lt;.0001), whereas participants without neuropathologic AD were more likely to have been cognitively normal at time of death (36%) than those with neuropathologic AD (4.3%; p&lt;.0001).

The baseline mean AD8 score, MMSE score, participant’s subjective memory complaint, and the informant’s report of memory problems for the participant all predicted neuropathologic AD at death on average 5 years later (Table 2). A positive AD8 screen at the time of the clinical assessment increased the odds of having neuropathological changes of AD by seven-fold (odds ratio [OR] 6.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.55–12.98), similar to the MMSE (OR 5.60, 95% CI 2.89–10.85), participant SMC (OR 3.81, 95% CI 1.96–7.39), and informant SMC (OR 8.07, 95% CI 4.41–14.77). Similar results were obtained when controlling for age, interval year, and APOE4 status (Table 3).There was no significant difference between AD8, the MMSE, participant SMC, and informant SMC when controlling for age, interval year, and APOE4 status (the unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regression models are presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, respectively). The AD8 offered differential sensitivity and specificity of neuropathological AD from its component single-query informant SMC (table 4). The sensitivity of AD8 is 87.4%, greater than the sensitivity (77.6%) of its component single-query informant SMC (p=.0026), whereas the specificity of the AD8 is 49.4%, less than the specificity (70.1%) of the informant SMC (p&lt;.0001). The sensitivity and specificity for the MMSE are 52.5% and 83.5%, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of the participant SMC are 42.6% and 83.5%. The AD8 had a balanced combination of PPV (74%) and NPV (70.5%): the informant SMC was somewhat balanced (PPV 81.0%, NPV 65.6%). The MMSE yielded a PPV of 84.1% but its NPV was 51.5%; the participant PPV was 83.7% but the NPV was 47.1% (Table 4).

Discussion

Sensitive and reliable screening methods are an important for the growing AD epidemic and have implications for therapeutic interventions and future care planning. In this study we found that each of four dementia screening instruments, the AD8, MMSE, participant SMC, and informant SMC, accurately predicted neuropathologic AD in a cohort of older adults. However, the AD8 had the greatest sensitivity for the presence of neuropathologic AD. Screening instruments are not diagnostic of AD but instead act as a bridge to additional evaluation. Our results indicate that a positive AD8 screen validated with the diagnostic gold standard of neuropathologic AD can serve to aid in cognitive screening strategies for the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit and other care settings.

The AD8 has several advantages as a screening instrument. Unlike the MMSE, which captures cognitive ability at a single point in time, the AD8 captures cognitive change over time that is the salient characteristic of AD dementia.13 In addition, performance-based cognitive screening instruments such as the MMSE rely on comparisons to standardized population norms, which may be influenced by age, gender, education, and cultural and language effects.24,25 The AD8 implicitly accounts for these unmeasured factors by assessing intraindividual changes through informant-based assessment, using the individual as his or her own control, and thus has face validity.26–28 Lastly, the MMSE requires an in-person paper and pencil assessment with an administrator and takes 5–10 minutes, whereas the AD8 is briefer (~2 minutes), simpler, and can be completed independently without need of someone to administer it. The limitation of the AD8 is that optimally it is completed by a person who knows the individual well and thus depends on informant availability, although the informant can be interviewed remotely to complete the AD8 or can self-complete it at home for future delivery to the clinician’s office.

Although participant SMC had similar predictive ability for neuropathologic AD compared to the AD8 and MMSE in this study, depression and other psychological factors are important confounders to the single-query approach and validation studies are lacking.29–32 The AD8, on the other hand, has been validated against CDR designation from standardized clinical assessments, performance on neuropsychological testing, and changes in in vivo molecular biomarkers of AD that included cerebrospinal fluid and beta-amyloid imaging.13–15 The AD8 now has been validated against the diagnostic gold standard of neuropathologic diagnosis of AD as well.

The results of this study inform both case-finding strategies for high-risk populations, as well as the ongoing debate about the utility of universal population screening for AD. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force remains equivocal regarding universal cognitive screening, with one highlighted concern being the lack of evidence demonstrating improved outcomes associated with universal screening.25 However, the advent of biomarker-derived confirmatory testing of AD may be changing the benefit/burden equation of screening strategies. The strongly predictive performance of the screening instruments for AD pathology in the present study also may aid in streamlining timely access to clinical trials of putative disease-modifying investigational drugs for AD.33 Additional potential benefits of screening include earlier access to education and community resources, targeted interventions to improve patient and caregiver quality of life, implications for hospital discharge and chronic disease management, and future care planning with increased participation from persons with AD at the milder stages.34–37

In response to the cognitive assessment provision in the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit that did not provide specific recommendations for a screening strategy, the Alzheimer’s Association published the Alzheimer’s Association Medicare Annual Wellness Visit Algorithm for Assessment of Cognition recommending a two-step evaluation including clinical assessment and the use of a structured cognitive assessment tool for both patients and informants.38 The use of the AD8 aligns with these recommendations and could serve as a primary screening tool if the patient is accompanied by a reliable informant, with a positive screen of two or greater acting as a trigger for additional diagnostic testing. However, even in the absence of an accompanying informant the AD8 can be administered to the informant via telephone or even self-completed by the participant.39 In the setting of time constraints or low risk sub-populations, this study suggests the utility of a single query of SMC from the collateral source, although with a tradeoff in sensitivity and longitudinal tracking ability over time. A positive response could subsequently trigger asking the remaining seven questions on the AD8.

There are several limitations to this study. The small sample size, which reflects the long time frame of AD progression and time to autopsy, may have limited the power to discriminate the predictive performance of the different dementia screening instruments. In addition, the neuropathologic diagnosis of AD did not take into consideration comorbid neurodegenerative disease. An additional limitation is that the large majority of the study participants were white, resulting in unknown external validity to non-white participants. Lastly, this study was done in a single academic institution at an Alzheimer Disease Research Center as a part of a longitudinal study on memory and aging. The generalizability to alternative sites of service and patient populations, such as a community primary care clinic, is unknown and warrants further investigation. Additional future work towards this goal could include investigating sites of care comprised of patient populations at higher risk of AD, including patients with delirium in the hospital or emergency department.40 Performance-based cognitive screening instruments are problematic in this patient subgroup given the confounding influence of delirium on test performance. The AD8 bypasses this limitation by querying an informant and can act as a trigger for outpatient referral for additional diagnostic testing following resolution of the delirium.

In conclusion, the AD8 accurately predicted neuropathologic AD, as did the MMSE, participant SMC, and informant SMC, in a cohort of older adults receiving a clinical evaluation at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis. The characteristics of the AD8 are favorable for use as a concise and accurate screening test for AD that can be implemented in the Annual Wellness Visit for Medicare recipients and aligns with the Alzheimer’s Association Medicare Annual Wellness Visit Algorithm for Assessment of Cognition. Future work includes validation studies in alternative sites of care, including primary care settings and those with high-risk patient populations.
