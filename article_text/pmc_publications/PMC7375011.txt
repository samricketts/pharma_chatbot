Objectives

Intensive control of hypertension has been reported to decrease risk of cognitive decline. However, the effect of this in older adults with hypertension and comorbid depression is not well understood. We aim to identify whether intensive control of systolic blood pressure (BP) is associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) in a clinical population.

Methods

Using data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center, we conducted survival analyses in older adults with normal cognition at baseline and treated hypertension. We also examined those with comorbid depression, to determine if intensive control of systolic BP (≤120 mmHg) was associated with reduced risk of AD.

Results

In all older adults with treated hypertension (n = 4505), 298 (6.6%) developed AD during a median follow-up duration of 4.2 years. In the comorbid depression subgroup (n = 1327), 152 (11.5%) developed AD. Intensive control of systolic BP was not significantly associated with reduced risk of AD in the overall sample (HR 1.13, 95%, 0.79–1.64). However, in the comorbid depression subgroup, intensive control of systolic BP (≤120 mmHg) was associated with increased risk of AD (HR 1.49, 95%, 1.03–2.15) compared to standard control (121–139 mmHg).

Conclusions

In a clinical population of older adults with hypertension and comorbid depression, we found that an intensive systolic BP target of ≤120 mmHg was associated with increased risk of AD. While these findings are preliminary, they suggest that a more cautious approach to hypertension treatment may be warranted in this vulnerable subgroup.

Introduction

In view of the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD), interventions that can delay or prevent onset of dementia by even a few years will have a significant beneficial impact on healthcare costs, patient function, and caregiver burden.1 There is a long-established association between mid-life hypertension and an increased risk of age-related cognitive decline and dementia.2–4 However, whether antihypertensive treatment specifically reduces the risk of AD in older adults at risk of cognitive decline remains poorly understood.3,5 Recent results from SPRINT MIND, a substudy of the landmark Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), attempted to answer this question and revealed that intensive systolic blood pressure (BP) control (≤120 mmHg) did not reduce dementia risk, but did decrease the overall risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).6 SPRINT also demonstrated a significant reduction in cardiovascular event rates7 and in 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) lowered the diagnostic threshold for hypertension from 140/90 mmHg to 130/80 mmHg in clinical practice guidelines.8 However, intensive control of hypertension can be associated with adverse events in older adults9 and hypotension in later life has also been associated with increased risk of MCI and dementia.10

Older adults with depression have an excess of medical comorbidities including greater burden of cerebrovascular lesions and orthostatic hypotension.11,12 We have previously reported a two-fold higher risk of AD in older adults with depression and MCI.13,14 However, despite the high comorbidity between depression and hypertension,15,16 it is not clear how different levels of BP control may impact the risk of developing AD in this population.

Our objectives are to: (1) determine whether intensive systolic BP control (≤120 mmHg) is associated with decreased risk of AD in a large clinical population of older adults with hypertension attending memory clinics across the US and (2) whether the risk is also decreased in older adults with hypertension and comorbid depression. In view of recent findings from SPRINT MIND, we hypothesized that individuals both with and without comorbid depression treated to a systolic BP of ≤120 mmHg would have a reduced risk of AD compared to standard control.

Methods

Sample and Study Design

The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) collects data from participating Alzheimer’s Disease Center (ADCs) across the U.S approximately annually. The Uniform Data Set (UDS) was implemented in September 2005, and prospectively gathers standardized information from study participants.17 The combined dataset includes 41,459 subjects as of September 2019. Study participants are assessed by a clinician, and receive cognitive testing, psychological questionnaires, and a physical examination. Our analysis is based on a subsample of participants from the UDS who attended from September 2005 to March 2019. We included participants aged 50 years and over, with a baseline diagnosis of normal cognition and a diagnosis of hypertension at baseline who attended for an assessment on at least two visits (n = 5,587). This inclusion criteria was selected to maintain consistency with the SPRINT MIND trial design,6 and also based on previous longitudinal studies investigating the role of late life depression and development of AD.18

For survival analyses examining conversion to AD, we excluded all participants who did not have BP measured at baseline, were missing measurements during follow up visits, or were subsequently diagnosed with non-Alzheimer’s dementia. This remaining sample size was 4,505. In our prespecified subgroup survival analysis, we examined participants with a clinical diagnosis of hypertension and comorbid depression (n = 1327).

Informed consent was obtained from participants and approved by the ADC’s institutional review board (IRB). Research using the NACC database was also approved by the University of Washington IRB.

Hypertension

Hypertension is defined as present, remote, or absent by a clinician at time of initial assessment based on a review of the subject’s health history, blood pressure measurement, and medication review for the presence of an antihypertensive. We included only individuals with an active diagnosis of hypertension who were also receiving at least one antihypertensive treatment at the time of initial assessment and during all follow up visits.

Blood Pressure

BP for each subject is measured and recorded annually by a clinician at an ADC. A single seated BP measurement is made at each visit according to a standardized protocol. For our analysis, participants were classified into one of three groups depending on their systolic BP measurement: (1) ≤120 mmHg, (2) 121–139 mmHg (reference group), and (3) &gt;140 mmHg. These groups were chosen based on the SPRINT MIND BP targets groups of ≤120mmHg and &lt;140 mmHg systolic. As SPRINT MIND did not specify a target treatment criterion for diastolic BP, we did not consider the role of diastolic BP during this categorization.

Medications

Participants were documented at each visit as either taking or not taking any type of an antihypertensive (or blood pressure) medication, lipid lowering medication, antidepressant medication, or antipsychotic medication (UDS Form A4).

Antihypertensive medications are further coded into one or more of the following classes: angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, antiadrenergic agents (peripherally and centrally acting), beta-adrenergic blockers (cardioselective and non-cardioselective), calcium channel blockers (CCB), diuretic (loop diuretics, potassium-sparing diuretics, thiazide, and thiazide-like diuretics), angiotensin II receptor blockers, and combination therapy. Lipid lowering medications included any use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and miscellaneous antihyperlipidemic agents.

Antidepressant medications included any use of a prescription antidepressant, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), phenylpiperazines antidepressants, tricyclic antidepressants, and tetracyclic antidepressants. Antipsychotic medications included any use of a prescription antipsychotic, including phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, atypical antipsychotics, and combination medications.

Depression

Depression was defined as either: (1) depression in the last 2 years as reported by the study participant or a co-participant to an ADC clinician (UDS Form A5), or (2) an ADC clinician-reported depression at time of initial assessment according to DSM criteria, chart review, or whether the subject was taking an antidepressant for a depressive mood disorder (UDS Form D1). The subject health history (UDS Form A5) is completed by a clinician, based on “subject/informant report, medical records, and/or observation” using the clinician’s best judgment. Participants with no depression at time of initial assessment, but who later developed depression during follow up by these definitions were also included in this group. Depression includes major depressive disorder and other depressive syndromes for which a clinician is consulted. The severity of depressive symptoms at baseline was also assessed with the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).19

Cognition and Alzheimer’s Dementia

Cognitive and diagnostic assessments were made by team consensus or the physician conducting the examination using a structured clinical history, neuropsychological testing, and validated assessments of symptoms and function. Normal cognition was defined as a global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of zero and cognitive testing within normal limits. MCI was diagnosed by the presence of a cognitive complaint with cognitive decline not normal for age and maintained functional activities.20 A dementia syndrome was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria and dementia diagnoses were made by a consensus team or the physician conducting the examination using the a structured clinical history, neuropsychological testing, and CDR.17 Alzheimer’s dementia was diagnosed according to NINCDS/ADRDA criteria21 prior to 2015 and according to NIA-AA criteria22 starting in 2015 when the UDS (version 3) was revised.23 We included probable and possible AD where Alzheimer’s was considered to be a contributory pathology. Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores (using WORLD) was completed on study participants at the baseline until 2015 (UDS version 1–2).24

Medical Conditions and Health Behaviors

Common medical conditions were collected using a structured health history form (UDS Form A5) by an ADC clinician based on participant report, medical records, and/or observation. A medical condition was deemed present if it was active within the last year or occurred in the past. We included medical conditions known to be associated with depression, hypertension, and a risk of cognitive decline including: hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, heart attack/arrest, stroke or TIA, traumatic brain injury, or B12 deficiency. Participants were also asked about any history of alcohol abuse (defined as significant impairment over a 12-month period in one or more the following areas: social, work, driving, or legal) and total number of years of smoking cigarettes.

Physical Examination

Physical examinations were performed by ADC clinicians, including weight measurement, height measurement, and a record of hearing impairment (without hearing aids) or visual impairment (without corrective lenses). A baseline body mass index (BMI)25 was calculated using the subject’s weight and height at the initial assessment. A subset of participants also had genetic testing (blood test or buccal swab) to determine whether participants were homozygous or heterozygous for the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele associated with an increased risk of AD.26

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive analyses were conducted to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample at baseline. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square analyses, and t tests were conducted as appropriate. Survival analyses were conducted to determine which variables were associated with increased risk of AD during the follow-up period. An event was a diagnosis of dementia due to possible or probable Alzheimer’s pathology during follow-up. In the first survival analysis, we included all hypertensive participants (n = 4,505). Systolic BP category (≤120, 121–139, or &gt;140 mmHg) was modelled as a time-dependent variable27,28 and entered into a Cox regression model adjusting for covariates. A second survival analysis was performed and included only participants with hypertension and comorbid depression (n = 1327). In all survival analyses, censoring at the last date of contact was used to account for participants who had not received a diagnosis of AD before loss to follow-up. We used a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model, adjusting for the effects of other covariates on risk of AD. Prior to running the model, the variables were assessed for multicollinearity using tolerance statistics (tolerance &lt;0.4 as a cut-point) to avoid an unstable estimate of regression coefficients. The proportionality assumption was also confirmed using Schoenfeld residuals. All analyses were conducted utilizing Stata 13.0 for Mac. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

A total of 4,505 participants with normal cognition and treated hypertension were included in the baseline analysis. The median follow-up duration was 4.2 years (range 7.5 months to 13.4 years). 2,872 (63.8%) were female with a mean (SD) age of 73.7 years (8.4). Baseline clinical characteristics according to (1) BP group, and (2) presence and absence of comorbid depression are described in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively. In the entire study group, 298 individuals (6.6%) developed dementia. Individuals with a target BP of ≤120 mmHg at baseline had a significantly higher prevalence of heart attack/cardiac arrest and hypercholesterolemia.

In those with hypertension and no depression (n = 3178), 146 individuals (4.6%) developed AD. In those with hypertension and comorbid depression (n = 1327), 152 individuals (11.5%) developed AD. In this group, 622 individuals (46.9%) were on an antidepressant at baseline, and 18 individuals were on an antipsychotic (1.4%). Individuals with comorbid depression had a significantly greater occurrence of TIA/stroke, B12 deficiency, alcohol abuse, total smoking years, antidepressant use, antipsychotic use, and angiotensin II receptor blocker use.

Survival Analyses

Multivariable survival analyses were first performed for all participants and then for those with only with comorbid depression. The analyses were adjusted for the following variables: age, sex, years of education, MMSE, BMI, presence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotype, atrial fibrillation, stroke/TIA, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, B12 deficiency, smoking years, alcohol abuse, visual impairment, hearing impairment and medications. Variables found to be significantly associated with AD in all participants included age (HR 1.07, 95%, 1.05–1.10), baseline MMSE score (HR 0.73, 95%, 0.69–0.76), presence of APOE4 (HR 2.35, 95%, 1.74–3.17), BMI (HR 0.95, 95%, 0.92–0.98), presence of depression (HR 2.00, 95%, 1.18–2.65), more depressive symptoms (HR 1.13, 95%, 1.07–1.19), antidepressant use (HR 1.76, 95%, 1.18–2.62), and a history of stroke/TIA (HR 1.83, 95%, 1.31–2.56) (Table 3). There was no difference in survival to AD between the systolic BP groups in the all participants group.

In the subgroup analysis in adults with comorbid depression, we found that a target systolic BP of ≤120 mmHg was associated with increased risk of AD (HR 1.49, 95%, 1.03–2.15) compared to standard control (121–139mmHg). This survival difference is also shown in a Kaplan-Meier survival curve in Figure 1. Age (HR 1.06, 95%, 1.03–1.09), MMSE score at baseline (HR 0.71, 95%, 0.66–0.77), APOE4 (HR 1.86, 95%, 1.21–2.87), more depressive symptoms (HR 1.08, 95%, 1.01–1.15), antidepressant use (HR 2.3, 95%, 1.68–3.14), and visual impairment (HR 1.62, 95%, 1.03–2.54) were also significantly associated with AD in this group (Table 4).

Discussion

In this clinical sample of older adults with hypertension attending memory clinics across the United States, we found that there was no difference in survival to AD between the different systolic BP targets in the overall group. However, in the subgroup with comorbid depression, we found that intensive systolic BP control (≤120 mmHg) was associated with a significantly greater risk of conversion to AD compared to moderate BP control (121–139 mmHg).

There are several possibilities why individuals with depression in the intensive treatment group had a higher conversion rate to AD. Our study included individuals with late-life depression who are known to be at increased risk of AD. Individuals with late-onset depression often have a greater burden of cerebrovascular disease and are a subgroup at particularly increased risk.12 We also found that older adults with comorbid depression had a greater burden of medical comorbidity including TIA/stroke, smoking years, and alcohol abuse. Therefore, it is possible that they may have poorer tolerability for intensive BP control and that this may exacerbate vascular pathology increasing risk of conversion to AD.18,29 One recent community-based clinical-pathologic study found that a faster decline in systolic BP was associated with an increased number of brain infarcts.30

Secondly, previous studies have also shown that there is a U-shaped relationship between BP and cognitive performance and dementia.4,31,32 Both hypertension in mid-life, and more importantly, hypotension in late life have been associated with increased risk of AD.32,33 The risk associated with hypotension in late life may be secondary to decreased cerebral perfusion.4,34 Orthostatic hypotension is associated with increased risk of dementia35,36 and depression has been associated with a greater prevalence of orthostatic hypotension.37,38

Our finding of lower systolic BP and increased risk of AD in the comorbid depression group is also consistent with previous findings by Abell et al. in a general population where a systolic BP of &lt;130mmHg was associated with a greater risk of dementia compared to &lt;140mmHg.39 It has also previously been reported that the group with highest risk of dementia are those with hypertension in middle age, and subsequent hypotension in later life.32

We note that adults recruited to the SPRINT MIND trial were younger with fewer medical comorbidities, and this may explain the finding of decreased MCI risk.6 The INFINITY trial (Intensive Versus Standard Blood Pressure Lowering to Prevent Functional Decline in Older People) focused exclusively on older adults over age 75 with hypertension and found that intensive lowering of systolic BP reduced the development of subcortical white matter disease but did not improve mobility or cognitive function.40 While the INFINITY trial did not demonstrate increased falls in the more intensive treatment group, data from patients in naturalistic settings have indicated increased falls risk with low-treated systolic blood pressure.9 Thus, although mid-life hypertension is an important modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline,33 our findings suggests that there is no “one size fits all” BP treatment target and that these targets may vary according to age, presence of depression and medical comorbidity.

In line with previous analyses, we found that age, baseline cognition, and APOE genotype were associated with increased risk of AD. Antidepressant use was also significantly associated with increased risk and we note that previous analyses have indicated either neutral,41 protective,42 or deleterious effects for antidepressants.43 Specific SSRIs have been reported to have potentially protective effects44 while antidepressants with anticholinergic properties are generally best avoided if possible.41 Since antidepressants were not coded by class, we were unable to explore class effects or adjust for number and severity of previous depressive episodes, which are relevant confounders. We found that increased severity of depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with increased risk, which is in line with previous findings.45,46

Our study has several strengths and limitations. Strengths include a well-defined clinical population and dementia diagnoses based on standardized criteria by clinicians in specialized memory services. We had a large clinical sample and were able to control for multiple confounders. However, subjects were attending specialized memory services, and findings may not be generalized to the community population. Other limitations include BP being measured only once at each visit rather than an average of multiple measurements. The duration of follow-up was relatively short, and it is also possible that hypotension occurred as a consequence of cognitive decline. Depression diagnosis was not based on diagnostic interview although clinician diagnoses were informed by DSM criteria. Finally, we did not have additional data regarding orthostasis and occurrence of adverse events such as falls related to antihypertensive use.

In conclusion, we found that intensive control of systolic BP to a target of ≤120 mmHg in older adults with hypertension and comorbid depression was associated with a significantly increased risk of AD. In the overall sample, there was no difference in the risk of AD between the different systolic BP targets. These findings should be replicated in other observational samples or explored in subgroup analyses from randomized controlled trials. While these findings are preliminary, they suggest that a more cautious approach to hypertension treatment may be warranted in this vulnerable subgroup.

Key Points

Intensive blood pressure control and the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) in older adults with hypertension and comorbid depression is not well understood

Older adults with hypertension and comorbid depression treated to a systolic blood pressure of ≤120 mmHg have an increased risk of AD compared to those treated to 121–139 mmHg.

A more cautious and nuanced approach to blood pressure control in older adults with hypertension and comorbid depression may be warranted.

Conflicts of Interest: None declared.
