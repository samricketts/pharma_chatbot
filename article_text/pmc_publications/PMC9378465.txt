Background:

The Medicare Advantage (MA) program is rapidly growing. Limited evidence exists about the care experiences of MA beneficiaries with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD). Our objective was to compare care experiences for MA beneficiaries with and without ADRD.

Methods:

We examined MA beneficiaries who completed the Medicare Advantage Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) and used inpatient, nursing home, or home health services in the past 3 years. We classified beneficiaries with ADRD using the presence of diagnosis codes in hospitals, nursing homes, and home health records. Our key measures included overall ratings of care and health plan, and indices of receiving timely care, care coordination, receiving needed care, and customer service. We compared differences between beneficiaries with and without ADRD using regression analysis adjusting for demographic, health, and plan characteristics, and stratifying by proxy response status.

Results:

Among beneficiaries sampled by CAHPS, 22.2% with ADRD completed the survey compared to 38.5% without ADRD. Among proxy responses, beneficiaries with ADRD were 4.2 (95% CI: 0.1–8.4) percentage points less likely to report a high score for receiving needed care, and 3.5 percentage points (95% CI: 0.2–6.9) less likely to report a high score for customer service. Among non-proxy responses, those with ADRD were 9.0 (95% CI: 5.5–12.5) percentage points less likely to report a high score for needed care, and 8.5 (95% CI: 5.4–11.5) percentage points less likely to report a high score for customer service.

Conclusions:

ADRD respondents to the CAHPS were more likely to be excluded from CAHPS performance measures because they did not meet eligibility requirements and rates of non-response were higher. Among responders with or without a proxy, MA enrollees with an ADRD diagnosis reported worse care experiences in receiving needed care and in customer service than those without an ADRD diagnosis.

pmcINTRODUCTION

The Medicare Advantage (MA) program is rapidly growing and now accounts for over 42% of Medicare beneficiaries nationally.1,2 MA differs from traditional Medicare (TM) in that private plans are paid on a capitated basis to cover the needs of their enrollees in a year. MA plans can offer additional supplemental benefits unavailable in TM.3 But they can also set specific networks of available providers4 and implement prior authorization requirements that may pose additional challenges for enrollees with chronic conditions.

Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a highly prevalent condition that is responsible for substantial care and cost burdens nationally.5-9 Individuals with ADRD and their caregivers often face additional barriers in access to care compared to other patients in the healthcare system. While both the MA program and the prevalence of ADRD continue to grow, there is currently limited evidence on the care experience of Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD in the MA program. While two recent studies have found substantially higher disenrollment rates for enrollees with ADRD from MA plans, few studies have examined the care experiences of MA enrollees with ADRD.10,11 Additionally, given that beneficiaries with ADRD may have cognitive decline or may be more likely to be institutionalized, it is unclear if their experiences are captured by current performance measurement initiatives.

In this study, we use a unique linkage of national survey data with claims and assessment data to examine the care experiences of MA enrollees with ADRD. Our two primary objectives are to understand the extent to which beneficiaries with ADRD are included in CAHPS performance measurement and to measure how the care experiences of enrollees with ADRD compared to those without.

METHODS

Data sources

Our primary source of data was the Medicare Advantage Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) from 2015 through 2017. CAHPS surveys are fielded annually to a sample of 600 MA enrollees drawn from each contract. Traditionally, response rates for the CAHPS survey are similar to other health surveys, with slightly higher response rates for non-Hispanic White beneficiaries, and lower response rates for low-income beneficiaries.12-14 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) uses CAHPS to measure the performance of MA plans. CAHPS surveys contain questions primarily related to an enrollee's experience with their care and detailed questions on enrollee demographics including self-reported race/ethnicity, income, and education level. The CAHPS survey is restricted to only non-institutionalized enrollees at the time of the survey. In addition to CAHPS, we used the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF) to determine which beneficiaries were enrolled in MA and other enrollee characteristics including their ZIP Code, county, and hospital referral region of residence.

To classify beneficiaries with ADRD, we drew from three sources available for MA enrollees: The Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) files which include hospitalization records for over 90% of MA enrollees nationally, the Minimum Data Set (MDS) which is a nursing home assessment file for all Medicare beneficiaries ever admitted to a nursing home, and the Outcomes and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) which is a home health assessment file for all Medicare beneficiaries who receive home health care. We linked across all files in this study using a unique individual-level beneficiary ID.

Study sample

Our primary study sample were all MA beneficiaries who completed a CAHPS survey in either 2015, 2016, or 2017. We limited our sample to enrollees who had any utilization in any of our three files (MedPAR, MDS, and OASIS) used for ADRD classification to ensure that utilization alone did not contribute to any differences in outcomes. This led to an inclusion of 65,095 CAHPS respondents and an exclusion of 345,422 among MA beneficiaries without utilization. The CAHPS survey data also identifies beneficiaries that were selected for a CAHPS survey but did not complete the survey.

Classification of ADRD

The CAHPS survey does not include a question on whether the respondent has ever been diagnosed with ADRD. To identify enrollees who may have ADRD, we drew from the MedPAR, MDS, and OASIS.15 Each of these three files includes a range of ICD9 or ICD10 diagnosis codes that we used to identify ADRD diagnoses. We used the Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW) set of diagnosis codes.16 If a beneficiary had a diagnosis of ADRD across any of the included files, they were classified as having ADRD. Most beneficiaries were classified using the MedPAR file, with the second most ADRD diagnoses coming from the MDS. Consistent with the approach that Medicare uses to classify ADRD among traditional Medicare beneficiaries, we employed a three-year lookback period to identify ADRD diagnoses and used a rolling window for each year of CAHPS data. While this approach is likely to be more sensitive than using outpatient data alone, the limitation is that we may not detect ADRD among enrollees who do not utilize hospital or post-acute services during the study period. In sensitivity analysis, we also classified ADRD using 2015 MA encounter data that include all claims (including outpatient claims) for MA enrollees, and also only using the MA encounter data as a source of diagnosis and the results were largely unchanged (Table S3). We also assessed whether the results changed when excluding beneficiaries who received nursing home care, which may be associated with poor reports of care experience, and found similar results.

Outcome variables

We studied several outcomes designed to capture enrollees' care experiences. From the CAHPS survey, we used two overall measures for the respondents: (1) overall rating of their health care, and; (2) overall rating of their MA plan. Both questions ask respondents to rate on a scale of 1–10, with 10 being the best. As over 80% of respondents selected the top score for either question (10), consistent with prior studies we dichotomized these measures as 0/1 binary variables of whether the respondent selected 10 or any other value.17-19

In addition to the two overall measures, we calculated several indices that CMS uses to assess respondents' customer service experience, their care coordination experience, and whether they reported that they received needed care, got appointments and care quickly, and received needed prescriptions. These indices are based on multiple CAHPS questions and are scored out of 100.20,21 Similar to the single item questions above, we dichotomized these measures between top scorers (100), and everyone else (&lt;100). In sensitivity analyses, we tested different thresholds for the top-rated category and found similar results.

Other variables

To adjust our analysis for potential confounders, we also included variables for the self-reported race, ethnicity, educational attainment, age, and income from the CAHPS surveys. From the MBSF we included dual eligibility status and if the beneficiary lived in a rural zip code. We also linked the MA contract number to publicly available MA characteristic data for premium, zero-premium plan, type of plan (health maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), other), special needs plan (SNP) types, and if the plan operates in multiple states. We also included flags for if the enrollee had any hospital, nursing home, or home health utilization in the year as well as flags for if the enrollee had additional comorbid conditions as reported by CAHPS.

The CAHPS survey includes a variable indicating whether a proxy helped the respondent fill out the survey. In our descriptive analysis, we found that the proxy reporting rate was substantially higher for enrollees with ADRD compared to enrollees without ADRD.22-24 To address this concern about potential differences in responses by proxy status, we stratified all of our analyses by the proxy status of the response. In sensitivity analyses we also used inverse probability weights (IPW) calculated from the probability to use a proxy response; however, the use of IPW for proxies may not offer substantial benefits over stratification.24

To compare if the experience of enrollees with ADRD is unique from other conditions, we additionally created flags to indicate whether enrollees were diagnosed with COPD, diabetes, glaucoma, acute myocardial infarction, schizophrenia, or heart failure. We selected these conditions following other work that compared ADRD outcomes9 and calculated them based on CCW code definitions following the same approach as ADRD.

Statistical analysis

We first descriptively compared CAHPS participation rates by ADRD status. We then compared the characteristics of those with an ADRD diagnosis in our sample to those who did not. Next, for each outcome we fit a linear probability model with a binary outcome variable, with ADRD status as our primary independent variable of interest, adjusting for each of the individual and plan characteristics listed above. All standard errors were clustered by a plan to account for similarities between beneficiaries in the same plans. We also include a county fixed effect in our analysis to account for regional differences. For all models, we started with an alpha of 0.05 and then used a Bonferroni adjustment for our 7 primary outcome measures to account for multiple comparisons.

In sensitivity analysis, we compared the primary outcomes using additional diagnoses from encounter records, tested the use of IPW to account for proxy responses, and tested additional forms of the outcome variables (dichotomized using alternative cutoffs, as continuous variables). We also compared differences in outcomes by enrollment in MA special needs plans and standard MA plans.

RESULTS

In Figure 1, we first compared the response rates to the CAHPS surveys by ADRD status. We find that while 38.5% of MA beneficiaries without ADRD were included in the performance measurement from the survey, only 22.2% of beneficiaries with ADRD were both eligible and completed the survey. Beneficiaries with ADRD had higher non-response rates (49.3% vs. 43.7%), higher rates of not being able to complete the survey due to comprehension or cognitive function (3.7% vs. 0.8%), and a higher rate of ineligibility due to being institutionalized at the time of the survey (1.2% vs. 0.1%).

In Table 1, we compare the characteristics of enrollees with and without an ADRD diagnosis who completed the CAHPS survey. Our final analytic sample included 61,728 enrollees without ADRD and 3367 enrollees with ADRD. Our prevalence rate of ADRD in MA is similar to prior work.11 Enrollees in our sample with ADRD were older (mean age 83.4 vs. 74.3), more often dual eligible with Medicaid (39.6% vs. 23.5%) and were much more likely to use a proxy in completing the survey (57.6% vs. 15.3%). In Table Table S1, we present the unadjusted outcome rates by ADRD and proxy response status and in Table S2, we compare the unadjusted outcomes as continuous variables.

In Table 2, we present the results of our primary analysis. In general, enrollees with ADRD reported worse care experiences than enrollees without ADRD among both those who used a proxy respondent and those who did not. Among enrollees who used a proxy, those with ADRD were 4.2 (95% CI: 0.1–8.4) percentage points less likely to report a high score for getting needed care, and 3.5 percentage points (95% CI: 0.2–6.9) less likely to report a high score for the customer service index. Among enrollees who did not use a proxy, those with ADRD were 9.0 (95% CI: 5.5–12.5) percentage points less likely to report a high score for getting needed care, 8.5 (95% CI: 5.4–11.5) percentage points less likely to report a high score for the customer service index, and 4.2 (95% CI: 0.9–7.4) percentage points less likely to report a high score for getting needed. The group that did not use proxies had somewhat worse care experience scores than the groups that used a proxy and frequently performance was lower for those with ADRD compared to those without. Overall plan rating was an exception: non-proxy respondents with ADRD reported higher ratings than those without ADRD.

In Table 3 we compare the difference in satisfaction expressed by those with ADRD relative to enrollees with other chronic disease conditions, stratified by proxy status. We found that for both the getting needed care index and the customer service index, the experience was substantially poorer for beneficiaries with ADRD, compared to beneficiaries with all other chronic conditions.

In sensitivity analysis, we found that when including MA encounter records from 2015, we were able to classify an additional 1315 beneficiaries with ADRD who were sampled by the CAHPS. We find that after including these beneficiaries in our analysis, the results were similar to the primary analysis (Table S3). We also present results using IPW weights to account for proxy status (Table S4). When stratifying by special needs plan enrollment, we found similar differences in care experiences between those with and without ADRD (Table S5). Full regression output is available in Table S6.

DISCUSSION

Our study of the experiences of enrollees with ADRD in the MA program had four key findings. First, beneficiaries with ADRD were substantially less likely to be included in CAHPS performance measurement than beneficiaries without ADRD. Second, among those who were included in the performance measure, enrollees with ADRD reported significantly worse care experiences across several measures compared to those without ADRD. These differences for enrollees with ADRD were larger than beneficiaries with other chronic conditions, and respondents who did not use a proxy reported worse outcomes. Among non-proxy respondents, beneficiaries with ADRD reported higher overall plan ratings than those without ADRD.

Our study is among the first to study the care experiences of MA enrollees with and without ADRD. One prior study compared care experiences using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey and found that beneficiaries with ADRD did not report different care satisfaction scores regarding the quality of their medical care, and availability of specialists.25 Our study builds on the literature by using a larger sample of enrollees with ADRD who have had healthcare utilization and a different set of care experiences questions that are available in CAHPS.

Our study has important policy implications for evaluating the performance of MA plans in addressing the needs of their enrollees with ADRD. As the MA program continues to grow,26 and greater proportions of beneficiaries with ADRD select MA over Traditional Medicare, the need to measure and improve the quality of care for people with ADRD will only become more pressing. MA plans can offer additional benefits and care management services, such as caregiver support, adult daycare, and home modifications, which may be particularly relevant to people with ADRD and are unavailable in Traditional Medicare. However, MA plans' adoption of these benefits is low and the impact of these novel benefits on care experiences for MA enrollees needs further evaluation.3,27 Enrollment in SNPs, MA plans that are designed to take care of more complex patients, has rapidly grown from 1.3 million in 2011 to 3.8 million in 2021. While some early research finds some improved outcomes in these plans,28-31 our study does not find they were associated with significant improvements in care experiences among beneficiaries with ADRD. As MA risk adjustment now pays higher rates for enrollees with an ADRD diagnosis, it is even more important that plans address the needs of these beneficiaries.

What might be leading to these differences in care experiences for enrollees with ADRD? Prior work has found that MA beneficiaries tend to be admitted to lower quality hospitals, nursing homes, and home health agencies than those in TM,32-34 and that MA networks are often narrow in nature.4,35,36 While all beneficiaries in our study are enrolled in MA, narrow networks and other barriers to care such as prior authorizations may be an additional burden for beneficiaries with ADRD to navigate than healthier enrollees. Enrollees with dementia may also face challenges in selecting the right plan for them, leading to lowerrated care experiences.37 More research is needed to understand whether some plans perform better at meeting the care needs of enrollees with ADRD.

Our findings also have important implications for performance measurement in the MA program. We find that enrollees with ADRD are disproportionately undercounted in CAHPS responses due to both higher rates of non-response and less eligibility due to being institutionalized. CMS uses five CAHPS measures in their calculation of overall plan star ratings.38 If enrollees with ADRD are not included in these measures, then plans may not currently be held accountable for their outcomes. To address this, it is crucial to design performance measures that equitably include persons with serious health conditions, functional and cognitive decline, and who require proxies to complete surveys of patient experience Otherwise, plans may not be properly incentivized to address these care experience gaps. CMS may also need to use alternative survey modalities to better account for non-response among persons with ADRD, or may consider over-sampling older respondents with this condition.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, given limitations in available data about the Medicare Advantage population, our main analysis is limited to enrollees who received hospital, nursing home, or home health care in any of our study years. As such, our results may not generalize to the care experiences of enrollees with ADRD but who do not receive these services. Second, the source of where an ADRD diagnosis was captured may influence our results, however, in sensitivity analyses, we find similar results across settings of care. Third, the MedPAR file may undercount ADRD cases as ADRD may not always be coded for inpatient stays. Fourth, while our finding that there are lower and non-response rates among enrollees with ADRD has important policy relevance, we are limited in being able to measure the care experiences among those who did not respond. Fifth, we do not have detailed information on why certain respondents used a proxy and why others did not. Sixth, this analysis is associational and we cannot draw causal inference from our findings.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, MA enrollees with an ADRD diagnosis reported worse care experiences in receiving needed care and in customer service than those without an ADRD diagnosis. Further, relative to those without ADRD, ADRD respondents to the CAHPS were twice as likely to be excluded from CAHPS performance measures because they did not meet eligibility requirements or did not respond to the survey. In order to ensure that all enrollees in the MA program have access to high-quality services, more efforts may be needed to measure and address the care needs of the ADRD population.

Key points

Medicare Advantage enrollees with ADRD report worse care experiences than beneficiaries without ADRD

Beneficiaries with ADRD are disproportionately excluded from performance measurement through the CAHPS survey

Why does this paper matter?

As the Medicare Advantage program continues to grow, it is imperative that plans are held accountable for the outcomes and care experiences of their enrollees with ADRD.
