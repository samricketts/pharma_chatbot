This study utilized a randomized control trial to examine whether structural changes in the precuneus, insula, caudate, hippocampus, and putamen were related to exercise. A total of 197 healthy older adults with no evidence of dementia participated in moderate-intensity interval training or low-intensity continuous training for 16 weeks. Size decreased in the right hippocampus such that the effect of time was significant but the interaction with condition was not. For the left hippocampus, size decreased in the low-intensity continuous training condition but increased in the moderate-intensity continuous training plus interval training condition at the trend level. Finally, there was a significant time-by-condition interaction such that the thickness of the left insula increased for low-intensity continuous training and decreased for moderate-intensity continuous training plus interval training. Few structural changes were associated with the exercise intervention. Future studies should examine the effects of exercise on brain structure in high-risk or clinical populations for a longer period of time.

pmcCompared with just 50 years ago, more adults are living longer, often well into their 80s and beyond. However, even in the absence of chronic disease, age-related changes in cognition may affect quality of life and place additional burden on the health care system for these individuals (Arent, Landers, &amp; Etnier, 2000; Schoenborn, Vickerie, &amp; Powell-Griner, 2006; Thomas, 2001). Cognitive decline is characterized by decreasing brain volume and thickness for regions such as the hippocampus, preceded by other biochemical changes (Jack et al., 2013; McKhann et al., 2011). By the time one begins to experience even mild cognitive impairment, biochemical and structural changes in the brain are so pronounced that interventions are poorly timed and do not effect impactful change for patients (Aisen, 2009; Hyman &amp; Sorger, 2014; Karran &amp; Hardy, 2014). The need is growing to identify cognitive changes earlier in their progression and to develop therapeutic and preventative strategies to slow, stop, or reverse negative changes.

Amidst this climate, there is increasing consensus that research efforts toward preventing cognitive decline for older adults should be focused on prodromal asymptomatic populations (Aisen et al., 2011). There could be utility in investigating structural and biochemical targets based on research with populations known to be at high risk for cognitive decline, such as among autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (AD) patients (Bateman et al., 2012; Fleisher et al., 2015). For example, Gordon and colleagues reported in 2018 that prodromal decreases in volume and thickness for regions of interest (ROIs) including precuneus, insula, caudate, hippocampus, and putamen were detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as early as 13 years preceding estimated onset of symptoms (Gordon et al., 2018). Furthermore, while the hippocampus has long been associated in the literature with cognitive decline, regions such as the precuneus (visuospatial processing and episodic memory; Cavanna &amp; Trimble, 2006), insula (cognitive-emotional processes; Singer, Critchley, &amp; Preuschoff, 2009), and caudate (learning and inhibition; Grahn, Parkinson, &amp; Owen, 2008) are comparatively much less researched in terms of their relationship to cognitive decline.

Behavioral factors such as exercise may have protective or therapeutic effects against age-related cognitive changes. Some studies have estimated that 30.6–54.1% of AD cases in the United States are attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors with 21.0% attributable to physical inactivity (Norton, Matthews, Barnes, Yaffe, &amp; Brayne, 2014). Numerous meta-analyses, reviews, and individual studies detail the potential benefits of exercise among older adults in the domain of cognitive function (Barnes &amp; Yaffe, 2011; Colcombe &amp; Kramer, 2003; Erickson et al., 2011; Hernández et al., 2015; Heyn, Abreu, &amp; Ottenbacher, 2004; Kramer, Bherer, Colcombe, Dong, &amp; Greenough, 2004; Kramer &amp; Erickson, 2007; Paillard, Rolland, &amp; de Souto Barreto, 2015; Smith et al., 2010), though other reviews of randomized control trials of exercise and cognition have had mixed findings (Kelly et al., 2014). In general, the effects of fitness training on cognitive function are strongest for executive function (Bunce &amp; Murden, 2006; Kramer &amp; Willis, 2002; Yu et al., 2013), with some cognitive benefits also shown to be independent of brain pathology (Buchman et al., 2012; Buchman et al., 2019), while even increased light activity has been associated with improved cognitive function (Buchman, Wilson, &amp; Bennett, 2008; Stubbs, Chen, Chang, Sun, &amp; Ku, 2017). Exercise has also been associated with lower levels of AD-related biomarkers in human and animal models (Gomez-Pinilla, Zhuang, Feng, Ying, &amp; Fan, 2011; Liang et al., 2010; Wrann et al., 2013), slower decreases in structural volume or thickness, or even increases in volume in some ROIs such as the hippocampus (Ding et al., 2018; Erickson et al., 2009, 2011). Studies that incorporate an intervention to change physical activity show much stronger effects on cognition and have been called for in the literature (Erickson et al., 2007). However, few if any studies compare two groups at different aerobic intensities, as compared to an aerobic versus either a sedentary condition (Lautenschlager et al., 2008; Muscari et al., 2009) or a stretching/toning/weight training condition (Colcombe et al., 2006; Erickson et al., 2011), and in a 2007 review, Kramer and Erickson call for more studies that examine “the interaction between fitness dose and cognitive maintenance” (Kramer &amp; Erickson, 2007).

In the context of a large randomized controlled exercise intervention study focused on executive function among healthy older adults, we had a unique opportunity to examine both well recognized and novel ROIs shown to exhibit significant presymptomatic changes among prodromal individuals in recent work (Gordon et al., 2018) in two groups exercising at different aerobic intensities. In this study, older adults with no current evidence of dementia were enrolled in a 16-week study of physical activity and cognitive function (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02068612; R01 AG43452–01A1), and for this analysis, it was hypothesized that physical activity would be associated with changes in the volume or thickness of the precuneus, insula, caudate, hippocampus, and putamen.

Materials and Method

Study Sample and Recruitment

Older adult participants were recruited from the Denver-Boulder area primarily through targeted mailings, electronic advertisements placed in campus bulletins, Craigslist, ResearchMatch, and on social media websites between April 2014 and November 2018. Flyers were also posted on the University of Colorado Boulder campus and at community centers and recreation centers. Participants were included in the study if they reported &lt;80 min per week of moderate-intensity physical activity in the last 6 months at screening, were physically capable of safely engaging in moderate-intensity exercise as assessed by the study physician, were able to successfully complete a peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) test without evidence of cardiac or other abnormalities, and made fewer than three errors on the Pfeiffer Mental Status test (Pfeiffer, 1975). Participants were excluded from the study if they were a heavy smoker (&gt;20 pack years), had uncontrolled diabetes (hemoglobin A1C &gt;7%) or diabetes treated by insulin or sulfonylureas, had uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg), had MRI contraindications or body size exceeding the capacity of the MRI, were taking antipsychotic medications, or had any of the following conditions: bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, or AD. All participants participated in an informed consent process and all recruitment, consent, and study procedures were conducted with the approval of the University of Colorado Boulder Institutional Review Board. Final participant flow is described in Figure 1.

Some changes were made to eligibility criteria after the commencement of the study to aid in recruitment efforts. First, the inclusionary age range was increased from 65 and older to 60 and older. Second, individuals with controlled diabetes who were not taking insulin or sulfonylureas, and individuals who reported a diagnosis of depression or anxiety from a doctor or therapist were allowed to participate. Finally, inclusion criteria was increased from a maximum of 60 min to a maximum of 80 min of physical activity per week. We also increased enrollment overall because of attrition and motion during MRI scanning.

Study Design

The data presented here were collected as part of a larger randomized controlled trial with multiple aims called Enhancing Function in Later Life: Exercise and Functional Network Connectivity. The overall aim of Enhancing Function in Later Life: Exercise and Functional Network Connectivity was to examine the relationship between changes in physical activity and changes in functional network connectivity, executive function, and self-reported cognitive, social, emotional, and financial functioning. Cognitive measures, as well as measures of social, emotional, and financial functioning were collected but are not included in the present analysis as the focus here is on physiological changes in the brain. This study was a between-subject randomized controlled trial with two conditions: moderate-intensity continuous training plus interval training (MICT+IT) or low-intensity continuous training (LICT). Sample size was selected to permit analysis of the hypotheses at a two-tailed alpha of .05 and power level of at least .80 following Cohen (Cohen, 1988). G*Power (version 3.0.3, Heinrich-Heine-Universität, Düsseldorf, Germany; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007) was utilized for the main power calculations. The larger trial from which these data come utilized three behavioral measurement points, and it is these three time points that were used in the power analysis. Using a small effect size (f = 10), two groups, three assessment points, and an average correlation of approximately 50 between assessment points, we estimated a minimum of 113 participants (approximately 56 per group) would be required. Our sample size thus exceeds minimum requirements for power.

Randomization and masking.

Study staff generated a random assignment table for each gender using a random number generator. Upon completion of consent and assent, a research assistant enrolled and block-randomized participants by gender to either the LICT or MICT+IT intervention. Given the nature of behavioral trials, it was not possible for participants to be fully blind to condition. However, they were blind to the exact nature of the other exercise condition as well as the study hypotheses.

Training protocol.

Both groups were asked to exercise three times per week for 16 weeks for approximately 30 min each session. Exercise sessions were supervised by trained research assistants. Heart rate was monitored continuously during exercise sessions to assess adherence. Participants were fitted with a heart rate monitor (Polar T31; Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) during exercise sessions, and predominantly exercised on the treadmill; however, participants with orthopedic limitations or balance concerns were allowed to exercise on an elliptical or cycle ergometer. The exercise programs were designed to have similar contact time across conditions, help participants get closer to achieving current physical activity recommendations, and were adapted from exercise interventions effective at improving cardiopulmonary fitness (American College of Sports Medicine, 2018; Fu et al., 2013; Roxburgh, Nolan, Weatherwax, &amp; Dalleck, 2014). The MICT+IT program was progressive in design, increasing in intensity and frequency of intervals to make it tolerable to older adults (DeSouza et al., 2000; Fu et al., 2013; Rognmo, Hetland, Helgerud, Hoff, &amp; Slørdahl, 2004; Roxburgh et al., 2014; Tanaka et al., 2000). The MICT+IT group performed approximately 2 min of warm-up at the beginning of each exercise session. During the first 3 weeks of the program, participants were asked to exercise for 30 min at 60% of their previously determined heart rate maximum (HRmax; e.g., a moderate level of exertion). During Weeks 4–6, participants began interval training during one session per week. Interval training included 15 min of exercise at 75–80% HRmax, followed by 3 × 3 min intervals at 85–95% HRmax. Each interval was separated by 2 min of active recovery. Noninterval sessions included 30 min at 75–80% HRmax. During Weeks 7–9, participants completed interval training two times per week. In Weeks 10–16, interval training was completed three times per week. Participants were allowed to cooldown for approximately 5 min, or until heart rate returned to resting values. The LICT group exercised for 30 min at 50% of HRmax (e.g., a “low” level of exertion) for all 16 weeks. If the target heart rate for LICT participants was too low to be realistically achieved, then LICT participants were asked to walk at their normal walking pace. All participants included in the present analyses in both groups could complete the entire exercise session at the beginning of the exercise intervention. Participants were allowed additional time after the 16 weeks to complete missed exercise sessions.

Measures

Cardiopulmonary fitness.

The VO2peak was assessed before and after the exercise intervention using an incremental graded exercise test to exhaustion with breath-by-breath gas collection (MGC Diagnostics Ultima; MGC Diagnostics Corporation, St. Paul, MN) on a motorized treadmill (Full Vision Inc.; Trackmaster Treadmills, Newton, KS). While maximum oxygen consumption is defined as “the highest rate of oxygen uptake and utilization by the body during intense, maximal exercise” that is possible for an individual to achieve (Cade et al., 2018), VO2peak is the highest value of VO2 that an individual reaches on a specific test of high-intensity exercise. VO2peak was used as an objective measure of fitness as it is not uncommon for untrained study subjects to tire before reaching the VO2 plateau requirements to measure VO2 max. A modified Balke protocol was used (American College of Sports Medicine, 2013), where treadmill speed remained constant and grade was increased by 2% every 2 min until exhaustion. A treadmill speed was selected to elicit approximately 70% of age predicted maximum heart rate and a rating of perceived exertion of 13 (Borg; 6–20 scale; Borg, 1970). Heart rate was continuously monitored using a 12-lead electrocardiogram. VO2peak was calculated as the highest 30 s average during the test. Two participants completed the VO2peak assessment on a cycle ergometer (Lode Excalibur; Lode, Groningen, The Netherlands) due to an orthopedic limitation or a balance concern on the treadmill. The tests began at a resistance of 0 W and increased by 20–25 W every 2 min until exhaustion.

Structural neuroimaging.

The MRI data collection took place at the Intermountain Neuroimaging Consortium at the University of Colorado Boulder. Scan data were acquired on a Siemens 3T MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil. Scan data acquired prior to April 2016 were collected on a TIM Trio system (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany). In April/May 2016, the Trio system was upgraded to a Prismafit system; data acquired after May 2016 were collected on this system. Within participants, the scanner system remained constant; no participants had initial scan sessions on the Trio system and follow-up scan sessions on the Prismafit system. Scanner instability and quality control on a phantom were monitored weekly. For optimal contrast between gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid at 3T, a multi-echo magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence was utilized. Acquisition parameters were: repetition time/echo time/ inversion time (TR/TE/TI) = 2,530/1.64/1,200 ms, flip angle = 7°, FOV = 256 × 256 mm, Slab thickness = 192 mm, matrix size = 256 × 256, 3D voxel resolution = 1 × 1 × 1 mm, pixel bandwidth = 651 Hz, and total scan time = 6 min 3 s. To estimate and reduce radio frequency inhomogeneities and spatial distortion, a field map was also acquired: TR/TE = 400 ms/4.92 ms, field of view = 238 × 238 mm, matrix size = 68 × 68, in-plane voxel resolution = 3.5 × 3.5 × 3.55 mm, 48 slices, total scan time = 54 s.

Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation were performed with the Freesurfer image analysis suite (Laboratory for Computational Neuroimaging, Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Charlestown, MA). The technical details of these procedures are described in prior publications (Dale, Fischl, &amp; Sereno, 1999; Dale &amp; Sereno, 1993; Fischl, Liu, &amp; Dale, 2001; Fischl et al., 2002; Fischl, Salat, et al., 2004; Fischl, van der Kouwe, et al., 2004; Fischl, Sereno, &amp; Dale, 1999; Fischl, Sereno, Tootell, &amp; Dale, 1999; Han et al., 2006; Jovicich et al., 2006; Reuter, Rosas, &amp; Fischl, 2010; Reuter, Schmansky, Rosas, &amp; Fischl, 2012; Ségonne et al., 2004). Briefly, this processing includes motion correction (Reuter et al., 2010), removal of non-brain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure (Ségonne et al., 2004), automated Talairach transformation, segmentation of the subcortical white matter and deep gray matter volumetric structures (Fischl et al., 2002, 2004a), intensity normalization (Sled, Zijdenbos, &amp; Evans, 1998), tessellation of the gray matter white matter boundary, automated topology correction (Fischl et al., 2001; Segonne, Pacheco, &amp; Fischl, 2007), and surface deformation following intensity gradients to optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class (Dale et al., 1999; Dale &amp; Sereno, 1993; Fischl &amp; Dale, 2000).

Once the cortical models are complete, a number of deformable procedures can be performed for further data processing and analysis including surface inflation (Fischl, Sereno, &amp; Dale, 1999), registration to a spherical atlas which is based on individual cortical folding patterns to match cortical geometry across subjects (Fischl, Sereno, Tootell, &amp; Dale, 1999), parcellation of the cerebral cortex into units with respect to gyral and sulcal structure (Desikan et al., 2006; Fischl, van der Kouwe, et al., 2004), and creation of a variety of surface-based data including maps of curvature and sulcal depth. This method uses both intensity and continuity information from the entire three dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) volume in segmentation and deformation procedures to produce representations of cortical thickness, calculated as the closest distance from the gray/white boundary to the gray/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) boundary at each vertex on the tessellated surface (Fischl &amp; Dale, 2000). The maps are created using spatial intensity gradients across tissue classes and are therefore not simply reliant on absolute signal intensity. The maps produced are not restricted to the voxel resolution of the original data, thus are capable of detecting submillimeter differences between groups. Procedures for the measurement of cortical thickness have been validated against histological analysis (Rosas et al., 2002) and manual measurements (Kuperberg et al., 2003; Salat et al., 2004). Freesurfer morphometric procedures have been demonstrated to show good test–retest reliability across scanner manufacturers and across field strengths (Han et al., 2006; Reuter et al., 2012).

Analysis

To test the hypothesis that physical activity caused changes in the volume or thickness of our ROIs, we conducted a series of random coefficient regression analyses (Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2013) using the MIXED procedure in SAS (version 6.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). In each model, the volume or thickness of the region of interest was regressed on time (preexercise and postexercise), exercise condition (MICT-IT or LICT), and the time-by-condition interaction. In the models testing effects of exercise on volume, we included total intracranial volume, age, and relative VO2peak as covariates. In the models testing effects of exercise on thickness, we included age and relative VO2peak as covariates. Prior to analyses, participant characteristics were examined at baseline to inform covariates that would be modeled in relation to ROIs. Gender was highly correlated with intracranial volume (r = .63; male = 1, female = 0, p &lt; .001) and VO2peak (r = .44, p &lt; .001). Given the importance of controlling for intracranial volume in neuroimaging structure results, as well as the lack of a theoretical rationale for controlling for gender, models did not control for gender. VO2peak was moderately correlated with age (r = −.36, p &lt; .001) and ICV (r = .32, p &lt; .001), suggesting no concern with multicollinearity. Age was uncorrelated with ICV (r = .13, p = .310). Thus, covariates were age, VO2peak, and ICV.

Results

Enrolled participants included 273 older adults living in the Denver-Boulder area. Of those, 63 were excluded after being deemed physically incapable of safely engaging in moderate exercise by the study physician, and 49 participants were lost to attrition. A total of 197 older adults (124 females and 73 males) were randomly assigned to and began either LICT or MICT+IT. About 186 participants completed the baseline MRI scan. A total of 149 participants completed the exercise program. Participants in the LICT group completed 98.3% of exercise sessions in 17.6 weeks. Average heart rate during exercise in the LICT group was 66.2% of HRmax. Participants in the MICT+IT group completed 98.0% of exercise sessions in 18.2 weeks. Average heart rate during exercise after the first 3 weeks in the MICT+IT group when not completing interval training was 79.5% of HRmax. The average heart rate achieved during intervals was 88.2% of HRmax. A total of 149 participants completed the follow-up MRI scan. Participant characteristics for the 149 participants included in these analyses are further described in Table 1. Fifty-one participants assigned to the LICT and 59 participants assigned to the MICT+IT group reached VO2max at baseline preexercise, which was not significantly different between group (p = .506). At follow-up, 54 participants in the LICT and 53 participants in the MICT+IT group reached VO2max, which was also not significantly different between groups (p = .301). At baseline, participants in the LICT group achieved an average VO2peak of 25.11 ml·kg−1·min−1 (standard error of measurement [SEM] = 0.631) prior to exercise and achieved an average VO2 peak of 25.06 ml·kg−1·min−1 (SEM = 0.630) after exercise training. While at baseline, participants in the MICT+IT group achieved an average VO2peak of 24.747 ml·kg−1·min−1 (SEM = 0.586) prior to exercise and achieved an average VO2peak of 26.32 ml·kg−1·min−1 (SEM = 0.605) after exercise training. Overall, there was a significant time × condition interaction, F(1, 142) = 24.37, p &lt; .001.

The ROIs of interest are shown in Figure 2. The means values for volumes and thicknesses at preexercise versus postexercise for both groups are presented in Table 2 along with the fixed effects tests for changes over time and the time-by-condition interaction. In general, there were very few significant effects of exercise on the volume or thickness of any of the structures examined. Where there seemed to be some signal was in effects on the hippocampus, though effects were mixed and in one case not in the direction that has been shown in previous research. For the right hippocampus, size decreased in both exercise conditions such that the effect of time was significant (p = .007) but the interaction with condition was not (p = .651). For the left hippocampus, size decreased in the LICT condition but increased slightly in the MICT+IT condition, though this interactive effect was only at the trend level (p = .067). Finally, there was a significant time-by-condition interaction for the thickness of the left insula such that thickness increased in the LICT condition and decreased in the MICT+IT condition (p = .036). Importantly, each of these effects was small and did not survive corrections for multiple testing.

Discussion

In this study, the aim was to examine whether structural changes exhibited in selected ROIs shown in an autosomal dominant AD cohort to exhibit structural changes 10 or more years prior to symptom onset would change in response to exercise in a sample of healthy older adults. In other words, this was an exploratory analysis of potential new preventive intervention targets in relation to physical activity. It was hypothesized that physical activity would be associated with changes in the volume or thickness in the precuneus, insula, caudate, hippocampus, and putamen. In contrast, our results demonstrated few significant changes, in inconsistent directions and that were limited to the hippocampus and left insula.

We speculate that one reason for our effects not being consistent with other prior exercise and cognitive aging literature stems from our choice of exercise intervention conditions. For example, prior studies have compared low-intensity aerobic activity to stretching and/or toning (Colcombe et al., 2006; Erickson et al., 2011) or compared exercise to a no-exercise control condition (Lautenschlager et al., 2008; Muscari et al., 2009). By contrast, this study compared two aerobic interventions at different intensities. Furthermore, while we examined some ROIs common to exercise research with older adults (e.g., the hippocampus) we also included ROIs that are comparatively less studied (e.g., insula and precuneus). It should be noted that other groups are also starting to investigate regions such as the precuneus (Daamen et al., 2020; Jia, Li, Li, Liang, &amp; Fu, 2019) or insula (Anderson, Ren, Baran, Zhang, &amp; Lin, 2019; Mihaescu et al., 2019) in relation to cognitive decline, with some others in relation to physical activity. Thus, while we had ample justification to explore whether new targets for the prevention of cognitive decline not previously addressed in the literature might warrant further examination, it may simply be that these areas are not responsive to changes in physical activity.

It was noted previously that the effects of fitness training on cognitive function are strongest for executive function (Bunce &amp; Murden, 2006; Kramer &amp; Willis, 2002; Yu et al., 2013), thus the positive relationship demonstrated here between physical activity and insula volume and thickness are significant to the study of aging and cognition. Executive function is thought to centrally regulate social, emotional, and economic functioning (Baggetta &amp; Alexander, 2016; Friedman et al., 2006; Miyake et al., 2000), while the insular cortex has been strongly associated with this second domain of emotion, regulating the “processing of uncertainty,” and the facilitation of affective learning (Singer et al., 2009). Thus, maintenance of insula structures through protective mechanisms such as exercise may help older adults to sustain balanced emotional states later in life.

The inconsistent relationship between hippocampal volume and fitness is not as easily contextualized. While there is a body of research supporting a positive connection between hippocampus and fitness, the results have not always been consistent (Kelly et al., 2014), and data from very healthy nonsedentary older adults are relatively scarce. Some research among “super agers” has even demonstrated that older adults may be able to draw on cognitive reserve and other protective factors to maintain normal function despite significant structural changes (Goldberg, 2019), and that structural neuropathology may be nearly irrelevant for individuals who potentially benefit from neuroprotective factors not examined here. This analysis was limited to structural brain changes over relatively short duration, and examination of the extensive set of cognitive assessments collected in this larger project is beyond the scope of this paper, which focuses on structural changes in response to physical activity at different intensities. Thus, the data are unable to answer the broader question of whether those individuals with structural degradation in the hippocampus also exhibited differences in cognitive function.

Among this study’s notable strengths is the novel inclusion of a high-intensity interval training condition, which allows us to examine the effects of different exercise intensity levels on potential changes in brain volume. Prior work has tended to include only a single aerobic exercise condition (ten Brinke et al., 2015), often focusing on relationships between lower intensity exercise and brain volume (Varma, Chuang, Harris, Tan, &amp; Carlson, 2015). However, the lack of differentiation between the two exercise conditions could also explain our lack of findings with regard to differences in the effects of high-versus low-intensity exercise.

This study also had methodological limitations worth noting. Critically, the study included a nonclinical population who were not necessarily at increased risk for AD or cognitive decline. It is possible that the effects of aerobic exercise on these particular brain structures would emerge more strongly in a clinical or high-risk population. The study also lacks a no-exercise control group who may have exhibited comparatively greater structural changes than the sample described here, as demonstrated by other studies which include “no exercise” groups (Rosano et al., 2017). This study was also conducted in the Boulder area, which has often been rated among the “healthiest” communities in the United States by Gallup polls (Riffkin, 2014), meaning that the older adults who participated are likely very healthy as well, thus potentially impacting generalizability to other regions. In addition, there was very little variance in education level in our sample and most had a bachelor’s degree or more, thus inclusion of education as a covariate did not alter our results as well as the generalizability of our sample. Given that the analyses were exploratory, the multiple correction approach was not taken, and anterior and posterior hippocampus structural measurements were not available for analysis. Finally, the study included only 4 months of supervised exercise. A longer experimental period or a long-term follow-up may be better suited to explore associations between physical activity and ROI thickness or volume. For example, Erickson and colleagues demonstrated associations between hippocampal volume and moderate-intensity exercise, but the intervention lasted for 12 months (Erickson et al., 2011).

Conclusions

Future studies should examine the effects of exercise at different intensities on brain structure in high-risk (e.g., an autosomal dominant AD cohort or individuals with a family history of AD or cognitive decline), clinical populations, or very healthy, nonsedentary older adults; should ideally follow subjects for a longer period of time; and should potentially include a “no exercise” control group.
