Background:

Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are crucial for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring once disease modifying therapies become available.

Objective:

This study aims to quantify the forward magnetization transfer rate (kfor) map from brain tissue water to macromolecular protons and use it to identify the brain regions with abnormal kfor in AD and AD progression.

Methods:

From the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) cognition study, magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) was acquired at baseline from 63 participants, including 20 normal controls (NC), 18 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 25 AD subjects. Of those, 53 participants completed a follow-up MRI scan and were divided into four groups: 15 stable NC, 12 NC-to-MCI, 12 stable MCI, and 14 MCI/AD-to-AD subjects. kfor maps were compared across NC, MCI, and AD groups at baseline for the cross-sectional study and across four longitudinal groups for the longitudinal study.

RESULTS:

We found a lower kfor in the frontal gray matter (GM), parietal GM, frontal corona radiata (CR) white matter (WM) tracts, frontal and parietal superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) WM tracts in AD relative to both NC and MCI. Further, we observed progressive decreases of kfor in the frontal GM, parietal GM, frontal and parietal CR WM tracts, and parietal SLF WM tracts in stable MCI. In the parietal GM, parietal CR WM tracts, and parietal SLF WM tracts, we found trend differences between MCI/AD-to-AD and stable NC.

CONCLUSION:

Forward magnetization transfer rate is a promising biomarker for AD diagnosis and progression.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older adults and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered as a transitional clinical phase between normal brain aging and AD [1]. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that AD involves abnormalities in both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). Structural MRI demonstrated the discriminative and predictive power of atrophy in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex and ventricular enlargement [2–4]. Perfusion MRI detected compromised cerebral blood flow in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, parietal, hippocampus, temporal, and frontal regions [5, 6]. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) assessed brain microstructural changes and reported integrity disruption of WM pathways in corona radiata, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum for individuals with preclinical AD, such as those with subjective cognitive decline [7], positive amyloid β protein levels [8], and clinically diagnosed AD [9–11].

Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) evaluates brain microstructure in both GM and WM and has been used in the detection of AD. MTI includes the techniques of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), T1ρ, and magnetization transfer (MT) weighted MRI [12, 13]. MT results from dipolar coupling and 1H exchange between tissue water and macromolecular proton compartments [14]. Macromolecules like proteins cannot be imaged with conventional MRI due to their very short T2 values [15]. However, macromolecules can be interrogated through their interaction with tissue water. For example, the off-resonance RF excitation of the macromolecular protons changes the relaxation times and magnetization in the tissue water proton pool. The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) can be derived from water proton images with and without off-resonance RF saturation and it was associated with axonal attenuation and myelin content [16–18]. MTR is reduced in AD in the whole brain [19–21], GM [20, 22], WM [22], hippocampus [19, 23, 24], and medial temporal lobes [20]. However, in order to increase the reliability of the measurements, MTR was exclusively assessed in specific regions of interest. This means that the investigators may have excluded regions for analysis in order to optimize power in the other regions. In addition, MTR is affected by the RF excitation amplitude, frequency offset, duty cycle, the acquisition parameters, and tissue properties. Therefore, it is preferable to measure voxel-level MT-related intrinsic tissue properties, e.g., the forward magnetization transfer rate (kfor) map from tissue water to macromolecular protons, that are independent of the details of the data acquisition [25].

In this study, we developed a method to quantify the kfor map on a voxel-by-voxel basis and assessed the sensitivity of the kfor map in AD diagnosis and progression without a priori hypotheses regarding which regions would be affected in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. The MTI data were acquired to measure tissue T1 when the arterial spin labeling pulse sequence was applied on upstream blood vessels [26–28]. Preliminary results of MT effects of the arterial spin labeling sequence were reported [29]. The resulting kfor was used to investigate the extent of microstructural damage of brain GM and WM regions from the entire AD progression spectrum: normal controls (NC), MCI, and AD.

METHOD

Theory

The T1 value observed in the brain after macromolecular saturation (T1sat) can be modeled as [30–32]: [1] 1T1sat=1T1t+fλ+kfor

where T1t is the T1 of brain tissue water protons, f is the perfusion in ml/(100 g·s), λ is the brain-blood partition coefficient (typically 0.9 ml blood/g brain tissue) [33], kfor is the forward magnetization transfer rate for tissue to macromolecular water protons, and is a measure of tissue health. It is worth noting that Eq. [1] is true only when the macromolecular pool is fully saturated.

The T1 value without macromolecular saturation (T1nosat) is given by [31, 32]: [2] 1T1nosat=1T1t+fλ

kfor can be derived from the subtraction of Eq. [2] from Eq. [1] as: [3] kfor=1T1sat−1T1nosat

Participants

From 2002–2013, the Cardiovascular Health Study Cognition Study (CHS-CS) [34] measured cerebral blood flow, brain morphology and tissue health in 195 elderly volunteers at baseline. During the study, the volunteers progressed from normal cognition (NC) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Volunteers received follow-up MRIs during the course of the study. The subjects were classified as NC, MCI, or AD based on cognitive status adjudication [34] without verification for deposition of beta-amyloid. The CHS-CS diagnostic criteria for MCI in the study included both MCI-amnestic type and MCI-multiple cognitive domain type [34]. Sixty-three age matched elderly volunteers from the CHS-CS study, including 20 NC (mean age ± SD, 84.40 ± 4.38 years), 18 MCI (mean age ± SD, 84.77 ± 3.01 years) and 25 early AD (mean age ± SD, 84.40 ± 3.30 years) were scanned using MRI to measure MT effects at baseline. Of those, 53 participants completed a follow-up MRI scan to measure the same MT effects as the baseline. The longitudinal follow-up scans can be divided into four groups: 15 stable NC (follow-up time ± SD: 2.75 ± 1.90 years), 12 NC-to-MCI (follow-up time ± SD: 3.08 ± 2.20 years), 12 stable MCI (follow-up time ± SD: 2.69 ± 1.81 years), and 14 MCI/AD-to-AD (follow-up time ± SD: 1.91 ± 1.37 years) subjects. Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) scores [35] were used to assess general cognitive ability for the population. It has been shown that 3MSE scores have increased sensitivity in detecting dementia in comparison to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [36, 37].

MRI Protocol

All MRIs were performed on a dedicated GE Signa 1.5 T MRI (Version LX) at the University of Pittsburgh MR Research Center after informed consent. An inversion recovery sequence was performed with or without off-resonance macromolecular saturation. The images were acquired using multi-slice echo planar imaging (EPI) (field of view = 24 × 24 cm, matrix = 64 × 64, 19 slices, Thickness/Spacing: 5/0 mm, TE/TR: 21/9000 ms, 90°, 977 Hz/pixel) with twelve inversion times (TIs) for the first slice from: 0.025, 0.11, 0.195, 0.28, 0.365, 0.535, 0.705, 0.875, 1.3, 1.725, 2.15, and 2.575s (sample sets of 12 TI images without and with off-resonance saturation are shown in Fig. 1A and Fig. 1B). Images were acquired using a quadrature transceiver RF coil. The 19 slices were acquired sequentially from superior to inferior during a 1 s multi-slice acquisition. Therefore, TIs varied slice by slice. The off-resonance macromolecular saturation was administered between the inversion pulse and the image acquisition, using a pulse train with an input amplitude of 3.5 μT at 92% duty cycle and 85 ms repetition time and a frequency offset of 10.6 kHz below the water frequency. This frequency offset, originally designed to measure the MT effects of the continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) sequence, is therefore larger than the 1–3 kHz frequency offset in typical MTI [38–41]. T1 maps were quantified from the images acquired with and without macromolecular saturation, referred to as T1sat and T1nosat maps respectively.

Coronal T1-weighted three-dimensional anatomical images were acquired with spoiled gradient-echo (SPGR) images (field of view = 24 × 19 cm, matrix = 256 × 192, TE/TR = 5/25 ms, flip angle = 40°, slice thickness/gap = 1.5/0 mm, number of slices = 124, bandwidth = 63 Hz/pixel).

Image Analysis

Calculation of T1sat and T1nosat

To correct for the subject motion, SPM12 “realign” was used to align all of the 12 images acquired with and without off-resonance saturation. In principle, T1sat at each single voxel can be calculated by fitting the inversion recovery signals as a function of the TIs. [4] s(TI)=P(1−2e−TI/T1sat)

where TI is the inversion time, s(TI) is the signal at inversion time TI, P is the proton density, and T1sat is the T1 value measured after the application of off-resonance RF pulse. Eq. [4] represents a two-parameter fit that may assume perfect inversion that is unrealistic when the B1 field is inhomogeneous. However, combining the Eq. [4] with the signal-weighted inversion time (see Eq. [5]) one can calculate T1sat numerically, resulting in better results than a nominal three-parameter fit.

The signal-weighted inversion time is calculated as below. [5] WI(T1sat)=∑i=112TIi s(TIi)∑i=112s(TIi)

This simple first moment noniterative algorithm proved to be very robust. The signal-weighted inversion time, WI, was numerically calculated using Eq. [4] for a range of T1sat. WI was found to be a function consisting of two monotonic functions of T1sat with a singular point T1max, as shown in Fig. 2A. These two monotonic curves can be reorganized to form a single monotonic curve (Fig. 2B), which could be numerically inverted to calculate T1sat from WI. T1nosat was calculated using the same method as T1sat but with the signal images acquired without macromolecular saturation. Sample images of T1nosat and T1sat are shown in Fig. 1C and Fig. 1D.

Calculation of kfor

The realigned 12 image sets with and without macromolecular saturation were averaged to calculate mean images, respectively. For each subject, the mean realigned image with macromolecular saturation was co-registered to the mean realigned image without saturation and the co-registration parameters were used to transform the T1sat map to align with the T1nosat map. kfor was calculated from the aligned T1sat and T1nosat maps using Eq. [3]. To eliminate extreme values in these kfor maps, the signal less than −0.1 and greater than 0.6 was assigned to −0.1 and 0.6, respectively. Although kfor should not be negative in general, those negative values were left in kfor maps to avoid violating noise distribution. Sample images of T1nosat - T1sat and kfor are shown in Fig. 1E and Fig. 1F. The large frequency offset in the pulse sequence cannot fully saturate the macromolecular pool, and therefore the measured kfor will be underestimated.

Normalization of T1sat, T1nosat, and kfor maps

Anatomical SPGR images were segmented into GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) probability maps using SPM12’s “segment” tool. The GM probability map was co-registered to the mean realigned image without saturation so the transformed GM probability map were aligned with T1sat, T1nosat, and kfor maps. The transformed GM probability map was registered to the GM template in the standard MNI brain, and the warping parameters were used to transform the T1sat, T1nosat, and kfor maps to the standard MNI brain space.

Statistical Analysis

Demographic and neuropsychological data were analyzed with MATLAB, version R2019a. All tests were 2-tailed and the significance was set for p &lt; 0.05. Normality was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Demographic and neuropsychological characteristics for the NCs, MCIs, ADs at baseline and for stable-NCs, NC-to-MCIs, stable-MCIs and MCI/AD-to-ADs at follow-up were compared using either two-sample t-tests (for normal distribution) or Mann-Whitney nonparametric U-tests (for non-normal distribution) for continuous variables and χ2 test for categorical variables.

Generation of global regions of interest (ROIs) (whole brain, GM, and WM)

The global ROIs (whole brain, GM, and WM) were obtained by thresholding the corresponding SPM a priori probability map in the standard space with probability greater than 0.3, 0.8, and 0.95, respectively. The selected threshold levels allow us to minimize partial volume effects and have a sufficient number of voxels for reliable averaging. Regional kfor values were calculated as the median over each brain global ROI.

Voxel-level analysis on kfor maps at baseline

kfor maps were compared voxel-by-voxel among the three baseline groups using SPM’s general linear model (GLM), controlling for age and gender. Because of partial coverage, only the voxels in which kfor maps had valid values (intersection area from both T1sat and T1nosat maps) from all the participants were analyzed. The analyzed area in the SPM analysis is shown in Supplement 1A. A voxel-level p-value of 0.01 was used to threshold the statistical maps. A cluster-level p-value of 0.05 was used to guard against false positives from multiple comparisons. The MCI and AD-affected regions were used for further region-based analyses.

Voxel-level analyses on longitudinal changes of kfor

The longitudinal changes of kfor were compared among the stable-NCs, NC-to-MCIs, stable-MCIs and MCI/AD-to-ADs using a multiple linear regression. The longitudinal change of kfor maps for each subject was calculated between the baseline and follow-up scans and compared voxel-by-voxel among the four longitudinal groups using SPM’s GLM, controlling for age, gender and years between baseline and follow-up scans. The analyzed area in the SPM analysis is shown in Supplement 1B. A voxel-level p-value of 0.01 was used to threshold the statistical maps. A cluster-level p-value of 0.05 was used to guard against false positives from multiple comparisons. A more liberal voxel-level threshold of p &lt; 0.025 was used to view the trends of longitudinal changes, although a corrected cluster-level threshold of p &lt; 0.05 was still used for comparisons.

Region-level analyses on longitudinal changes of kfor

Regional kfor comparisons were performed among the four longitudinal groups for the whole brain, GM, WM, and MCI/AD-affected regions detected in the voxel-level cross-sectional analysis, controlling for age, gender and follow-up time between baseline and follow-up scans. Post hoc regional analyses were also performed to determine whether the regions detected in the voxel-level longitudinal analysis had better sensitivity in group differences.

RESULTS

Demographic and cognitive Information

Table 1 summarizes the subjects’ demographic and cognitive data for the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. For the cross-sectional analysis, no significant difference was found for age and gender across the NC, MCI, and AD groups. The AD group showed significantly lower 3MSE scores than the NC and MCI groups. For the longitudinal analysis, no significant difference was found for age, gender, follow-up time, and changes in 3MSE scores across the stable-NC, NC-to-MCI, stable-MCI, and MCI/AD-to-AD groups. The MCI/AD-to-AD group showed significantly lower 3MSE scores at baseline compared to the stable-NC, NC-to-MCI and stable-MCI groups.

Cross-sectional comparisons of T1nosat, T1sat, and kfor in the global ROIs

T1nosat values were not significantly different in the whole brain (561 ± 119 ms), GM (957 ± 246 ms), and WM (688 ± 133 ms) among the NC, MCI and AD groups. T1sat values were significantly higher in WM for ADs vs. NCs (p = 0.0061; 672 ± 158 ms vs. 556 ± 92 ms) and for ADs vs. MCIs (p = 0.022; 672 ± 158 ms vs. 560 ± 142 ms), but not different for whole brain (529 ± 97 ms) and GM (978 ± 247 ms) among the NC, MCI and AD groups. kfor values were significantly lower in WM for ADs vs. NCs (p = 0.0049; 0.17 ± 0.16/s vs. 0.35 ± 0.23/s) and for ADs vs. MCIs (p = 0.00087; 0.17 ± 0.16/s vs. 0.36 ± 0.17/s) and in the whole brain for ADs vs. MCIs (p = 0.0041; 0.16 ± 0.11/s vs. 0.27 ± 0.11/s), but not different for GM (0.065 ± 0.036/s) among the NC, MCI and AD groups.

Cross-sectional voxel-wise group comparisons

Example kfor maps from each group of NC, MCI, and AD subjects are shown in Fig. 3. Compared to the NC group, the AD group had significantly decreased kfor in three clusters: the left corona radiata WM region (cluster 1, in green circle, p = 0.044), right corona radiata extending to superior longitudinal fasciculus WM regions and right frontal lobe extending to precentral GM regions (cluster 2, in purple circle, p = 0.001) (Fig. 4A), and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus WM region and right postcentral, paracentral lobule and precuneus GM regions (cluster 3, p = 0.031) (Fig. 4B).

Compared to the MCI group, the AD group had significantly decreased kfor in two clusters: the left corona radiata, internal capsule, external capsule and corpus callosum WM region and left cingulum, putamen, precentral, insula, and superior medial frontal GM regions (cluster 4, in green circle, p &lt; 0.001), and the right corona radiata, external capsule, superior longitudinal fasciculus and internal capsule WM regions and putamen, insula, middle frontal, and right superior frontal GM regions (cluster 5, in purple circle, p &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 4C). Statistics of the clusters are listed in Table 2.

Longitudinal voxel-wise group comparisons

Compared to the stable-NC group, the stable-MCI group exhibited larger kfor decreases in the left corona radiata extending to the left superior longitudinal fasciculus WM regions (cluster 6, in green circle, p = 0.003) and the right corona radiata and right superior frontal GM regions (cluster 7, in purple circle, p = 0.017) (Fig. 5A–5B). No significant changes were observed for the other longitudinal groups for voxel-level p-value of 0.01. With less stringent voxel-level p-value of 0.025, compared to the stable-NC group, a symmetrical kfor decrease pattern of left and right sides was observed in the stable-MCI group (Supplementary Fig. 2); the MCI/AD-to-AD group exhibited a larger trend of kfor decreases in the corpus callosum, right superior longitudinal fasciculus, right corona radiata and cingulum WM regions and the left precuneus, posterior cingulate and left inferior parietal GM regions (cluster 8, p = 0.012) (Fig. 5C). Statistics of the clusters are listed in Table 3.

Longitudinal regional group comparisons

Longitudinal kfor decreases were observed significantly different from zero (p &lt; 0.001) on the global ROIs and the clusters 1–5 derived from the cross-sectional study. However, compared to the changes in the stable NC group, longitudinal kfor changes in the other groups were found only marginally different on the global ROIs and the cross-sectional clusters. Specifically, compared to the stable NC group, the stable MCI group exhibited marginally larger longitudinal kfor decreases in the whole brain (p = 0.068), cluster 2 (p = 0.080), and cluster 5 (p = 0.072). The MCI/AD-to-AD group had marginally larger longitudinal kfor decreases in the WM (p = 0.062), cluster 1 (p = 0.058), cluster 2 (p = 0.083) and cluster 5 (p = 0.085).

The regional kfor values in the clusters derived from the longitudinal voxel-wise analyses corroborated the voxel-level results and exhibited more significant changes. We used larger and symmetrical clusters 6–7 (voxel-level p value of 0.025) for the regional analyses. In cluster 6, significantly larger longitudinal kfor decreases were observed in the NC-to-MCI, stable MCI and MCI/AD-to-AD groups (Fig. 6, p = 0.05, p = 0.0006, and p = 0.0115 respectively) when compared to the stable NC group. In clusters 7 and 8, compared to the stable NC group, significantly larger longitudinal kfor decreases were observed only in the stable MCI group (Fig. 6, p = 0.0010 and p = 0.0078 for the clusters 7 and 8, respectively) and the MCI/AD-to-AD groups (Fig. 6, p = 0.0129 and p = 0.0008 for the clusters 7 and 8, respectively), while marginally larger longitudinal kfor decreases were observed in the NC-to-MCI group (Fig. 6, p = 0.0796 and p = 0.0719 for the clusters 7 and 8, respectively). Years between baseline and follow-up scans were significantly associated with the longitudinal changes in kfor (p &lt; 0.05).

DISCUSSION

We found lower kfor in the frontal GM, parietal GM, frontal corona radiata WM tracts, frontal and parietal superior longitudinal fasciculus WM tracts in ADs relative to both NCs and MCIs. From the longitudinal study, we also observed progressive decreases in kfor in the frontal GM, parietal GM, frontal and parietal corona radiata WM tracts, and parietal superior longitudinal fasciculus WM tracts in stable MCIs; and in the parietal GM, parietal corona radiata WM tracts, and parietal superior longitudinal fasciculus WM tracts in MCI/AD-to-ADs.

Lower kfor values were previously reported in the hippocampus, temporal lobe, posterior cingulate cortex, and parietal GM regions [42] and preselected WM fiber tracts [43] of AD patients. Lower kfor values in the WM tract were reported to differentiate MCI converters from stable MCIs [43]. Other quantitative MT parameters, such as the T2 of the restricted pool, fractional pool size, and the ratio of relaxation times of the free proton pool to restricted pool, were associated with AD [44, 45]. However, these quantitative MT parameters were mostly analyzed on predetermined regions of interest for increased signal-to-noise ratio. Our study explored voxel-wise kfor abnormalities in AD and AD progression and allowed accurate detection for abnormal kfor spatial locations related to AD without a priori hypotheses.

The detected abnormal kfor GM regions included the superior frontal GM, anterior cingulate, inferior parietal, posterior cingulate, and precuneus regions. These regions are consistent with regions with reduced cerebral blood flow [26, 27] and reduced glucose metabolism [46, 47] that are typically reported in AD. Due to its overlap with regions with blood flow and metabolic deficits, this finding supports that kfor is related to metabolic processes [48] and mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role in the pathophysiology of AD for GM damage [49]. N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a neuron-specific metabolite synthesized by the mitochondria, has been reported with significant reduction in the whole brain tissue of MCI patients [50]. The reduction of NAA in the MCI further supports energy impairment and mitochondrial dysfunction may be already evident before individuals are clinically demented [50, 51]. Energy impairment from mitochondrial dysfunction causes neuronal and axonal damage, and therefore reduces magnetization transfer effects. The abnormal kfor WM regions included the frontal and parietal corona radiata, and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Reduced kfor values in WM tracts of AD patients have been correlated to smaller fractional anisotropy values using DTI [43], which can be influenced by demyelination. Mitochondrial dysfunction was found to contribute to WM demyelination in multiple sclerosis [52, 53]. Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction may play a similar role in the pathophysiology of AD for WM damage. Although highly speculative, our study supports a uniform role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of AD.

We also observed kfor decreases in the whole brain and global WM in ADs relative to MCIs or NCs and longitudinal decreases of kfor in the whole brain and global WM in ADs and MCIs. Existing studies using MTR mostly focused on histogram analyses in large regions [19, 21, 22, 54, 55], such as the whole brain, GM, WM, and some hypothesized regions, such as hippocampal regions and deep GM regions. Our study supports the whole brain and global WM microstructure deficits in AD. An MTR study analyzed the frontal lobe and found reduced histogram properties in the region [21]. Therefore, our findings extend current microstructural deficits of AD to the frontal WM and parietal WM, and also specify the deficits in two WM tracts.

Only one longitudinal MTR study was found and it reported that AD patients had significant longitudinal decreases of MTR in the whole brain and all deep GM regions that were investigated over 12 months [55]. We extended these findings by demonstrating that the longitudinal decreases in kfor are significantly larger in stable MCIs and MCI/AD-to-ADs than in stable NCs, indicating that AD pathology accelerates kfor declines in frontal and parietal GM regions and WM tracts.

The frontal and parietal WM deficits in kfor are also in line with the locations for WM microvascular damage observed with mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy using DTI [56–58]. Altered mean diffusivity and free water signal fraction in the frontal WM and temporal WM regions have been significantly correlated with CSF biomarkers in AD [58]. We did not observe deficits in the kfor of the temporal region. However, the temporal region was located in the inferior portion of the imaging volume and only the overlapped regions covered across the subjects were analyzed. It is worth noting that anterior (frontal) corona radiata and posterior (parietal) corona radiata were listed as clusters with significant association with kfor declines. A DTI meta-analysis showed significant decreases of both WM volume and fractional anisotropy in corona radiata in ADs [10]. The alterations from both corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus WM tracts were also supported by longitudinal DTI analysis in AD [11, 59].

Years between baseline and follow-up scans were significantly associated with the longitudinal changes in kfor. Our results support the involvement of frontal and parietal GM regions and WM tracts (corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus) in the progression of AD, highlighting MTRs of those regions as promising biomarkers and disconnection of fibers as a potential mechanism.

This study has limitations, the most important of which is a consequence of the technical aspects of scanning and measuring magnetization transfer. Specifically, the data becomes less reliable in the more ventral aspects of the brain. in addition, we set the stringent criterion that each voxel must have representation from every subject in order to be included in the analyses. Therefore, the more ventral regions of the brain, most importantly including the inferior and middle temporal gyri, and the mesial temporal lobe including the hippocampus, were not included in the analyses. Consequently, there may be important, subtle changes in MTR in these regions, especially in the transition from normal cognition to MCI. For future studies we will need more focused protocols in order to examine these brain regions, but critically, we have derived a measure of magnetization transfer rate from a data set that was not designed for this purpose.

Second, the images acquired with and without macromolecular saturation were acquired at 1.5 T before the widespread availability of 3 T. We expect that MTI studies at 3 T can benefit from longer T1 relaxation times in addition to higher steady state magnetization. However, the method of continuous off-resonance saturation used in this study would probably not be practical at 3 T due its high specific absorption rate (SAR). Nevertheless, we were able to observe the kfor differences between NCs, MCIs, and ADs at 1.5 T.

Third, we had small sample sizes, especially for the longitudinal analysis. This limits the statistical power to detect longitudinal changes for the groups with large variations. The fourth longitudinal group was a combined group from the subjects who turned into AD from MCI stage and those who stayed in the AD stage, resulting from the small numbers of participants in these two categories. If repeated in a larger population, there is a potential for a better understanding of the full trajectory of disease progression using kfor.

Fourth, no differences were found among the AD progression groups (NC-to-MCI, stable-MCI and MCI/AD-to-AD groups) thus changes in kfor during the middle and late stages of AD remain incomplete. The lack of sensitivity may be partially attributed to the reduced sensitivity from the large RF frequency offset used in our protocol. Future studies should evaluate the kfor maps using the optimal sequence design (lower RF frequency offset and short RF duration). In addition, the participants were classified into NC, MCI, or AD based on neuropsychological assessments. The lack of neurobiological definition of AD in the study may have mixed subjects with AD pathology (e.g., those with positive beta-amyloid) with those with severe cognitive deficits, leading to reduced sensitivity in kfor longitudinal changes. Unfortunately, neither beta-amyloid nor tau PET imaging was available at the beginning of the CHS-CS.

Fifth, the range of kfor is less than 0.6/s, which is on the lower side of the kfor ranges from the literature, e.g., 1.35 ± 0.19 /s for a rat study [32] and 0.51 ~ 1.43 /s for a human study [30]. The low kfor values result from the large RF frequency offset only partially saturating the macromolecules [60]. Hence, the kfor values we presented are relative, not absolute. In addition, the kfor values are biased by spatially-dependent B1 inhomogeneities, inversion times, and off-resonance saturation including excitation crosstalk. 3D acquisitions would eliminate the bias from the slice-dependent inversion times and excitation crosstalk but could exacerbate spatially-dependent B1 inhomogeneities. Nevertheless, we assumed the systematic bias was consistent between individuals in the group analysis. We were able to observe the kfor changes in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies despite potentially reduced sensitivity associated with these biases.

Sixth, WM hyperintensities were not accounted for in the current analysis. WM hyperintensities are common in older adults with AD subjects having increased WM hyperintensity volume [54, 61]. AD subjects demonstrated decreased MTR in normal-appearing WM and even lower MTR in WM hyperintense regions [54]. Not accounting for WM hyperintensities in this study represents a potential limitation in understanding how different types of WM (normal-appearing WM and hyperintense WM) contributed to reduced kfor in AD.

CONCLUSION

Our study reveals that voxel-wise forward magnetization transfer rate maps are efficient in detecting GM and WM microstructural damage in AD diagnosis and AD progression. Future studies are needed to investigate the clinical relevance of kfor in posterior cingulate, precuneus, inferior parietal, anterior cingulate, and superior frontal GM regions and corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus WM tracts.

Fig. S2. Significant clusters identified from the voxel-based longitudinal group comparisons of kfor changes between the stable-NC and stable-MCI groups showed larger symmetric patterns when voxel-level threshold was increased to p = 0.025. These two clusters (circled in green and purple) together with cluster 8 above were selected as ROIs in the regional analysis.

(A) Theoretical graph of WI as a function of T1 (Equation [5], with T1sat replaced by T1 for generality), WI reaches its maximum value at T1max, (B) WI forms a monotonically increasing curve of T1 if the curve at [0 T1max] ms is shifted to the right of [T1max 4000] ms. WI is an inversible function except for the values within [WI(4000) WI(0)]. For the value of WI that falls into the range, T1 is assigned to 0 ms or 4000ms depending on whether WI is closer to WI(0) or WI(4000).

Fig. 4. Compared to the NC group, the AD group had significantly lower kfor values in three clusters: (A) the left corona radiata white matter region (cluster 1 in green circle), right corona radiata extending to superior longitudinal fasciculus white matter regions and right frontal lobe extending to precentral gray matter regions (cluster 2 in purple circle), (B) the right superior longitudinal fasciculus white matter region and at right postcentral, paracentral lobule and precuneus gray matter regions. Compared to the MCI group, the AD group had significantly lower kfor values in (C) two clusters: the left corona radiata and internal capsule white matter regions and left anterior cingulum and superior medial frontal gray matter regions (cluster 4 in green circle), and the right corona radiata and external capsule white matter regions and right superior frontal gray matter regions (cluster 5 in purple circle). The color bar stands for the range of t values.

Fig. 5. Compared to the stable-NC group, the stable-MCI group exhibited larger kfor decreases in (A) the left corona radiata extending to left superior longitudinal fasciculus white matter regions (cluster 6, in green circle) and (B) the right corona radiata and right superior frontal gray matter regions (cluster 7, in purple circle). The MCI/AD-to-AD group exhibited larger kfor decreases in (C) the corpus callosum, the right superior longitudinal fasciculus, right corona radiate and cingulum white matter regions and the left precuneus, and both sides of the posterior cingulum and left inferior parietal gray matter regions (cluster 8). The color bars stand for the range of t values.
