Purpose of Review:

To review sleep complaints reported in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, explore the relationship between sleep disturbances and subtypes of autoimmune encephalitis, and leverage knowledge concerning antibody-antigen specificity to inform the receptors, structures, and disseminated neural networks that contribute to sleep function in health and disease.

Recent Findings:

Autoimmune encephalitis is an inflammatory brain disorder characterized by the subacute onset of psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment, and focal neurologic deficits or seizures. Sleep disturbances are detected in a majority of patients systematically screened for sleep complaints, may be the presenting symptom in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, and may compromise recovery in patients with autoimmune encephalitis.

Summary:

Early recognition of specific sleep disturbances in patients with subacute changes in behavior or cognition may support the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. Similarly, recognition and treatment of sleep dysfunction in patients with known autoimmune encephalitis may speed recovery and improve long-term outcomes.

Introduction

Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is an inflammatory brain disorder characterized by the subacute onset of psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment, and focal neurologic deficits or seizures [1]. Although clinical findings are typically accompanied by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and characteristic findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cases without objective markers of inflammation are increasingly recognized in clinical practice [2, 3]. Early identification of affected patients is important, as early induction of first-line immunotherapies (i.e., high-dose methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin) is associated with better long-term outcomes [4–9]. Increased screening for AE has improved recognition of affected patients, with revised estimates of incidence and prevalence suggesting that AE may be as common as infectious encephalitis in developed countries [10, 11]. Increased attention has also contributed to a better understanding of the symptoms, signs, and comorbidities common in AE patients—including sleep disturbances.

As sleep symptoms are commonly elicited by targeted questioning of patients and bed-partners, it is easy to appreciate why sleep dysfunction may be overlooked in patients presenting with prominent cognitive changes, movement disorders, seizures, and other sequelae of a neuroinflammatory process. Accordingly, reports of sleep disorders in AE patients were initially limited to disparate collections of cases associated with dramatic symptoms [12, 13]. Sleep disturbances are now well-recognized in patients with specific subtypes of AE (i.e., AE associated with antibodies against IgLON5 [14, 15]), and in almost 75% of patients reported in a case series incorporating systematic screening for sleep complaints [16]. However, the types of sleep complaints, association with specific subtypes of AE, and contributions of sleep disturbances to the clinical presentation and long-term outcomes in recovering AE patients remain unknown.

Sleep disturbances in neurological disease and AE

Sleep disturbances are increasingly recognized as common manifestations of neurologic disease. Disease-specific compromise of networks important for sleep initiation and maintenance are presumed to underlie sleep disruption in Alzheimer disease [17–19], Parkinson disease [20, 21], and prionopathies [22, 23], with the potential that untreated sleep disruption may exacerbate both symptoms and pathological progression of these neurodegenerative diseases. Network disruption is also recognized in subtypes of AE [24–29], and may contribute to or arise from sleep disturbances in recovering patients. Untreated sleep disturbances may adversely affect the acute care of AE patients, worsening autonomic instability and challenging attempts to wean patients from mechanical ventilation. Over the long-term, sleep disorders may compromise recovery and return to meaningful function, representing a potentially treatable contributor to cognitive dysfunction in recovering patients [30]. For these reasons, systematic identification of sleep disturbances and further study of the interaction between neuroinflammatory disease and sleep is needed.

This review characterizes sleep disruptions in AE, summarizing findings from published cases with the goal of improving outcomes in AE patients through earlier recognition and treatment of sleep dysfunction. By leveraging antibody-antigen specificity we also aim to inform the receptors, structures, and disseminated neural networks that contribute to sleep function in health and disease.

Classification of AE based on autoantibody target

Although identification of autoantibodies in the serum and CSF are not required to diagnose AE [1], the discovery of disease-associated antibodies helps to define disease pathogenesis and to predict treatment responsiveness, long-term outcomes, and the risk of disease-associated malignancy (i.e., “paraneoplastic encephalitis”). In general, autoantibodies in AE may be divided into two categories based on the localization of the target antigen. In patients with AE associated with antibodies against cell-surface antigens (e.g., components of the voltage-gated potassium channel complex, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors [NMDAR], or amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors [AMPAR]) [31] neurological dysfunction is presumed to arise from the direct effects of antibody-antigen interactions rather than T-cell mediated neuronal involvement [31, 32], explaining the robust response to B-cell depleting therapies, and the inverse association between time-to-treatment and long-term outcomes [5, 8, 33]. By contrast, AE associated with antibodies against intracellular antigens (e.g., immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule 5 [IgLON5], ma1/ma2) are commonly associated with intraparenchymal invasion of inflammatory cells, including CD8-positive cytotoxic T-cells [34–37]. The risk of underlying malignancy is high, particularly in patients with multiple autoantibodies [38], and responsiveness to standard immunotherapies is low.

Sleep disturbances are reported in patients with antibodies against cell-surface or intracellular antigens (Table 1), and in patients with AE without detectable autoantibodies [16, 41, 61, 63, 64]. Although the association between the autoantibody subtype and sleep disturbances is unknown, a more complete description of the association between specific sleep complaints and various antibody-mediated causes of AE may inform the neuroanatomical underpinnings of sleep in health and disease. With this in mind, we review the clinical features, polysomnography (PSG) characteristics, and presumed etiology of sleep dysfunction in patients with AE associated with antibodies against cell-surface and intracellular antigens.

Sleep disruptions and polysomnography in AE with antibodies against cell-surface antigens

Voltage-gated potassium channel complex-associated autoantibodies

AE associated with antibodies against the leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) antigen of the voltage-gated potassium channel complex typically presents with memory impairment, confusion, and facial brachial dystonic seizures, although phenotypes are recognized with varying degrees of central, peripheral, and autonomic involvement [39]. Reported sleep complaints in LGI1-associated AE include insomnia, daytime hypersomnolence, sleep reversal, and dream enactment behavior [39–41, 65]. The frequency of insomnia varies from 12% [39, 40] to 50% in LGI1-associated AE cases [41], with the most extreme cases associated with complete absence of nocturnal sleep [41]. Daytime hypersomnolence is reported in 11% [39] to 14% [40] of cases, but may be considerably higher in some series [66]. Sleep reversal (a combination of nocturnal insomnia with daytime hypersomnolence) is also recognized [39]. Dream enactment behaviors are reported with a prevalence ranging from 5–53% [39, 41, 65], with REM sleep without atonia confirmed on PSG in subsets of patients [41, 65]. Dream enactment resolved or improved with immunosuppressive therapy in 60–80% of patients [41, 65, 66]. In addition to REM sleep without atonia, PSG may show reduced sleep efficiency in symptomatic patients [63, 65], with reductions in stage 3 (slow wave) sleep [41, 65] and REM sleep [41, 63, 65] that may be dramatic (e.g., absent recognizable sleep architecture [41]). Additional changes in sleep microarchitecture may also be appreciated, including decreased stage 2 sleep spindle density [67].

Morvan syndrome is an autoimmune disorder associated with peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (neuromyotonia), autonomic dysfunction (hyperhidrosis), and encephalopathy, which often presents with insomnia, dream enactment, and hallucinations [42, 43]. Most patients have antibodies against the contactin-associated protein (Caspr2) of the voltage-gated potassium channel complex, although Morvan syndrome is also described in patients with LGI1 autoantibodies [42]. When present, insomnia is often severe [42, 43], and may be the presenting symptom [44, 45]. It is unclear if decreased nocturnal sleep duration in these patients represents true decreased need for sleep, or if nocturnal insomnia is coupled with daytime hypersomnolence—with normal amount of sleep over the 24 hour day—but abnormal timing, suggesting a circadian rhythm sleep disorder. Agrypnia excitata (severe insomnia, confusion, motor agitation, and autonomic hyperactivity) has been described in Morvan syndrome [68], although the prevalence is unclear. Complex, quasi-purposeful nocturnal behaviors are also referenced in subsets of patients [12, 43], as well as sleep walking and sleep talking (3/29; 10% [43]). However, as PSG was not performed, it is unknown whether sleep complaints reflected disorders of arousal (in NREM sleep) or REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD).

In the selected patients with Caspr2 autoantibodies who underwent PSG, sleep architecture was severely distorted, with no K complexes, sleep spindles, or delta activity. Instead of typically cycling sleep stages, PSG showed brief REM sleep occurring directly from wake with 4–6 Hz theta activity intermixed with fast activity [12, 13]. Behaviorally, patients appeared calm, with sleep-like behavior admixed with periods of agitation and dream enactment arising from REM sleep without atonia [12, 13]. Both abnormal sleep behavior and sleep architecture may improve with immunomodulatory treatment—sometimes dramatically, as in one exemplar case with absent sleep architecture on pre-treatment PSG, who demonstrated near-complete return of normal background rhythm and sleep architecture following plasma exchange [12].

NMDAR autoantibodies

Patients with AE associated with antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of central nervous system NNMDAR typically present with prominent psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, insomnia, fear, mania, delusions, and hyper-religiosity), with memory loss, language deficits (reduced verbal output, echolalia) and alterations in level of consciousness [4]. Severe agitation, catatonia, abnormal movements, and dysautonomia may also develop [8, 46, 69]. Although the disease classically presents in women of childbearing age (in whom there is a strong association with ovarian teratoma), cases at the extremes of age are recognized, in both sexes.

Difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, and decreased need for sleep, are the most prevalent sleep symptoms in patients with NMDAR encephalitis [4, 8]. When present, insomnia is commonly refractory to standard treatments [70], which may provide an important clue to the diagnosis in the patients with new behavioral or psychiatric complaints. Paradoxically, insomnia may respond to immunomodulatory treatments, including steroids [46]; although this is not guaranteed [48]. In 20% of cases, severe sleep dysfunction may persist, with complaints of daytime hypersomnolence and inversion of sleep patterns [4, 46]. Movement disorders, including generalized dyskinesias and orofacial dyskinesias, are commonly recognized in patients with NMDAR encephalitis, with manifestations limited to sleep in selected patients [47]. Finally, dream enactment (22%), and disorders of arousal (including confusional arousals and somniloquy, 22%) are also reported [16].

Hypoventilation requiring respiratory support is common in the acute phase of NMDAR encephalitis, particularly in patients with declining consciousness or worsening encephalopathy [48, 49]. However, hypoventilation may also be seen in patients with preserved consciousness, or may emerge during sleep [4, 46, 71], implicating a disruption of respiratory drive, rather than global cerebral dysfunction. Central hypoventilation may complicate efforts to wean respiratory support, and should be considered in patients who fail to wean from ventilator support despite improved consciousness. Cases requiring prolonged nocturnal ventilation following resolution of encephalitis are described [46, 72].

Longitudinal changes in electroencephalography (EEG) patterns are well-described in patients with NMDAR encephalitis [73–75]. By contrast, little is known concerning sleep architecture in this population. One EEG series noted absence of normal stage 2 sleep features (K complexes and sleep spindles) in about half of 24 cases [76]. Decreased stage 3 or slow wave sleep, decreased REM sleep, and REM sleep without atonia have also been described in NMDAR encephalitis [16]. Dedicated studies reporting PSG in patients with NMDAR encephalitis are needed.

AMPAR autoantibodies

AMPAR encephalitis most often presents as limbic encephalitis, with an underlying neoplasm identified in 67% of patients [77]. While sleep disturbances are not a core feature of the disease, patients with insomnia and hypersomnolence are recognized, with a frequency approaching 10% [50, 51]. No PSG data is reported in AMPAR encephalitis patients.

IgLON5 autoantibodies

Clinical features in patients with AE associated with antibodies against the extracellular domain of an immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule, IgLON5 include bulbar symptoms, gait abnormalities, oculomotor deficits, cognitive decline, and sleep disruption, which is a central feature. Insomnia, sleep breathing disorders, and disorders of arousal are identified in a majority of patients [14, 15, 54], and often develop before the emergence of other neurologic symptoms and signs.

Unlike other forms of AE, abundant PSG data is available from patients with IgLON5 disease, demonstrating undifferentiated NREM sleep, poorly structured stage 2 sleep (behaviorally associated with vocalizations and movements), REM sleep without atonia, and obstructive sleep apnea with stridor in affected patients [14]. Overall, PSG demonstrates moderately decreased total sleep time and increased fragmentation with decreased sleep efficiency [54, 78], while REM sleep without atonia (often with dream enactment behavior) is reported in 20–80% [15, 54, 78]. Clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea is reported in 55–100% of cases [15, 54, 78]. Broad variability in frequency across series may reflect differences in population selection, with some series identifying patients by clinical presentation (including sleep complaints), and others based on autoantibody identification.

Ma1/ma2 autoantibodies

AE associated with ma1/ma2 antibodies typically presents with limbic encephalitis or brainstem/ diencephalitis associated with eye movement abnormalities and endocrine dysfunction, mood changes, cognitive decline, agitation, and seizures [55]. Sleep dysfunction may be striking, with hypersomnolence identified in upwards of one third of cases in selected series [55], and abundant cases associated with narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy with cataplexy) and RBD [58–61]. PSG findings include reduced sleep efficiency, severely fragmented sleep with a paucity of stage 3 sleep, sleep onset REM periods, and occasionally REM sleep without atonia [57–59]. The response to therapy is poor in general [55], with incomplete resolution of sleep symptoms following immunotherapy [58–61].

Autoantibodies to other intracellular antigens (anti-Hu, anti-Yo, anti-Ri)

Descriptions of sleep disturbances in AE associated with classical “paraneoplastic” antibodies are limited to case studies, including descriptions of narcolepsy type 1 [62], insomnia, and witnessed apneas [16, 79] in patients with Hu antibodies; and hypersomnolence in patients with Yo antibodies [16].

Mechanisms of sleep disturbances in AE

The neuroanatomical structures and neurotransmitter systems implicated in sleep disorders common in AE are summarized in Table 2. Improved understanding of the antigenic targets and downstream effects of AE-associated antibodies may inform the neuronal systems that regulate complex sleep behaviors.

Insomnia (disorders of sleep initiation and sleep maintenance)

The physiology of sleep-wake rhythms is complex, involving broadly distributed homeostatic, circadian, and reciprocally inhibitory networks, and multiple neurotransmitter systems (reviewed in [86]). Among these, the reticular activating system serves a critical role, mediating sleep and wake patterns through coordinated action within the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, the median preoptic nucleus, and hypocretin (orexin)-producing neurons of the lateral hypothalamus. Many additional neurotransmitter systems are involved in sleep regulation, including cholinergic, monoaminergic, histaminergic, and glutamatergic neurons from the brainstem, which communicate with the thalamus, basal forebrain, and cerebral cortex to generate wake activity. The distributed anatomy and multiple neurotransmitter systems involved in healthy sleep-wake patterns renders these processes vulnerable to disruption from generalized or localized injury.

The main sleep-promoting system includes the GABAergic ventrolateral median preoptic nuclei, as the primary inhibitor of the reticular activating system, which is counterbalanced by hypocretin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus that reinforce arousal pathways in the brainstem as well as direct excitatory input to the cerebral cortex and basal forebrain [87]. By extension, insomnia is presumed to arise from reduced GABAergic activation (weakening sleep promotion) or increased hypocretin activation (strengthening arousal pathways), and is frequently reported following traumatic brain injuries [88]—particularly injuries affecting the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex [89]—and in AE (see Table 1).

The clinical management of insomnia is tailored to the duration and severity of symptoms, as well as consideration of medical comorbidities. While there are many sedative-hypnotic agents available, in patients with AE the benefits of sleep promotion, may not outweigh potential side effects (e.g., drowsiness compromising examination of mental status or participation in physical therapy), especially in the inpatient setting. If insomnia persists following the acute presentation of AE, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia or a short-term sedative-hypnotic medications may be considered [90].

Narcolepsy type 1

Narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy with cataplexy) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, disrupted nocturnal sleep, and focal or generalized weakness triggered by emotion. The diagnosis is confirmed by multiple sleep latency testing demonstrating shortened mean sleep onset latency and sleep onset REM periods [91]. The neuropathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 centers on dysfunction of the wake-promoting hypocretin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. These neurons have projections to regions that promote arousal and suppress REM sleep, including the dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus, tubomammillary nucleus, periaqueductal grey, and basal forebrain [91, 92]. In patients with narcolepsy type 1, CSF hypocretin is low or undetectable, but may be intermediate or normal in narcolepsy without cataplexy (type 2 narcolepsy), suggesting an alternative pathophysiology underlying this disease [93].

Narcolepsy type 1 is commonly reported in patients with AE associated with antibodies against ma1/ma2. Biochemical studies confirm low CSF hypocretin in these patients, implicating selective compromise of hypocretin-producing neurons within the lateral hypothalamus [55, 94]. Limited neuropathologic studies demonstrate selective hypothalamic involvement with CD8+ T lymphocyte-mediated loss of hypocretin neurons [59]. Ma1/ma2 autoantibodies are not found in patients with idiopathic narcolepsy, and low hypocretin levels are only seen in patients with AE associated with ma1/ma2 autoantibodies who present with sleepiness [94]. Unlike primary narcolepsy, hypersomnolence and cataplexy in AE associated with ma1/ma2 autoantibodies does not exhibit an association with HLA DQB1*0602 [58].

Hypersomnolence in narcolepsy is treated with stimulants (modafinil or armodafinil, methylphenidate, pitolisant, or amphetamines), or with sodium oxybate, which can improve daytime sleepiness, disrupted nocturnal sleep, and reduce cataplexy in narcolepsy type 1 [95]. However, the role for sodium oxybate in secondary narcolepsy, including narcolepsy in AE, is less clear. In patients with hypersomnolence and cataplexy associated with AE, use of an alternative agent, such as an antidepressant (e.g., venlafaxine), may be considered if treatment for cataplexy is indicated.

REM sleep behavior disorder

RBD is characterized by a clinical history of dream enactment behaviors, with PSG confirming REM sleep without atonia [96]. Patients typically exhibit complex behaviors during sleep, which are more frequent in the second half of the night when REM sleep predominates, and may be consistent with dream content. Neuroanatomically, the modulation of REM sleep involves feedback from the hypothalamus, thalamus, substantia nigra, basal forebrain, limbic system, and frontal cortex, necessitating coordination of glutamatergic subceruleus/sublateral dorsal nucleus, the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, the cholinergic pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, and the medullary magnocellular reticular formation [96–98]. Outside of AE, RBD is recognized in 20–70% of patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease [99], and ~75% of patients with Lewy body dementia [100, 101], with symptoms presenting a median of 13 years prior to the emergence of parkinsonism or cognitive decline [102]. In these patients, RBD is closely associated with deposition of alpha-synuclein within midbrain structures (e.g., substantia nigra pars compacta) [103]. RBD is also recognized in patients with focal brainstem lesions (e.g., structural lesions involving the pons, medulla, and limbic system [104, 105]), providing clues towards the localization of this unique sleep pathology. RBD is also seen in primary narcolepsy, implicating dysfunction of posterior hypothalamic hypocretin-producing neurons [106]. Disruption at any level of this circuitry may impair REM atonia, leading to dream enactment [107].

Dream enactment is reported in patients with AE associated with antibodies against LGI1, Caspr2, ma1/2 and IgLON5 autoantibodies. While several of these disorders are known to directly involve the brainstem (e.g., IgLON5 disease is associated with an ascending tauopathy [14]), brainstem involvement is rarely suspected based on neurological examination or neuroimaging in patients with LGI1 autoantibodies [66]. Further study is required to determine the networks, receptors, and neurotransmitter systems that are disrupted in AE patients with REM sleep without atonia and dream enactment.

Pharmacological treatment strategies for RBD include melatonin and clonazepam. Behavioral interventions are also recommended to reduce the risk of injury to patients and bed partners, and can be implemented by moving furniture away from the bed, removing weapons or sharp objects from the bedroom, placing the mattress on the floor or lowering the bed. In severe cases it may be necessary to assign a separate sleeping space for the patient [108, 109].

Disorders of arousal

Disorders of arousal (NREM parasomnias) are characterized by inappropriate response or unresponsiveness to the external environment with or without autonomic nervous system activation, and are attributed to incomplete arousal from NREM (mainly slow wave) sleep [110]. NREM events may include complex behaviors, such as walking or talking, or confusional arousals, which typically predominate in the first half of the night [111]. As central nervous system cholinergic levels are low during non-REM sleep, amnesia for the event is common, and may compromise reporting and recognition of disorders of arousal (emphasizing the need for a thorough sleep history involving a reliable bed partner). A further consideration in complex nocturnal behaviors is the need to differentiate nocturnal seizure, disorders of arousal (in NREM sleep), and RBD. This may be difficult by history or direct observation, requiring corresponding EEG or PSG.

NREM disorders are presumed to reflect a “disconnection state” in which NREM sleep-like patterns persist in frontoparietal associative cortices and hippocampi, while wake-like patterns predominate in motor cortex and limbic structures [111]. Disruptions in serotoninergic systems are implicated by animal studies demonstrating behavioral awake states associated with EEG delta activity following injection of serotonin into the cholinergic basalis neurons [112], and by reports of sleep walking and confusional arousals following initiation of serotonergic medications in humans [113–116]. GABA-mediated potentiation of these behaviors suggested by the clear association between sleep walking and ingestion of sodium oxybate—a potent GABA-B agonist [117, 118].

Disorders of arousal are recognized in patients with IgLON5 disease [54, 78] and AE associated with Caspr2 autoantibodies [43]; it is unknown whether serotonergic and GABAergic systems are directly or indirectly disrupted in these disorders. Surprisingly, disorders of arousal are not reported in AE associated with antibodies against GABA-A/B receptors. This may reflect under-recognition of sleep disruption, noting that case series focused on patients with AE associated with antibodies targeting GABA-A/B receptors either do not comment on sleep [119] or elude to non-specific sleep complaints (3/18, 17% [53]).

The approach to treatment of disorders of arousal, includes optimization of sleep hygiene and management of concurrent sleep disorders (such as sleep breathing disorders), which may trigger or worsen disorders of arousal [120]. As with RBD, evaluation of sleep environment safety, especially with sleep walking, is essential. Sleep talking does not typically require targeted intervention.

Severe sleep-wake dysregulation: agrypnia excitata

Severe sleep-wake dysregulation manifesting as agrypnia excitata (total insomnia with confusion, motor agitation, and autonomic hyperactivity) is presumed to reflect wide-spread disruption of sleep homeostatic, circadian, and endocrine systems, as seen in fatal familial insomnia [121] and delirium tremens associated with alcohol withdrawal [122]. Disruption of thalamo-limbic pathways that regular sleep may account for presentations of agrypnia excitata in selected cases with Morvan syndrome associated with Caspr2 autoantibodies [68], and a single patient with AE associated with Hu, NMDAR and CRMP5 autoantibodies [79].

Sleep breathing disorders

Sleep breathing disorders affect an estimated 5–20% of the adult population [123, 124], with incidence increasing with age, body mass index, and medical comorbidities including cerebrovascular disease [125], coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes [123]. Whereas obstructive apnea is primarily mediated by collapsibility of the upper airway during sleep, central sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoventilation may arise from processes that compromise CO2-sensing medullary chemoreceptors, or peripheral sensors within the carotid body (e.g., tumors, traumatic brain injury) [126, 127]. Accordingly, hypoventilation is well described in patients with NMDAR encephalitis [4, 46, 48, 49, 71], in whom it is presumed to arise from direct antibody-antigen interactions in the medulla. This suggestion is supported by studies confirming that ketamine, a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist, also leads to respiratory depression [128]. Sleep breathing disorders are also common in IgLON5 disease [15, 54, 78], presumably attributable to brainstem tau pathology. Importantly, obstructive and central sleep apnea may co-exist in AE patients, especially patients with typical obstructive risk factors, warranting careful monitoring for associated symptoms and signs of impairment (e.g., snoring, gasping or witnessed apneas) at presentation and throughout follow-up.

Regardless of the cause, sleep breathing disorders are highly responsive to treatment (e.g., positive airway pressure), with treatment associated with improvements in quality of life [129, 130] and health outcomes in the general population [131, 132]. The high incidence and favorable treatment response justifies broad screening for symptoms of sleep breathing disorders. Accessible screening tools are available for use in general clinical populations (e.g., STOP-BANG questionnaire [85]), and can be readily adapted for use in AE patients. Objective monitoring for signs of hypoventilation should be considered in any symptomatic patient.

Once the diagnosis is established, sleep breathing disorders are treated with positive airway pressure therapy, an oral appliance, behavioral or positional modifications, or nocturnal non-invasive ventilation, depending on the severity and type of disorder [133]. Long-term follow up to evaluate treatment efficacy or assess for resolution are needed.

Circadian rhythm sleep disorders

Nocturnal insomnia associated with daytime hypersomnolence may result from circadian shifts attributed to disrupted melatonin synthesis and secretion. Daily patterns in rest-wake activity and sleep are regulated through the master clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, in the hypothalamus. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are almost certainly under-reported in AE patients given co-localization of brainstem involvement and often severely disrupted sleep patterns in these patients. The circadian rhythm in melatonin level was absent and the overall level of melatonin was low in one case of AE associated antibodies against Caspr2 with nocturnal insomnia and daytime hypersomnolence [134]. In this case PSG showed decreased nocturnal REM sleep and increased daytime REM sleep [134], further implicating circadian disruption [135]. Additional support for circadian disruption in AE is suggested by the hypothalamic and endocrine disruption in AE associated with ma1/ma2 antibodies; however, no studies have directly measured melatonin disruption in this patient population.

Melatonin and timed light exposure may be used to adjust and maintain the sleep-wake cycle in circadian rhythm sleep disorders [136]. The effect of these therapies is mediated via the suprachiasmatic nucleus. However, given the degree of hypothalamic dysfunction associated with AE, it is unknown whether this approach is sufficient to regulate sleep-wake patterns in these patients.

Implications for clinical care and priorities for future study

High quality data concerning sleep disruptions are lacking in AE patients. Systematic screening for sleep complaints is critical to objectively determine the prevalence of disruptions in AE, and to quantify the contribution of sleep dysfunction to the clinical presentation, treatment responsiveness, and long-term outcomes in recovering patients. We suggest that patients with suspected AE and their bed partners should be queried about new-onset sleep disruption or behaviors, with additional investigations coordinated as appropriate (Box 1). The use of standardized questions or validated sleep questionnaires may aid in the detection of disturbances, clarify the diagnosis, and determine the utility of additional evaluations, including PSG. Detailed characterization of sleep disturbances may also provide clues towards the subtype of AE, informing diagnostic (i.e., autoantibody testing) and therapeutic decisions, acknowledging the potential association between certain sleep disturbances and specific causes of AE.

We acknowledge that there are challenges associated with performing and interpreting in-depth sleep studies in AE patients—particularly during the acute phase of the illness. However, rigorous investigation of sleep complaints is essential to objectively qualify and quantify sleep dysfunction in AE. In turn, this information may be leveraged to inform the neural networks and neurotransmitter systems that give rise to sleep dysfunction in AE, providing further insight into the mediators of sleep function (and dysfunction) in health and disease.

Box 1: Recommendations for screening, indications for polysomnography, and treatment of sleep disruption in AE patients

Screen for sleep disruption in AE patients. Ask patients and their bed partners about disturbances in sleep patterns (insomnia, daytime hypersomnolence), abnormal sleep behaviors (disorders of arousal, dream enactment behavior), or symptoms of sleep breathing disorders (snoring, gasping, witnessed apneas).

Evaluate symptomatic patients for modifiable sleep disorders with polysomnography or referral to sleep center.

Treat potentially modifiable sleep dysfunction early in the disease course. Confirm response to treatment with polysomnography when appropriate.

Monitor for the emergence of sleep disturbances throughout the disease course. Evaluate and treat newly symptomatic patients.

Repeatedly screen for sleep symptoms during follow up of AE patients. Reassess the severity of sleep complaints in symptomatic patients.
