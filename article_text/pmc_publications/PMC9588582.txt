Background:

Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) undergoing inpatient procedures represent a population at elevated risk for adverse outcomes including postoperative complications, mortality, and discharge to a higher level of care. Outcomes may be particularly poor in patients with ADRD undergoing high-risk procedures. We sought to determine traditional (e.g. 30-day mortality) and patient-centered (e.g. discharge disposition) outcomes in patients with ADRD undergoing high-risk inpatient procedures.

Methods:

This retrospective cohort study analyzed electronic health records linked to fee-for-service Medicare claims data at a tertiary care academic health system. All patients from a large multi-hospital health system undergoing high-risk inpatient procedures from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2017 with continuous Medicare Parts A and B enrollment in the 12 months prior to and 90 days following the procedure were included.

Results:

This study included 6,779 patients. 536 (7.9%) had ADRD. A multivariable analysis of outcomes demonstrated higher risks for postoperative complications (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.23-1.81) and 90-day mortality (OR 1.44 [95% CI 1.09-1.91]) in patients with ADRD compared to those without. Patients with ADRD were more likely to be discharged to a higher level of care (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.32-2.18) and only 37.3% of patients admitted from home were discharged to home.

Conclusions:

Compared to those without ADRD, patients living with ADRD undergoing high-risk procedures have poor traditional and patient-centered outcomes including increased risks for 90-day mortality, postoperative complications, longer hospital lengths of stay, and discharge to a higher level of care. These data may be used by patients, their surrogates, and their physicians to help align surgical decision making with health care goals.

pmcIntroduction

Surgical procedures are common among the elderly, with over half of all surgery in the US occurring in patients 65 years or older1. Decision-making around surgical procedures is especially consequential for older patients because of the higher risk for postoperative complications, prolonged recovery, and loss of function and independence compared to younger patients. Within this group, patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent an especially vulnerable group. Several studies suggest that the risk of adverse postoperative outcomes – death, postoperative complications, and loss of function and independence – is higher in patients with ADRD2,3. In addition to elevated risk, patients with ADRD also face decision-making that may be complicated by impaired cognition, the presence of multiple formal and informal surrogates, and a lack of clarity surrounding the patient’s healthcare goals.

Risk of adverse postoperative events derives not just from patient factors, such as ADRD, but also procedural factors. As such, discussions of risk must be tempered by an acknowledgement that not all procedures confer equal risk. We hypothesized that patients with ADRD who receive high-risk procedures have worse traditional (e.g. mortality) and patient-centered outcomes (e.g. discharge to a higher level of care) compared to those without ADRD. In this study we sought to determine traditional and patient-centered outcomes after high-risk procedures in patients with and without ADRD in a large hospital system.

Methods

Data Sources

The cohort was selected from the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) linked to Medicare claims and converted to the PCORNet Common Data Model (CDM). The MGB RPDR contains electronic health record data from two large academic medical centers and three community hospitals, a rehabilitation center, and a psychiatric hospital. The RPDR data includes information on patient demographics, medical problems, medications, vital signs, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), immunizations, laboratory data, various clinical notes and reports. The Medicare claims data include enrollment files, inpatient claims, outpatient claims, carrier claims, and other claims files (home health agency, hospice, skilled nursing facility, and durable medical equipment), and Part D (prescription drug coverage) files. National Death Index data, including cause of death, is also included for patients with Medicare claims. This cohort study was approved by the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Institutional Review Board.

Patient Population

Patients included in this study comprised all individuals with RPDR data linked to Medicare claims data who had a high-risk procedure (see below) in the MGB system between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2017, and whose procedures, as identified in RPDR data, have corresponding CMS procedure claims. The cohort is limited to patients who had continuous Medicare Parts A and B Fee-for-Service (FFS) enrollment in the 12 months prior to and 90 days subsequent from the date of index surgery. The date of cohort entry was the first date of a high-risk surgical procedure on or after October 1, 2015. If a patient had more than one high-risk surgical procedure on the date of cohort entry (not merely the same surgical admission), then the procedure with the highest mortality was considered the index “procedure of interest.”

High Risk Surgical Procedures

Following the literature-based definition, high risk surgical procedures were defined as inpatient procedures with greater than or equal to 1% inpatient mortality risk among patients 65 and older4. An updated list of high-risk procedures was generated using International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) procedure codes in the national 2018 Medicare FFS claims data5. In brief, we compiled a list of inpatient surgical procedures with a nominal mortality of 1% of higher. We included percutaneous inpatient procedures as well, because the mere fact that these are done without incisions does not signify low risk. Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and transcatheter aortic valve replacement are examples of percutaneous procedures that carry substantial periprocedural risk of complications and death. Subsequently three board-certified surgeons reviewed the list to exclude procedures unlikely to be the causally related to mortality. For example, tracheostomy creation was excluded because it occurred in patients at high-risk for mortality but was itself unlikely to cause death. All procedures in our final lists – one master list that is blind to procedure status and another that include urgent/emergent procedures – are identified by AHRQ as major surgeries (Supplemental Tables 1, 2)6. If a procedure appeared on both lists then we used the highest associated mortality for inclusion in our multivariable models (see “Statistical Analysis” for details). To account for the likelihood that patients with and without dementia underwent different types of procedures, the percent mortality associated with each procedure was used to define procedure-specific risk.

Variables

Dementia was coded as 0,1 based on documented ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis codes (Supplemental Table 3) in the one year prior to the date of the high-risk procedure7,8. This list excludes non-specific codes and reversible codes, and was developed by chart validation and expert consensus9. Comorbidities were identified using a modified Elixhauser comorbidity index and inpatient complications were based on previously identified codes10. Outcome variables included: In-hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality; inpatient complications (Supplemental Table 4); hospital length of stay (LOS); discharge to home among patients admitted from home; and discharge to a higher level of care, defined using the following ascending hierarchy: home, skilled nursing facility, long-term acute care. Patients already in long-term acute care were excluded from this analysis.

Statistical Analysis

Categorical data were described using frequencies and percentages. Continuous data were described using means, medians, and standard errors. Differences in unadjusted data were calculated using Wilcoxon two-sample tests for continuous data and χ2 or Fisher’s exact test for categorical data. For adjusted analyses, multivariable logistic regression was used for categorical outcomes, and multivariable linear regression was used for continuous outcomes. High-risk procedures performed only in patients without ADRD were not included in our analyses. Models were adjusted for patient-level (sex, race, comorbidity index, procedure count, age, urgency) and procedure-level (procedure risk) factors. Due to the differences in case mix between the ADRD and non-ADRD cohorts, we performed a sensitivity analysis examining outcomes while restricting to the 20 most common procedures performed in patients with ADRD. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC).

Results

We identified 6,779 patients who underwent high-risk inpatient procedures from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2017 in the MGB hospital network. Of these, 536 (7.9%) patients had ADRD. Patients with ADRD had a higher median age (81.4 vs 74.0 years, p&lt;0.01) and were more likely to be female (61.4% vs 46.7%, p&lt;0.01) (Table 1). 91.7% of the overall cohort was non-Hispanic white, and there were no significant racial differences between the ADRD and non-ADRD groups. Significant percentages of the overall cohort had diabetes, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure. The ADRD group had higher rates of renal failure (39.7% vs 27.2%), COPD (37.9% vs 32.7%), and congestive heart failure (46.1% vs 34.1%).

The admission sources differed between the ADRD and non-ADRD groups (p&lt;0.01) (Table 1). Patients with ADRD were significantly less likely to be admitted from home (55.0% vs 75.3%) and more likely to come as transfers from another hospital (35.8% vs 23.4%) or another facility (7.8% vs 0.6%).

Although the two most common procedures were identical in both groups – drug-eluting coronary artery dilation and percutaneous aortic valve replacement – the remainder of the ten most common procedures were largely dissimilar (Table 2). For example, the third and fourth most common procedures in the non-ADRD group were open aortic valve replacement and two-vessel coronary artery bypass, whereas these two procedures were the 22rd and 14th most common procedures in patients with ADRD. Conversely the third and fourth most common procedures in patients with ADRD were surgeries for femur fractures which held the 19th and 54th positions among patients without ADRD. Seven of the top 10 most common procedures in patients with ADRD are orthopedic procedures. On the whole, median procedure risk (see “Definitions” above) was lower among patients with ADRD: 4.3% vs 4.8%, p&lt;0.01. Patients with ADRD were more likely to undergo urgent/emergent high-risk procedures: 57.1% vs 26.8%, p&lt;0.01.

Outcomes between the two groups differed in many respects (Table 3, Figure 1). Patients with ADRD undergoing high-risk procedures had higher unadjusted complication rates compared to patients without ADRD (59.1% vs 42.3%) and adjusted odds ratios (1.49, 95% CI 1.23-1.81) for the same. While in-hospital mortality (p=.74) and 30-day mortality (p=.46) were similar between the two groups, 90-day mortality was worse in patients with ADRD (OR 1.44 [95% CI 1.09-1.91], respectively). Patients with ADRD spent approximately half a day longer in the hospital compared to patients without ADRD (β 0.67, SE 0.32). Among all patients admitted from home, only 37.3% of patients with ADRD were discharged to home compared to 68.8% of those without ADRD (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.32-0.55). Similarly, accounting for all patients irrespective of admission source, patients with ADRD were more likely to be discharged to a higher level of care (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.32-2.18). 65.3% of patients with ADRD were discharged to a facility compared to 32.8% for those without (p&lt;0.01).

In our sensitivity analyses restricted to the 20 most common procedures among patients with ADRD, we found that 90-day mortality and hospital length of stay were similar between the two cohorts (Table 4). In contrast, the adjusted likelihood of inpatient complications, discharge to home, and discharge to a higher level of care remained worse for patients living with ADRD.

Discussion

Patients with ADRD undergoing high-risk procedures represent a vulnerable group because of the combination of medical and procedural risk alongside the intrinsic complexity of healthcare decision-making related to ADRD. We found that patients with ADRD experienced poor outcomes in a broad set of postoperative measures including complications, 90-day mortality, length of stay, discharge to higher levels of care, and likelihood of discharge home.

The scope of our procedures and outcomes is novel. No study has examined a broad range of outcomes for patients with dementia among all high-risk procedures. Existing studies on surgical outcomes in patients living with ADRD tend to focus on single procedures – for example, hip fracture11,12. For two studies that looked at broader sets of surgical procedures (e.g. all general surgery), the outcomes of interest were limited to mortality and postoperative complications, ignoring outcomes such as discharge to a higher level of care that may be of relevance to patients and surrogates8,13. Masutani et al. 14 assessed only inpatient outcomes, included all procedures (not just high risk), and was restricted to patients in the Premier Healthcare Database, a non-random sample of US cases and hospitals15. Similar to our findings, Masutani et al. reported a longer hospital length of stay and lower risk of discharge home in patients with ADRD. Contrary to our findings, however, they found a slightly higher inpatient mortality (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.10-1.20). Since their analysis was limited to inpatient outcomes only, there was no reporting of 90-day mortality, which was higher in our study. Bekelis et al. examined a large cohort of patients undergoing one of nine major surgeries in a New York state database16. Their findings were similar to those of Masutani et al.

Our results support our central hypothesis that traditional and patient-centered outcomes are worse in patients living with ADRD compared to those without. These results are particularly striking because within the spectrum of high-risk procedures, patients with ADRD undergo procedures that are less risky than those without ADRD. Our finding of no difference in inpatient mortality among patients with and without ADRD even after adjustment for procedure risk was unexpected. We speculate that one possible explanation is that our study occurred in tertiary care academic centers specializing in high acuity patients and procedures. Alternatively, there may be a difference in mortality between patients with and without ADRD that was not detected because of our sample size.

Our sensitivity analysis examined outcomes while restricted to the 20 most common high-risk procedures performed in patients living with ADRD. We found that 90-day mortality and hospital length of stay were no longer worse in patients with ADRD. The likelihood of inpatient complications, discharge home and to a higher level of care remained statistically worse. The differences between the two models demonstrates that, to some extent, the adverse outcomes seen in patients with ADRD hinge on the specific procedures being analyzed. Patients with ADRD underwent procedures associated with a lower median mortality than those without (4.3% vs 4.8% mortality, p&lt;.01); our findings of somewhat better outcomes likely reflects this case selection.

Nevertheless, our results offer important insights into surgical outcomes for patients living with ADRD undergoing high-risk procedures. These results may be used by patients, their surrogates, and physicians to ensure that treatment decisions align with healthcare goals. Prior studies have reported the willingness of patients to decline life-prolonging treatments in order to avoid loss of independence and functional decline17. Although our study did not directly measure these endpoints, we feel that our measurement of likelihood of discharge to home or a higher level of care are similarly patient-centered and would be relevant to decision-making.

There are several limitations to our study. First, these include its retrospective nature and the use of administrative data. ADRD may not be well-captured in administrative data. We have previously used administrative data for the study of ADRD, and multiple validation studies examining ICD-9 and -10 codes for ADRD have found high positive and negative predictive values and specificity3,18–20. Sensitivity, however, has been variable and lower, and it is likely that our data may have missed mild cases of dementia. Second, we included percutaneous procedures that many would not normally classify as surgery, such as transfemoral aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). While these are not “surgery” since they can be performed in non-OR settings we felt strongly that their inclusion was justifiable and made our results more useful for the following reasons: 1) our data includes only inpatient PCI and other percutaneous procedures, which are different clinical entities from the usual outpatient percutaneous procedures; 2) all of our procedures fit the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) definition of major surgery6; 3) some percutaneous procedures are very similar to traditional surgery, such as TAVR, which is frequently performed in an operating room, requires a cardiac surgeon, carries typical surgical risks (e.g. access site vessel injury and hemorrhage), and is often done via surgical exposure of the femoral arteries under general anesthesia; and, 4) the frequency of TAVR and PCI in patients with ADRD increases the applicability and usefulness of our results. Our study was also limited by our lack of access to information on do not resuscitate (DNR) status. While we do not believe that DNR status impacts procedural outcomes and patients in the MGB network are generally asked to rescind DNR decisions in the immediate postoperative period to avoid death from immediately reversible causes, it is possible that DNR decisions after this time could impact, for example, withdrawal of support and mortality. Unfortunately, we are unable to examine these associations with our existing data. Last, our study setting was limited to two large academic tertiary care hospitals and others in the MGB network. Our findings may not generalize to other settings. We plan to pursue additional investigations with different datasets that will clarify the generalizability of our findings.

Conclusions

Compared to those without ADRD, patients living with ADRD undergoing high-risk procedures have poor traditional and patient-centered outcomes including increased risks for 90-day mortality, postoperative complications, longer hospital lengths of stay, and discharge to a higher level of care. These data may be used by patients, their surrogates, and their physicians to help align surgical decision making with health care goals.

Key Points

Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) undergoing high-risk inpatient procedures had higher risks for inpatient postoperative complications (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.23-1.81) and 90-day mortality (OR 1.44 [95% CI 1.09-1.91]) compared to those without.

Compared to those without ADRD, patients living with ADRD had longer hospital lengths of stay and were more likely to be discharged to a higher level of care (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.32-2.18); only 37.3% of patients admitted from home were discharged to home

Why does this paper matter?

Compared to those without ADRD, patients living with ADRD undergoing high-risk procedures have poor traditional and patient-centered outcomes. These data may be used by patients, their surrogates, and their physicians to help align surgical decision making with health care goals.
