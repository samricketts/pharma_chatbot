Cerebral small vessel disease is associated with late-life depression, cognitive impairment, executive dysfunction, distress, and loss of life for older adults. Late-life depression is becoming a substantial public health burden, and a considerable number of older adults presenting to primary care have significant clinical depression. Even though white matter hyperintensities are linked with small vessel disease, white matter hyperintensities are nonspecific to small vessel disease and can co-occur with other brain diseases. Advanced neuroimaging techniques at the ultrahigh field magnetic resonance imaging are enabling improved characterization, identification of cerebral small vessel disease and are elucidating some of the mechanisms that associate small vessel disease with late-life depression.

Introduction

Most older adults have neuroradiologic evidence of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) [1]. Although many older adults carry the burden of SVD without clinical manifestations, population studies have clearly shown that a high burden of small vessel disease is associated with cognitive, physical, and mood dysfunction [2–4]. Specifically, small vessel disease has been linked to the thinning of the cerebral cortex, gray matter atrophy [5], greater cerebral blood flow decline [6, 7], increased white matter hyperintensity volume [8–11], and worsening cognition [8, 9, 11, 12]. It is also shown that small vessel disease is strongly associated with late-life depression (LLD) [13]. Depression is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly [14–19]. Better understanding triggers for late-life depression like small vessel disease will facilitate both prevention strategies and treatment plans. However, the progress in understanding the role of small vessel disease and how it contributes to late-life depression has been stymied in part by a lack of specificity when it comes to the imaging and classification of white matter hyperintensities (WMH). White matter hyperintensities are currently identified using MRI imaging and are a hallmark of small vessel disease [13, 20–25]. White matter hyperintensities represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. There is an established longitudinal association between white matter hyperintensities and late-life depression; specifically, the progression of small vessel disease is based on imaging is associated with persistent depression [26, 27].

Furthermore, depression can cause many complications in the growing elderly population, and at times, it is poorly responsive to treatment [26, 27]. Characterizing the pathophysiologic subcomponents responsible for white matter hyperintensity progression in late-life depression through advanced neuroimaging techniques is of great importance, as it will allow for an understanding of how depression develops over time. The neuroimaging characterization of small vessel disease will, in turn, shape decision making about what to do about this growing public health problem moving forward [28].

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) neuroimaging plays an essential role in exploring and understanding small vessel disease (SVD) and its association with late-life depression (LLD). MRI is noninvasive, without ionizing radiation, and due to the low risk associated with this imaging technique, it is ideal for longitudinal studies. Lately, ultrahigh field (UHF ≥ 7 T) MRI has been extensively used in MRI neuroimaging research. This significant development in MRI coupled with the advances in computer hardware and medical imaging analysis paradigms are enhancing the visualization, analysis, and help in better understanding LLD and its association with SVD. Despite these recent advances in the available neuroimaging techniques for SVD and LLD, these techniques are mostly applied for research purposes and are under heavy development, and we expect that they will mature to be used in clinics in the next few years.

The potential clinical applications of these UHF MRI neuroimaging techniques cover diagnosis, individualized treatment options, and treatment monitoring. The MRI neuroimaging techniques available to investigate SVD and LLD are numerous and multimodal. Therefore, we will focus our discussion on three main topics: (1) introduction to UHF MRI, (2) the advances in the neuroimaging of small vessel disease structural imaging with ultrahigh field MRI, (3) novel methods in assessing microvascular mechanism in small vessel disease, and (4) neuroimaging connectomes for late-life depression and small vessel disease.

UHF MRI

Human MRI UHF is impacting the neuroimaging field with its higher image resolution, higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and enhanced soft tissue contrast. 7 Tesla (T) MRI has reached a level of maturity that can meet the demand of clinical settings, being recently cleared by the Food and Drug Administration [29] for clinical use. At the time of writing this article, there are 70 human 7 T scanners installed worldwide [30]. These new MRI scanners are usually installed with optimized head coils designs [31], better gradients, and powerful computing engines. In this section, we will explain what the advantages of 7 T MRI are and discuss some of the main challenges of scanning at 7 T.

Benefits of Ultrahigh Field MR

There are three main benefits of increasing the magnetic field in MRI; a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which can be used to either increase spatial resolution or to perform faster scans with higher acceleration factors, increased susceptibility effects, which increases blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast, and longer T1 and shorter T2/T2* relaxation times, which enhances contrast in certain applications.

MRI SNR increases with magnetic field strength [32]. Consequently, this increase in SNR means that scans to be collected at higher spatial resolution (more voxels per volume unit) without an increase in acquisition time. As an example: Table 1 shows that the MPRAGE at 7 T collects almost twice the amount of the voxels per volume with a comparable acquisition time of 3 T MPRAGE.

The other benefits are a higher contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and an enhanced T2* effect (relaxation time due to magnetic susceptibility effects) which grows with the magnetic field and leads to more significant variability of relaxation times between several tissues which can be exploited in differentiating between structures. Moreover, this higher CNR contrast enables more accurate quantification susceptibility maps (QSM) of the iron deposit in the brain [33].

T1 relaxation time is longer with the magnetic field [34]; this effect is exploited to increase the CNR in time of flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This gain in CNR is utilized to detect smaller arteries [35]. Lastly, UHF has a higher sensitivity to blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast [36]. The increased BOLD contrast has a significant effect on enhancing functional MRI spatial resolution, CNR, and temporal resolution of (fMRI) [37].

Radio Frequency Transmit Nonuniformity and Specific Absorption Rate

In MRI, the transmit radiofrequency (RF) coil produces the RF transverse magnetic field responsible for the spin excitation (B1+). The B1+ field distribution becomes more inhomogeneous with the increase of the magnetic field. The inhomogeneity of the B1+ field is an unwanted consequence that causes the appearance of inhomogeneities in the images or low contrast in certain parts of the brain, especially in high flip angle sequences like the fluid-attenuated inverse recovery (FLAIR) [38]. Parallel transmissions using several RF transmit coils and pulses sequences that are insensitive to the RF inhomogeneity (e.g., adiabatic pulses) [39] might alleviate the RF Tx field inhomogeneity. However, in certain instances, solving the RF transmit inhomogeneity issues might cause RF heating effects. Moreover, the B1+ field distribution changes with different head shapes (loads); therefore, these transmit fields change for each subject [40, 41].

Load Insensitive Head Coil Design and Full Head Coverage Parallel Transmission

The tic-tac-toe (TTT) RF system for 7 T head MRI is composed by a 16-channel transmit array (4 TTT elements located around the head) and a 32-channel receive insert, for optimal receiving performance. The TTT transmit array has been shown to produce a homogenous spin excitation at 7 T frequencies [42] and superior subject insensitiveness (low variations of the RF performance with different head shapes) [43]. It also presents lower global and local (SAR) when compared with other transmit coil designs [42, 43], increasing patient safety and minimizing the risks of temperature increase and tissue damage.

Future of UHF

Several centers are exploring neuroimaging at UHF MRI at 9.4, 10.5, 11.2, and 20 T [30]. The current state of the art in 7 T is to optimize sensitivity, spatiotemporal resolution, and encoding speed [44] and to improve B0 homogeneity to address susceptibility artifacts [45].

Neuroimaging of Small Vessel Disease Structural Imaging with Ultrahigh Field MRI

The neuroimaging standards of SVD designate a set of distinct neuroimaging features in the brain. These features are acute small subcortical infarct, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces (PvS), cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), and atrophy [46]. Although these distinct SVD features were regarded as different types of tissue changes, there is increasing evidence that these features are associated and might be caused by the diffuse nature of the small vessel pathological changes. 7 T UHF has a huge impact on the imaging of PvS, CMB, lacunes, and cortical microinfarcts. Therefore, in the following section of the book chapter, we will focus our review on how 7 T UHF impacted PvS, CMB, lacunes, and cortical microinfarcts.

Lacunes and PvS at 7 T

Lacunes

Lacunes are small cavities filled with fluid and have a diameter between 3 and 15 mm. Lacunes often form as a result of acute small subcortical infarcts or hemorrhages of a nearby perforating arteriole. On MRI, their shapes are usually round or oval with a hyperintense rim. These lacunes cavities have hyperintense signals in T2 sequences similar to the cerebral spinal fluid signal. On the other hand, the lacunes signal is hypointense in T2-FLAIR. While the presence of some lacunes is mostly asymptomatic, large amounts of lacunes are correlated with dementia, cognitive impairment, gait disturbance, and increased risk of stroke [47–49].

Enlarged Perivascular Spaces (PvS)

Perivascular spaces are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filled cavities areas surrounding cerebral arteries or veins, and they extend from the subarachnoid space [50]. Perivascular spaces (PvS) are usually &lt;5 mm and have an irregular shape [20]. Since PvS are filled with CSF, they are hyperintense in T2 and hypointense in T2-FLAIR. These spaces tend to enlarge with age. Despite being considered, as a normal aging phenomenon, PvS are increasingly thought to be associated with the occurrence of cerebral small vessel disease. Additionally, studies have shown that PvS presence could be a risk factor for antidepressant resistance [51].

UHF 7 T MRI Role in Distinguishing Between Lacunes and Perivascular Spaces

UHF 7 T MRI plays a major role in distinguishing between lacunes and PvS. At low resolution on imaging such as 1.5 and 3 T, PvS can look the same as lacunes. Both pathologies are filled with liquid, and therefore, they have hyperintense signal in T2. Consequently, larger PvS might have been confused with lacunes in several studies looking at small vessel changes [52]. The hyperintense rim surrounding the hypointense “hole” on FLAIR, which is thought to be a distinguishing feature of lacunes from PvS, can be absent in some cases. The colocalization of PvS with extensive WMH areas may mimic the hyperintense rim of lacunes, subsequently causing misidentification. The importance of distinguishing between lacunar infarct and PvS cannot be overstated [53], as they are the result of different cerebral pathologies and lead to distinct clinical outcomes. The superior capability of 7 T in detecting PvS has been noted in the literature and offers a solution to the current problem [54]. The resolving power of 7 T UHF can better detect the small vessels in the PvS, which leads to a better characterization of PvS when compared to lacunar infarcts [55]. When comparing 7 and 1.5 T (7 and 1.5 T) [56], 7 T was more sensitive to PvS than 1.5 and 3 T (Fig. 1).

Cerebral Microbleeds (CMB)

Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are small (typically 2–5 mm in diameter), ovoid hypointense signals on T2*. Susceptibility-based sequences are sensitive to microbleeds [46]. CMBs correlate with neurodegenerative brain diseases, including the small vessel disease seen in late-life depression [57, 58]. The increase in the magnetic field at 7 T makes CMBs more prominent than the surrounding tissue. Several studies have confirmed that 7 T is more reliable than 1.5 T at detecting CMBs, which lead researchers to investigate CMBs at 7 T as an imaging marker for SVD [59–61]. For example, in another study, the confidence in detecting microbleeds in vivo is slightly higher at 7 T compared to 3 T. However, increased susceptibility effects at 7 T also increases the number of artifacts on imaging. The susceptibility artifacts make detecting microbleeds near other structures challenging and will have to be addressed for better results in the future [62].

Cortical Microinfarcts

Cortical microinfarcts (CMI) were first observed in autopsy reports [63] in a mixed aging population. CMIs are found in the brains of non-demented elderly, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia patients [64]. There is an increased interest in studying CMI and their relations to small vessel disease (SVD). Cortical microinfarcts are sometimes visible in 3 T scanning [65], yet most of the time, they go undetected in the routine examination due to their size 0.2–2.9 mm [66]. While CMIs are relatively small, CMIs have an effect volume 12 times the volume of their core [67]. This affected volume causes disorganization in the adjacent axons, which might induce clinical deficits seen in the aging population [68]. Several studies reported that CMIs are more visible and easier to detect in both ex vivo and in vivo [69, 70] at 7 T MRI. There have even been new guidelines established for the detection and characterization of CMIs following these findings, which illustrates the potential of 7 T in helping to pick up small changes in the microvasculature and influence care [71].

Neuroimaging of Microvascular Mechanism in Small Vessel Disease

In the section above, “Neuroimaging of small vessel disease structural imaging with ultrahigh field MRI,” we had discussed the neuroimaging methods investigating SVD that assess parenchymal and cortical structural damage, these methods in addition to WHM evaluation reflect damage in the later stage of the small vessel disease. With the technical advancement, the SVD research is heading toward detecting changes that happen earlier than overt disease on structural imaging. In addition to being a diffuse disease and a whole-brain disease [72], there is an accumulation of evidence that suggests the intrinsic aspect of small vessel disease. The changes appear to start at the endothelial level which leads later on to disorders in the cerebral microvasculature, to fibrinoid necrosis, and then to perivascular tissue injury [73]; this new understanding of the pathophysiology of small vessel disease created a need to detect features at an earlier stage of SVD that are associated with the microvessels health. Subsequently, the following section will review the advancement of neuroimaging of small vessel disease in terms of cerebral microvascular changes (venules and arterioles), tissue pulsatility, and blood–brain barrier.

Small Arteries Imaging

MRA and TOF visualize large cerebral arteries such as middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the circle of Willis. Even with the administration of contrast, clinical MRI scanners are not able to visualize accurately perforating arteries at the lower magnetic field (1.5 and 3 T) [46, 74]. The visualization of perforating arteries and the consequences of their pathology can elucidate some of the SVD mechanism [75]. Ultrahigh field (7 T and more) has a higher contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) clinical scanners. The imaging at UHF enables the visualization of some of the intracranial perforating arteries without the administration of contrast; several studies reported 0.3–0.2 mm3 resolution for MRA [35]. Recent studies reported the visualization of lenticulostriate arteries in the basal ganglia (BPA) and the thalamus (TPA) [76, 77]. Although great progress has been made in the visualization of small arteries, MRA is still limited in the visualization of smaller arteries that are distal to the circle of Willis. The state of art research is to increase the contrast of 7 T UHF to detect small arteries either by the use of extrinsic contrast agents [78] or the use of blood flow as an intrinsic contrast agent [79].

Small Veins Imaging

An early cerebral microvascular study observed that arterioles become more tortuous in some of SVD earlier states [80]. The visualization of the venous side of the cerebral microvascular pathology was not possible without contrast; therefore, the alterations of the venules due to small vessel disease were rarely investigated and thus poorly understood [81]. The increase in susceptibility (T2*) at the Ultrahigh field (7 T) MR imaging enables the visualization of venous microcirculation [82, 83]. SWI enhances the contrast of deoxyhemoglobin compared to the brain parenchyma, therefore, enables the visualization venules without a contrast agent. This contrast enhancement leads to the development of methods to quantify venules in multiple sclerosis [84] sickle cell anemia, [85] CADASIL [86] and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [87]. In addition to arterioles pathology, venules pathology such occluded venules may be a contributing factor to small vessel disease [88] and venules tortuosity is a potential indicator of venule pathology, and the tortuosity computation is done at 7 T without contrast [81]. More tortuous venules are more common with aging and mostly distributed near regions of white matter hyperintensities [89, 90]. The venules tortuosity is believed to be the result of the inflammation changes and is associated with white matter hyperintensities in the brain parenchyma and could predate radiologically overt white matter hyperintensities [81] (Fig. 2).

Arterial Pulsatility Index

In the past few years, there is an increasing amount of research papers that are showing an association between intracranial pulsatility and cerebral vessel disease. The increase in the intracranial pulsatility could be a contributing mechanism in small vessel disease [91]. Arterial pulsatility index is shown higher in more severe small vessel disease cases [92]. Most of these studies were done using transcranial Doppler Ultrasound and lower field MRI and investigated larger arteries such as the middle cerebral arteries [93]. Small perforating arteries have small diameters &lt;300 μm [94, 95] and they are challenging to visualize in the current techniques let alone measuring their flow and pulsatility. Building on the relative increase in the T2* contrast of the arterial blood, cardiac gated 7 T MRI 2D phase-contrast method can measure the pulsatility and blood flow in small artery with good precision and repeatability [96]. This method measured a higher pulsatility in patients with lacunar infarct and intracerebral hemorrhages on both the basal ganglia and semioval centers [97]. Most of the studies in the MRI cerebral artery pulsatility are cross-sectional and have a limited number of patients. They need to be adjusted to several confounding factors such as age. Nonetheless, with the increase in centers using 7 T and development of automatic methods to segment arteries and estimating pulsatility index, small arterioles pulsatility index could help in unraveling poorly understood mechanisms in small vessel disease.

Cerebral Reactivity

Cerebral reactivity measurements might estimate the small vessel disease burden directly. The reactivity measures the response of microvasculature to the administration of acetazolamide and by manipulations of the air breathed by the subject (CO2 challenge) breath-holding, and neuronal activation (high-frequency visual tasks). A reduced reactivity is a sign of exhausted autoregulation and impaired adaptation of microvasculature which can be a consequence of the loss of smooth muscle cells, vessel walls stiffness [98], or poor functioning of the pericytes [99].

As a consequence of the impaired autoregulation ischemia of the brain is more frequent [100]. The MRI methods to estimate cerebral reactivity are BOLD, arterial spin labels, phase-contrast MRI. BOLD MRI [101], which measures the increase of blood oxygenation and the neurovascular coupling, is the most popular method used in estimating the cerebral reactivity measures [102]. Though the interpretation of BOLD signal alterations and their relation to cerebral reactivity can be complex, it is the most widely used method for cerebral reactivity assessment. In a recent paper, the authors indicated that spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations (0.02–0.04 Hz) without gaseous challenge are a measure of cerebral reactivity [103]. As mentioned above, the increase in the magnetic field increases the BOLD signal contrast. Therefore, the cerebral reactivity measurement using BOLD signal is expected to have higher sensitivity at 7 T [104].

Blood-Brain Barrier

The integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is imaged with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI [105], this has demonstrated BBB breakdown associated with tumor infiltration. DCE MRI has recently been explored as a marker of blood–brain barrier breakdown in small vessel disease as well as in conditions such as diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. BBB acts as a regulator for material transfer to and out of the cerebrum, Also BBB maintains homeostasis of the brain cell environment. In addition to the breakdown of the BBB with tumor infiltration, the BBB may leak more with advancing age [76] and is leakier in white matter hyperintensities in small vessel disease [106]. In a recent case report using ultrahigh field MRI, it was observed that microbleeds were formed in the areas of BBB disruption [107].

Mechanical Assessment of Cerebral Tissue

Age and disease alter brain tissue mechanical properties [108, 109]. Elastography methods are imaging-based techniques that can estimate the elastic property of biological tissue [110]. The elastography techniques can use the endogenous small vessel pulsatility to estimate the displacement (&lt;1 mm) in the brain tissue [111] or apply exogenous force to estimate stiffness. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses an exogenous force to estimate brain tissue stiffness. This exogenous force induces mechanical waves that travel perpendicular to the direction of the applied force. The wave speeds are measured using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). MRE can be sensitive to tissue alterations [112]. Thus, MRE has the potential to assess tissue alterations in SVD at an early stage. The MRE is finding its way into the UHF field, and it is expected to be added as a routine research sequence [113].

Neuroimaging Connectomes for Late-Life Depression and Small Vessel Disease

Connectomes are defined as the structural and functional mapping of neural connections between different brain regions to understand the organization of the human brain [114]. This functional and structural organization or networks can be analyzed using MRI and has benefited from the advances of the ultrahigh field imaging [30].

Structural Networks

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) may detect the weakened white matter integrity on a microstructure scale, in normal-appearing white matter [115]. Therefore, it can be used as an indicator of small vessel disease. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and graph theory [116, 117] measures the white matter integrity of the whole-brain structural networks. In SVD, metrics such as path length (connecting two brain regions) and efficiency are used to investigate how the burden of SVD affects the brain. For example, an increase in path length between two brain regions means the information is routed through the long way. Thus, DTI-based connectomes can be used as an indicator of the severity of the disease [118].

Functional Networks

Neuronal activity at rest (under no cognitive command) induces spontaneous fluctuation throughout the brain; this fluctuation can be temporally correlated in different brain regions without direct fiber connectivity. This synchronized activity is called resting states; it was observed in BOLD fMRI [119]. Resting states fMRI (rs-fMRI) is analyzed using distinct computational methods (seed-based correlations [120], independent component analysis [121] and graph theory [122]) to extract resting brain networks. The resting brain networks provide information about the intrinsic organization of the brain networks, and the alteration of these networks can be indicative of a pathogenic brain process that affects mental health like major depression disorder [123], schizophrenia [124, 125] and cognition like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [126, 127]. Similar to the structural connectomes, functional connectomes shows a disrupted organization of the functional brain networks in late-life depression [128] and small vessel disease [129].

Connectomes in the Clinics

The evidence is growing that the connectomes are a potential clinical tool that can map and characterize brain networks in healthy aging population as opposed to an aging population with small vessel disease. However, a considerable effort is required to validate the reliability, reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity of SVD connectomes, if they are going to be used as a clinical tool and marker for the small vessel diseases.

Conclusion

In this chapter, we have highlighted how UHF MRI can enhance the imaging of small vessel disease (SVD). The advances rely on improvements in the basic MR coil design, which allow for uniform high SNR. We reviewed how the UHF MRI allows for improved identification of small microbleeds and microinfarcts, as well as improved characterization of the small arteries and veins. Small vessel disease is strongly associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric syndromes in late-life, including late-life depression. Advanced imaging techniques, such as those described in this chapter, can help identify mechanisms relating SVD to depression. Moreover, they may help identify targets for prevention and treatment.
