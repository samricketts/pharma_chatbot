Cellular senescence is an important contributor to aging and age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Senescent cells are characterized by a durable cell proliferation arrest and the acquisition of a proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which participates in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Clearance of senescent glial cells in an AD mouse model prevented cognitive decline suggesting pharmacological agents targeting cellular senescence might provide novel therapeutic approaches for AD. Δ133p53α, a natural protein isoform of p53, was previously shown to be a negative regulator of cellular senescence in primary human astrocytes, with clinical implications from its diminished expression in brain tissues from AD patients. Here we show that treatment of proliferating human astrocytes in culture with amyloid-beta oligomers (Aβ), an endogenous pathogenic agent of AD, results in reduced expression of Δ133p53α, as well as induces the cells to become senescent and express proinflammatory SASP cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα. Our data suggest that Aβ-induced astrocyte cellular senescence is associated with accelerated DNA damage, and upregulation of full-length p53 and its senescence-inducing target gene p21WAF1. We also show that exogenously enhanced expression of Δ133p53α rescues human astrocytes from Aβ-induced cellular senescence and SASP through both protection from DNA damage and dominant-negative inhibition of full-length p53, leading to inhibition of Aβ-induced, astrocyte-mediated neurotoxicity. The results presented here demonstrate that Δ133p53α manipulation could modulate cellular senescence in the context of AD, possibly opening new therapeutic avenues.

pmcIntroduction

There is a critical need to identify novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of age-associated diseases including dementia. Currently, 5.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and by 2050, this number is projected to reach nearly 14 million (Hebert et al., 2013).

AD is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a transmembrane protein cleaved by β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (known as BACE1) and γ-secretase to produce Aβ fragments between 37–43 amino acids long (Chow et al., 2010). These Aβ peptides aggregate and contribute to neurotoxicity and subsequent neurocognitive decline (Bush et al., 1994). The accumulation of Aβ increases with normal aging (Funato et al., 1998), and in a more accelerated manner in AD. In association with Aβ accumulations in the brain, several brain cell types, including astrocytes and microglia, adopt an inflammatory phenotype and function to clear Aβ from the extracellular space (Thal, 2012). However, prolonged activation of these glial cells in the presence of Aβ contributes to the chronic inflammation observed in AD. Although several forms of Aβ exist, there is increased interest in the soluble species of Aβ, particularly the oligomeric form such as Aβ1–42, which correlates better with disease severity (Mroczko et al., 2018).

Cellular senescence is characterized by sustained cell cycle arrest and is induced by telomere shortening (referred to as replicative senescence) or by cellular stressors inducing DNA damage and activating oncogenes. Common markers of cellular senescence include upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4A (Rayess et al., 2012) and p21WAF1 (Roninson, 2002), as well as increased activity of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), a lysosomal hydrolytic enzyme (Debacq-Chainiaux et al., 2009). When cells undergo senescence, they secrete various inflammatory cytokines which alter the tissue microenvironment and propagate neurodegeneration (Chinta et al., 2015). This inflammatory phenotype is collectively named the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, or SASP, but may vary depending on the cell type and the inducer of senescence (Borodkina et al., 2018). Astrocytes, an important regulator of brain homeostasis providing functional and metabolic support (Molofsky et al., 2012), are a major cell type undergoing senescence in the brain (Turnquist et al., 2016). Senescent astrocytes, which are induced by aging- or injury-associated replicative exhaustion (Turnquist et al., 2016) or in response to endogenous and external stresses such as irradiation (Turnquist et al., 2019) show phenotypic similarities to a subset of so-called reactive astrocytes in terms of increased secretion of pro-inflammatory SASP cytokines and neurotoxicity (Liddelow and Barres, 2017). Here, we show for the first time that Aβ induces astrocytic SASP, and identify a role for astrocytic SASP in Aβ promoted neurotoxicity. Aβ oligomers have been reported to induce senescence in astrocytes (Bhat et al., 2012) but the mechanism underlying Aβ-induced senescence is still to be elucidated.

TP53 plays a critical role in the initiation of cellular senescence through upregulating p53-inducible senescence genes such as p21WAF1 (Zilfou and Lowe, 2009). Elevated p53 immunoreactivity has been observed in sporadic and familial AD, particularly in white matter glial cells distributed in brain regions undergoing degeneration (Kitamura et al., 1997), suggesting that p53 and its regulatory factors in glial cells are involved in AD pathogenesis. The human TP53 gene encodes, in addition to full-length p53 protein (often simply called p53), at least 12 natural protein isoforms through alternative mRNA splicing or alternative promoter usage (Bourdon et al., 2005). Δ133p53α, an N-terminal truncated isoform, dominant-negatively inhibits full-length p53-mediated senescence and promotes DNA repair under conditions of accelerating DNA damage (Fujita et al., 2009; Horikawa et al., 2017; von Muhlinen et al., 2018; Turnquist et al., 2019). Expression of Δ133p53α was diminished in the brain tissue of AD patients, compared to age-matched controls (Turnquist et al., 2016). We have shown astrocytes to be one of the predominant cell types expressing Δ133p53α in the brain (Turnquist et al., 2016; Turnquist et al., 2019). Decreased expression of Δ133p53α was associated with radiation-induced and replicative senescence in human astrocytes, which was rescued by overexpression of Δ133p53 (Turnquist et al., 2016; Turnquist et al., 2019). All these findings have prompted us to investigate whether Δ133p53α plays a role in the underlying mechanism for Aβ-induced astrocyte senescence and SASP. It is unknown whether AD pathogenic agents such as Aβ directly induce this astrocyte phenotype and whether Δ133p53α has a protective effect against Aβ-induced astrocytic neurotoxicity. In this study, we show that treatment of primary human astrocytes with Aβ causes reduced expression of Δ133p53α and accelerated DNA damage, along with induction of senescence and SASP, and that lentiviral vector-based expression of Δ133p53α promotes DNA repair in Aβ-treated astrocytes and prevents them from SASP-mediated neurotoxicity. Together with a therapeutic effect of clearance of senescent glial cells against cognitive decline in mouse models (Bussian et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019), this study using human astrocytes emphasizes a causative role of astrocyte senescence in neurodegenerative diseases and supports further studies investigating Δ133p53α as a potential novel therapeutic target that can be leveraged in astrocytes.

Experimental Procedures

Primary cells and cell lines

Primary human astrocytes were purchased from Sciencell (Carlsbad, CA, USA) and cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 in astrocyte medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, growth supplement, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin all obtained from ScienCell Research Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA). Cells were passaged when confluent. Human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) (ACS-5004) were maintained in neural expansion media (ACS-3003) purchased from American Type Tissue Collection (Manassass, VA) passaged when 80% confluent. All experiments used the same batch of human astrocytes in proliferative phase (at passage numbers between 3 and 10). At the start of astrocyte culture experiments, 70,000 cells per well were plated in 6-well dishes, unless otherwise stated.

Preparation of Oligomeric Amyloid-beta

Synthetic Aβ1–42 pretreated with hexafluoroisopropanol HFIP (1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol) was purchased from Bachem (Switzerland) and oligomerized as described (Stine et al., 2003). Briefly, to generate oligomeric Aβ, the peptide film was dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 5 mM and sonicated. The suspension was diluted in phenol-free DMEM to a final concentration of 100 μM and incubated at 4°C overnight.

Cell Treatments

Cells were treated with Aβ according to the method previously published by Bhat et al. [16]. Human astrocytes were treated for 24 hours with oligomerized Aβ1–42 at a final concentration of 0.5 or 1 μM (as indicated in Figure legends; dose-dependent differences were not evident between 0.5 and 1 μM) in astrocyte media; 0.01% DMSO was used as control. After 24 hours, media was replaced without Aβ. At 72 hours post-treatment, cells were examined by SA-β-gal staining and for immunoblotting, and qRT-PCR.

Lentiviral vector transduction

As described previously (Turnquist et al., 2016; Horikawa et al., 2017), the pLOC lentiviral vector, which drives RFP as an ORF insert and IRES-translated GFP, was purchased from Open Biosystems (Lafayette, CO). For Δ133p53α expression, RFP was replaced with the Δ133p53α cDNA. These lentiviral constructs, together with the Trans-Lentiviral GIPZ packaging system (Open Biosystem), were transfected into 293T/17 Cells (ATCC, American Type Culture Collection) using Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen). The Δ133p53 cDNA was also cloned into pLenti6.3/TO/V5- DEST vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by using Spe I and Mlu I sites for constitutive overexpression and were transiently transfected into 293T/17 cells (ATCC) with the ViraPower lentiviral expression system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The lentiviral vector particles were collected 48 hours after transfection and used for overnight transduction to primary human astrocytes, followed by selection with blasticidin (1 μg/ml; Sigma–Aldrich) three days after transduction. The pLenti6.3/TO/V5- DEST lentiviral vector was used for Fig. 3 and the RFP/GFP pLOC lentiviral vector was used for all other experiments.

Trans-well Experiments

Human astrocytes were treated with Aβ1–42 in the top transwell chamber for 24 hours then the media was changed without Aβ1–42 and combined with NPCs. NPCs were plated on bottom transwell chamber 24 hours before combining with human astrocytes in 1:1 astrocyte and NPC media. After 72hr co-culture, accutase was used to collect NPCs for trypan blue staining and qRT-PCR.

SA-β-gal staining

SA-β-gal staining was performed according to the protocol of the Senescence-β-Galactosidase Staining Kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). At least 200 cells were counted in each treatment group from three independent experiments.

IL-6 Quantification

Quantification of IL-6 in media was assessed via Human IL-6 ELISA kit according to manufacturer instructions (Sigma Aldrich; St. Louis, MO).

Immunofluorescence

Cells were plated onto poly-D-lysine/laminin coated 8-chamber slides (Corning). After 24 hours, cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized with 0.01% Triton-X for 4 min, washed with PBS and then blocked in 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 1 were applied overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS before incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated to fluorophores: Alexa-488, 568- and -647 at a dilution of 1:400 (Life Technologies). Coverslips were mounted on with Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc.; Burlingame, CA).

Immunoblotting

Immunoblotting was carried out as previously described (Turnquist et al., 2019). Briefly, cells (two 6-wells per condition) were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. NuPAGE 4 × loading buffer was added to all lysates and then boiled for 5 min before loading onto a Tris-glycine gel (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked in 1:1 mixture of Superblock and Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS, 125 mM Tris and 200 mM NaCl), containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 10% non-fat dry milk. Membranes were incubated in the primary antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 1 overnight at 4 °C, and washed three times in TBS-Tween-20. Membranes were then incubated in HRP- conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The signal was visualized with SuperSignal developing reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (BioRad Laboratories) and ImageLab software was used for quantitative image data analysis.

RNA extraction and cDNA preparation

Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were homogenized and lysate mixed 1:1 with 70% ethanol and centrifuged through an RNeasy Mini Spin column. RNA was eluted with RNase-free water. The abundance and quality of the resulting RNA was assessed using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). RNA samples were diluted so that 2000 ng total RNA could be used for a 5-μl reverse-transcription reaction. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen).

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)

For the quantitative analysis of mRNA expression, the CFX384 Real-Time PCR system (BioRad Laboratories Hercules, CA, USA) was used. Each reaction was performed in at least triplicate using 2 μl of cDNA in a final volume of 5 μl. The following thermal cycle was used for all samples: 10 min-95 °C; 40 cycles of 30 s-95 °C, 40 s-primer specific annealing temperatures, 40 s-72 °C. The expression level of each target gene was analyzed based on the ΔΔCt method and the results expressed as relative expression normalized to GAPDH. Taqman primer assays for p21 (Hs00355782_m1), NOS2 (Hs01075529_m1), IL-8 (Hs00174103_m1), IL-1β (Hs01555410_m1), TNFα (Hs00174128_m1), GADD45 (Hs00169255_m1), BAX (Hs00180269_m1), PUMA (Hs00248075_m1), NGF (Hs00171458_m1), IFG1 (Hs01547656_m1), and GAPDH (Hs02758991_g1) were purchased from Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Results

Aβ Decreases Expression of Δ133p53α and Induces Senescence in Human Astrocytes

In order to assess Aβ effect on astrocyte senescence and p53 isoform expression, primary human astrocytes were treated with oligomeric Aβ1–42 (referred to as Aβ for short from here out) for 24 hours then collected after a 3 day “recovery period” in fresh media (Fig. 1A). We did not observe any measurable cell death during or after Aβ exposure. Treatment with Aβ increased expression of p53, its target cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1 and another cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4A, while decreasing endogenous Δ133p53α expression (Fig. 1B–D). Aβ inhibited expression of cell proliferation marker Ki-67 (Fig. 1E), and increased SA-β-gal activity (Fig. 1F), a marker of cellular senescence. These results indicate that Aβ leads to activation of p53, with downregulation of its inhibitory isoform Δ133p53α, and induces senescence in human astrocytes.

Astrocytes Display SASP Following Aβ Treatment

IL-6 is a major contributor to SASP and is often increased in aging-related diseases (Maggio et al., 2006). Astrocytes treated with Aβ demonstrated increased IL-6 secretion (Fig. 1G) and elevated mRNA expression of common SASP cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β and IL-8, and of NOS2 (iNOS) associated with SASP and oxidative stress (Fig. 1H). Additionally, astrocytes have reduced expression of neurotrophic factors (IGF-1 and NGF) (Fig. 1I). These results further support the induction of senescence by Aβ and identify features of proinflammatory and neurotoxic SASP in Aβ-treated human astrocytes.

Aβ Induces DNA Damage in Astrocytes

DNA damage contributes to the development of AD and has been observed in astrocytes found in AD vulnerable regions of the brain (Myung et al., 2008; Coppede and Migliore, 2009; Mao and Reddy, 2011). Although DNA damage-induced transient cell cycle arrest is a mechanism for preventing the replication of cells with potential oncogenic mutations (di Fagagna, 2008), increased accumulation of DNA damage in persistent senescent cells can contribute to aging-associated diseases. In the case of Aβ, Aβ1–42 peptide oligomers demonstrate DNA nicking activities in vitro similar to nucleases (Suram et al., 2007) and Aβ-associated oxidative stress could lead to DNA double-stranded breaks (González-Reyes et al., 2017). To examine if Aβ-induced astrocyte senescence is associated with DNA damage, astrocytes were treated with Aβ1–42 as above and labeled for double-stranded DNA damage markers γH2AX and 53BP1. We observed increased numbers of γH2AX- and 53BP1-positive foci in astrocytes treated with to Aβ (Fig. 2A–C, Supplementary Fig. 1A and B), as well as elevated mRNA expression of GADD45, a DNA damage-inducible gene (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that Aβ induces DNA damage in astrocytes, which could consequently contribute to the induction of senescence.

Δ133p53α Inhibits Aβ-induced DNA Damage

Previous studies have shown that Δ133p53α promotes DNA repair in fibroblasts and cancer cells (Gong et al., 2015; von Muhlinen et al., 2018). To examine whether Δ133p53α also protects human astrocytes from Aβ-accelerated DNA damage, we generated human astrocytes expressing the lentiviral vector-driven Δ133p53α (Supplementary Fig. 2). Although Δ133p53α reduced baseline levels of γH2AX foci in control cells without Aβ, the more striking effect of Δ133p53α was observed against Aβ-induced DNA damage (Fig. 3A and B). The Δ133p53α-expressing astrocytes, whether or not treated with Aβ, showed only modest numbers of γH2AX foci, suggesting that they were completely resistant to Aβ-induced DNA damage (Fig. 3B). The protective effect of Δ133p53α against Aβ-induced DNA damage was also confirmed by the analysis of 53BP1 foci (Fig. 3A and C). The protective effect of Δ133p53α may be attributed in part to increased expression of the DNA repair protein RAD51, which plays a key role in homologous recombination [22]. Consistent with previous findings (von Muhlinen et al., 2018), RAD51 was upregulated by Δ133p53α in the presence or absence of Aβ (Fig. 3D).

Δ133p53α Protects Astrocytes from Aβ-induced Senescence

To determine whether the lentiviral vector-driven expression of Δ133p53α would protect from Aβ-induced senescence, control vector-transduced and Δ133p53α-expressing primary human astrocytes were examined for senescent phenotypes. We found that Δ133p53α-expressing astrocytes showed no significant increase in SA-β-gal staining after Aβ treatment, compared to an increase up to 50% positivity in control astrocytes (Fig. 4A, B). The Δ133p53α-expressing astrocytes expressed lower levels of p21 mRNA, which did not respond to Aβ, in contrast to the control cells showing the higher basal level and its further increase in response to Aβ (Fig. 4C). Similarly, the Δ133p53α-expressing astrocytes secreted less IL-6 and there was no induction by Aβ treatment, while Aβ significantly increased the IL-6 secretion in the control cells (Fig. 4D). Aβ treatment also induced the TNFα expression in the control cells, but not in the Δ133p53α-expressing astrocytes (Fig. 4E). In addition, the lentiviral expression of Δ133p53α upregulated neurotrophic IGF-1 and NGF and rendered them resistant to reduction by Aβ (Fig. 4F, G). These results indicate that Δ133p53α protects astrocytes from Aβ-induced senescence and SASP, along with upregulation of the neurotrophic growth factors.

Δ133p53α Prevents Astrocyte-mediated Neurotoxicity Following Aβ Treatment

Astrocyte dysfunction can result in NPC death, further propagating neurodegeneration (Molofsky et al., 2012). To investigate the protective role of Δ133p53α in Aβ-induced astrocyte neurotoxicity, we co-cultured transduced astrocytes expressing Δ133p53α and control vector with NPCs separated by a trans-well membrane. Astrocytes were treated with Aβ for 24 hours, then fed with fresh media without Aβ, and the astrocytes were combined with NPCs in trans-well system. NPCs were in co-culture with astrocytes for 3 days and then analyzed or collected (Fig. 5A). Cell viability measured by trypan blue was decreased in NPCs co-cultured with vector control astrocytes exposed to Aβ, but no significant loss of cell viability was observed in NPCs co-cultured with Δ133p53α-expressing, Aβ-exposed astrocytes (Fig. 5B). To determine if the NPCs were undergoing apoptosis, we quantified cleaved caspase 3 positivity via immunofluorescence and observed an increase of cleaved caspase 3-positive cells in NPCs co-cultured with Aβ-treated vector control astrocytes, but not in NPCs co-cultured with astrocytes expressing Δ133p53α with or without Aβ treatment (Fig. 5C, D). Additionally, we found increased expression of proapoptotic genes BAX and PUMA and a cell cycle inhibitor p21 in NPCs co-cultured with Aβ-exposed vector control astrocytes, but again not in those co-cultured with astrocytes expressing Δ133p53α (Fig. 5E–G). These findings indicate that Δ133p53α expression in astrocytes inhibits Aβ-induced, astrocytic SASP-mediated neurotoxicity.

Discussion

Astrocytes provide neurotrophic support to neurons (Thal, 2012), however with physiological and accelerated aging, endogenous and exogenous pathogenic agents and stimuli, and chronic stress and injury, they may become dysregulated and dysfunctional (Liddelow and Barres, 2017). The distinct differences between aged reactive astrocytes and senescent astrocytes is still not well defined, however it is clear that chronic exposure to pathogenic agents contributes to astrocyte reactivity and aging (Escartin et al., 2021). Aβ represents one such endogenous agent for AD pathogenesis, which may lead to chronic oxidative stress and aging-associated phenotypes (Mao and Reddy, 2011), including induction of astrocyte senescence. Aβ peptides, including soluble Aβ oligomers, correlate with disease severity (Bhat et al., 2012) and upregulate p53, a key mediator of cellular senescence (Ohyagi et al., 2005; Zilfou and Lowe, 2009). Consistent with previous studies (Bhat et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2019), we demonstrate that Aβ increases p53 activity and its downstream targets, thereby inducing cellular senescence in primary human astrocytes (Fig. 1D–F). Aβ-induced astrocyte senescence is associated with upregulation of proinflammatory SASP cytokines (such as IL-6) and reduced expression of neurotrophic growth factors (such as IGF-1 and NGF) (Fig. 1G–I), which both contributed to astrocyte-mediated neurotoxicity in our previous studies on replicatively and radiation-induced senescent astrocytes (Turnquist et al., 2016; Turnquist et al., 2019). These results are consistent with previous reports of the “A1 reactive” and “astrosenescence” phenotypes (Liddelow and Barres, 2017; Cohen and Torres, 2019). Our data in this study also indicate that the change in these soluble factors from Aβ-induced senescent astrocytes leads to neuronal apoptosis in transwell co-culture experiment (Fig. 5, Vector control). Of note, in consistence with accumulation of DNA damage in AD brain tissues (Turnquist et al., 2016), our immunofluorescence staining of γH2AX and 53BP1 revealed that Aβ induces DNA double-stranded breaks in human astrocytes (Fig. 2), which cause p53 activation and senescence induction (di Fagagna, 2008) possibly by a mechanism involving p38MAPK (Bhat et al., 2012; Mombach et al., 2015). The Aβ-induced DNA damage is likely due to oxidative stress-induced generation of DNA double-stranded breaks (Mah et al., 2010; Mao and Reddy, 2011; González-Reyes et al., 2017) and/or a direct nuclease activity of Aβ (Suram et al., 2007).

This study for the first time identifies Δ133p53α as an endogenous regulator of Aβ-induced astrocyte senescence and as a possible therapeutic target for Aβ-induced neurotoxicity (summarized in Fig. 6). Aβ diminishes the expression level of endogenous Δ133p53α in human astrocytes (Fig. 1B, C), possibly through decreasing CHIP/STUB1 expression (Oddo et al., 2008) resulting in the autophagic degradation of Δ133p53α (Horikawa et al., 2014). The lentiviral vector-mediated reconstitution of Δ133p53α expression prevents the cells from Aβ-induced DNA damage (Fig. 3), Aβ-induced senescence and SASP (Fig. 4) and Aβ-induced astrocytic neurotoxicity (Fig. 5). Although the effect of Δ133p53α on DNA damage (Fig. 3B, D), p21 expression (Fig. 4C) and IL-6 secretion (Fig. 4D) is significantly observed even without Aβ, it is much more evident against Aβ-induced changes. These are consistent with our previous data that Δ133p53α inhibits p53 transcriptional activity for senescence and prevents cells from DNA damage (Turnquist et al., 2016, Turnquist et al., 2019, Fujita et al., 2009, Horikawa et al., 2017, von Muhlinen et al., 2018). While the astrocyte-neuron co-culture experiment has successfully allowed us to examine astrocyte-mediated neurotoxicity in this and our previous studies (Turnquist et al., 2016, Turnquist et al., 2019), future studies need to better recapitulate in vivo brain environment, for example, by prolonged Aβ exposure and longer-term observation reflecting the chronic and progressive nature of the disease, by using brain organoid culture, and by establishing transgenic mice expressing Δ133p53α, which otherwise exists only in human and primates (Turnquist et al., 2016, Joruiz et al., 2020). Our data suggest that Δ133p53α expression in astrocytes may be therapeutically enhanced in future applications to prevent or delay Aβ-induced pathological changes in AD.

Inhibition of p53 by expression of mutant p53 or use of a synthetic inhibitor has been shown to attenuate Aβ-mediated neuronal death and preserve cognitive functioning (Culmsee et al., 2001; Mattson and Ashery, 2009). However, such total inhibition of p53 could be mutagenic and oncogenic, thus not being considered for use in patients. In contrast, Δ133p53α-overexpressing cells are protected from p53-mediated senescence, while they maintain p53-mediated DNA repair function and apoptotic elimination of severely damaged cells (Fujita et al., 2009; Horikawa and Harris, 2017; Horikawa et al., 2017). Furthermore, we have shown evidence of Δ133p53α non-oncogenic and non-mutagenic properties in lymphocytes (Horikawa et al, 2017). However, data still needs to be accumulated for further ensuring its non-oncogenic and non-mutagenic property in wider varieties of normal human cells types and in vivo studies with Δ133p53α-transgenic mice. This selective dominant-negative inhibitory activity of Δ133p53α, together with its DNA repair-promoting activity (Gong et al., 2015; von Muhlinen et al., 2018), well explains the beneficial effects of Δ133p53α observed in this study. Additional studies investigating if Δ133p53α continues to protect from senescence in long term chronic exposure to Aβ, combined with in vivo evidence from Δ133p53α-transgenic AD mouse models will be necessary to continue towards therapeutic applications.

Figure 6: Δ133p53α in astrocytes and Aβ-induced neurotoxicity.

(A) Aβ accelerates DNA damage and upregulates p53 in astrocytes without Δ133p53α-mediated inhibition, leading to astrocyte senescence and SASP. Astrocyte SASP not only promotes neuronal apoptosis but also generates and spreads proinflammatory environments, which in turn amplifies neurotoxicity. (B) Genetic enhancement of Δ133p53α (e.g., vector-driven expression in this study) or, ideally in future, its pharmacologic activation in astrocytes may constitute a therapeutic strategy for AD by disrupting such Aβ-triggered neurotoxic cascades.

Highlights

Aβ diminishes the expression of the p53 isoform Δ133p53α, and induces DNA damage, cellular senescence, and SASP in human astrocytes.

Enhanced expression of Δ133p53α protects human astrocytes from Aβ-induced DNA damage and cellular senescence.

Enhanced expression of Δ133p53α prevents astrocyte-mediated neurotoxicity.

These in vitro findings on cultured astrocytes and neurons warrant further investigation toward future therapeutic application of Δ133p53α.
