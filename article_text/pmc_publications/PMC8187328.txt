In our continuing efforts to develop novel neuroprotectants for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a series of analogs based on a lead compound that was recently shown to target the mitochondrial complex I were designed, synthesized and biologically characterized to understand the structure features that are important for neuroprotective activities. The results from a cellular AD model highlighted the important roles of the 4-OH on the phenyl ring and the 5-OCH3 on the indole ring of the lead compound. The results also demonstrated that the β-keto moiety can be modified to retain or improve the neuroprotective activity. Docking studies of selected analogs to the FMN site of mitochondrial complex I also supported the observed neuroprotective activities. Collectively, the results provide further information to guide optimization and development of analogs based on this chemical scaffold as neuroprotectants with a novel mechanism of action for AD.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia affecting ~5.5 million Americans and more than 30 million individuals worldwide.1 Several medications have been approved for AD patients; however, they only help manage the symptoms of AD patients and there is yet no cure available for this devastating disease. Although significant efforts and resources from both academia and pharmaceutical industry have been devoted to discovery and development of disease-modifying agents for AD, our community is still anxiously waiting for the successful news from many ongoing clinical trials that target multiple pathogenic factors implicated in AD.2–9 Therefore, novel chemical entities with novel mechanisms of action are desperately needed to fuel the pipeline of AD therapeutics.

Recently, we designed and developed small molecule compounds based on a novel chemical scaffold that was constructed by reassembling critical structural features of β-diketone and acetamide from curcumin and melatonin that have shown some neuroprotective activities.10 The following in vivo studies in mice and transgenic AD mice demonstrated that the lead compound, ZCM-I-1 (Figure 1), is a brain penetrant after oral administration and showed activity of amelioration of AD pathology in transgenic APP/PS1 mice.11 Recent mechanistic studies demonstrated that this lead compound targets a unique binding site, the Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) site, of mitochondrial complex I (Fig. 1).12 Since complex I is one of the major complexes of mitochondrial electron transport chain that produces the majority of reactive oxygen species (ROS),13–14 and oxidative stress has been shown to induce other AD pathology,15 this might explain the observed amelioration of oxidative stress and Aβ pathology in the AD mice by ZCM-I-1’s interaction with complex I FMN site. To guide further development of new analogs based on this chemical scaffold as chemical probes to understand the pathological roles of mitochondria dysfunction and as potential neuroprotectants for AD, herein, we report the synthesis and biological characterization of a series of analogs designed to understand the essential structural features for the observed neuroprotective activities of the lead compound.

Originally, two compounds, ZCM-I-1 and ZCM-I-2, were developed,10 and rescue experiments in MC65 cells established their protective potency, 32.6 ± 1.3 and 29.0 ± 0.7 nM, respectively (Fig. 2). MC65 cells are a well-established cellular AD model that conditionally express C99, the C-terminus fragment of APP using tetracycline removal (-TC) serves as transgene suppressor.16 Upon removal of TC, MC65 cells produce Aβ aggregates including Aβ oligomers, and the ultimate cell death in this model is associated with the production of Aβ aggregates and oxidative stress, two well-studied AD pathologies.16–18 Our mechanistic studies with this cell model suggested a necroptotic cell death mechanism mediated by mitochondrial ROS mitoROS) and Ca2+ dysregulation.19 More relevantly, this cellular model was successful in identifying mitochondria modulators.20–22 Studies from our group and others have also demonstrated that the rescue assay of MC65 cells serves as a suitable phenotypic screening model to identify potential neuroprotectants.10,23–32 In order to understand the structural features that are essential to the protective activity of ZCM-I-1 and ZCM-I-2, we focused our modifications on three domains of the scaffold: the phenyl ring; the indole ring; and the middle β-keto moiety (Fig. 2). The modifications on the phenyl ring employed a bioisosteric replacement with heterocycles strategy to replace the 4-OH moiety. On the other end of the scaffold, the role of the 5-OCH3 on indole ring was primarily evaluated. In the middle β-keto moiety, analogs were designed by either constraining it to a cyclic structure or changing to an OH or diazirine moiety. In total, twenty-three analogs were designed and made.

The analogs 1–9 with structural modifications on the phenyl ring were synthesized following our reported procedures.10 Chemical syntheses for the remaining compounds were accomplished following the procedures outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. As shown in Scheme 1, phthalimide-protected 5-methoxy-tryptamine 25 was de-methylated by BBr3 in dichloromethane (DCM) to give 26. Protection with TBDMSCl or alkylation with propargyl bromide in the presence of Cs2CO3 of 26 followed by deprotection with methylhydrazine in ethanol afforded 27 and 28, respectively. For the synthesis of amine intermediates 31–33, 5-nitro-indole 29 was reacted with oxalyl chloride followed by reaction with ammonia to get oxalylamide 30. Compound 30 was then reduced with BH3 or LiAlH4 to yield intermediate 31 or 32, respectively. Compound 32 was converted to 33 by reaction with NaNO2 and NaN3. Reaction of phosphonium ylide 34 with TBDMS-protected 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde afforded β-keto ester 35. Catalytic hydrogenation of 35 yielded 36. Reaction of 35 or 36 with amines 27, 28, 31, 32, or 33 followed by the removal of the TBDMS group afforded compounds 10–15.33–34

As shown in Scheme 2, aldol reaction of ester 37 or 38 with MOM-protected 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde in the presence of K2CO3 in ethanol yielded 39 and 40, respectively. Ester-amide exchange reactions of 5-methoxy-tryptamine with 39 or 40 followed by de-protection, produced 16 and 17, which was then reduced to provide 18 and 19, respectively. Racemic 20 was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of ZCM-I-2. The syntheses of diazirine-containing compounds 21–23 were accomplished by direct reaction of their corresponding β-keto amide compounds with ammonia in the presence of hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid (HOSA) followed by oxidation with I2 in the presence of Et3N in methanol.12

After chemical synthesis, we first evaluated their protective potencies to rescue MC65 cells under –TC conditions, a well-established cellular AD model that involves multiple known risk factors such as Aβ oligomers, oxidative stress, calcium dyshomeostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction.12–32 As shown in Table 1, replacement of the 4-OH-benzene ring with pyridine or furan led to complete or significant loss of the neuroprotective activity as demonstrated by compounds 1–4. Although we intended to use pyridine or furan to maintain potential H-bond interactions by these heteroatoms, the results of this set of analogs may suggest the important roles of a potential H-bond donor, i.e., by the 4-OH of ZCM-I-2. The results of 5, 6, and 7 with a significant loss of potency further support this notion. Replacement of the 4-OH with a 4-F, however, retained the neuroprotective potency as demonstrated by compounds 8 and 9. This may suggest that an H-bond or Halogen-bond donor is needed at this position. On the other end of the structure, the results of 10 and 11 demonstrated the importance of the 5-OCH3 for the observed protective activity, and suggest the necessity of an alkoxy substituent at this position. This notion is further supported by the results of 12, which shows potency comparable to ZCM-I-1. Replacement of the 5-OCH3 in ZCM-I-1 with a 5-NO2 or 5-NH2 led to dramatic loss of activity as evidenced by 13 and 14. However, analog 15 with a 5-N3 substituent showed increased protective potency (~2 fold). Besides being part of the structure activity relationship studies, one of the reasons to design compound 12 and 15 was to explore the feasibility of designing photo-affinity labeling probes for future mechanistic studies. Structural constraints of the β-keto moiety into a cyclic structure led to 4–7 fold or complete loss of protective activity as demonstrated by the results of 16–19 (all are racemic compounds). Notably, reduction of the β-ketone to OH increased the protective potency by ~3.5 fold as shown by compound 20 (racemic compound). Studies of individual enantiomers of this analog in the future may shed light on the impact of stereochemistry at this position on biological activities. Conversion of the β-ketone moiety into a diazirine led to an analog (21) with slightly less protective potency. The results of 12 and 21 led us to design a potential chemical probe 22 for future mechanistic studies and the results confirmed comparable potency of this compound with parent compound ZCM-I-1. The result of compound 23 further supported the important roles of the 4-OH substituent in the observed neuroprotective activities.

Recently, our mechanistic studies of ZCM-I-1 using photo-affinity labeling probes derived from the sttructure of ZCM-I-1 that contains a diazirine moiety and a 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan moiety, and competition studies demonstrated that this molecular probe can interact with proteins that compose the FMN binding site of mitochondrial complex I (IF).12 The results suggest that analogs based on this chemical scaffold interact with the IF site of mitochondria to exert the observed neuroprotective activities. So, we next conducted computational docking studies to illuminate how these analogs interact with the IF site and whether the docking results support the biological results. To this end, we exploited the T. thermophiles complex I X-ray structure (PDBID: 3IAM)35 within which the IF site shares 76.7% identity with that of human complex I. In order to better model how the compounds bind to human NDUFV1 (NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein 1), a subunit within the IF site that interacts with NADH and FMN, twenty homology models were generated using Modeller (version 9.19). These models were then aligned with the crystal structure and the rmsd was caluclated for the backbone atoms for fitting. The model with an rmsd of 1.16 was used for further investigation. Compounds 2, 9, and 20 were selected for the docking studies to represent the biological activity differences. Docked poses were generated using GOLD2020 and scored with HINT, a program developed by us.36 The resulting interactions of ZCM-I-1 with the IF site with a HINT score of 683 were found to be comparable to NADH’s HINT score of 662. The residues E209, K226, and E121 made H-bond interactions with the indole nitrogen, the oxygen of the amide, and the phenolic oxygen of ZCM-I-1, respectively. This is slightly different from our previous studies when docking ZCM-I-1 into the T. thermophiles nqo1 (NADH quinone dehydrogenase 1) subunit of 3IAM in which residues of E185, A68 and Y180 are involved in H-bond interactions. However, in various scored poses, these residues collectively contribute to the polar binding score of the compound. Compound 2 scored (HINT score of 180) lower than ZCM-I-1, which is consistent with the protective potency results. This is mainly due to the loss of interactions of E121 with the phenolic oxygen (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, compound 9 was scored at 313 in the docking studies, lower than that of ZCM-I-1, while it showed comparable potency as ZCM-I-1 in the MC65 rescue assay. Similar to compound 2, the observed lower HINT score of 9 is caused by the loss of its interaction with the E121 residue (Fig. 3B), however, its -F should not be as effective as the -OH of the parent compound in hydrogen bond formation. Further studies with additional analogs may be necessary to investigate whether halogen bond interactions or other effects are contributing to the observed biological potency. Since 20 contains a chiral carbon, both entiomers were generated and docked into the model. The results revealed that the R-isomer showed an improved HINT scoring of 729 while the S-isomer showed a decreased HINT scoring of 599. The increased HINT score of the R-isomer of 20 is mainly due to the relief of the unfavorable interactions between the ketone moiety of ZCM-I-1 and A91 upon reduction to a hydroxy (Fig. 3C). In the S-isomer, the steric clash between A91 and OH is more costly than in the R-isomer (Fig. 3D). On the other end of the compounds, residues F93, F101 and F229 form a hydrophobic interaction pocket with the 5-CH3O-indole ring. Importantly, each of these residues and their homlogous counterparts is important for the binding of NADH32 as shown in the crystal structure.

In summary, a series of analogs based on the structures of ZCM-I-1 and ZCM-I-2 were designed to understand the structural features that are important to the neuroprotective activities. The results established the important roles of the 4-OH on the phenyl ring and an alkoxy substituent on the indole ring on the observed neuroprotective activities. However, replacement of the 4-OH of the phenyl ring with a 4-F substituent retained the neuroprotective activity. Furthermore, reduction of the β-keto to a β-OH group led to increased potency, thus encouraging further structural exploration of this OH moiety for future molecular optimization and design. The results from the structural modifications also led to an analog that will serve as a chemical probe to facilitate mechanistic and target identification studies. Docking studies of selected analogs into the IF site of mitochondrial complex I revealed a possible polar interaction on the phenol end of the compounds and a hydrophobic interaction on the indole end of the compounds. However, the relative biological activities of compound 9 and the parent ZCM-I-1 may require additional analogs to reconcile the docking results. Collectively, the results from this series of compounds provided guidance for future design and development of next generation of mitochondria-targeted compounds based on this chemical scaffold as potential neuroprotectants for AD.
