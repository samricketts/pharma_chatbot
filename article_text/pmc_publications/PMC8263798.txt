Growing evidence supports significant involvement of immune dysfunction in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, several of which also display prominent sex differences across prevalence, pathology, and symptomology. In this review, we summarize evidence from human studies of established and recent findings of sex differences in Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and discuss how sex-specific CNS innate immune activity could contribute to downstream sex differences in these diseases. We examine human genomic and transcriptomics studies in each neurodegenerative disease through the lens of sex differences in the neuroimmune system and highlight the importance of stratifying sex in clinical and translational research studies. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the existing studies, and outline recommendations for further advancing sex-based analyses to uncover novel disease mechanisms that could ultimately help treat both sexes.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Immune system dysregulation has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Interestingly, most human diseases related to immune dysfunction have sex biases, including diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) (1, 2). For instance, AD is more prevalent in females compared to males while PD has the opposite sex-bias (3, 4) (Table 1). One compelling hypothesis is that these sex-biases in disease manifest from sex differences in the CNS immune system and immune cell interactions.

Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain and display varying levels of molecular sex differences (5–7). In rodents, microglia exhibit transcriptomic and proteomic sex differences that increase with age (4). Our recent study also demonstrated that microglial microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in translational regulation are expressed in a sex-specific manner (8). Consequently, removal of these miRNAs results in sex-specific microglial responses to AD-related tau pathology in mice (8). Less is known about microglial sex differences in humans. One study isolated microglia from freshly-resected human tissues from 5 ∼ 15-year-old patients with varying diagnoses (tumor, epilepsy, and acute ischemia) and performed population-level RNA sequencing. In this study, most differentially expressed genes between males and females were encoded by sex chromosomes (n = 12 female, 7 male) (9), suggesting minimal microglial transcriptomic sex differences at this age. This is consistent with previous findings in rodents, where microglial sex differences become more robust in older mice (10, 11). Other groups have conducted detailed transcriptomic profiles of microglia in human brain tissues, but these studies regressed out sex or had too few samples to draw sex-specific conclusions (12, 13).

Though comprehensive studies of human microglial sex differences are lacking, significant sex differences have been observed in human peripheral macrophages, a cell type related to microglia, that may shed light on microglial biology. For instance, a study from the ImmGen report analyzing transcriptomic data of innate and adaptive immune cells found that human and murine innate immune cells, especially macrophages (CD14+ cells), had more sex differences in gene expression than other immune cells, including genes involved in the interferon, anti-viral response (14). Though not significantly overlapping, some of these differentially expressed genes were also seen between male versus female microglia (14). These studies suggest transcriptomic sex differences in humans may be subtle, specific to immune cell subpopulations, and especially prominent in microglia along with peripheral macrophages.

Our review focuses on neuroimmune sex differences in four neurodegenerative diseases that exhibit clinical sex differences: Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and highlights sex-specific findings from human studies (Table 1). We focus on human studies with limited overview of rodent findings, which have been reviewed elsewhere (3, 4, 15). Our objective is to identify patterns within sex differences in the neuroimmune system and highlight the importance of stratifying sex in clinical and translational research studies.

MAIN TEXT:

Multiple Sclerosis

Sex differences in clinical phenotypes and symptomology in MS:

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous, auto-immune, demyelinating disease of the CNS, with clinical symptoms including vision loss, impaired mobility, and cognitive decline. MS is stratified into three clinical subtypes. Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is characterized by intermittent inflammatory events followed by complete or partial recovery and remission and can develop into secondary progressive MS (SPMS), which takes a more gradual, steady clinical course, much like primary progressive MS (PPMS) (16).

Like other autoimmune diseases, MS has higher incidence and prevalence in females than males, at a ratio of 3:1 in RRMS; this bias has increased over the past few decades, largely explained by the increase in female incidence (17, 18). Though the incidence is higher in females, males seem to have a shorter time to disability and a higher rate of conversion from RRMS to SPMS (19), while females have a higher relapse rate than males with RRMS (20). Males also have greater rates of brain atrophy and lesion burden on MRI scans (21–23) and histopathology (24, 25), though these findings could be confounded by not controlling for MS type and/or duration of disease (26). Sex hormones also seem to play a large role on disease course, as MS risk and disease relapse rate increase during puberty and postpartum, but decrease during pregnancy (27, 28). These studies demonstrate that sex differences in MS dynamically change over the course of the disease (initiation versus disease progression) as well as with patient age, requiring an understanding of the sex-specific immune pathways involved in this autoimmune disorder at different disease stages.

Myeloid cell involvement in MS and their potential sex differences

Many studies have focused on the central role of T cells in MS, owing to the strong genetic association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes involved in antigen presentation by immune cells (29, 30). The ratio of female to male MS patients was found to be higher in HLA-DRB1*15-positive genotypes compared to HLA-DRB1*15-negative patients, showing interactions between sex and genetic risk (31) and many studies have also demonstrated sex differences in T cells (32, 33). Beyond T cells, diverse immune cell types and their interactions are involved in the pathogenesis of MS within the brain, including microglia and macrophages (34, 35). Histologically, microglia are observed in early active MS lesions as well as after the initial period of demyelination, when lymphocyte infiltration is less prominent, but microglia-mediated demyelination is still observed (36). One study found that patients with more severe disease, measured by progression rate, had a higher proportion of lesions with foamy microglia/macrophages (25). Microglia in these lesions have activated profiles, shown through the loss of P2RY12 protein expression and increased expression of pro-inflammatory markers such as CD68 and MHC antigens (37–39).

Transcriptomic analysis of microglia isolated from normal-appearing grey and white matter regions in MS and control patients also showed regionally-specific changes based on disease status (40). Microglia enriched in MS patient brains upregulate genes involved in lysosomal pathways, lipid catabolism and foam cell differentiation (40), including many genes reminiscent of disease-associated microglial signatures found previously in a murine amyloid model (41). Indeed, a recent single-cell study of microglia from human MS patient brains found diverse microglial subpopulations, some of which also upregulate genes related to lipid metabolism (42). Interestingly, gene expression markers for certain disease-associated subpopulations correlate well with microglia subpopulations found in the cuprizone demyelination and remyelination mouse model (42), suggesting differential microglial states may be responding to and potentially contributing to the different pathological microenvironments in MS.

However, whether sex differences in the MS histopathological findings are driven by microglia is unknown, as few studies have looked specifically at microglial sex differences in the context of MS. White matter plaques can be classified into specific categories based on the presence or absence of microglia/macrophages and the specific myelin contents inside of these cells (43–45). These plaque types and their frequencies dynamically change over the course of disease and are sex-dependent (44), and the categorizations are correlated with sex-biased disease progression and clinical symptomology, raising the possibility that sex-specific differences in microglial state drive some of the sex differences in MS.

The potential role of hormone signaling onto microglia in MS is compelling as microglia express estrogen receptor-α (ERα) and progesterone receptor (PGR). The involvement of androgen/estrogen receptors and response elements in innate immunity has also been covered in several excellent reviews (46–49). The expression of ERα and PGR is increased in active and inactive MS lesions at the mRNA level, with higher PGR expression in female than male MS patient lesions (24). This same study further found sex-specific expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF in these lesions, and showed that human postmortem astrocytes and microglia incubated with TNF could upregulate ERα, though this in vitro study was not done in a sex-specific manner (24). More specific studies are needed to determine the contribution of hormonal signaling onto microglia from MS patients, and the role of microglia in mediating sex differences in MS.

Alzheimer’s Disease:

Sex differences in clinical and pathological phenotypes in AD

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the primary cause of late-onset dementia, characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognition, and currently has no cure. The worldwide female-to-male AD ratio is 2:1, though this may be skewed by the fact that females live longer than males. Moreover, epidemiological studies assessing AD incidence and prevalence by sex show geographical and socio-economic heterogeneity and therefore are inconclusive (50, 51). However, sex differences also exist in the clinical manifestation and progression of the disease. For instance, most studies testing cognition in AD dementia find that females score lower than males in verbal memory and fluency tasks (52–54). The rate of cognitive decline and the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD is also higher in females than males (55–58). Although there are discrepancies in whether the measured pathological biomarkers vary between sexes, studies found that the same pathological burden can have more detrimental effects on cognition in females than males (59–61). In the case of mortality rate, however, males with AD experience higher mortality than female patients (62, 63).

Interestingly, studies have found an interaction between sex and various AD genetic risk factors (64), including the most prevalent genetic risk factor for AD, APOE4, such that female APOE4 carriers have a higher conversion rate from MCI to AD, especially in younger cohorts, suggesting female APOE4 carriers have a higher susceptibility to AD (65–69). Many of these studies leveraged existing GWAS data and stratified the analysis by sex, finding novel sex-specific associations (70, 71). Together, the clinical and genetics studies support the existence of sex bias in AD and prompt the need for further molecular investigations that take sex into account during data collection and analysis.

Transcriptomic microglial sex-differences in brains from AD patients

Microglia and the neuroimmune response have been implicated in AD pathogenesis, and GWAS have shown many disease-risk alleles in immune-related genes (72–74). Recent advancements in human tissue transcriptomics have also enabled comprehensive characterizations of the expression-level differences between brains of AD and healthy, age-matched control patients. Unfortunately, these studies typically have small numbers of sex-matched samples and/or regress out sex during their analysis. One single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) study of the entorhinal cortex, for instance, reported some of the data variability could be explained by sex, though this variability was lower than the variability explained by individual samples (75). Another study using bulk-sequencing of microglia isolated from frozen human tissues also found most genes differentially expressed by sex were encoded by sex chromosomes (76). The number of female and male patient samples, however, were low for both studies (6 male, 2 female for Grubman et al.; 3 AD female, 5 AD male, 4 Control female, 9 Control male for Srinivasan et al.).

One of the most comprehensive studies was conducted by Mathys and colleagues, in which authors performed snRNA-seq analysis on a large cohort of AD and control prefrontal cortex brain tissues (48 individuals: 24 with no/low AD pathology, 24 with high-levels of pathology, with equal numbers of male and female patients in each group) (77). In this study, the authors found large transcriptomic changes between no-pathology and AD-pathology samples, with the majority of these changes occurring during early-stages of the disease, as seen by the dramatic differences between early-pathology (characterized by amyloid burden, but modest tangle pathology and cognitive impairment) and no-pathology samples. Further sub-clustering of each cell type revealed that specific cell states were more enriched in samples with AD-pathology compared to those without pathology. Interestingly, these pathology-associated subpopulations were highly-enriched in female samples, whereas no-pathology-associated subpopulations were enriched in male samples. For example, out of the 1920 microglia sequenced, the authors were able to identify a microglial subpopulation (M1) enriched in high-pathology and female samples. Marker genes for this microglial subpopulation were enriched in pathways related to T-cell activation and antigen presentation, and slightly overlapped with disease-associated microglial signatures previously identified in an amyloid mouse model (41). To increase the resolution of sex-specific microglial responses to AD-pathology (versus natural heterogeneity), more samples and more human microglia will need to be sequenced.

Parkinson’s Disease:

Sex difference in clinical phenotypes in PD

Parkinson’s Disease exhibits an average age of onset at 61.6 years (78) and is marked by abnormal alpha synuclein pathology called Lewy bodies (79), extensive dopaminergic neuronal death in the substantia nigra (80), motor symptoms such as resting tremors, and non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment. PD affects nearly twice as many males compared to females and the male-to-female incidence ratio ranges from 1.37~3.7:1 (81). Male patients generally experience symptoms two years earlier than females and show greater motor deficits and loss of verbal fluency (82, 83). Although few studies have investigated the relationship between sex and PD Lewy body pathology, one Neurology supplement reported higher Lewy-body presence in female patients within the frontal temporal lobe, amygdala, and locus coeruleus (84).

Sex hormones can have a profound modulatory effect on PD symptoms and risk. Studies have found that in women, age of symptom onset correlated positively with age of menopause (85, 86), with every 5-year delay in menopause linked to an 11% reduction in PD risk, and reduced PD risk for post-menopausal women on hormone therapy (87). The delay in developing symptomatic PD in women may be associated with higher levels of striatal dopamine as shown by [123I]FP-CIT SPECT tracer binding to the dopamine transporter, possibly due to estrogen activity (82).

Roles for the neuroimmune system and sex in PD genetic risk and pathology

Microglia and the neuroimmune system are closely associated with PD pathology. Activated microglia coincide with alpha-synuclein pathology in human PD brains, and alpha-synuclein can stimulate cytokine production via microglial TLR-2 signaling (88). Notably, heightened presence of ameboid, CD68+ microglia occurs before alpha-synuclein pathology accumulation (89) predominantly in the midbrain and substantia nigra (90), indicating that microglial activation precedes systemic alpha-synuclein pathology. Positron emission topography (PET) imaging of TSPO, a translocator protein upregulated by activated microglia and reactive astroglia, serves as a measure of inflammatory processes and shows increased TSPO volume in PD patients reversed by anti-inflammatory agents (91).

Whether sex differences exist in immune responses to PD pathology remains largely unexplored. However, several studies have identified sex differences in immune-related genetic risk factors. For instance, the PD risk gene, SNCA, is highly expressed by microglia and more prevalent in male than female PD patients (92, 93), with male patients exhibiting higher expression of SNCA variants in substantia nigral dopamine neurons compared to female patients (94). Moreover, the rs2622624 variant in the ABCG2 gene which decreases urate export, is also expressed in microglia, and has been shown to delay age of onset by over a year (95). Yet studies have shown that high serum uric acid levels are associated with less cognitive decline only in male patients, suggesting a potential sex-specific, neuroprotective effect of uric acid (96). These studies suggest that risk genes/pathways enriched in microglia and other immune cells may mediate sex-specific PD outcomes.

The microbiome as a peripheral source of neuroimmune sex differences in PD

Recent studies have elucidated connections between the microbiome and the brain in PD (97), including changes in the diversity and abundances of bacterial phyla specific to PD patients. Notably, PD demonstrates sex-dependent microbiome changes, with female patients showing decreased microbial diversity while male patients show increased diversity compared to control patients (98). Interestingly, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which are male-biased, can also increase the risk of developing PD by 43% (99). IBD patients exposed to anti-TNF therapy had a 78% reduction in PD incidence rates compared to untreated patients (100), supporting potential crosstalk between the immune system, microbiome, and brain in PD risk.

Rodent studies indicate that immune signaling via microglia may mediate the gut-brain axis; in one study, decreased microbiota diversity led to changes in the microglial transcriptome, maturity, and proliferation rate (101). Furthermore, male and female microglia respond differently to microbiome changes. In male offspring of germ-free mice, the microglial transcriptome is profoundly altered, whereas microglia from the female offspring do not show such alterations until adulthood (102). This sex-specific link between microglia and the microbiome needs to be further explored in the context of humans and may shed light on some aspects of PD sex differences.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis:

Sex differences in clinical phenotypes in ALS

Compared to other diseases in this review such as AD and PD, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) displays a much more rapid progression, as ∼50% of ALS patients experience mortality within three years of diagnosis. Clinical symptoms of ALS are primarily motor-based and categorized as limb-onset, which involves limb spasticity and weakness, and bulbar-onset, which involves tongue wasting and speech/swallowing difficulties (103). Interestingly, female ALS patients exhibit more pathology in the bulbar region whereas male patients demonstrate more pathology in the spinal region (104).

ALS is about 1.5 times more common in men than in women, with the male-to-female incidence ratio approximately 1.3:1, and men develop the disease ∼5 years earlier than women in the United States (104). Genetic determinants of ALS are more prevalent in women than men, suggesting men may be more prone to the sporadic form (105). For instance, meta-analyses have shown that mutations in C9orf72, a gene involved in autophagy and the most common genetic risk factor of ALS, are more prevalent in females with ALS, though the repeat expansion shortens survival time only in male carriers (106). Another study also identified significantly higher expression of several ALS risk genes such as C3orf72 (responsible for 30-40% of familial ALS cases) in the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, frontal cortex, and hippocampus of male patients than female patients (107). Thus, men may be more susceptible to ALS, a bias that is partially explained by higher expression of and vulnerability to causative genes, and higher caseload of sporadic ALS compared to women.

Sex differences in the immune response to ALS pathology

ALS pathology is largely defined by ubiquitin deposits containing TDP-43 in motor neurons, but neuroinflammation is also a key feature and likely play an important role in driving the disease progression. Activated microglia correlate with upper motor neuron degeneration in human ALS brains (108). Cooper-Knock et al. isolated motor neurons and surrounding glia from ALS patients and identified an enrichment of genes involved in immune response to degenerating motor neurons, with many of these genes highly expressed by microglia, such as C1QA, CSFR1, and TREM2 (109).

The interferon pathway has also emerged as a key player in ALS-associated innate immune responses. Increased Type I interferons are observed in brain tissue from ALS patients (110). Mice lacking C9orf72 (mimicking the loss-of-function ALS mutation) in myeloid cells, including microglia, recapitulated the autoinflammation seen in mouse models with a global knockout of C9orf72 (110). This effect was found to be mediated by abnormal activation of the STING pathway (110). Interestingly, female immune cells, especially macrophages and innate immune cells, have higher expression of inflammatory genes at baseline and after interferon stimulation (14). Whether this sex-bias is also observed in microglia isolated from brains of C9orf72 mutation carriers remains to be explored. Type I interferons can also activate STAT3, which in turn can engage in negative feedback loops that dampen the Type I interferon response. Human ALS brains demonstrate activated microglia (111) and spinal cord microglia expressing STAT3, which also stimulates additional downstream cytokines that facilitate neuroinflammation (112). Notably, STAT3 activity is increased in female immune transcriptomes and may coincide with the increased inflammatory response to interferon stimulation (14). Such findings raise the possibility that sex-specific microglial regulation of the Type I interferon response could manifest as downstream sex differences in STAT3 signaling and neuroinflammation, ultimately contributing to sex differences in ALS risk and progression. Further studies will be needed to explore these connections in ALS.

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

Microglia and neuroinflammation play a fundamental role in various neurodegenerative diseases. Whether inflammation is inherently “good” or “bad” for a disease has been long-discussed by the field, but is likely too binary as shown by the diseases and sex differences highlighted in this review. For instance, the immune system in females seems more robust and responsive to immune stimuli, such as having a stronger interferon response, compared to in males (14, 113). This could translate to short-term benefits in acute infection, when a strong immune response is necessary for rapid clearance of the pathogen. Meanwhile, in chronic diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases with gradual pathology accumulation, sustained activation of the immune system may be detrimental and mechanistically distinct from acutely activated pathways, and the immune system in males may exhibit greater susceptibility and vulnerability to such chronic immune activation. Using this lens, we can examine the four neurodegenerative diseases highlighted in this review (Figure 1).

In MS, which is a heterogeneous disease involving varied microenvironments of immune activation within the CNS, we can think of the female-biased RRMS as an “acute” response of the immune system (Figure 1). This bias may be due to the propensity of the female immune system to respond robustly to acute immune stimuli. Meanwhile, for the more gradual, progressive disease courses in MS, males seem to be more susceptible, possibly driven by a male-specific vulnerability to chronic immune activation (Figure 1). Consistent with this, both PD and ALS, which are chronic neurodegenerative diseases, are heavily skewed towards males. In contrast, AD has a female-bias in terms of increased risk, pathological burden, and cognitive decline, even though there are aspects in which males fare worse, specifically mortality. One possible explanation underlying the elevated female susceptibility could be that certain detrimental inflammatory responses are associated with female-biased AD risk alleles, such as APOE4. Thus, sex differences in response to chronic immune challenge remain disease-specific, depending on the pathogens and genetic risk alleles.

The mechanisms underlying the sex biases for these four neurodegenerative diseases are not well-established, but the contribution of sex to molecular pathways underlying these diverse clinical phenotypes will be important for discovering effective treatments. To facilitate such explorations, we have outlined several recommendations for future studies. Sex-stratified GWAS have yielded interesting findings in AD, as described above, and in other diseases such as schizophrenia, and ALS (71, 105, 114). Unfortunately, many published GWAS excluded the X chromosomes. This exclusion is largely due to an inability to differentiate genes belonging to the silenced X chromosome versus the unsilenced chromosome in XX individuals (115). Some of these issues can be bypassed via XWAS, a software that statistically differentiates X-linked gene expression by comparing variance in a trait between heterozygous and homozygous females (116). Gao et al. tested XWAS on 16 GWAS datasets and found the X-linked CENP1 gene was significantly associated with ALS as well as found other X-linked genes associated in vitiligo, Crohn’s Disease, and Celiac Disease (116). Thus, including sex chromosomes in future GWAS analyses would expand our understanding of genetic risk factors in neurodegenerative diseases.

It is also important to note that some of the variability by sex reported in the literature may be due to small sample sizes, low statistical power, and other factors that occur when experiments are not designed to directly investigate sex differences. Studies need to include sample sizes that are sufficient when split by sex for adequate statistical power and sex-based analysis. This is particularly true in human studies, where individual heterogeneity can mask sex differences. Studies that do not report sex differences should include sex-stratified data or sex-specific findings in supplementary sections of the manuscript. Moreover, human clinical trials should consistently document sex hormone-based factors such menopause history and hormonal medication to aid in understanding the effects of menopause and exogenous hormones in neurodegenerative diseases. This is especially important as rodent models do not faithfully reflect the hormonal fluctuations seen in human menopause and therefore increases reliance on human clinical datasets. Such efforts will lead to better understanding of these complex factors and their interactions with sex in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.
