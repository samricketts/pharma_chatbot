Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease. Prior studies suggested impaired mitochondrial biogenesis likely contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. Bezafibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pan-agonist, has been shown to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and increase oxidative phosphorylation capacity. In the present study, we investigated whether bezafibrate could rescue mitochondrial dysfunction and other AD-related deficits in 5xFAD mice. Bezafibrate was well tolerated by 5xFAD mice. Indeed, it rescued the expression of key mitochondrial proteins as well as mitochondrial dynamics and function in the brain of 5xFAD mice. Importantly, bezafibrate treatment led to significant improvement of cognitive/memory function in 5xFAD mice accompanied by alleviation of amyloid pathology and neuronal loss as well as reduced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Overall, this study suggests that bezafibrate improves mitochondrial function, mitigates neuroinflammation and improves cognitive functions in 5xFAD mice, thus supporting the notion that enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis/function is a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.


pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease pathologically characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and extensive loss of neurons in selective regions of the brain [1, 2]. There is no effective treatment of this devastating disease largely due to the incomplete understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms [3]. A large body of evidence suggested a critical role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of AD [4, 5], and it is likely impaired mitochondrial biogenesis is involved [6] as several groups demonstrated decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 α (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, in the brain of AD patients as well as in animal models and cell models of AD [7–9]. Consistently, mtDNA copy numbers were significantly reduced and levels of critical components of the electron transport chain were also reduced in the brain tissues of AD patients and mouse models [10]. Mitochondria abnormalities are considered to occur early in the development of AD, therefore, enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and function has been regarded as a promising therapeutic strategy for AD [6].

Bezafibrate, one of the FDA-approved lipid-lowering agents to treat hyperlipidemia [11], is an agonist of pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), a subfamily of nuclear receptors [12, 13]. Upon activation by their ligands, PPARs act as transcription factors and regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and energy metabolism in multiple organs including central nervous system [14, 15]. Among these pathways, bezafibrate was shown to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and increase oxidative phosphorylation capacity through the PPAR-PGC-1α axis [16]. Indeed, several studies have shown that bezafibrate treatment can improve mitochondrial function in both cells and animal models of human mitochondrial disorders [17–19]. Furthermore, several groups have tested bezafibrate in mouse models for neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington’s disease [20], Parkinson’s disease [21], tauopathies [22], and depression [23], and these studies suggest bezafibrate treatment have neuroprotective effects likely through a mitochondrial biogenesis-dependent mechanism. In this study, we seek to determine whether bezafibrate treatment confers neuroprotection in 5xFAD mice, a widely-used APP transgenic mouse model of AD.

Results

Bezafibrate was well tolerated in 5xFAD mice

Mice were fed either the control or bezafibrate-containing diet starting at 3 months of age until 6 months of age. No adverse activity was noted in any mice. Body and brain weights were measured at time of sacrifice. The control mice on bezafibrate diet (CB group) showed a significant decrease in body weight compared with the control mice on normal diet (CN group) (CN vs. CB: 31.42±1.82g vs. 26.17±0.88g; p&lt;0.05, Supplementary Fig. 1A), but the 5XFAD mice on normal diet (AN) showed no significant difference from the 5XFAD mice on bezafibrate diet (AB) (AN vs. AB: 27.62±1.81 g vs. 25.69±0.91 g; Supplementary Fig. 1A). Brain weights were similar among all groups (CN vs. CB vs. AN vs. AB: 0.443±0.004 vs. 0.434±0.006 vs. 0.438±0.004 vs. 0.446±0.005 g; Supplementary Fig. 1B).

Bezafibrate prevents mitochondrial deficits and reduces oxidative stress in 5xFAD mice

To determine whether bezafibrate rescued mitochondrial deficits in 5xFAD mice, we first analyzed protein expression of key mitochondrial proteins. Western blot analysis demonstrated significantly reduced protein expression of SDHB, a key subunit of Complex II, in the brain of AN mice as compared to that of CN mice, which was almost completely rescued by bezafibrate treatment in AB mice (Fig. 1A, B). Mitochondrial function was determined by nitrotetrazolium blue exclusion assay (NBTx), an enzyme histochemical assay that quantitatively measured mitochondrial COX activity using fresh frozen sections. Cells with COX-competent mitochondria remain colorless while cells with COX-deficient mitochondria displayed blue staining as shown in positive control sections treated with NaN3, a COX-inhibitor. NBTx assay revealed significantly increased blue staining in AN mice compared with CN mice, suggestive of reduced COX activity in the 5xFAD mice, which was reversed by bezafibrate treatment in AB mice (Fig. 1 C, D)

Mitochondrial fragmentation and ultrastructural damage have been associated with AD. Electron microscopic analysis of pyramidal neurons revealed filamentous mitochondria with clearly discernable cristae in WT mice (Fig. 1E, left panel). In contrast, mitochondria appeared shorter and round consistent with a fragmentation phenotype, and often had disrupted or loss of cristae suggestive of damaged mitochondria in 5xFAD mice (Fig. 1E, middle panel). Bezafibrate treatment restored the filamentous shape of mitochondria and most mitochondria displayed intact cristae in the treated 5xFAD mice (Fig. 1E, right panel). Quantitative analysis confirmed a significantly reduced mitochondrial aspect ratio, mean increased mitochondrial size and increased mitochondrial damage in 5xFAD mice, all of which were rescued by bezafibrate treatment (Fig. 1F–H).

Bezafibrate improves memory performance in 5xFAD mice

To determine the effect of bezafibrate on AD-related cognitive deficits, we subjected both control or 5xFAD mice fed either a normal diet or bezafibrate diet to a battery of behavioral tests (Fig. 2A). We first carried out open field test to evaluate the effect of bezafibrate treatment on locomotor behavior and found that bezafibrate-treated control (CB) and 5XFAD (AB) mice showed a trend towards increased distance and mean speed, but not max speed, compared with the non-treated CN and AN groups respectively, although neither reached significance (Supplementary Fig. 2A–C), suggesting that bezafibrate administration did not change locomotor behavior in either WT or 5xFAD mice. Next, these mice were tested for memory function by novel object recognition test (NOR), object location test (OLT) and Barnes maze test at the ages shown in Fig. 1A. In the NOR test, there was no significant difference in the total exploration time among all groups (Fig. 2B). The NOR discrimination index was not different in WT mice fed with either control (CN) or bezafibrate diet (CB). As expected, AN mice demonstrated impaired preference for the novel object as evidenced by significantly reduced NOR discrimination index compared to CN mice. Interestingly, this decreased NOR discrimination index for the novel object observed in 5xFAD mice (i.e., AN mice) was significantly reversed after bezafibrate treatment (i.e., in AB mice) (Fig. 2C). Similarly, in OLT test, while bezafibrate treatment did not impact OLT discrimination index in control mice, it also reversed the significantly impaired preference for novel location over familiar location in 5xFAD mice (i.e., AB mice vs. AN mice) (Fig. 2E). In the Barnes maze test, during the training session, we measured the latency for mice to enter escape box to assess its learning performance from day 1 to day 4. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA analysis revealed that the latency for CN was significantly decreased from day 2 of the training session compared to that of AN mice. AB mice showed significant decrease of its latency on day 4 when compared to that of AN mice (Supplementary Fig. 3). During the probe trial session, compared with CN mice, AN mice took significantly longer time to find the target hole (Fig. 2F) and spent significantly less time in the target quadrant (Fig. 2G), all of which were significantly reversed in AB mice after bezafibrate treatment (Fig.1F, G). Collectively, these behavioral tests suggest that bezafibrate administration improved memory performance in 5xFAD mice.

Bezafibrate alleviates the amyloid pathology in 5xFAD mice

In the brain of 5xFAD mice, amyloid plaques begin to form at 2 months of age and become abundant at 5–6 months of age. To assess the effects of bezafibrate on amyloid deposition, immunohistochemical study using the 82E1 antibody against the Aβ residue 1–16 was performed. Abundant amyloid plaques were present in the cortex and hippocampus of AN mice which appeared to be reduced after bezafibrate treatment in AB mic (Fig. 3A). Quantification of area occupied by the amyloid plaques as an index for amyloid plaque load confirmed a significant reduction in amyloid deposition (p &lt; 0.05; Fig. 3B) in AB mice. It is believed that oligomeric Aβ plays an important pathogenic role in AD. We further measured the effect of bezafibrate on the accumulation of oligomeric Aβ by utilizing the NU4 antibody that specifically detects Aβ oligomers (Fig. 3C). We found that bezafibrate treatment also led to significantly reduced Aβ oligomer deposition in the cortex and hippocampus of the 5xFAD mice (p &lt; 0.05; Fig. 3D). We further performed ELISA assays and found that bezafibrate treatment reduced TBS soluble Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels in 5xFAD mice (Fig. 3E, F). These results suggest that bezafibrate administration reduced the amyloid pathology in 5xFAD brain.

Bezafibrate reduces neuronal loss in 5xFAD mice

Extensive neuronal loss occurs in AD brain and 5xFAD mice demonstrated selective neuronal loss in brain regions cortical layer V as early as 6 months old. We confirmed a significant neuronal loss of around 20% in the cortex layer V, but not in other cortical layers, in AN mice as compared to CN mice (Fig. 4A, B). Importantly, bezafibrate treatment prevented neuronal loss in layer V in 5xFAD mice and restored the neuronal number to a level comparable to that of CN (Fig. 4A, B).

Bezafibrate reduces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in 5xFAD mice

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major source of oxidative stress and the lipid peroxidation adduct 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) is a biomarker of oxidative stress. We found that 4-HNE adducts are greatly increased in 5xFAD AN group and are significantly reduced by bezafibrate treatment (AB group), suggesting that bezafibrate can reduce elevated oxidative stress in 5xFAD brain (Fig. 5A, B). In addition, heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), as a response to oxidative stress, was previously reported to increase in the brain of AD patients and 5xFAD mice [24]. Indeed, we found increased HO-1 in 5xFAD AN mice, which was significantly reversed by bezafibrate administration in the AB group (Fig. 5C, D). These data suggest that bezafibrate can alleviate oxidative stress in the 5xFAD brain.

Neuroinflammation is another key feature of AD. GFAP levels were greatly increased in 5xFAD mice, and bezafibrate treatment reduced GFAP protein levels in 5xFAD brain (Fig. 6A, B). In addition, microglia cells were greatly overactivated, indicated by enlarged soma size, in 5xFAD brain and this overactivated phenotype was significantly reversed by bezafibrate administration (Fig. 6C, D). We further measured neuroinflammation related cytokine molecules levels by real-time PCR. Both TNFα and IL6 gene expression levels greatly increased in 5xFAD mice, and bezafibrate treatment reduced both TNFα and IL6 expression (Fig. 6E, F). Overall, our results suggest that bezafibrate reduces neuroinflammation in 5xFAD mice.

Discussion

As a widely used AD mouse model, 5xFAD mice develop amyloid deposition in the subiculum and cortex around 2 months of age, and display age-dependent memory deficits, starting as early as 4–5 months old [25]. 5xFAD mice also recapitulate other AD-related deficits, such as mitochondrial deficit, neuronal loss and neuroinflammation in the brain [25]. In the current study, we investigated whether the treatment of bezafibrate protects 5xFAD mice against AD-related cognitive and pathological deficits via restoration of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Indeed, 3 months of bezafibrate treatment starting from 3 months of age led to the rescue of mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, and function in the brain of 5xFAD mice accompanied by alleviation of amyloid pathology and neuronal loss as well as reduced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Most importantly, bezafibrate treatment led to significant improvement of cognitive/memory function in 5xFAD mice.

Dietary bezafibrate administration had been tested in various mouse models of mitochondrial dysfunction and showed considerable variability in the outcome ranging from significant beneficial effects to severe adversities such as lethality, which appears to suggest that the outcome of bezafibrate treatment is dependent on the particular mouse model and the severity of disease in the model [26]. Therefore, even though prior studies demonstrated that bezafibrate exerts neuroprotective effects in animal models of various neurological diseases including the R6/2 and BACHD mouse model of Huntington disease [20] and the P301S tauopathy mouse model [22], it is of significance to determine whether bezafibrate is neuroprotective in other neurological disease models. This study provided strong evidence that bezafibrate is neuroprotective in 5xFAD mouse model of AD in terms of both cognitive/memory function and amyloid-pathology and neuronal loss. While WT mice treated with bezafibrate showed a slight but significant body weight loss which is consistent with other studies [22], 5xFAD mice tolerated bezafibrate treatment well as no changes in body weight was observed. Bezafibrate administration was started at 3 months of age, a timepoint after amyloid plaque begins to deposit but before behavior deficits and neurodegeneration occur in this model. Such an early intervention successfully reduced amyloid pathology and neuronal loss in 5xFAD mice, which is likely due to prevention effects. Though bezafibrate-treated wild type or 5xFAD mice showed a trend of increase in travel distances compared with untreated mice, there is no significant difference at this age. Consistent with prior studies, our 5xFAD mice showed memory deficits in a battery of behavioral tests including NOR OLT and Barnes tests. Strikingly, the memory deficits in 5xFAD mice were significantly improved by the administration of bezafibrate. As no further improvement was seen in wild type mice treated by bezafibrate compared to untreated mice, our cognitive/memory function results again suggest that early intervention with bezafibrate prevents cognitive/memory loss in 5xFAD mice. Because bezafibrate treatment reduced tau pathology and related motor deficits in a tauopathy model [22], our studies thus added new evidence demonstrating that bezafibrate exerts beneficial effects on two hallmark pathologies of AD which makes it an attractive drug candidate for AD. In this regard, it is worthy of noting that a recent study reported that bezafibrate can improve recognition memory deficits in a rat model of sporadic AD [27]. However, it should be pointed out that the 5xFAD mice used in the current study were relatively young. Ageing related changes such as weight loss in old adults and decreased body function will affect the bioavailability of a drug, and the incidence of pharmacogenetically related drug toxicity might be expected to increase with age, therefore, whether bezafibrate treatment can be well tolerated in older adults and have similar beneficial effect should be further determined. It also remains to be determined whether late intervention with bezafibrate reverses the disease progression.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD [6]. Previous studies suggest that bezafibrate as a pan-PPAR agonist is an inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis and a potent regulator of mitochondrial function [26]. In support of this notion, in the current study, bezafibrate treatment led to increased expression of SDHB, a critical OXPHOS component, in 5xFAD mice, accompanied by improved mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress, suggestive of beneficial outcome of rescued mitochondrial biogenesis. It is known that oxidative stress enhances β-cleavage of APP through activation of BACE1 and presenilin [28]. The rescue of oxidative stress likely contributes to reduced Aβ levels and plaque deposition in bezafibrate-treated 5xFAD mice. Mitochondrial fragmentation and ultrastructural damage have been well documented in the brain of AD models and AD patients [29–32]. It is of significance to note we found bezafibrate also rescued mitochondrial fragmentation and ultrastructural damage in 5xFAD mice. It is not clear whether rescuing effects on mitochondrial dynamics and structure are secondary to mitochondrial biogenesis as the relationship between mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics are not fully elucidated. In fact, prior studies demonstrated that PGC1α stimulates the expression of Mfn2 protein, a critical mitochondrial fusion protein, and thus could be directly involved in the regulation of mitochondrial network dynamics [33, 34]. By the same token, PGC1α impacts mitophagy pathway through either PINK1/Parkin or NIX1 [35] which could lead to improved mitochondrial homeostasis through enhanced removal of damaged mitochondria. Therefore, it is likely that bezafibrate rescued mitochondrial function through multiple pathways downstream of PGC1α in addition to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis.

Recent studies demonstrated important roles of neuroinflammation in AD [36]. Amyloid deposition and cell demise in AD caused a chronic type of cerebral inflammation [37] which further fueled APP processing and Aβ production and created a downward spiral during the course of disease [38]. Indeed, our 5xFAD mice showed much higher GFAP protein levels and over-activated microglia indicated by enlarged soma size compared to wild type mice as well as elevated levels of proinflammatory molecules such as TNF1alpha and IL6. Bezafibrate treatment reduced GFAP levels, alleviated microglia activation and rescued proinflammatory cytokines in 5xFAD brain. This is consistent with prior studies demonstrating a strong anti-inflammatory effect of bezafibrate [39]. The blockade of this downward spiral likely contributed to the reduced amyloid pathology in bezafibrate-treated 5xFAD mice. Bezafibrate may also act upon astrocytes through activation of PPAR to enhance Aβ uptake and degradation and reduce amyloid pathology [40]. In the brain of AD patients, early neuronal loss occurred in all layers of the entorhinal cortex and followed by neuron loss in the hippocampus and other brain areas [41, 42]. Earlier studies showed that 5xFAD mice have age-related neuronal loss in the layer V and the subiculum region [25, 43]. While neuronal loss in 5XFAD mice is not a phenocopy of AD patient brain, it still provides an opportunity to study neuronal loss in vivo and we found that bezafibrate almost completely prevented neuronal loss in cortical layer V in 5xFAD mice. As mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are detrimental to neuronal survival, it is likely bezafibrate rescued neuronal loss by rescuing these deficits.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that bezafibrate protects against amyloid pathology, neuronal loss, and cognitive/memory deficits in 5xFAD mouse model. This is associated with improved mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and function and alleviation of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Our study showing beneficial effects on amyloid pathology and cognitive deficits in AD model, together with prior studies from other group demonstrating beneficial effects of bezafibrate against tau pathology in P301S mice, provides compelling evidence that bezafibrate may be an effective therapeutic agent for AD treatment.

Materials and methods

Animals

The 5xFAD transgenic mouse model (MMRRC stock #34848) was purchased from Jackson Laboratory. The mice express human APP and PS1 mutant proteins associated with familial AD. To generate our experimental 5xFAD and non-transgenic littermates, male hemizygous 5xFAD were mated to B6SJLF1/J female mice (Jackson lab stock # 100012). Mice were housed in an environmentally controlled room with a 12-h light cycle in sterilized ventilated microisolator cages with ad lib access to food and water. Animal studies were done under an approved IACUC protocol through Case Western Reserve University.

Bezafibrate treatment

At weaning, mice were genotyped from ear punch and assigned to one of four groups: 5xFAD on normal diet (AN), 5xFAD on bezafibrate diet (AB), non-Tg control mice on normal diet (CN) and non-Tg control mice on bezafibrate diet (CB). NIH-31 control diet (normal diet) and NIH-31 containing 0.5% Bezafibrate from Envigo (bezafibrate diet) were stored in sealed containers at 4°C before administered to mice. Mice were maintained on normal diet until 3 months old and then switched to the 0.5% bezafibrate diet (~800 mg/kg/day) diet for 3 months [22]. Laboratory personnel were responsible for providing the diet to the experimental cohort of mice. At 6 months of age, mice were euthanized, and brains were removed for biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering, discomfort, and stress.

Behavioral tests

A battery of tests was performed to evaluate behavioral performance of the mice starting from 4 months old. The order of the testing was first open field test (OF), followed by novel object recognition (NOR), object location test (OLT) and then Barnes maze test.

Open field test (OF)

The OF test was carried out as described elsewhere to evaluate the locomotion activity of mice [44]. The apparatus consisted of a square box (a light opaque chamber, 50cm×50cm). Mice were placed individually into the center of the box and their behavior over the 10-min test period was recorded by a video camera mounted above the apparatus. The apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol followed by wet and dry paper towels after each test.

Novel object recognition (NOR)

To assess memory performance a novel object recognition task was used [44]. Two identical objects were placed into the arena used in the OF test for a 10 min phase. Twenty-four hours later, one of the objects was exchanged for a new object and the mice were allowed to explore for a 5 min test phase. The time spent with each object was recorded and the memory was assessed by the discrimination index (the time spent exploring the novel object / total time spent exploring both objects*100). The apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol followed by wet and dry paper towels after each test.

Object location test (OLT)

OLT was also carried out to assess memory performance in mice [44]. Two identical objects were placed into the arena used in both OF and NOR tests with a plus sign on one wall during a 10min phase. Twenty-four hours later, one of the objects was changed to a new location and memory was assessed by discrimination index (the time spent exploring the moved object /total time spent exploring both objects*100) during a 5-min test phase). The apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol followed by wet and dry paper towels after each test.

Barnes maze test

Mice were tested on a Barnes maze to assess spatial memory performance [45]. The maze consists of a circular arena with circular holes located at equal distances around the perimeter near the edge of the maze. The maze was divided into four quadrants clockwise, target, positive, opposite, and negative. Mice were trained to locate an escape box beneath one of the holes in response to aversive light stimuli and remember its location using surrounding visual cues. The latencies to enter the escape box and times spent in different quadrants were recorded by a video camera mounted directly over the center of the maze. The video tracking system ANYMAZE was used to analyze the parameters mentioned above. Barnes test consists of habituation, 4 training days and final trial. For habituation and subsequent training trials, the mouse was placed in the center of the maze under a bucket in a room that was brightly lit and rich in consistently located spatial cues. After 1 min, the bucket was lifted, and the mouse was allowed to explore the maze. If during the subsequent 3min it failed to find the escape tunnel, it was guided there. After entering the escape tunnel, the animal was allowed to remain in the tunnel for 1 min. For final trial, after the escape box was removed, the mouse was placed in the center under the bucket and after 1 min, the bucket was lifted and allowed to explore the arena for 2 min. The latency to find escape hole and time spent in different quadrants was calculated to assess the memory performance in mice.

Western blots

Brain cortical tissues were homogenized by glass homogenizer on ice in RIPA buffer (Abcam) with protease inhibitors (Roche). Tissue homogenates were centrifuged (18000g) at 4°C for 10 min and supernatants were aliquoted and stored at minus 80°C for western blot analysis. A total of 30μg protein samples were subject to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane at constant 100 volts for 2h. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBST and probed with primary antibody in TBST with 1% milk at 4°C overnight. After three washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibody, and washed again. The blots were developed with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) and imaged by Amersham Imager 600 (GE healthcare). Primary antibodies: anti-SDHB (Abcam, ab110413), anti-GAPDH (Cell signaling, # 2118), anti-HNE (Alpha Diagnostic, HNE11-S), anti-HO-1 (Enzo, ADI-OSA-110-D), and GFAP (Invitrogen, PA5–16291).

ELISA for measurement of amyloid-beta levels

Brain tissues were homogenized by glass homogenizer on ice and extracted with TBS buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl). The levels of Aβ40 or Aβ42 soluble in TBS-extracted from cortex were measured using an ELISA assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, standards or diluted samples were dispensed into pre-coated wells with Aβ40 or Aβ42 primary antibody for 3 h at room temperature. After three washes using washing buffer, anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase was added for 30 min, then washed again and incubated with stabilized chromogen for additional 30 min in darkness. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a BioTek microplate reader.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry was performed according to the peroxidase anti-peroxidase protocol [46]. Briefly, formalin fixed paraffin embedded brain samples were sectioned at 6μm thickness. The sections were incubated sequentially in Xylene I, Xylene II, 100% ethanol, 90% ethanol, 75%, and 50% ethanol and PBS for 5min in each solution. Deparaffinized and re-hydrated tissue sections were then subject to antigen retrieval in 1x rodent antigen decloaker (Biocare), then blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) in TBS for 30 min, washed with TBS with 1% NGS, and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. After washing three times with 1% NGS, the sections were incubated with secondary antibody goat-anti-rabbit or goat-anti-mouse for 30 min, washed again with 1% NGS, incubated with rabbit or mouse PAP complex for 1hr, washed first with 1% NGS and then with Tris buffer three times, 5 min each time. The sections were then developed using a DAB kit (Enzo) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, then dehydrated in 70%-95%-100%-Xylene II sequentially for 10min each solution, and coverslipped using Permount. Primary antibody for detection of amyloid deposition was anti-amyloid antibodies 82E1 (IBL) and NU4 [47]. Quantification of amyloid burden levels were performed using Image J as described [46]. The amyloid burden was calculated by averaging the percent staining across all sections. To exclude the gender effect on the amyloid deposition, we first normalized values based on the gender and further calculated relative 82E1 or NU4 positive amyloid burden levels. For immunofluorescence, Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1/300 dilution (Life Technologies) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in darkness, then washed three times with PBS, and then mounted with mounting medium. Confocal images were collected by Leica TSC S8 platform with an inverted DMI 6000 adaptive focus microscope.

NBTx assay

NBTx assay was performed as previously described to assess the COX activity in mouse brain [48]. Briefly, brain tissues were frozen slowly on dry ice. Frozen sections were cut at 10 μm thick using a cryostat, mounted on super frost Plus microscope slides (Thermo Scientific), and air-dried for 5–10 min. Slides were stored at minus 80°C and enzyme activity assays were completed. Slides were taken out of the minus 80°C freezer and thawed briefly at room temperature. Sections (three sections per slide) were covered with PBS for 10 min at room temperature. PBS was discarded and replaced with NBTx solution (2mM NBT, 0.2mM PMS, 130mM sodium succinate in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.0). Then the sections were further incubated for 10min at room temperature. Then sections were washed briefly in purified water and dehydrated in an ethanol series (2 min in 50%, 75%, 96% and 100%, followed by an extra 5 min in 100% ethanol. Finally, slides were immersed for 5 min in two changes of xylene before being mounted on coverslips with Cytoseal (Thermo Scientific). As a positive control for the enzyme activity, to inhibit the respiratory chain, sodium azide was added to PBS for the preincubation time as well as to the NBTx solution (1mM). Reagents NBT, PMS, sodium succinate, and sodium azide were purchased from Sigma.

Electron microscopy

Mice were perfused with saline and one half brain was immediately placed into EM fixative (triple aldehyde-DMSO mixture) and tissue blocks containing cortical region layer V were post-fixed in 1% osmium-1.5% ferrocyanide mixture as we previously published [46]. Then specimens were dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol and embedded in EMbed 812 embedding resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Toluidine blue thick sections were analyzed to mark the cortical layer V neurons for imaging. Thin sections were sequentially stained with 2% acidified uranyl acetate followed by Sato’s triple lead staining and examined in FEI tecnai T12 electron microscope equipped with a Gatan single tilt holder and a CCD camera (Gatan). At least five neurons showing the neuronal soma with long post-hillock process regions were imaged from each mouse. Age and genotype were blinded to the microscopist. Using Image J software, every neuronal mitochondrion was measured for length, width, and area. Mitochondria were also classified as intact or damaged (i.e., with either outer membrane disruption or inner cristae damage).

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis

Total RNAs were extracted from brain tissues with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and used as templates to generate cDNA with TaqMan reverse transcription reagent (Applied Biosystems). The first-strand cDNAs were used as templates for qRT-PCR in a final volume of 20 μL with 1X SYBR green master mix (Bio-Rad). Individual values of target genes were normalized to the value of reference gene. The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Relative expression of RNAs was calculated with ΔCt – ΔCt method.

Neuron quantification

Neuron counts in the cortices were performed using Image J software. Briefly, digitized images were transformed into tiff files and thresholded using image J. Care was taken to maintain the same threshold in all sections from the same experiment. Counts of NeuN positive cells in the cortices were automatically performed using Image J, and cell numbers were calculated per mm2. Mouse age and gender were matched for each group.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was done with Student’s t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-way repeated ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Data are means ±S.E.M. p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. n.s. indicates not statistically significant. Graphpad prism was used for data analysis and graphing.
