Introduction

This study examined false positive rates on embedded performance validity tests (PVTs) in older adults grouped by cognitive status.

Method

The research design involved secondary analysis of data from the National Alzheimerâ€™s Coordinating Center database. Participants (N = 22,688) were grouped by cognitive status: normal (n = 10,319), impaired (n = 1,194), amnestic or non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 5,414), and dementia (n = 5,761). Neuropsychological data were used to derive 5 PVTs.

Results

False positive rates on individual PVTs ranged from 3.3 to 26.3% with several embedded PVTs showing acceptable specificity across groups. The proportion of participants failing two or more PVTs varied by cognitive status: normal (1.9%), impaired (6.6%), MCI (13.2%), and dementia (52.8%). Comparison of observed and predicted false positive rates at different specificity levels (.85 or .90) demonstrated significant differences in all comparisons. In normal and impaired groups, predicted rates were higher than observed rates. In the MCI group, predicted and observed comparisons varied: predicted rates were higher with specificity at .85 and lower with specificity at .90. In the dementia group, predicted rates underestimated observed rates.

Conclusions

Despite elevated false positives in conditions involving severe cognitive compromise, several measures retain acceptable specificity regardless of cognitive status. Predicted false positive rates based on the number of PVTs administered were not observed empirically. These findings do not support the utility of simulated data in predicting false positive rates in older adults.

Performance validity tests (PVTs) are commonly used by neuropsychologists in clinical and forensic contexts to estimate the likelihood that obtained test data accurately reflect ability (Bush et al., 2005; Heilbronner et al., 2009; Sharland &amp; Gfeller, 2006). There has been considerable research activity in the area over the last two decades resulting in a proliferation of tests covering almost all cognitive domains (Boone, 2009; Sweet &amp; Guidotti Breting, 2013). Research has also examined underlying constructs, models, and nomenclature (Larrabee, 2012; Merkelbach, Jelicic, &amp; Pieters, 2011; Van Dyke, Millis, Axelrod, &amp; Hanks, 2013). Given the weight attributed to information provided by PVTs and their frequent use in medicolegal contexts, clinical and research questions on performance validity often spark controversy (Faust &amp; Guilmette, 1990).

Among other areas of contention in the PVT literature, issues related to PVT failure and false positive rates are a recurrent concern (Berthelson, Mulchan, Odland, Miller, &amp; Mittenberg, 2013; Davis &amp; Millis, 2014; Larrabee, 2014). A false positive on a PVT occurs when an individual is identified by the test as performing noncredibly or invalidly (i.e., with what was previously described as inadequate effort; Larrabee, 2012) when, in fact, that individual was providing a credible or valid (i.e., best effort) response. A number of demographic variables have been identified as relevant to PVT failure including age (Duff et al., 2011), educational history (Webb, Batchelor, Meares, Taylor, &amp; Marsh, 2012), and ethnicity (Salazar, Lu, Wen, &amp; Boone, 2007). Clinical conditions have also been identified as important considerations regarding PVT failure including intellectual disability (Dean, Victor, Boone, &amp; Arnold, 2008) and dementia (Dean, Victor, Boone, Philpott, &amp; Hess, 2009).

The recognition memory testing format used by many freestanding PVTs can be sensitive to memory deficits in dementia. Among the older freestanding PVTs in common use today, the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM; Tombaugh, 1996) illustrates this issue. In healthy, nonclinical volunteers, TOMM performances are often nearly perfect across the last two trials (Trial 2: M = 49.9, SD = 0.4; Retention: M = 49.9, SD = 0.5; Tombaugh, 1996), but in individuals with a diagnosis of dementia and no identified incentive to underperform, performances drop below cutoff (Trial 2: M = 39.5, SD = 6.1; Retention: M = 39.5, SD = 6.8; Teichner &amp; Wagner, 2004) and demonstrate unacceptably low specificity (.50 to .70; Merten, Bossink, &amp; Schmand, 2007). Similarly elevated false positive rates have been reported on other freestanding PVTs (Merten et al., 2007), but consideration of performance patterns from easier to more demanding trials has led to better classification even in memory disorders clinics (Howe &amp; Loring, 2009).

Embedded PVTs have also been found to have unacceptably high false positive rates in cases involving dementia (Dean et al., 2009). Dean and colleagues examined 18 embedded and freestanding PVTs derived from 12 neuropsychological measures in a clinical sample of participants diagnosed with dementia. Only two embedded PVTs based on Digit Span (Wechsler, 1987b) showed adequate specificity. Loring et al. (2016) examined embedded PVTs on Digit Span and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT; Rey, 1941; Ivnik et al., 1992) in a sample of older adults categorized by cognitive status into intact, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia groups. A commonly used reliable digit span (Greiffenstein, Baker, &amp; Gola, 1994) cutoff showed adequate specificity in the cognitively intact group but the false positive rate increased to 14% and 34% in MCI and dementia groups, respectively. On the AVLT, a recognition trial cutoff showed adequate specificity in the cognitively intact group, but the false positive rate was 42% and 70% in MCI and dementia groups, respectively. A logistic regression model cutoff on the AVLT (Davis, Millis, &amp; Axelrod, 2012) also showed adequate specificity in the cognitively intact group but not MCI or dementia groups in which false positive rates were 44% and 79%, respectively. One approach to reducing the false positive rate in cases involving suspected dementia is to adjust the cutoffs to achieve adequate specificity (Dean et al., 2009; Loring et al., 2016). Other research has identified embedded PVTs that appear to have adequate specificity without adjustment (Bortnik, Horner, &amp; Bachman, 2013; Merten et al., 2007), and combinations of PVTs have been found to reduce false positive rates (Loring et al., 2016).

Another area of debate over embedded PVTs and false positive rates centers on the relationship between the number of PVTs administered and PVTs failed. Given the proliferation of validity research and development of embedded PVTs in virtually all cognitive domains (Martin, Schroeder, &amp; Odland, 2015), it is possible for one neuropsychological measure to contribute to multiple embedded PVTs. The Trail Making Test (TMT; Partington &amp; Leiter, 1949; Reitan, 1955), for example, might be used to derive five embedded PVTs: TMT-A and -B raw scores (Iverson, Lange, Green, &amp; Franzen, 2002); TMT-B to -A ratio (Iverson et al., 2002; Merten et al., 2007); and errors on TMT-A and -B (Ruffolo, Guilmette, &amp; Willis, 2000). Although PVT research has continued to prioritize specificity over sensitivity at the level of individual test development (Larrabee &amp; Berry, 2007), some authors have noted concern that the cumulative false positive rate across a test battery might not remain at 10% given the number of PVTs under consideration and likely correlations among measures (Berthelson et al., 2013).

In contrast to research supporting the benefits to classification accuracy arising from use of multiple PVTs (Larrabee, 2003; Loring et al., 2016), Berthelson and colleagues (2013) proposed that excessive false positives would result because the binomial probability theory underlying aggregation across multiple PVTs is premised on independence of PVTs, which is not reflected in actual data (p. 910). They proposed Monte Carlo simulation as an approach to estimation of false positive rates that takes into account the correlations among PVTs. In their metaanalysis of 18 PVT studies, Berthelson and colleagues noted an average PVT intercorrelation of .31 (range .14 - .92) and suggested that PVT false positive rates increase linearly in relation to the number of PVTs administered with an average increase in false positive rate of about 3% and 5% with every additional PVT administered at specificities of .90 and .85, respectively (Tables IV and V in Berthelson et al., 2013).

Issues have been noted with the analytic methods used in the Berthelson et al. (2013) study (Davis &amp; Millis, 2014; Larrabee, 2014; Tarescavage &amp; Ben Porath, 2015). Research based on actual clinical and forensic data has demonstrated improved classification accuracy using multiple PVTs (Davis &amp; Millis, 2014; Larrabee, 2003; Miller et al., 2011; Vickery et al., 2004; Victor, Boone, Serpa, Buehler, &amp; Ziegler, 2009). Proponents of statistical simulation, however, continue to claim a strong linear relationship between PVTs administered and PVTs failed (Odland, Lammy, Martin, Grote, and Mittenberg, 2015).

Considering the continued importance of minimizing false positive rates on PVTs, noted concerns over the use of multiple embedded PVTs, and remaining questions about the utility of embedded PVTs in certain cases (e.g., suspected dementia), further research examining false positive rates on embedded PVTs in cases at risk of or involving dementia is warranted. In addition, predicted false positive rates based on simulated data reported in prior research (Berthelson et al, 2013), warrant empirical cross-validation. Earlier studies undertaking such empirical investigation (Davis &amp; Millis, 2014; Larrabee, 2014) were criticized for small sample size and failure to include results based on null hypothesis testing (Bilder, Sugar, &amp; Hellemann, 2014). To this end, a large sample comprised of older adults including cognitively normal and impaired groups offers a compelling test for examining the relationship between the number of PVTs administered and PVTs failed. Clinical groups predisposed to high false positive rates like older adults and individuals diagnosed with dementia may show an even greater effect of the number of PVTs administered on PVT failure. Given the claims of earlier research using simulated data (Berthelson et al., 2013; Odland et al., 2015), this study sought to examine the hypothesis that PVT failure rates observed empirically can be accurately predicted by Monte Carlo simulation taking into account the number of PVTs administered and PVT intercorrelations.

Method

Participants

This study involved secondary analysis of data from the National Alzheimerâ€™s Coordinating Center (NACC) database. The NACC database is described in detail elsewhere (Beekly, et al., 2007; Weintraub et al., 2009). Briefly, the NACC aggregates and disseminates data gathered by 39 Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Centers (ADCs) receiving funding from the National Institute on Aging. The ADCs contribute demographic, diagnostic, neurologic, neuropsychologic, and neuropathologic data from multiple clinic visits. The NACC moved to a Uniform Data Set (UDS) in 2005. This study used data from 35 ADCs. Participants included in this study were seen at NACC sites from 2005 to 2015 and were examined using version 1 and version 2 of the NACC UDS.

The dataset was restricted to the initial visit resulting in 24,127 cases. Cases were excluded for missing data on health history (n = 893), neuropsychological variables (n = 274), and demographics (n = 272) resulting in a final sample of 22,688. The sample was 57.2% female. In terms of race and ethnicity, the sample was 77.6% white, 13.8% black or African American, 6.0% Hispanic/Latino, 2% Asian, 0.4% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 0.1% other. The sample was 72.0 years old on average (SD = 10.3). The average educational level was 15.2 years (SD = 3.1). Participants were grouped by diagnosis with 45.5% classified as having normal cognition, 25.4% diagnosed with dementia, 23.9% diagnosed with amnestic or non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 5.3% diagnosed with cognitive impairment but not MCI. Diagnosis was determined clinically at individual ADCs according to published diagnostic criteria based on information captured in the UDS (Beekly, et al., 2007; McKann et al., 1984; Petersen &amp; Morris, 2005; Weintraub et al., 2009). Individuals considered cognitively impaired but not meeting diagnostic criteria for dementia or MCI were classified in the impaired but not MCI group (NACC, 2008). Diagnosis was determined by a single clinician in 22.1% of the sample (n = 5,025) and by consensus in 77.9 (n = 17,663). UDS version 1 was completed by 46.8% of the sample, and 53.2% completed UDS version 2.

Measures

Participants underwent neuropsychological evaluation with a battery that included common elements according to the UDS covering cognitive domains of attention, language, memory, and executive function (Weintraub et al., 2009). Tests comprising the UDS include a modified version of the Boston Naming Test (Kaplan, Goodglass, &amp; Weintraub, 1983), Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975), Semantic Word Generation (animal naming and vegetable naming; Gladsjo et al., 1999), Trail Making Test (Partington &amp; Leiter, 1949; Reitan, 1955), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Digit Symbol Coding (Wechsler, 1987a), and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised subtests (Digit Span and Logical Memory Story A; Wechsler, 1987b). Given the aim of this study, the UDS neuropsychological test battery was examined for measures identified in previous research with potential for use as embedded PVTs. Measures of interest included Digit Span (DS; Wechsler, 1987a, 1987b), Digit Symbol Coding (COD; Wechsler, 1987a), Logical Memory Story A (LM; Wechsler, 1987b), semantic word generation (SWG; animal naming; Gladsjo et al., 1999), and the Trail Making Test (TMT; Partington &amp; Leiter, 1949; Reitan, 1955).

Embedded PVTs were derived for all participants based on five neuropsychological tests: COD, DS, LM, SWG, and TMT. Cutoffs and references for the embedded PVTs are shown in Table 1. COD raw scores were converted to dichotomous pass or fail score based on an age-adjusted scaled score cutoff (&lt; 6; Inman &amp; Berry, 2002). Available DS raw scores included forward trials correct (DSF), longest DS forward, backward trials correct (DSB) and longest DS backward. DSF and DSB scores were combined to produce a total DS raw score that was converted to dichotomous pass or fail score based on an age-adjusted scaled score cutoff (&lt; 6; Iverson &amp; Franzen, 1994) using WAIS-R (Wechsler, 1987a) normative data. LM raw scores for Story A were doubled to produce an estimated LM raw score that was examined using a previously identified cutoff (&lt; 14; Iverson &amp; Franzen, 1996). SWG raw scores from animal naming were used (&lt; 13; Sugarman &amp; Axelrod, 2015). The TMT ratio (TMT-R) was calculated by dividing TMT-B raw score by TMT-A raw score (&lt; 1.5; Iverson et al., 2002).

Results

Participant demographics and performance on neuropsychological measures by diagnostic group are shown in Table 2. Given the sample size, all demographic comparisons were significantly different despite small effect sizes in many cases. Performance on neuropsychological measures varied by diagnostic group consistent with what would be expected clinically.

False positive rates on PVTs ranged from a low of 3.3 on TMT to a high of 26.3% on LM in the whole sample. False positive rates by diagnostic group and PVT are shown in Table 3. The average PVT intercorrelation was .40 (range âˆ’.25 to .59; Table 4).

Predicted failure rates based on statistical simulation (Berthelson et al., 2013) were compared to observed failure rates by diagnostic group and assumed specificity. Assuming specificity of .90 and failure on 2 or more of 5 PVTs, Berthelson and colleagues predicted a false positive rate of 11.5%. In the normal group, observed (1.9%) and predicted rates were significantly different, z = 30.66, p &lt; .0001. In the impaired group, observed (6.6%) and predicted rates were significantly different, z = 5.29, p &lt; .0001. In the MCI group, observed (13.2%) and predicted rates were significantly different, z = 3.97, p = .0001. In the dementia group, observed (52.8%) and predicted rates were significantly different, z = 98.19, p &lt; .0001.

Assuming specificity of .85 and failure on 2 or more of 5 PVTs, Berthelson and colleagues (2013) predicted a false positive rate of 19.4%. Observed and predicted proportions were again examined by diagnostic group. In the normal group, observed (1.9%) and predicted rates were significantly different, z = 45.03, p &lt; .0001. In the impaired group, observed (6.6%) and predicted rates were significantly different, z = 11.17, p &lt; .0001. In the MCI group, observed (13.2%) and predicted rates were significantly different, z = 11.50, p &lt; .0001. In the dementia group, observed (52.8%) and predicted rates were significantly different, z = 64.05, p &lt; .0001.

Observed and predicted false positive rates by diagnostic group and specificity are shown in Figure 1.

During peer review, additional analyses were suggested to compare observed and predicted false positive rates with failure on 3 or more of 5 PVTs. Berthelson et al. (2013) predicted false positive rates of 3.6% and 7.3% with specificity of .90 and .85, respectively, and failure on 3 or more of 5 PVTS. The observed false positive rates in the normal (0.17%), impaired (1.5%), and MCI (1.4%) groups were significantly lower than predicted false positive rates at both specificity levels (z = 3.9 to 18.7, p â‰¤ .0001). In the dementia group, the observed false positive rate (13.3%) was significantly higher than predicted rates at both specificity levels (z = 17.5 to 39.5, p &lt; .0001).

Discussion

This study examined false positive rates on embedded PVTs administered to an older adult sample categorized into cognitively normal, impaired, MCI, and dementia groups. Despite examination of 5 embedded PVTs, the average false positive rate in the cognitively normal group remained within a commonly accepted range (Larrabee &amp; Berry, 2007) with all measures showing false positive rate less than 10%. In the impaired and MCI groups, false positive rates were acceptable on three of five measures (COD, DS, and TMT-R). In the dementia group, the false positive rate remained acceptable on TMT-R. These findings are consistent with prior research in clinical samples with diagnosed memory disorders (Dean et al., 2009; Loring et al., 2016).

These observations indicate that a number of embedded PVTs maintain adequate specificity in older adults without diagnosed cognitive impairment. Therefore, in cases involving no or minimal expectation of neurologic cognitive dysfunction (e.g., three or more months after mild traumatic brain injury), older age alone is not a sufficient reason to consider PVT failure a false positive. Another observation from these findings is that, despite the clear increase in false positive rates seen with increasing cognitive dysfunction (i.e., a tenfold increase in the proportion failing two or more PVTs from cognitively normal to dementia groups), several embedded PVTs maintained adequate specificity in all but the dementia group. TMT-R demonstrated adequate specificity even in the dementia group. COD cutoffs have previously been examined only in simulation and mild traumatic brain injury samples (Inman &amp; Berry, 2002). DS variables appeared promising in some research involving dementia (Dean et al., 2009) but required adjustment to maintain adequate specificity in another sample (Loring et al., 2016). TMT variables appeared useful in prior research in samples involving memory deficits and dementia (Bortnik et al., 2013; Merten et al., 2007). Current findings thus extend prior research on use of embedded PVTs in cases involving suspected or diagnosed memory deficits including dementia.

A related implication of these observations is that in cases involving mild traumatic brain injury or another condition with limited expectation of significant cognitive compromise, individuals performing in the range of or lower than clinical groups with diagnosed cognitive deficits are likely performing noncredibly. Current findings might prove useful in contextualizing such performances. For example, a litigant claiming cognitive deficits following mild traumatic brain injury who completes TMT-A in 62 seconds or more, or completes TMT-B in 212 seconds or more can be described as performing in the range of older adults diagnosed with dementia. If such an individual drives him- or herself to the appointment, arrives on time, and navigates the sometimes challenging visuospatial demands of modern medical facilities, then it appears highly implausible that the TMT performance is an accurate reflection of cognitive dysfunction with a neurologic basis.

Regarding the proposed relationship between PVT administration and PVT failure (Berthelson, et al., 2013; Odland et al., 2015), the current findings provide striking evidence contrary to what has been predicted based on simulated data. Statistical comparison of observed and predicted false positive rates at different specificity levels (i.e. .90 or .85) revealed significant differences in all comparisons. Predicted false positive rates based on simulation demonstrated minimal relationship to observed false positive rates with overestimation in cognitively normal older adults as well as among older adults with a diagnosis of impairment, underestimation in individuals diagnosed with dementia, and variable findings in the MCI group. The instances in which observed rates were higher than predicted rates occurred in participants with a diagnosis of MCI or dementia, which have well-known susceptibility to false positive errors on PVTs. These findings do not support the utility of predicted false positive rates based on simulated data in a sample of older adults grouped by diagnosis. As noted in practice guidelines (Heilbronner et al., 2009), interpretation of PVT findings should occur in consideration of clinical characteristics observed in a specific case not in response to overreaching recommendations based on simulated data.

Limitations of this study include restriction in the range of neuropsychological data to variables included in the UDS, which incorporates older versions of tests to maintain consistency over time (Weintraub et al., 2009). Therefore, observed false positive rates on individual tests may be less relevant for those tests that have undergone revision (i.e., addition of new items to DS and COD subtests). Also, data were only available for LM Story A necessitating the use of an estimated LM raw score, which may underestimate actual LM raw score potentially inflating the false positive rate on the LM cutoff. Another limitation arises from the lack of a gold standard criterion for categorizing participants in terms of validity. Given the goal of the current study, it was thought to be more conservative to consider all PVT failures as false positives. While this approach may over-estimate the false positive rate, it appears a stringent test of the proposed association between the number PVTs administered and PVT failure. Finally, the sample was well-educated, which may limit extension of these findings to populations with lower educational attainment.

Future research might extend these findings by examining cutoffs on updated versions of instruments in the UDS. Given the promising findings of preserved specificity with some embedded PVTs, further research might also examine optimal cutoffs for different diagnostic groups (i.e., healthy older adults versus individuals with MCI or dementia diagnoses) on these measures. Furthermore, aggregation of additional information on relationships (or lack thereof) between the number of PVTs administered and PVTs failed would be facilitated if future validity studies were to report the number of PVTs administered, the number of PVTs failed, and, if multiple PVTs were administered, the non-parametric correlation coefficient between PVTs administered and failed. Given the ongoing productivity in PVT research, the addition of a few simple analyses would support future meta-analytic efforts that ultimately might provide stronger evidence of factors influencing PVT failure than what can be offered by any single study regardless of sample size.
