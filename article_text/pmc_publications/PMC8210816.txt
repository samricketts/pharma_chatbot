Despite decades of research and effort, there is still no effective disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Most of the recent AD clinical trials were targeting amyloid pathway but all these trials failed. Although amyloid pathology is a hallmark and defining feature of AD, targeting amyloid pathway have been very challenging due to low efficacy and serious side effects. Alternative approaches or mechanisms for our understanding of the major cause of memory loss in AD need to be considered as potential therapeutic targets. Increasing studies suggest that Ca2+ dysregulation in AD plays an important role in AD pathology and is associated with other AD abnormalities, such as excessive inflammation, increased ROS, impaired autophagy, neurodegeneration, synapse and cognitive dysfunction. Ca2+ dysregulation in cytosolic space, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria have been reported in the context of various AD models. Drugs or strategies to correct the Ca2+ dysregulation in AD have been demonstrated to be promising as an approach for treatment of AD in preclinical models. This review will discuss the mechanisms of Ca2+ dysregulation in AD and associated pathology, and discuss potential approaches or strategies to develop novel drugs for treatment of AD by targeting Ca2+ dysregulation.

1. INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is neurodegenerative disease with no cure. It is characterized by progressive memory loss that starts slowly and gradually worsens over the time. There are two forms of AD: familial form of AD (fAD) with early onset (appearance of the symptoms in ≥ 65 years) is caused by genetic mutations and sporadic form of AD (sAD) with late onset, the main reasons for sAD are advanced age and expression of genetic risk factors. fAD is caused by mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes. Majority of fAD mutations are found in PSEN1 indicating its dominant role in the pathogenesis of fAD, then goes APP and then PSEN2 (https://www.alzforum.org/mutations). APP encodes amyloid precursor protein that is cleaved by β and γ –secretases to produce amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides. Aβ42 peptide is the most toxic and aggregation prone form that is accumulated in extracellular plaques.

PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 proteins that constitute catalytic core of γ –secretase complex. fAD establish 1–2% of diagnosed AD cases worldwide. Additional characteristic of AD pathology is accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) that primarily are formed by hyperphosphorylated tau. In comparison to Aβ42 accumulation of NFT better correlates with synapse destabilization and development of AD [1], however there is no fAD associated mutations in tau protein. In contrast, mutations in MAPT gene encoding tau lead to frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a different neurodegenerative disorder.

The majority of AD is the sAD. Genetic mutation that causes sAD are still under active investigation. The main risk factors to develop AD is advanced age (older than 70) and expression of Apoliprotein E (ApoE) ε4 genes [2; 3]. ApoE isoforms influence Aβ clearance, aggregation and metabolism [4–6]. ApoE ε2 allele has been found to be neuroprotective [7]. Among other genetic risk factors are mutations in TREM2 gene that received recently growing attention due to appearance of the whole genome sequencing data. It has been observed that TREM2 is exclusively expressed by microglia in mouse and human brain [8]. Exact role of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis is not clear, it might be that TREM2 is involved in regulation of immune system of the brain [9].

Based on mutations found in fAD and sAD cases there are several hypothesis of AD pathogenesis. Firstly proposed and still believed dominant is amyloid hypothesis that positions Aβ42 to be the main trigger of the neurodegeneration. Despite many observations and proofs that Aβ42 is indeed toxic and plays certain role in AD pathogenesis [10–18], there is no anti-Aβ42 drug that can slow down the progression of the disease in humans [19]. Secondly studied is tau hypothesis that states abnormally phosphorylated tau is the main agent initiating AD. However, the same as with amyloid hypothesis so far developed anti-tau clinical trials failed [20]. There are methylene blue dye derivatives Trx0014 and LMTM inhibit tau aggregation and appeared to slow cognitive decline in phase III trials, but the methodology and claims of efficacy remain to be controversial [21]. Alternative hypotheses of AD are: inflammatory hypothesis that involves ApoE ε4 and TREM2, calcium dysregulation hypothesis as well as metal hypothesis [22]. Hypothesis on the role of innate immunity in AD is very young in comparison to amyloid and tau hypotheses with no drugs developed so far. Epidemiological studies have shown an association between heavy metals such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg) and AD, because of their involvement in cell toxicity and epigenetic mechanisms [23]. Metals such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) appear to be dysregulated in AD, perturbances in their levels have been linked to cognitive loss and neurodegeneration [24]. Metal ions play an important role in Aβ aggregation and metabolism, thus metal chelators and ligands have been suggested to be potential therapeutic agents for AD treatment [25]. Taking together there are different mutated genes that are involved in pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, due to unknown reason for sAD, there should be more new genes discovered in near future using bioinformatical and genetical approaches [26]. All known mutation leads to dysfunction of proteins that they encode. Abnormal function of proteins causes disruption of neuronal physiology and leads to cell death. How and whether these mutated proteins interact are under active investigation [27].

Calcium (Ca2+) hypothesis was first formulated in 1982 by Zaven Khachaturian [28]. It states that altered Ca2+ regulation might play role in AD pathogenesis as well as in brain aging. Since that time multiple experimental evidence was obtained that is consistent with the proposed hypothesis (for reviews see [29–33]). One of the drugs approved for treatment of AD is memantine. Memantine is selective inhibitor of NMDA receptors. Application of memantine to neurons protects them from glutamate induced excitotoxicity and reduces Ca2+ overload. However, efficacy of memantine is very limited and additional therapeutic agents need to be developed based on the “Ca2+ hypothesis”. Here we review the current state of studies of Ca2+ dysregulation in AD and discuss possible approaches for development of novel therapeutic agents based on these ideas. We pay special attention to modulators of neuronal store-operated calcium channels since we have recently obtained data demonstrating them as perspective therapeutics for AD.

2. Calcium dysregulation in AD

Calcium is a major second messenger that is involved in many physiological processes in excitable and non-excitable cells. Calcium can enter neurons from extracellular space via Ca2+ permeable channels such as voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC), non-specific cation channels N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and transient receptor potential channels (TRPC) (Figure 1). There are intracellular Ca2+ stores: endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. Intracellular calcium concentration is increased in patient fibroblasts, in vitro and in vivo experiments. Calcium dysregulation in AD neurons was observed at each site of Ca2+ entry to the cytosol. Aβ42 has been observed to increase intracellular calcium concentration via interactions with NMDAR [34–36], VGCC [37] and via potentiation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) [38] (Figure 1). Thus effective antagonists of NMDAR, VGCC as well as mGluR5 might constitute potential therapeutic strategy. Indeed the only drug that is able to temporally alleviate AD symptoms is NMDAR antagonist Memantine [39]. Nitromemantine is suggested to be an upgraded version of Memantine, that is able to protect spines from Aβ toxicity [40]. Recently Ketamine as NMDAR antagonist has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in treatment resistant forms of depression with early onset [41–43]. Thus it has been suggested that ketamine can be used to treat AD [44]. There are data from clinical studies on the use of antagonists of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel as potential drugs to prevent the development of dementia [45]. It was found that treatment with nitrendipine for 5 years can reduce the number of dementia (Alzheimer’s type, vascular and mixed) by 55% [45]. Antagonists of mGluR5 such as MPEP and PF-5212391 have been shown to protect postsynaptic mushroom spines in APPKI neurons [46].

It has been also proposed that oligomeric Aβ42 are able to imbed into plasma membrane and make Ca2+ permeable pores [47]. Anti-Aβ therapy should protect neurons from toxic influence of Aβ (Figure 1). However, recently it has been reported that treatment with Roche’s gantenerumab and Lilly’s solanezumab didn’t bring cognitive benefits to patients with genetically inherited AD form (outcome from DIAN-TU Phase 2/3 clinical trials that became available on 10th of February 2020). Aβ42 was also observed to affect the function of ryanodine receptors (RyanR) and inositolthisphosphate receptors (InsP3R), ER resident proteins that are responsible for Ca2+ release (Figure 1). Abnormally phosphorylated Tau and calcium dysregulation have been shown to be related with each other. For example it has been demonstrated that temporal intracellular calcium signaling induce prolonged increase in Tau phosphorylation via glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK-3β) pathway in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells [48]. It has been also shown that application of Tau protein to cultured hippocampal or cortical neurons significantly increase intracellular Ca2+ content through muscarinic receptor [49].

Apoliprotein E4 has been shown to affect neuronal intracellular calcium concentration [50–52]. The exact mechanism of ApoE4 mediated Ca2+ increase is not known. It might be related to the potentiation of excitotoxicity via NMDAR [51; 53] or hyperphosphorylation and secretion of p-tau [50]. No direct involvement of TREM2 in neuronal calcium dysregulation has been observed so far.

Many studies on calcium dysregulation in AD have been done using fAD associated mutations in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [54–57]. Presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 constitute catalytic core of γ-secretase complex. γ-secretase together with β-secretase constitute amyloidogenic pathway that cleaves APP to toxic amyloid beta peptides [58] (Figure 1). Development of gamma secretase modulators as potential anti-AD therapeutics is complicated due to essential role of gamma secretase in Notch processing [59]. Recently, several γ-secretase modulators that lower Aβ42 content but do not inhibit γ-secretase mediated Notch proteolysis or accumulation of C-terminal fragment of APP have been proposed [60]. However, recently published cryo-EM structures of γ-secretase complexes together with Notch [61] and APP [62] reveal small differences in binding sites of APP and Notch, thus making it difficult although possible to develop specific γ-secretase modulators that would block only toxic cleavage of APP. β-secretase inhibitors are next drugs tested by pharma to prevent toxic cleavage of APP. There are two homologues of β-secretase in humans: BACE1 and BACE2. BACE1 is the one that cleaves APP, while BACE2 does not cleave APP in vivo but has many other substrates. Almost all previously and currently clinically studied BACE1 inhibitors do not distinguish between BACE1 and BACE2 homologues increasing risk of side effects for drugs. Indeed, most of anti-BACE1 clinical trials are terminated due to liver, retinal or skin toxicity [63].

Presenilins have non-γ-secretase functions that play role in calcium signaling pathways. Among them most studied function of presenilins is impact on activity of RyanR and InsP3R [55; 56; 64; 65]. RyanR and InsP3R are ER resident proteins that activated in response to Ca2+ influx or inositoltrisphosphate, respectively. Up-regulation of RyanR-mediated Ca2+ release and increased levels of RyanR expression among different PS-fAD models was reported [56; 66-71]. It has been suggested that in order to change RyanR gaiting activity presenilins might have direct protein-protein interactions with RyanR [72–74]. Changes in RyanR function have been suggested to be responsible for alterations in synaptic activity induced by presenilins [75]. It has been also shown that overexpression of Aβ and βAPP can cause RyanR dysfunction independently of presenilin mutations or overexpression [76–79]. In addition application of exogenious Aβ oligomers can stimulate RyanR-dependent Ca2+ release in wild type hippocampal neurons [80]. There are three isoforms of RyanRs: RyanR1, RyanR2 and RyanR3. Although all three isoforms can be found in the brain, RyanR2 is predominantly expressed in the cortex and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus [81]. Dantrolene, an muscle relaxant, a drug used to treat malignant hyperthermia. Dantrolene works as RyanR antagonist to reduce Ca2+ release from the ER (Figure 1). Its neuroprotective effects in AD models been tested by several labs. Some [78; 82; 83] but not all [84] studies have shown that dantrolene can be used to slow down the progression of AD. However, usage of dantrolene in clinics complicates by several issues: dantrolene targets store-operated Ca2+ channels [85]; dantrolene is specific for skeletal muscle RyanR1 [86], and does not block neuronal RyanR2 and RyanR3 subtypes effectively; long term administration of dantrolene demonstrates severe side effects [87].There is growing body of evidence that complete blockade of RyanRs are not desirable and toxic. It seems like the function of RyanRs has to be stabilized but not blocked in order to be neuroprotective in AD. Possible RyanR stabilizing drug is Rycal. Rycals are a class of benzothiazepine-derived Ca2+ channel stabilizers that have been developed by ARMGO Pharma Inc. (Tarrytown, NY) for chronic heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [88]. Rycals target the interaction between RyanR and calstabin isoforms (RyanR1 to FKBP12 (calstabin1) in skeletal muscle and RyanR2 to FKBP12.6 in cardiac muscle), the latter of which stabilize the RyanR closed state under normal physiological conditions without perturbing functional isoforms expressed elsewhere [89] (Figure 1). Recent study in AD mouse models demonstrated that usage of Rycal S107 may improve synaptic plasticity, normalize behavioral and cognitive functions and reduce Aβ load [90]. Sensitivity of InsP3R to its agonist InsP3 significantly increased in cell expressing mutant presenilins [91; 92]. Suppression of InsP3R expression normalized exaggerated Ca2+ signals observed in cortical and hippocampal neurons in PS1-M146V knock-in and 3xTg AD mice models, indicating that it might be a potential therapeutic strategy [93]. However, there is no InsP3R-targeting drug at the moment.

Another γ-secretase independent function of presenilins is ER Ca2+ leak pore [84; 94; 95] that is disrupted by many but not all PS-fAD mutations. PSEN1-M146V mutation is a classic example of PS1 mutation that causes disruption of Ca2+ leak function [94]. However, widely distributed among Finnish population mutation when complete Exon 9 is deleted is the example of mutation that makes ER Ca2+ pore super leaky [94]. Recent study suggests that overexpression of PS2T122R/ N141I-fAD but not PS1A246E-fAD in either SH-SY5Y cells or FAD patient-derived fibroblasts reduces ER Ca2+ content via partial blockade of SERCA pump [96]. Thus it becomes obvious that different mutations in both PS1 and PS2 have different impact on ER Ca2+ homeostasis. How different mutations in PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes cause distinct dysfunction of ER Ca2+ handling mechanism? Probable answer is that these mutations differently affect endoproteolitic cleavage of presenilin proteins.

Presenilins undergo endoproteolisis that results in release of N- and C-terminal fragments. Only full length presenilins form ER Ca2+ leak pore (Figure 1). Initially site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to map potential ion conduction pore of PS1 [97]. Later on crystal structure of archael homologue PHS1 has been obtained that revealed a hole that traverses entire protein and large enough to allow Ca2+ to pass through [98]. In contrast, the Ca2+ conducting hole was not apparent in the structure of γ-secretase complex [99], which might be explained that only truncated forms of presenilins are present in mature γ-secretase complex.

3. nSOCE disruption in AD

Most of PS1-fAD mutations cause disruption of ER calcium leak function thus leading to ER Ca2+ increase. Effects of fAD mutations on ER Ca2+ leak function was confirmed by patient clinical data [100]. Moreover, ER Ca2+ concentration is increased in experimental models of AD including transgenic mice. Neuronal store-operated calcium entry (nSOCE) is mediated via store-operated calcium channels. nSOCE is a unique cellular mechanism that refills ER calcium store in response to its depletion [101]. SOCE was initially described in non-excitable cells and it has been believed that SOCE does not play a role in physiology of neurons. The first reports about role of SOCE in the pathogenesis of AD have been published in 2000. Leissring et al. (2000) observed that fibroblasts isolated from PS1-M146V knock in mice exhibit significant impairments in store-operated Ca2+ entry after stimulation of cells with bradykinin. Authors suggested that impaired SOCE is due to elevated ER Ca2+ levels in PS1-M146V fibroblasts [102]. Yoo et al. (2000) reported alteration in SOCE activity in presenilin fAD mutant neurons [103]. Two different mechanisms of mutant PS1-mediated dysregulation of SOCE have been proposed [104]. The first mechanism is linked to direct attenuation of SOCE at the cell surface, the second mechanism evokes changes in processing of APP and generation of amyloid beta peptides [104]. Later on came more experimental evidence that SOCE is dysregulated in AD pathogenesis [105–111] (Figure 1).

There are several cellular players that regulate the activity of SOCE. The first one is STIM protein that resides in ER and senses changes in ER Ca2+ concentration. There are two isoforms of STIM protein: STIM1 and STIM2 which differ in sensitivity to ER Ca2+ concentration. STIM proteins have Ca2+ sensitive EF hand motif that sits inside of ER and measures changes in ER Ca2+ concentrations. STIM2 detects changes in ER Ca2+ concentration first due to its lower affinity [112]. Activated STIM2 triggers small and prolonged store-operated currents in order to refill slightly depleted stores, thus correcting small fluctuations in ER Ca2+ concentrations [113]. Genetically manipulated deletion of STIM2 causes strong reduction in ER Ca2+ concentration [109; 112; 114], while its overexpression causes modest increase in ER and cytosolic Ca2+ [112; 115]. STIM1 detects big drops in ER Ca2+ concentration. When STIM proteins detect deficiency in ER Ca2+ they start to oligomerize and are moved to ER-plasma membrane (PM) tight junction where they interact with PM ion channels in order to allow Ca2+ influx [116–125]. Both STIM1 and STIM2 proteins are expressed in hippocampal neurons [115], and both of these proteins have been implicated in control of nSOCE.

Another cellular players that regulates the activity of SOCE are plasma membrane proteins from ORAI family and TRPC family. ORAI proteins have been described first to be involved in SOCE regulation. It has been observed that STIM1 is co-localized with ORAI1 upon depletion of Ca2+ stores in dendrites and soma [126]. Another report suggested that STIM1 and ORAI1 are co-localized and may interact with synaptopodin (SP), protein that regulates synaptic plasticity, in hippocampal dendritic spines [127]. Activation of STIM1 and neuronal store-operated calcium channels was described in hippocampal neurons following activation of type I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) [128]. Using single organelle, FRET-based analyses it has been shown that overexpression of both PS1-fAD and PS2-fAD downregulates SOCE via reduced expression of STIM1 [96]. It has been demonstrated that expression and activation of OptoSTIM1 construct in mouse hippocampus is able to induce nSOCE and promote contextual memory formation [129]. Improvements of contextual learning have been detected in STIM1 overexpressing mice [130]. Overexpression of STIM1 does not influence LTP induction in acute hippocampal slices, however, blocks DHPG dependent LTD [130]. Mild learning delay has been reported in Stim1 cKO mice, while learning and memory in Stim2 cKO mice was normal. However, deletion of both Stim genes resulted in a pronounced impairment in spatial learning and memory and in enhanced LTP [131]. Recent studies identified STIM1 as a target of gamma-secretase activity. Particularly, PSEN1 mutations, associated with fAD, enhanced gamma-secretase cleavage of STIM1, reducing activation of ORAI1, downregulating SOCE and causing destabilization of dendritic spines [132].

STIM2 is predominant isoform of the hippocampus [106; 133]. Downregulation of STIM2 proteins was observed in cells from AD patients and in AD mouse models [106; 134]. In a model of focal cerebral ischemia genetic deletion of STIM2 protein impaired SOCE and confer protection from neurological damage [109]. Recently it has been observed that STIM2 moves to dendritic spines and regulates ORAI1-mediated nSOCE [111]. It has been reported that STIM2, but not STIM1, influences the formation of excitatory dendritic spines and shapes basal synaptic transmission in excitatory neurons [135; 136]. Yap et al demonstrated impaired early LTP and long-term depression (LTD) at CA3–CA1 hippocampal synapses in adult mice bearing a STIM2 deletion in CaMKIIα positive neurons [136]. Our laboratory reported that virus mediated knock down of STIM2 protein expression causes mushroom spine loss and nSOCE downregulation in hippocampal dendritic spines [106]. Moreover it has been observed that STIM2 hyperexpression as well as pharmacological activation of nSOCE in the hippocampus is able to protect mushroom spines in different models of Alzheimer disease pathology [106; 107; 133; 137].

TRPC1 is the most extensively studied [138] and has been involved in nSOCE, particularly in striatum [139]. However its relation to hippocampal nSOCE is not clear. Downregulation of TRPC1 and ORAI1 proteins was suggested to cause the reduction of SOCE in astrocytes from APP knockout mice [140; 141]. TRPC3 has been reported to contribute to nSOCE [142; 143]. However, increased TRPC3 gene and protein expression has been associated with contextual fear memory deficits [144]. TRPC6 displays memory-preserving functions by promoting excitatory synapse formation via CaMKIV-CREB signaling pathway [145]. TRPC6 transgenic mice exhibit enhancement in spine formation, and spatial learning and memory in Morris water maze [145]. TRPC6 has non ion channel activities such as it interacts with APP thus leading to inhibition of its cleavage by γ-secretase and reduced Aβ42 production [146]. In contrast PSEN2-fAD mutations abolish agonist induced TRPC6 activation and thus Ca2+ entry function [147]. It has been shown that TRPC6 interacts with ORAI-1, −2 and −3 [148]. We have recently shown that TRPC6 together with ORAI2 and STIM2 form ternary complex that mediate nSOCE in hippocampal cultures [133].

4. TRPC6 channels as a molecular target

Recent evidence suggests that TRPC6 channels may constitute attractive target for development of AD modifying therapy. There is also genetic confirmation that TRPC6 is involved in AD pathogenies. Reduced TRPC6 mRNA expression has been observed in patient with AD and mild cognitive impairment [149]. Hyperforin, known activator of TRPC6 channels [150], shows neuroprotective effects in different mouse models [151–154]. Neuroprotective mechanism of Hyperforin may be related to upregulated phosphorylation of CREB [155], activation of RAS/MEK/ERK, PI3K, and CAMKIV signaling pathways [156], preservation of mitochondria functions [157], as well as to restoration of nSOCE (Figure 1) [133]. However main disadvantages of Hyperforin to be an anti-AD drug are its expensive costs for chemical synthesis [158] as well as its instability on light. Moreover Hyperforin has a toxic side effect causing gastrointestinal upset [159; 160].

Alternative to Hyperforin molecules that activate TRPC6 channels are NSN21778 [133] and 51164 [137]. NSN21778 and 51164 have been shown to recover mushroom spine percentage in different mouse models as well as to restore LTP in AD mouse slices [133; 137]. In contrast to Hyperforin it has been shown that both NSN21778 and 51164 are positive modulators of TRPC6 channels thus they should have less toxic effects when applied to humans (Figure 1) [133; 137]. CaMKII has been suggested to be the downstream signaling molecule that is involved in the neuroprotective mechanism of nSOCE activating drugs [106; 107]. It has been hypothesized that nSOCE is necessary to provide Ca2+ influx that is needed to support CaMKII activity, maintain LTP and preserve structure of postsynaptic dendritic spines [32; 161].

Important to note that AD seems to be a multifactorial disease with different disrupted signaling mechanism in different patients. TRPC6-mediated downregulation of nSOCE has been reported for fAD cases such as PS1-M146V [106], APP [133] and in conditions of amyloid synaptotoxicity [137]. Thus, therapy based on Hyperforin, NSN21778 and 51164 will work only in such cases (Figure 1 and 2). As it has been recently reported there is fAD associated PSEN1ΔE9 mutation where TRPC6-nSOCE is upregulated [162]. In such AD cases application of nSOCE blocking agents is needed. It has been shown that EVP4593 inhibits PS1ΔE9 mediated upregulation of TRPC6-nSOCE in hippocampal cultures (Figure 1) [162]. Thus antagonists of nSOCE are also potential anti-AD therapeutic agents (Figure 1 and 2).

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we would like to re-state that targeting Ca2+ dysregulation may constitute potentially promising approach to treating AD. There is ample evidence of Ca2+ dysregulation in AD neurons, and correction of abnormal Ca2+ signals may help to prevent synaptic and neuronal loss. Potential targets include RyanRs, components of nSOCE pathway and possibly additional Ca2+ signaling proteins. There are existing small molecules that engage with these targets and preclinical data that support this approach. However, Ca2+ signaling plays an important role in peripheral tissues, which may limit acceptable doses of these compounds in clinical trials.

Aβ oligomers are produced by β- and γ-secretases. They can form Ca2+ permeable pores. Aβ oligomers interacts with NMDAR, VGCC and upregulates their function that leads to increase Ca2+ influx into cytoplasm. Aβ oligomers are able to cause mGluR5-mediated ER Ca2+ refilling (the exact signaling mechanism is not known). Glutamate excitotoxicity hyperactivates NMDAR and causes mGluR1/5 mediated synthesis of IP3. IP3 stimulates ER Ca2+ release via IP3R that in turn induces Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release via RyanR2. All these events lead to increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations that shifts balance from CaMKII to CaN. CaN activation causes downregulation of LTP and induces LTD that causes synapse loss and leads to AD. Presenilins (PSEN) form ER leak pore. This function is disrupted by M146V and ΔE9 mutations. M146V causes PSEN loss of function that results in ER Ca2+ overfill and subsequent downregulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry (rectangle with a dashed line). ΔE9 causes gain of function that results in emptying of ER Ca2+ stores and hyperactivation of store-operated Ca2+ entry (rectangle with a solid line). The potential therapeutic strategies are: a) blockade of hyperactivated Ca2+ entry via NMDAR (by Nitromemantine or Ketamine), via VGCC (by Nitrendipine), via store-operated Ca2+ channels (in PSEN1-ΔE9 –like cases by EVP4593); b) reduction of ER calcium concentration via blockade of RyanR2 by Dantrolene or Rycal, via blockade of mGluR5-mediated ER calcium overfill by MPEP or PF-5212391. In PSEN1-M146V-like AD cases store-operated calcium channels are downregulated. It is believed that tonic SOCE is necessary to support stability of mushroom spines via support of CaMKII activity in silent synapses. Thus in PSEN1-M146V neurons the usage of agonist of SOCE such as Hyperforin, NSN21778 or 51164 is necessary.

Different fAD mutations can lead to a decrease [96; 106; 132; 134] or increase [103; 132; 162] in the activity of nSOCE (CCE). Depending on biological context, agonists or antagonists of nSOCE may exert beneficial effects in AD.
