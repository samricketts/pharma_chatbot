Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive, fatal, neurodegenerative disorder for which only treatments of limited efficacy are available. Despite early mentions of dementia in the ancient literature and the first patient diagnosed in 1906, the underlying causes of AD are not well understood. This study examined the possible role of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is involved in cognitive and motor function, in AD. We treated adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) with okadaic acid (OKA) to model AD and assessed resulting behavioral and neurochemical changes. We then employed a latent learning paradigm to assess cognitive and motor function followed by neurochemical analysis with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) at carbon-fiber microelectrodes to measure electrically stimulated dopamine release. The behavioral assay showed that OKA-treatment caused fish to have lower motivation to reach the goal chamber, resulted in impeded learning, and decreased locomotor activity compared to controls. Our voltammetric measurements revealed that peak dopamine overflow in OKA-treated fish was about one third of that measured in controls. These findings highlight the profound neurochemical changes that may occur in AD. Furthermore, they demonstrate that applying the latent learning paradigm and FSCV to zebrafish is a promising tool for future neurochemical studies and may be useful for screening drugs for the treatment of AD.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive neurodegenerative disease that accounts for 60–80% of all dementia cases. A patient with AD may undergo severe cognitive, mental, and social impairment, including memory loss that challenges daily life, confusion with place or time, and poor judgement.1–3 More than 5.5 million Americans and 44 million people worldwide suffer from AD symptoms and it is estimated that, by the year 2050, these numbers will triple. Moreover, the cost of treatment in the US could rise as high as 1.1 trillion US dollars.4–6 Unfortunately, there is still no cure or highly effective drug treatments for AD.7 Therefore, the development of model organisms that can accurately model AD while providing a way to evaluate potential therapies with enhanced throughput is critical.

AD pathophysiology can be related to two main hallmarks: extracellular formation of amyloid plaques and intracellular aggregation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Studies of familial AD show sufficient relationship between the disease and mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is the precursor of Aβ peptides and Pencillin1 (PSEN1) and pencillin2 (PSEN2). Both peptides are catalytic subunits in γ secretase responsible for APP cleavage. These mutations result in the formation of more hydrophobic and longer Aβ peptides, which further aggregate into amyloid plaques. Additionally, NFTs are likely also formed due to extensive deposition of tau aggregates. Tau proteins, which are responsible for stabilizing microtubules in the brain, undergo hyperphosphorylation, resulting in destabilization and disintegration into tau aggregates.8,9 These aberrant molecular changes may cause atrophy, resulting in large-scale alterations in brain size and structure.

Over the past two decades, rodents that model AD through different genetic modifications and chemical treatments have contributed immensely toward understanding cellular mechanisms of AD.10,11 However, the development of simpler vertebrate model organisms that recapitulate the cellular pathology seen AD model rodents, while also providing enhanced throughput and cost savings, would benefit AD research.12 Zebrafish (Danio rerio), having a complex central nervous system, is rapidly emerging as a useful model for the study of multiple neurodegenerative diseases13–15 and represent a potentially useful AD model organism that could provide information complementary to that found using rodents. Zebrafish have a fully sequenced genome, with 70% of the genes showing homology to that of humans, and possess neuronal pathways that are analogous in many cases to those found in the mammals.12,16 Additionally, depending upon experimental design, the use of zebrafish may provide enhanced throughput compared to rodents, as they offer the opportunity to group experiments (drug administration, behavioral analysis, etc). Recent work has illustrated that a robust zebrafish AD model can be developed by treating the zebrafish with okadaic acid (OKA).12

OKA is a polyether fatty acid extracted from marine sponges, and it has been widely used to study the propagation of neurotoxicity of different animal models.17–19 OKA selectively inhibits protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. Inhibition of PP2A, in particular, combined with triggered activation of several major phosphorylating pathways, including MAPK and ERK, induce the hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein, thereby giving rise to the tau aggregates. Additionally, even though the exact mechanism is not well known, OKA gives rise to neurodegeneration by oxidative stress and Aβ deposition.20–24 The newly developed OKA-induced AD zebrafish model recapitulates most of the pathophysiological conditions prevalent in AD, and captures changes in both Aβ-fragments and p-tau protein.25 Therefore, OKA acid treated zebrafish are a robust model to study molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of AD, or drug discovery for AD, while cutting down on cost and time constraints.

Dopamine, an abundant catecholamine neurotransmitter, plays critical roles in cognitive and motor function in humans and rodents.26–28 Alterations in dopamine synthesis, storage, release, and uptake likely influence motor and cognitive function in multiple neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease29–33, Huntington’s disease34–36, and schizophrenia.37 Similarly, in AD, dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway have shown characteristic pathological changes such as the presence of Aβ plaques and NFT.38 However, the precise role of dopamine dysregulation in the expression of cognitive and motor symptoms in AD has not been fully investigated.38

Techniques for analyzing zebrafish neurochemistry and behavior have rapidly evolved over the past several years. Fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) at carbon-fiber microelectrodes is an electrochemical technique that allows measurement of dopamine release and uptake with nM limits of detection and sub second temporal resolution.39–43 Recently, our group and others measured sub-second dopamine release and uptake in zebrafish brains ex vivo with FSCV.42–44

Behavioral assays that assess cognitive function have also matured. Recently, a behavioral paradigm that targets latent learning was developed and applied to zebrafish.45 This well-established test shows that zebrafish are capable of latent learning, i.e. can acquire memory of their environment after being allowed to explore it.45,46 Latent learning is a basic learning exercise based on spatial exploration that uses the natural tendency of the fish to explore novelty.47,48 In this behavioral assay, zebrafish are exposed to a maze with a particular tunnel opened, and allowed to explore the space without any external intervention or reinforcement (i.e. food motivation, punishment, etc). During the free exploration (training) period, no monitoring of the behavioral activity is necessary. The training session is then followed by a short probe session wherein the swim tunnel choice (spacial bias) of the fish is recorded and quantified.45 Importantly, during the probe period, stimulus fish are placed into a goal box of the maze, to enhance their natural need for socialization49–51 and promote the motivation to reach the goal box.

Critical advantages of this approach are that such training requires no controlled delivery of reinforcers, requires minimal experimenter intervention, and allows more fish to be trained simultaneously. Taken with data obtained by FSCV, this approach can provide an informative picture of how neurochemical changes compare with behavioral changes in disease model and control zebrafish.

Currently, the relation between dopamine release and uptake and cognitive performance in AD model zebrafish is not well characterized. To fill this knowledge gap, we administered OKA to zebrafish to recapitulate the main pathophysiological hallmarks and behavioral conditions observed in AD. We then analyzed the cognitive and locomotor activity of these fish with the latent learning behavioral paradigm45,46, and measured dopamine release in whole brains ex vivo with FSCV. We found significant deficiencies in latent learning and locomotor activity in OKA-treated fish when compared to controls. These deficiencies were accompanied by impairments in dopamine release. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine neurotransmitter release and uptake in AD model zebrafish and compare it to behavioral deficiencies.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

OKA treated fish showed cognitive and motor impairment.

Many AD symptoms are cognition and behavior related, with the majority of patients displaying memory loss, behavior deterioration, thought slowness, and performance impairment.1,2,52 In this study, the latent learning paradigm was used to investigate the effect of OKA on zebrafish memory and learning deficits.45,46 During the probe trial, fish did not show any obvious signs of fear, such as jumping, erratic movement, or freezing since they were exposed to the maze for nine days during the training period. The testing maze used is shown in Figure 1A. Representative heat maps show a single zebrafish movement (for each treatment) recorded for 10 minutes during the probe trial (Figure 1). All maps document probe trials for zebrafish trained to enter the left tunnel. Analysis of the heat maps revealed that while chemically naive and vehicle treated zebrafish tend to spend majority of time in the goal box close to the stimuli fish (Figure 1B and C), OKA treated fish remained mostly in the blind-ended tunnel and start box (Figure 1D). Such a behavior may be affected by several factors, including motor and locomotion impairment, lower interest to explore the maze, and/or decreased tendency to shoal. The activity level, i.e. the swimming velocity and the distance swam, is shown in Figure 2A and B, respectively. Repeated analysis of multiple zebrafish revealed that OKA treated zebrafish swam significantly slower and a smaller distance (both one way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc analysis, p &lt; 0.05, n = 14). These findings, therefore, suggest that OKA treatment causes cognitive and motor dysfunction in zebrafish. Even though motor impairments often occur prior to presentation of cognitive deficits in AD patients,53 motor dysfunction in OKA treated rodents is not well documented in the peer reviewed literature. One study found no effect on motor function in OKA treated rats54, however, other AD model rodents display motor deficits.55–57 In contrast, we found significant changes in motor function in the OKA zebrafish model. Thus, OKA treatment seems to recreate motor dysfunction more faithfully in zebrafish than in rats. To our knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate latent learning paradigm to assess locomotor activity in AD model zebrafish.

OKA treatment affects the learning and memory of zebrafish.

Here, we analyzed the choice of the tunnel when they first come out of the start box. Previous studies have proven that repeated exposure of fish to a particular open tunnel significantly affects their choice of tunnel to reach the reward chamber as compared to the untrained groups.58 Because the maze has two tunnels, and, therefore a 50% chance of being correct, animals are only considered to demonstrate functional learning if they are at least 70% correct at the end of the testing period.25 During the probe trial (when both tunnels leading to the reward box were opened), 86% of chemically naive and 92% of vehicle treated fish chose correctly (Figure 3), and first entered the tunnel that was open during their training session. On the contrary, our results demonstrated that the fish treated with OKA have a high tendency to choose the incorrect tunnel (56%). Binominal test confirmed our observation and found that significantly more chemically naive and vehicle treated fish chose the correct tunnel (p &gt; 0.05, binomial distribution probability 0.9963 and 0.9983, respectively) as compared to random chance (50 %). The OKA treated fish did not deviate from the random chance (p &gt; 0.05).

These results support our prediction that the OKA induces learning and memory impairment of the zebrafish. A large body of literature has reported that OKA treatment in rodents causes memory deficits.59–61 Inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A has been identified as the ultimate mechanism for the cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease pathology.20 Given that OKA is a potent and selective inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A activity62, these results agree with earlier findings of OKA induced memory impairments in rodents.

OKA treated fish have a prolonged latency to leave the start box.

Figure 4A depicts the results for the latency of fish to leave the start box. This demonstrates the level of motivation of the fish to actively explore the maze. Almost every fish regardless of the treatment condition left the start chamber and explored the maze. However, while the chemically naive and vehicle treated fish left the start box almost immediately after removal of the divider (2.7 ± 0.4 and 3.4 ± 1.4 s, respectively), the OKA treated fish displayed significantly higher latency (one way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc analysis, p &lt; 0.05) to leave the start box (27 ± 10 s). The lower tendency to leave the start box could be attributed to the decreased motivation of the fish to access the stimulus fish in the reward box.63 The latency to leave the start box of chemically naive and vehicle treated groups was not significantly different from each other.

OKA treated fish required a greater amount of time to reach the goal box.

The period of time between leaving the start box and entering the reward chamber was greater when testing OKA treated fish compared to controls. This time reflects the motivation and ability to reach the goal box and stay with the group of fish that served as the stimulus. As shown in Figure 4B, the fish treated with the OKA showed a significantly higher latency to enter the reward box (185 ± 33 s) as compared to the chemically naive and vehicle treated fish (18 ± 4 and 20 ± 4 s respectively) (one way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc analysis, p &lt; 0.05). No statistical difference was found between chemically naive and vehicle-treated fish. This increased latency to enter the reward chamber of the OKA treated fish may indicate impaired latent learning and spatial memory. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that show deficits in spatial learning and memory in OKA infused rats.54

OKA treated fish showed significant immobility.

In addition to complete the behavioral study, we have also quantified freezing (immobility), a zebrafish innate response to aversive or painful events.64 A growing body of evidence has reported on a link between immobility and fear-like behavior in zebrafish.46,65,66 Figure 5. shows the fish freezing response within each group throughout the probe trial. Tukey post hoc test (p &lt; 0.05) confirmed that fish exposed to the OKA exhibited significantly higher values of immobility as compared to chemically naive and vehicle treated fish. We speculate that the observed increased freezing may be related to a fear or fear-induced anxiety. It is possible that dopaminergic impairment contributes to this behavior. Though often neglected, it has been suggested that dopamine has a greater significance to the induction of anxious states than generally appreciated, and is one of the neurotransmitters most potently modulating the mechanism underlying states of fear and anxiety.67–69 However, the significance of dopamine in fear like behavior requires further investigation.

Taken collectively, our results indicate that OKA treatment impairs memory acquisition and consolidation in the zebrafish. The shorter latencies leaving the start box and entering the reward chamber observed in naive and vehicle fish have indicated that these control fish have learned the spatial layout of the maze better than the OKA treated fish. For the first time, our results demonstrate that a latent learning paradigm can detect the cognitive and behavioral impairments in OKA induced Alzheimer’s model zebrafish.

Neurochemical Response to OKA Administration.

Extensive evidence implicates dopamine in learning and memory. To determine if alterations in dopamine release correlate with behavioral deficits, we used FSCV to measure electrically stimulated dopamine release in live brains harvested from OKA treated, vehicle treated, and chemically naive fish. Representative raw data are shown in Figure 6. The color plots (Figure 6A) fail to reveal additional release chemical species. There is a tendency for the current signal to linger on the back side of the i versus t curves (Figure 6B). We have studied this phenomenon previously and concluded that it may result from adsorbed dopamine.43

Statistical comparison revealed that zebrafish exposed to OKA had significantly less dopamine release (one way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc analysis, p &lt; 0.05, n = 14) than naive and vehicle-treated fish (Figure 7A). There was no significant difference between naive and vehicle treated fish. When results were broken down by sex, analysis by two-way ANOVA revealed no main effect of sex on dopamine release (p &lt; 0.05, n = 7) or interaction between treatment condition and sex (p &lt; 0.05, n = 7) (Figure 7B). Dopamine release in the dorsal striatum36,70 and nucleus accumbens in rodents71 play important roles in motor control and learning. Therefore, it is possible that diminished dopamine release plays a role in locomotor and cognitive impairment in this AD model organism; however, more studies are needed to demonstrate cause and effect.

Several previous studies of dopamine release have been published.42–44 However, to our knowledge, the only other published study to examine dopamine release in chemically treated fish was carried out by our group and involved the treatment of zebrafish with carboplatin, a cancer chemotherapy agent.42 A previous study identified synaptic vesicle alterations in neurons from frogs.72 However, this is the first study, to our knowledge, that examines dopamine release in a zebrafish model of neurodegeneration. We were easily able to resolve differences in dopamine release between treated and control fish. This work not only raises the possibility that dopamine release impairments play a role in cognitive and motor dysfunction in AD model zebrafish, but also provides an assay to screen for potential therapies.

CONCLUSION

In this study, OKA was administered to zebrafish to induce an AD-like pathophysiology. By incorporating fish in a previously published latent learning paradigm, we found that treatment with OKA induced serious impairments in learning and locomotion. Also, OKA treatment resulted in diminished dopamine release. Considering the practical advantages of zebrafish, such as increased throughput in behavioral experiments compared to rodents, lower cost, and the ease of neurochemical measurements, we believe that our study provides a promising step towards the sensitive detection of neurochemical and behavioral changes in models of AD and other neurological diseases. Moving forward, our approach will also be useful for the behavioral and neurochemical evaluation of therapeutic compounds with enhanced throughput.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Chemicals.

Okadaic Acid Na salt (OKA) was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA) and dissolved in 95% ethanol. The dissolved OKA was diluted with system water to a final concentration of 100 nM. All chemicals for preparation of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 126 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 2.4 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaHCO3, and 20 mM HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1 M NaOH) were purchased form Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and used as received. Dopamine for electrode pre- and post-calibration was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Dopamine stock solution was prepared in 0.2 M perchloric acid and diluted prior to the calibrations with aCSF (with no glucose). Ultrapure water (~18.2 MΩ cm) was used for a preparation of aCSF.

Animals and Housing.

A total of 53 (4 months old, male: female = 1:1) adult wild type zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used in this study. The experimental fish were divided into 6 groups with each group containing 8 fish. In addition, 5 stimulus fish were used. All fish were housed in the Shankel Structural Biology Center at the University of Kansas. Protocols and procedures involving zebrafish were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Kansas.

OKA Treatment.

The 9 day long treatment protocol was previously described by Nada et al.25 The OKA treated fish were exposed to a 100 nM OKA in system water. A stock solution of OKA was prepared by dissolving the OKA in 95% ethanol (EtOH) and further diluted to a final concentration of 100 nM in fish system water. For a vehicle group, an equivalent volume of 95% EtOH was added to the system water, resulting in a final concentration of 0.01% of EtOH. Last, chemically naive fish were housed in system water with no treatment. The water, with OKA (EtOH, respectively) treatment in respective tanks, was refreshed every other day. The behavioral and neurochemical studies were performed on the 10th day.

Maze Apparatus and Learning Procedure.

The maze apparatus used in this study was similar to the one designed by Gómez-Laplaza and Gerlai.45 The homemade maze was constructed using transparent Plexiglass that allowed a clear vision over the entire maze for all studied fish. The start box served as an acclimatization area and branched into 3 tunnels: a left and right tunnel that led to the goal box, and a dead-ended straight tunnel. The maze was filled with system fish water to achieve approximately 10 cm water depth. The water was kept at the same temperature as water in the housing tanks and was exchanged daily.

To assess the learning protocol, fish were grouped based on their treatment protocol (chemically naive, vehicle, and OKA treatment), and further split based on the designated training tunnel (i.e. group trained to choose right or left tunnel). The learning procedure was adapted from a study described elsewhere.46 Briefly, during the learning period, all fish from a specific group were placed into a start box and allowed to acclimatize for 30 seconds. After the acclimatization period, a divider between the start box and the rest of the maze was removed, and all fish were allowed to explore the maze without any intervention for 20 minutes. Half of the fish of each treatment protocol were allowed to explore the maze with the right tunnel closed, while the second half with the left tunnel closed. This tunnel arrangement stayed the same during the entire training protocol. The goal box was kept empty during the learning session to ensure no stimulation and/or reinforcement for the fish. Such a training trial was carried out daily for 9 consecutive days and occurred at randomly selected times during the day. No video record was taken during the training period.

The learning period and the OKA treatment protocol were synchronized and concluded by a probe trial (day 10) to evaluate the zebrafish memory and learning. During the probe trial, only a single experimental fish was placed into the start box. After the acclimatization time, the experimental fish was released into the maze. Importantly, both left and right tunnels were open during the probe trial. In addition, 5 stimulus fish were placed into a newly created compartment in the reward box. We hypothesized that the natural need for socialization49–51 will drive the motivation of zebrafish to reach the goal box. The individual zebrafish behavior in the maze was monitored for 10 min using Nikon D3500 DX camcorder. Video files were analyzed using a EthoVision XT video tracking software (Noldus, InfoTech., Wageningen, The Netherlands).

Electrochemical Measurements.

The electrochemical measurement was carried out the same day as the behavioral probe trial. The procedure to harvest the zebrafish brain was described elsewhere.43,73,74 Briefly, the examined fish was euthanized by a rapid cooling method followed by decapitation. Immediately following euthanasia, the whole brain was harvested using previously described methods and transferred to a perfusion chamber. The brain was kept viable by a continuous flow of oxygenated and pH corrected aCSF. The system was kept at a stable temperature of 28°C prior to any measurement and the brain was allowed to equilibrate in the chamber for 40 min.

Carbon-fiber working electrodes were constructed following the previously published procedure.75 Briefly, a 7 μm diameter carbon-fiber (Goodfellow Cambridge LTD, Huntingdon, UK) was aspirated into a glass capillary tube (1.2 mm outer diameter, 0.68 mm inner diameter, A-M system Inc., Carlsberg, WA, USA), and fixed in the position by sealing the glass capillary around the fiber using a heated coil puller (PE-22, Narishige Int. USA, East Meadow, NY). Next, the exposed carbon fiber was trimmed to approximately 40 μm from the end of the pulled glass capillary, and an epoxy seal was created (EPON resin 815C, EPIKURE 3234 curing agent, Miller-Stephenson, Danbury, CT, USA). The microelectrode was further cured at 100°C for 1 hour, and cleaned by soaking in ultrapure isopropanol for 30 min. To ensure electrical connection between the carbon-fiber and electrode holder, all electrodes were backfilled with 0.5 M potassium acetate, and a silver wire was inserted.

A Chem Clamp potentiostat (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN) modified to enhance the range of available gain settings was used. TarHeel CV software (M.L.A.V. Heien and R.M. Wightman, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) with data acquisition PCI 6711 multifunction I/O board (National Instruments, Austin, TX) was used to collect and analyze all data. The traditional dopamine waveform (from −0.4 to 1.3 and back to −0.4 V at 400 V/s) was applied every 100 ms (i.e. 10 Hz application frequency). Dopamine release was evoked by multiple stimulus pulses (25 pulses, 2 ms, 350 μA) applied by stimulus electrode (two tungsten electrodes positioned 200 μm apart). The stimulus pulses were applied to the dorsal nucleus of the ventral telencephalon with a 10 min recovery time between each stimulation.
