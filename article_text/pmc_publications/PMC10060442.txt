Structured Abstract

INTRODUCTION

As Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers rapidly develop, tools are needed that accurately and effectively communicate risk of AD dementia.

METHODS:

We analyzed longitudinal data from over 10,000 cognitively unimpaired older adults. Five-year risk of AD dementia was modeled using survival analysis.

RESULTS:

A demographic model was developed and validated on independent data with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for 5-year prediction of AD dementia of 0.79. Clinical and cognitive variables (AUC=0.79), and APOE genotype (AUC=0.76) were added to the demographic model. We then incorporated the risk computed from the demographic model with hazard ratios computed from independent data for amyloid PET status and MRI hippocampal volume (AUC=0.84), and for plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 (AUC=0.82).

DISCUSSION:

An adaptive tool was developed and validated to compute absolute risks of AD dementia. This approach allows for improved accuracy and communication of AD risk among cognitively unimpaired older adults.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative brain disease with a long preclinical phase prior to cognitive changes signifying the onset of AD dementia. Subsequently, AD clinical trials increasingly focus on slowing or preventing symptom onset, and biomarkers are currently used for enrollment into clinical trials. The recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accelerated approval of aducanumab based on the drug’s ability to reduce amyloid deposition as visualized by amyloid PET suggests that understanding risk of AD dementia is likely to become increasingly relevant, and modeling tools that accurately estimate risk of dementia are needed to facilitate communication of AD dementia risk. Ideally, a tool to estimate and communicate AD dementia risk should estimate a personalized absolute risk of AD dementia both before and after incorporation of biomarker results to enable individuals to see how biomarkers affect baseline risk, and be adaptable for incorporation of the latest biomarker risk data [1, 2]. As a central component of a clinical trial to return Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and either imaging biomarkers (amyloid PET, and MRI hippocampal volumes) or plasma biomarkers (plasma Aβ42/Aβ40) to cognitively unimpaired older adults and determine the impact of risk disclosure on cognitive and psychosocial outcomes, we sought an adaptive tool to compute both a baseline and biomarker-adjusted absolute risk of AD dementia.

Many models for the estimation of dementia risk have been developed. A recent systematic review described 39 models for prospective prediction of dementia among adults aged 65 or older [3], and five additional models have been published recently [4–8]. Despite the large number of models that included a variety of approaches and variables, none estimated both a baseline absolute risk of dementia and a biomarker-adjusted absolute risk of dementia.

Building on the existing dementia risk models, we developed a modeling framework to compute both a baseline absolute risk of AD dementia and a biomarker-adjusted absolute risk of AD dementia (Figure 1). First, we computed a model for risk of AD dementia using only widely available demographic factors. We then used the Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimator (iCARE), a statistical tool developed for computation of absolute risk of cancer [9–12], to estimate adjusted risk of AD dementia when different biomarkers are incorporated. This approach has three major benefits. First, our modeling approach is adaptable, enabling new biomarkers or data to be incorporated as new evidence emerges. This is essential given the many biomarkers currently under investigation. Second, our approach calculates absolute 5-year risk estimates. Absolute risk is an evidence based communication practice that enhances individual ability to understand the meaning of risk information [1]. Importantly, evidence suggests that individuals are especially interested in learning how biomarkers affect their personal risk of developing AD dementia [13, 14]. Lastly, our approach enables a direct comparison of how baseline risk changes once biomarkers are added.

2. Methods

Five models for AD dementia were developed: demographic, clinical/cognitive, APOE genotype, imaging biomarker (both amyloid PET and hippocampal volume by MRI), and plasma biomarker (Aβ42/Aβ40). Model design and reporting used Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) [15]. Detailed methods are in the Supplementary Methods.

2.1 Data

Two different sources of data were used: the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), including a subset of individuals from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC), and two biomarker data sets from the Knight ADRC: an imaging biomarker dataset and a plasma biomarker dataset. The three datasets that include Knight ADRC participants have overlapping participants, but the observation windows differ. The NACC data start at the time of the first clinical assessment, and the biomarker datasets start at the time of the individual biomarker measurement (amyloid PET scan for the imaging data, and time of blood collection for the plasma dataset). Each analysis with data from the Knight ADRC includes only one of these datasets. All participants were age 65 or older, cognitively unimpaired (Clinical Dementia Rating® [CDR®] of 0) [16] at baseline, and followed for at least six months.

2.2 Model Development

Five models were developed based on the available data and the clinically-oriented goal of having an imaging biomarker model and a separate plasma biomarker model with absolute risk estimates directly comparable to a demographic model. Variable selection and model estimation for the demographic and clinical/cognitive models were based on the NACC data. The APOE, imaging, and plasma models were developed using the Knight ADRC data.

2.2.1 Outcome variables:

AD dementia was defined as when a participant had both a clinical diagnosis of AD dementia and CDR®&gt;0 [16]. The time to outcome was the time from the first assessment to the first diagnosis of AD dementia or death (coded as an alternate event). Participants who did not have AD dementia at their last study visit (including those with CDR®&gt;0) were considered right censored.

2.2.2 Variable selection for demographic model and clinical/cognitive model:

Individual variables from dementia models were identified from a 2019 systematic review [3], and from five additional models that have been published since then [4–8]. The selection process is diagrammed in Supplementary Figure S1, a description of the variable selection and categorization process is in Supplementary Results, and the variables considered are in Supplementary Table S1.

2.2.3 Biomarkers:

Four biomarkers were evaluated: APOE genotype, amyloid PET, MRI hippocampal volume and plasma Aβ42/Aβ40.

APOE genotype:

APOE was genotyped [17] and coded as the number of APOE ε4 alleles (the APOE allele that confers highest risk for AD dementia) and the number of APOE ε2 alleles (the APOE allele that is associated with a lower risk of AD dementia, relative to the most common APOE ε3 allele). A categorical model with a reference of ε3ε3 was statistically compared to the additive model for the APOE alleles using a likelihood ratio test and was not found to be superior (p=0.60).

Amyloid PET:

Participants received a bolus injection of either C Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) [18] or 18F AV45 (Florbetapir) [19]. Data were processed with an in-house pipeline [20, 21]. Amyloid PET positivity was defined with the established cutoffs of &gt;1.42 for PiB and &gt;1.22 for AV45 [20, 22].

MRI hippocampal volume:

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was processed [19, 23] and the total hippocampal volume, a non-specific measurement of neurodegeneration associated with increased risk of AD dementia, was dichotomized with a cutoff of 7 cm3. This cutoff was derived by maximizing sensitivity and specificity of 5-year AD dementia prediction, described in the supplementary methods.

Plasma amyloid:

Plasma amyloid Aβ42/Aβ40 concentration ratio, a plasma marker that predicts brain amyloid status based on high concordance with qualitative and quantitative amyloid PET results, was measured in biobanked samples [21, 24–27] and dichotomized as ≥0.102 denoting a higher risk for AD dementia or &lt;0.102 denoting a lower risk for AD dementia. This cutoff was derived by maximizing sensitivity and specificity of 5-year AD dementia prediction, described in the supplementary methods.

2.2.4 Demographic, APOE genotype and clinical/cognitive model estimation:

Risk of AD dementia was computed using cause-specific Cox modeling with death as a competing event. This approach allows for clear interpretation of the predictive ability of the risk factors. Statistical models were computed using the riskRegression package [28] in Rstudio [29] running R version 4.0.4 [30]. The riskRegression package includes established procedures for estimation of absolute risk of an event based on inverse of the probability of censoring weights [31, 32]. Candidate variables were all included in a model, and then the variables with the least statistically significant association with AD dementia were individually removed in a reverse stepwise manner until all were statistically associated with AD dementia. Forward stepwise modeling was then used to verify robustness of parameterization: the model started with most statistically significant candidate variable and then variables were added with decreasing statistical significance until all remaining variables had a p-value greater than the statistical cutoff when added to the model. P&lt;0.01 was used as a statistical cutoff in order to reduce over-fitting.

The APOE genotype model was developed by adding the APOE genotype to the demographic model. In the demographic and APOE genotype models, all two-way interactions for the final model variables were included in the model and then removed in the same stepwise manner. Individuals with missing variables from the clinical/cognitive model were not included in development or estimation of the clinical/cognitive model.

2.2.5 Imaging and plasma biomarker model estimation:

Construction of the biomarker models required combining data from different sources to estimate absolute risk. This was accomplished with a modeling tool called the Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimator (iCARE), which combines a model for relative risk, an age-specific disease incidence rate and the distribution of covariates for the population of interest to estimate absolute risk [9, 10]. This methodology has been used in computation of risk for breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer [11, 12].

For the imaging and plasma biomarker models, the hazard ratios for AD dementia, adjusted for the variables in the demographic model, were computed using cause-specific Cox modeling with death as a competing event, using the same R functions detailed above. For each biomarker model, we tested all two-way interactions between the included biomarkers and the demographic model variables for statistical significance. We used multinomial logistic regression to derive age-specific imaging distribution for the four combinations of the dichotomized MRI hippocampal volume and amyloid PET. We used logistic regression to derive age and APOE-specific distribution of plasma Aβ 42/40.

The 5-year absolute risk of AD dementia estimated using the iCARE function was based on (1) the estimated hazard ratios for AD dementia from the cause-specific Cox model, (2) the biomarker distributions, (3) estimated incidence of AD dementia from the demographic model (adjusted for the covariates), and (4) estimated mortality from the demographic model (adjusted for covariates). Standard errors and confidence intervals for the absolute risk estimates were computed using bootstrapping. To adjust for an observed participation bias in the imaging biomarker data, the demographic model was adjusted to include a covariate for receiving an MRI within a year of a cognitively normal evaluation, as detailed in the supplementary methods.

2.3 Model validation:

Discrimination was evaluated by computing the area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), equivalent to concordance statistics (C-statistic) using the Score function of the riskRegression package [28]. Calibration was evaluated by computing scaled Brier scores [33] and by comparing observed and expected 5-year incident AD within covariate groupings [34].

The demographic model and the APOE genotype model were statistically validated on both an independent data set, the non-overlapping sub-cohort of NACC from the Knight ADRC, and on the NACC data used for development. The imaging biomarker and plasma biomarker models were therefore validated only on the data used for their construction because we did not have access to additional datasets.

For further evaluation of our models, we compared them to dementia prediction models that were recently evaluated across countries [35]: the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) risk score [36]; the Aging, Cognition and Dementia (AgeCoDe) model [37]; the Australian National University Alzheimer’s Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI) [38, 39]; the Brief Dementia Screening Indicator (BDSI) [40]; and the Rotterdam Study Basic Dementia Risk Model (BDRM) [6]. We computed risk estimates for these models in the NACC data using and compared them the models that can be computed using NACC data: age-only model, demographic model, and clinical/cognitive model.

3. Results

The baseline characteristics of the participants included in each dataset are summarized in Table 1, stratified by the outcome that ends their observation period: censored (alive without AD dementia), AD dementia, and deceased without AD dementia. Overall, more than 56,000 person-years were observed. The datasets have limited ethnic and racial diversity. Black or African American participants represent 14% of NACC data, 18% of Knight ADRC NACC data, 15% of Knight ADRC imaging data, and 9% of Knight ADRC plasma data. Hispanic or Latino participants represent 5% of the NACC sample, but are not represented in the Knight ADRC datasets. Cross-frequencies for gender and age are given in Supplemental Table S2. The demographic model served as a base model for the other models: i.e. all variables from the demographic model were included in the other models, and the presented results from the other models are adjusted for these variables.

3.1 Demographic model:

Five variables were included in the demographic model after stepwise modeling: age (years from 65), age2, gender, parental history of AD dementia, and education beyond high school (Table 2). Two-way interactions between these variables were tested and were not statistically significant. Age is the factor most strongly associated with AD dementia, and it is not linearly associated with AD dementia [6]. To allow for non-linearity and improve parameter interpretation, age was coded in 5-year bins (65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, and ≥85). Of note, although risk of AD dementia increases with increasing age, the rate of increase declines over time. For example, the hazard ratio (HR) comparing ages 70–74 to 65–69 is 1.55 whereas the HR comparing ages 80–84 to 75–79 is 1.30. Women had significantly lower risk of developing AD dementia than men. Individuals with a parental history of AD dementia had a higher risk of AD dementia compared to those without a parental history, and individuals with education beyond high school had lower risk of AD dementia than those with fewer years of education. Self-identified race and ethnicity was not statistically associated with AD dementia after adjusting for age.

3.2 Clinical/Cognitive Model:

Stepwise modeling in the NACC training data identified an additional 9 clinical and cognitive variables associated with AD dementia (Table 2). Interpretation of these results is given in the Supplementary Results.

3.3 APOE, imaging, and plasma models:

The associations between AD dementia and the biomarkers are given in Table 2, and AD dementia incidence curves stratified by the biomarkers are shown in Figure 2. Two-way interactions between the biomarkers and the variables from the demographic model were tested and were not statistically significant. In the NACC data, cognitively normal participants who opted to receive a research MRI were healthier than cognitively normal participants who did not both in terms of risk for AD dementia (HR= 0.67 95% CI 0.58–0.77) and death (HR=0.59, 95% CI 0.47–0.73), supporting the hypothesis of a selection bias in cognitively normal participants with imaging data. This correction was incorporated into the baseline risk estimate for the imaging model prior to adjustment for the imaging biomarkers. As has been shown before [41], the strong association between APOE ε4 and AD dementia is eliminated after adjusting for the imaging biomarkers, and therefore is not included in the model. For the imaging and plasma biomarker models, the biomarker hazard ratios and observed biomarker distributions were combined with biomarker estimated absolute risk of AD dementia to compute a 5-year absolute risk of AD dementia.

3.4 Model validation:

All models were validated on their training datasets. The demographic, clinical/cognitive and APOE genotype models were also validated on the Knight ADRC NACC data, an independent dataset not used for estimation of any model parameters. For each model, Table 3 shows the estimation of model discrimination based on 5-year AD dementia prediction in the available datasets, and Supplemental Figure S2 shows the ROC curves for the 5-year AD dementia prediction. The discrimination of each of the models is statistically better than chance (AUC=0.5). However, the models do not statistically differ from one another with the exception of the AUCs measured in the NACC data. The Brier scores are well below the null hypothesis value of 0.25 and are further decreased in the biomarker models, indicating improved accuracy of the 5-year predictions.

A comparison of the demographic, clinical/cognitive, and APOE genotype models to other published models is in Supplementary Table S3. In a subset of N=4,720 individuals from the NACC training dataset without missing data for any model, the demographic model had a statistically higher AUC (0.70, 95%CI 0.68–0.72) than ANU-ADRI (AUC=0.68, 95% CI 0.65–0.70), and CADIE (AUC= 0.54, 95% CI 0.51–0.57). The AUCs of the APOE (0.72, 95% CI 0.70–0.75) and clinical/cognitive models (0.78, 0.76–0.8) had statistically higher AUCs than AgeCoDe (0.67, 95% CI 0.64–0.69), BDRM (AUC=0.70, 95% CI 0.68–0.73), BDSI (AUC=0.70, 95% CI 0.67–0.72), ANU-ADRI and CADIE. No statistical differences between models were seen in the Knight ADRC NACC validation data. Further discussion of these comparisons is in Supplementary Results.

3.6 An online calculator for dissemination of AD Dementia risk models:

To maximize utility of the AD dementia risk models, an online calculator was developed that allows for estimation of 5-year risk of AD dementia based on the model covariates (AlzheimerDementiaCalculator.wustl.edu [*to be live at time of publication*] Figure 3). The website uses age-specific linear estimates to compute both the demographic model risk and biomarker adjusted risks. Risk at 5 years was chosen based on the combination of clinical relevance and observed follow-up for the biomarkers, and is presented as absolute rather than relative risk [1]. The online calculator uses simple language and pictographs to maximize understanding of the estimated risk, and to encourage use in clinical settings.

4. Discussion

A dynamic modeling framework was developed for computation of AD dementia risk that estimates a baseline absolute 5-year risk of developing AD dementia based on demographics and adjusted absolute risks incorporating biomarkers and other factors. This framework is designed to evolve and adapt for ongoing adjustment of biomarkers used and their associations with AD dementia. By combining the absolute risk estimations with best practices for communication of risk, we are using this tool to communicate AD dementia risk in individuals who are interested in learning their biomarker status in a research setting. We tested and validated the approach for a baseline risk, including age and variables typically stable in older adulthood (educational attainment and parental history of AD dementia), and four adjusted models (clinical/cognitive variables, APOE genotype, imaging biomarkers and plasma biomarkers), and developed an online tool for dissemination of the AD dementia risk calculators. This is based on statistical methodology for synthesizing risk information from multiple sources into computation of absolute risk [9, 10], and represents the first application of this methodology to neurological or psychiatric disease.

The flexibility of the modeling structure is not only amenable to the changing science of AD biomarkers, it also allows for model improvement based on issues identified from model application and validation in diverse clinical, research and community settings. Indeed, we view the statistical models presented here as the first step in an ongoing effort to improve both the validity of the risk estimations and the quality of communication tools to assist research and clinical decision making based on AD risk estimates. Importantly, all of the data used for model development and validation in this study are from ADRCs in the US, where participants are older adults with the means, interest, and access to participate in longitudinal AD research. Although we identified and adjusted for several demographic factors related to AD dementia, it is likely that unmeasured bias contributes to our models. To identify this bias, we must leverage data from independent and diverse sources.

We validated the demographic model, clinical/cognitive model and APOE model on independent data. Because of the limited amount of available biomarker data in longitudinal samples, neither the imaging biomarker model nor the plasma biomarker models were validated on independent data, and they therefore require validation and evaluation in independent samples at the earliest opportunity. Fortunately, efforts are underway for expanding and harmonizing research imaging measurements [46], and for testing of banked plasma samples for both Aβ and other AD-related biomarkers. In addition, because the models were constructed using data from older adults with the means, interest, and access to participate in longitudinal AD research at ADRCs in the US, validation of all models on more representative and diverse populations is required. It is especially important to evaluate validity across underrepresented racial and ethnic cohorts.

Our individual models replicate the finding that age is the strongest risk factor for AD dementia. In addition, the demographic model confirms the increased risk of AD dementia associated with a parental history of AD dementia and lower educational attainment. In contrast to the fact that nearly two-thirds of Americans with AD dementia are women [47], we found that men have a higher risk for AD dementia than women. Using the dementia incidence models identified for our covariate selection process, we investigated the literature on the association between gender and AD incidence and found it mixed. Of the 29 models that reported and quantified the association between dementia and gender, three reported increased risk in women [4, 48, 49], five reported increased risk in men [37, 46, 50–52], and 21 found no statistically significant association between gender and dementia [5, 40, 53–70].

Overall, the individual models demonstrate good accuracy and discrimination. However, many of our statistical comparisons between the models do not show that adding demographics and biomarkers improve prediction over a model with only age. Because the model with age only has relatively high discrimination as measured by AUC, it is not surprising that adding variables do not statistically improve the AUC; increase in the AUC depends on the strength of the baseline model [71, 72]. In addition, the fact that few participants in either sample developed AD dementia within 5 years of the biomarker measurement (26 in the imaging sample and 40 in the plasma sample) contributes to wide confidence intervals for these statistics. When deciding the utility of a risk model, the purpose of the model comes into play strongly. We developed these models to aid communication, focused on the setting where a biomarker test was conducted and the goal is to communicate the impact the biomarker test has on AD dementia risk. In this situation, it is less important to demonstrate clear improvement in discrimination between a model with and without a biomarker than if we were to use the model to determine the utility of adding a clinical test to an evaluation for AD dementia.

As in all survival analysis prediction models, our model fit is dependent on our selection of 5-years for the prediction of AD risk. However, biomarkers exert their effects on varying time scales. Specifically, amyloid deposition has been shown to occur as much as 20 years before onset of AD dementia and therefore a 5-year timeframe for development of AD dementia may be too short to fully leverage the predictive ability of an amyloid-related biomarker. In contrast, neurodegeneration is thought to be proximal to the development of AD dementia and therefore MRI hippocampal volume as a measure of neurodegeneration is more strongly predictive of 5-year AD dementia than amyloid biomarkers. This illustrates the importance of our model, which takes into account the interaction of multiple biomarkers. That is, incorporating MRI hippocampal volume with amyloid positivity provides a more accurate 5-year risk estimate than amyloid positivity alone. Notably, of the 79 individuals with a positive amyloid PET scan who maintained their hippocampal volume (&gt;7cm3), only 4% developed AD dementia by 5 years. This is in contrast to the individuals with decreased hippocampal volume in addition to the positive PET scan where 26% of the 50 developed AD dementia by 5 years. These results are similar to previously published estimates of AD incidence based on biomarker status [7, 8]. We selected 5-years as the outcome time point to balance clinical utility with available longitudinal data from research studies, but the selection of outcome time in the future should be evaluated based on both the intended application and the characteristics of the data available.

Regardless of the statistical properties of a risk model, practical implementation requires a user-friendly interface to convey risk information in a meaningful and comprehensible way. To incorporate best practices for health communication, the online calculator gives absolute rather than relative risk, uses simple language and pictographs [1]. Further, the website was designed to allow for updates to the current models and incorporation of new models.

In light of the rapidly changing landscape in diagnosis and treatment of AD dementia, and strong interest among individuals in knowing their risk of developing AD dementia [13, 14, 73–77], it is essential to develop tools to accurately compute and clearly communicate risk of AD dementia, and to design them in a way that can adapt to mirror the changing understanding of AD biomarkers. In addition, we anticipate that both biomarkers and other factors associated with AD dementia will be identified using novel scientific and statistical methodology [78]. The models presented here compute absolute rather than relative risk of AD dementia, clearly present this risk, and are designed using a flexible framework for incorporation of new AD risk factors or biomarkers as evidence emerges. This lays the foundation for improved computation and communication of AD dementia risk.

Research in Context

Systematic review:

We reviewed the literature using previously published systematic reviews and updated literature searches using PubMed, seeking a modeling framework to enable communication of Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarker tests using best practices for risk communication. Existing models for computing risk of AD dementia were summarized and cited.

Interpretation:

We developed and validated a modeling framework for estimating absolute risk of AD dementia before and after incorporation of AD biomarker results to aid communication of results.

Future directions:

This manuscript proposes a framework for modeling AD dementia risk to improve communication of risk and integration of biomarker tests into communication. Future research may include application and validation in diverse research and clinical populations, and adaptability of this framework to additional biomarker tests and clinical settings.
