Background:

Family caregivers of people living with dementia have high caregiver strain and poor health consequences. Limited research exists on Lewy body dementia (LBD) caregivers and their specific comorbidities. This study aimed to (1) identify the prevalence of self-reported comorbidities among LBD caregivers and (2) contextualize these findings with historical data on caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer disease and associated disorders (ADADs).

Methods:

In a national, online survey, LBD family caregivers completed the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire and we compared these findings with extant literature on ADAD caregiver comorbidities.

Results:

Among 217 LBD caregivers, 84.3% were female, 39.1% were 64 years old or younger, and 66.8% had &gt; 2 years of caregiving experience. Caregivers self-identified as current (83.9%) or former (16.1%) caregivers. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (38.2%), depression (35.0%), back pain (34.1%), and arthritis (27.7%). LBD caregivers, particularly younger caregivers, had a higher prevalence of depression compared with ADAD caregivers and older adult populations, and back pain prevalence nearly equivalent to spinal cord injury caregivers.

Conclusions:

Our study is the first to illustrate and contextualize specific comorbidities among LBD caregivers. Understanding the causality and impact of these conditions will be critical in designing effective interventions to improve the lives of families affected by LBD.

pmcFamily caregivers are essential providers for older adults with chronic conditions, with estimated indirect costs of 522 billion US$.1 Lewy body dementia (LBD), comprising Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), is the second most common major neurocognitive disorder, yet up to 50% of cases may be undiagnosed.2,3 Distinct from other conditions, deterioration in cognitive, motor, and neuropsychiatric domains in people with LBD leads to heavy reliance on family caregivers, henceforth referred to as “caregivers.” Caregiver strain is an independent predictor of adverse health outcomes in patients and caregivers. Strain is higher in LBD caregivers than in caregivers of individuals with non-LBD Alzheimer disease and associated disorders (ADADs).4–6 In addition, higher levels of patient’s physical and psychological impairment, lifestyle disruptions from caregiving demands, and caregiving frequency and intensity independently contribute to caregiver health outcomes.5,7

No LBD-specific caregiver interventions exist, and most interventions designed for ADAD caregivers lack efficacy.4 Given the increasing prevalence and unique physical and emotional demands of LBD caregivers, rigorously designed and tested interventions are necessary, which consider specific health risks and characteristics of LBD caregivers.7 The hallmark cognitive and motor fluctuations of LBD vary between and within days, such that attention, alertness, mobility, and psychotic symptoms can vary significantly, and dependence on caregivers for transfers, fall prevention, reorientation, and de-escalation can fluctuate widely and unpredictably. Furthermore, dementia-related sleep disturbance can be profound and lead to caregivers’ sleep disruption resulting in depression and hypertension.6,8 Increasing motor and cognitive severity are each associated with worsening caregiver mental health and adverse health outcomes.6,9,10 We hypothesized that depression, arthritis, and back pain may be elevated because of the unique motor, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric symptoms of LBD and accompanying caregiving burden. We aimed to assess the self-reported prevalence and severity of comorbidities among LBD caregivers to inform the development of future caregiver interventions. We sought to compare LBD caregiver comorbidity prevalence with data from historical ADAD caregivers and general population cohorts.

METHODS

Study Design

We conducted a cross-sectional, online survey analyzing the comorbidities of current and past LBD family caregivers between November 2020 and April 2021. For historical comparisons, we searched PubMed in January 2022 for English-language publications in the past 25 years using the search terms: “dementia” AND “comorbidity” or “comorbidities” or “chronic disease” AND “caregiver” or “care partner” or “carer.”

Ethical Considerations

The Rush University Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved this study, including the use of an e-consent process. All potential participants read through the electronic consent and were then presented with a 4-item capacity assessment. Participants had to correctly answer all 4 questions about study goals, potential risks and benefits, and alternatives to electronically sign the consent form and proceed to the survey. Appendix A, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/WAD/A420 contains the e-consent form, capacity assessment, and survey.

Study Population

In partnership with the Lewy Body Dementia Association and the Parkinson Foundation, we disseminated online survey links through disease-specific and foundation-specific Facebook groups, email lists, and e-newsletters. This link was shared locally at our Movement Disorders Center and through regional LBD caregiver support groups.

Inclusion criteria were the following: 21 years or older, English speaking, and identifying as a family caregiver (defined as cohabitating with or spending ≥ 10 hours weekly on unpaid caregiving duties) for someone diagnosed with LBD. Individuals were excluded if they did not have the capacity to consent, were personally diagnosed with LBD, or did not qualify as caregivers. Given the challenging nomenclature and frequent misdiagnoses associated with PDD, DLB, and LBD, we did not ask for the specific diagnosis of the care recipient.

Assessments

Using a structured online survey, participants indicated their sex, age, race, and ethnicity, if they were currently caregiving or if they identified as a former caregiver, and in the latter case, whether their care recipient was alive or deceased. Participants completed the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire.11 This validated instrument assessed the presence of 16 categories of comorbidities. If present, the respondent indicates whether the condition necessitates treatment and limits any activities.

Data Management and Statistical Analyses

The online survey was built in REDCap, a secure, password-protected platform12 and deidentified data exported to Stata 15. To avoid duplicate entries, we did not allow respondents to return to a partially completed survey or to complete multiple surveys from the same internet protocol address. We defined the screening cohort as individuals who clicked on the survey link and generated a study identification number. Enrolled participants were those who completed the e-consent process.

For the cross-sectional analysis, categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables were assessed for normality and summarized as mean and SD or median and interquartile range, as appropriate. It was possible for participants to indicate that they had received treatment for a comorbidity without indicating that they had the condition. Therefore, we categorized a positive response to any of the 3 response options (ie, “I have this,” “I receive treatment for this,” and “This limits my activities”) as the presence of the comorbidity. We used only a positive response to “This limits my activities” as an indication of severity. In secondary analyses, we examined the prevalence of each comorbidity among current caregivers by age group (18 to 44 y, 45 to 54 y, 55 to 64 y, 65 to 74 y, 75 to 84 y, and 85 y or older).

RESULTS

LBD Online Survey Cohort

We screened 364 participants, 107 of whom did not complete the capacity and e-consent process and 40 who were excluded (either identified as care recipients or did not meet the inclusion criteria as caregivers), yielding a cohort of 217. As demonstrated in Table 1, 84.3% of the caregivers were female, with 64.5% between the ages of 55 and 74 years old. Most identified as White and 3.2% as Hispanic/Latinx. Current caregivers comprised 83.9% of the cohort. Among the former caregivers, 25 (73.5%) indicated that their care recipients were deceased.

Table 2 lists the cumulative prevalence, prevalence of receiving treatment, and prevalence of activity limitation for each comorbidity. The most frequently reported conditions were hypertension (38.2%), depression (35%), back pain (34.1%), degenerative or osteoarthritis (27.7%), cardiovascular disease (11.5%), and diabetes (7.8%). The most common “other conditions” listed included other chronic pain and musculoskeletal issues (n=11), thyroid or parathyroid disease (n=6), other autoimmune disease (n=8), hyperlipidemia (n=4), anxiety (n=4), and headache/migraine (n=2). LBD caregivers had a median of 2 comorbidities each (interquartile range 1 to 4).

Table 3 demonstrates the prevalence of each comorbidity among current caregivers only (n=182, highlighted in light gray) and stratified prevalence by age category. Age categories with a greater prevalence than the total current cohort are highlighted in darker gray to denote the age of caregivers most likely to report each condition. The most common comorbidities did not change when the cohort was limited to current caregivers, although the prevalence of each condition slightly increased. Although certain expected comorbidities increased in prevalence in an age-dependent manner (eg, hypertension and heart disease), depression, back pain, and constipation were more frequent in younger LBD caregivers.

Prior Literature on ADAD Caregiver Comorbidities

After excluding publications that were unrelated, duplicate, non-English, patient focused rather than caregiver focused, or lacking condition-level prevalence data, we identified 9 relevant studies. We present the findings of prior ADAD cohorts in comparison with the LBD online survey cohort and an epidemiologic review of comorbidities in over 25 million US Medicare beneficiaries, by comorbidity, in Table 4.15

Hypertension

Chu et al13 compared cross-sectional survey data of 849 ADAD spouses and 25,707 controls in the Medicare Expenditure Panel Survey 2003-2017, including self-reported comorbidities and mental health. Self-reported hypertension was higher in the ADAD spousal caregivers than in controls (29.4% vs. 23.0%, P=0.03), and still higher in our LBD caregivers (38.2%).

Suehs et al10 compared household members (HHMs) of individuals with ADADs versus matched controls ≥ 65 years enrolled in the Humana Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug. Comorbidities were determined based on diagnostic codes in administrative claims over a 36-month observation period. The cumulative prevalence of hypertension in both ADAD caregivers and matched controls was higher (87.5% vs. 81.8%, P &lt;0.01) than in either the Chu cohort or our LBD caregiver cohort.

Shaw et al14 conducted longitudinal home assessments to determine whether caregiving for those with Alzheimer disease (AD) accelerates the caregiver’s risk for hypertension. Caregivers consisted of 144 spouses of AD patients and 47 married couple controls. A visiting nurse regularly assessed the participants’ morning home blood pressure for 2 to 6 years. Although all participants were normotensive at study entry, AD caregivers met criteria for borderline hypertension nearly 1 year earlier than the controls.

Salive15 conducted an analysis of the US Medicare fee-for-service claims database among adults 65 years or older to identify the prevalence of multimorbidity in the older adult population. In this population of over 25 million individuals, 59.6% of Medicare beneficiaries had at least 1 hypertension-related service or treatment-based claim.

Depression

As a proxy measure of depression, Chu et al13 found that 46.0% of ADAD spouses and 37.1% of controls rated their mental health as either fair or poor (P &lt;0.01) and Suehs et al[10] reported that ADAD caregivers had a higher prevalence of mood disorders compared with controls (24.2% vs. 15.9%, P&lt;0.001). Using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to measure depression in both DLB and AD caregivers, Liu and colleagues found that DLB caregivers scored worse than AD caregivers (PHQ-9: 3.69 ± 3.79 vs. 1.62 ± 2.06, P&lt;0.001).

Luchsinger et al16 conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the Northern Manhattan Caregiver Intervention Project, focused on Hispanic caregivers of persons with dementia (primarily AD). By Geriatric Depression Scale criteria, 34.8% of the caregivers had mild and 16.7% had severe depression; however, only 16.8% self-reported depression. In our LBD cohort, 35.1% reported depression, increasing to 45.5% and 54.5% among 18 to 44 and 45 to 54 year olds, respectively, compared with 10.7% of Medicare beneficiaries who had a depression-associated claim.15

Back Pain and Osteoarthritis

Pajeemas et al evaluated the prevalence and risk factors associated with low back pain among family caregivers of dependent individuals with spinal cord injuries.17 The prevalence of low back pain was 64.6% compared with 34.1% of all LBD caregivers and 45.5% of current LBD caregivers ≤54 years. Risk factors for low back pain in spinal cord injury caregivers included age younger than 60 years, older than 8 hours of daily caregiving, and female sex. Suehs et al10 found that ADAD HHMs had a higher prevalence of both osteoarthritis (56.4% in ADAD HHMs vs. 49.9% in controls, P &lt; 0.01) and aggregated pain conditions (89.7% vs. 81.6%, respectively, P&lt;0.01) during the 36-month study period. By comparison, 27.7% of LBD caregivers self-reported osteoarthritis, and the claim-based prevalence in the general older adult population is 22.2%.15

Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes

von Känel et al18 computed the Framingham Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Risk Score in ADAD caregivers compared with noncaregiving controls. The CHD Risk Score includes age, hyperlipidemia, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking status. ADAD caregivers had a 1.6% greater 10-year CHD risk than noncaregiver controls with a medium effect size. In a study of 126 AD caregivers, Schwartz et al8 found that 80.5% and 61.7% had objective findings of hypertension and dyslipidemia, respectively, and 19.2% of caregivers met objective criteria for type 2 diabetes, whereas only 11.9% self-reported diabetes or diabetic medication use. By contrast, 11.5% and 7.8% of our LBD caregivers self-reported cardiovascular disease and diabetes, respectively, whereas 34.5% and 26.9% of Medicare beneficiaries have claims for each condition.

DISCUSSION

This is the first study to examine self-reported comorbidities of LBD family caregivers and compare them with previously studied ADAD caregivers and older adult populations. Hypertension, depression, back pain, arthritis, and heart disease were the most commonly reported conditions in LBD family caregivers. Younger caregivers, in particular, commonly reported depression and back pain. Although these comorbidities mirror those of ADAD caregivers, several points require further exploration.

Since multimorbidity increases with age, study populations skewed toward or limited to older adults will share a higher prevalence of common comorbidities, as seen in most ADAD caregiver studies.15 LBD largely affects older adults. The mean age at DLB diagnosis is 76.3 years;19 although mean age at PD diagnosis is 61.6 years, the diagnosis of PDD typically occurs between 76 and 81 years.20–22 Although most LBD studies have focused on spousal caregivers, often similar in age to their loved one, 39% of our participants were 64 years or older of age, likely representing adult children or nonspousal family members. We anticipated that younger caregivers would skew our results. The US age-standardized prevalence of objectively measured hypertension increased from 21.4% among 20- to 39-year olds to 51.1% among 40- to 59-year olds and 71.8% in those 60 years or older.23 As expected, younger LBD caregivers had a lower self-reported prevalence of hypertension compared with age-standardized objectively measured prevalence, and lower than that reported in some ADAD studies (Table 4). However, the prevalence of hypertension in LBD caregivers aged 45-64 (32%) was higher than the self-reported 29.4% prevalence in an ADAD cohort where the majority of caregivers were ≥75 years. Conversely, depression does not necessarily increase with age, and a recent US study found that in the 18 to 39, 40 to 59, and 60 years or older age groups, the prevalence of depression was 9.0%, 8.5%, and 7.9%, respectively.24 Among LBD caregivers aged 18 to 44, 45 to 54, and 55 to 64, the corresponding prevalence was 45.5%, 54.5%, and 43.8%, respectively. Therefore, although comparisons with older adult referent populations contextualize our findings, the significant number of younger caregivers and their disproportionately increased prevalence of multiple comorbidities compared with age-standardized rates requires further study. Our findings may have critical policy implications for supporting diverse family caregivers.

Abundant evidence documents higher rates of and multifactorial contributors to depression among dementia caregivers.6,9,25 Here, 35.1% of all LBD caregivers reported depression—more than triple the rate seen in general Medicare beneficiaries—rising to 54.5% in the 45- to 54-year-old age group, more than double that of some ADAD cohorts.10,13,15 This aligns with Liu’s findings that LBD caregivers had more severe depression than their ADAD counterparts. The pathognomonic cognitive fluctuations and visual hallucinations of LBD, paranoia, delusions, and physical and sexual aggression may individually and synergistically strain the caregiving relationship, worsen social isolation, precipitate or exacerbate changes in caregivers’ coping strategies and mental health, and directly cause caregiver injury.2,26–30 These unique aspects of LBD—distinct from those of ADAD—may explain the higher prevalence of depression and inform future investigations and interventions.

Unlike non-LBD ADAD where cognitive or neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia predominate, up to 85% of people with LBD have parkinsonism, including falls and impaired dexterity, mobility, and transfers.2 The interplay of these domains may explain the higher prevalence of certain comorbidities such as back pain and arthritis. Our study population of largely female, older adult caregivers are faced with the responsibility of physically lifting, transferring, and adjusting the position of their parkinsonian loved ones. These activities may explain why the rates of chronic back pain mirror those of bedside and intensive care unit nurses and caregivers to dependent individuals with spinal cord injuries, rather than noncaregiving adults.17,31 These physical demands—not typically seen in ADAD caregivers until late in the disease32—combined with diminished time for self-care, exercise, and medical care33 may lead to muscular strain, failed transfers, falls, and injuries. The time course of symptom onset in relation to caregiving duration, intensity, and symptoms of the care recipient bear prospective study. In addition, it remains to be seen whether caregivers whose preexisting comorbidities preclude physical exertion institutionalize their loved ones earlier. Even among younger LBD caregivers, nearly 46% of those aged 18 to 54 reported chronic back pain compared with 21% to 28% of US adults aged 18 to 55.34 Although nurses and spinal cord injury caregivers may receive training on safe lifting and transferring practices, the slowly progressive nature of LBD may not motivate such training but illuminates an avenue for future intervention.

Although not measured in this study, sleep may contribute to certain comorbidities. ADAD caregivers frequently report fatigue and poor subjective sleep. Rowe et al35 documented worse sleep in ADAD caregivers than in noncaregivers using in-home polysomnography. LBD is notable for excessive daytime sleepiness, frequent awakenings, and rapid eye movement behavior disorder.2 LBD caregivers often assist with nighttime toileting, reorientation, and mobility assistance and may consequently have more disrupted sleep than their ADAD counterparts. Insufficient sleep may lead to metabolic and sympathetic nervous system perturbations, increased blood pressure, and higher rates of diabetes and dyslipidemia.8 Further work is needed to determine the impact of LBD symptoms on caregiver sleep and related comorbidities.

We acknowledge several limitations of this brief, cross-sectional study. We studied only self-identified LBD caregivers who were connected with either Parkinson Foundation, Lewy Body Dementia Association, or our movement disorders center. Thus, we did not capture caregivers of people without a definitive diagnosis or those who were not connected to such foundations. All comorbidities were self-reported risking healthy volunteer and recall biases. However, such misclassification would bias toward the null, with nonrespondents potentially receiving less care and support and fewer opportunities to engage in activities beyond direct caregiving. Although age was ascertained, the relationship to the care recipient was not. Future work will assess the identify of younger caregivers, including whether they have additional caregiving responsibilities (eg, childcare). This survey was administered during the SARS-CoV2 2019 pandemic, which may not be representative of caregiving demands and well-being prepandemic or postpandemic. Although we sought the existing literature on non-LBD ADAD caregiver comorbidities, the studies were highly variable and posed unique challenges to direct comparison because of the methodological differences in study design, assessment methods, and time frames. Discrepancies between self-report and claims-based diagnoses are common, with notably low concordance for arthritis, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and depression.36–38 Many studies have used cumulative, claims-based assessments, which may explain the higher rates of objectively measured comorbidities. Diagnostic codes in administrative claims data may be applied without individuals’ knowledge or may be omitted from self-reports because of disagreement or recall bias. Thus, contrasting only self-reported or claims-based comorbidities would allow for more accurate future comparisons. In addition, many people with LBD are initially diagnosed with ADADs. Therefore, the ADAD comparator groups represent a population in which LBD caregivers are likely to be admixed. Given the higher strain and comorbidities in LBD caregivers, we expect that comparing LBD caregivers with purely AD caregivers would yield even greater differences. Finally, prospective work is necessary to explore the causality of the associations identified here between LBD caregiving and comorbidities.

In summary, a national sample of LBD family caregivers reported a high prevalence of hypertension, depression, back pain, and other comorbidities, which may affect or be affected by their caregiving responsibilities. Given the increasing prevalence, unique features, and higher caregiver strain in LBD, along with the inadequate supply and high turnover rate and cost of hired caregivers, rigorous efforts are needed to identify and intervene on disease-specific and caregiver-specific factors driving adverse patient and caregiver outcomes, from both a policy perspective and a research agenda. It is imperative that we design care models and interventions with the needs of both parties in mind.
