Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible progressive neurodegenerative disorder recognized by accumulation of amyloid-plaques (APs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and eventually loss of memory. Glia maturation factor (GMF), a neuroinflammatory protein first time isolated and cloned in our laboratory plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. However, no studies have been reported on whether anti-GMF antibody administration could downregulate neuroinflammation and attenuate amyloid pathology in AD brain. We investigated the potential effect of single dose of (2 mg/kg b.wt/mouse) intravenously (iv) injected with anti-GMF antibody on cognitive function, neuroprotection, neuroinflammation and Aβ load in the brain of 9-month-old 5XFAD mice. Following four weeks of anti-GMF antibody delivery in mice, we found reduced expression of GMF, astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and microglial ionizing calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) as well as improvement in neuroinflammatory response via inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) production and amyloid pathology in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA1 region of 5XFAD mice. Correspondingly, blockade of GMF function with anti-GMF antibody improved spatial learning, memory, and long-term recognition memory in 5XFAD mice. The present study demonstrates that the immune checkpoint blockade of GMF function with anti-GMF antibody coordinates anti-inflammatory effects to attenuate neurodegeneration in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region of 5XFAD mouse brain. Further, our data suggest, that pharmacological immune neutralization of GMF is a promising neuroprotective strategy to therapeutically target neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD.

Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in a slow decline in memory and thinking abilities, deposition of beta amyloid (Aβ) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (Hardy and Higgins, 1992). Accumulation of Aβ peptide leads to the activation of resident microglia around the vicinity of Aβ deposits (Morgan, 2009) and neuroinflammation may as well promote development of Aβ plaques (Akiyama et al., 2000). Further, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to synaptic plasticity, memory impairments and neurodegeneration (Wang et al., 2005). It has been observed that up regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines may inhibit phagocytosis of Aβ, thus hindering clearance of plaque by locally present microglia. Clinically, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) mediated neuro inflammation plays an important role in AD pathology and is responsible for the dysfunction in memory, cognition and to the progression of neurodegeneration in AD (Tobinick et al., 2006; Alvarez et al., 2007). Previous studies have shown that the activation of microglia is a totally regulated event which showed more phagocytosis of Aβ in young mice, while in aged mice phagocytosis associated gene expression decreased expression of phagocytosis-associated genes decreased', and pro-inflammatory cytokine level increased (Hickman et al., 2008). Over the last several years, the role of the innate immune system in the progression of AD has been well-studied (Heneka et al., 2015). In relation to the innate-immune system, microglial cells are very important for the clearance of Aβ, which are disrupted in AD pathology (Prokop et al., 2013). The chronic activation of microglia and pro-inflammatory cytokines are suggested being crucial in AD pathogenesis. The early stage of activation of microglia probably due to the capacity of the molecular Aβ species to activate microglial cells (Kim et al., 2013) may contribute to the initial pathological process involved in the progression and initiation of disease.

Glia maturation factor (GMF), a pro-inflammatory protein with a molecular mass of (17 kDa) present in glial and some neuronal cells, was discovered, isolated and cloned for the first time in our laboratory (Lim et al., 1990; Kaplan et al., 1991; Zaheer et al., 1993). Under certain circumstances such as with Aβ deposition and oxidative stress, GMF could be over expressed and exert its lethal effects in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Ahmed et al., 2017b; Selvakumar et al., 2018a), (Selvakumar et al., 2018b).

We have previously shown that, there is an increase in the level of GMF in the neurodegenerative conditions like AD, PD, Multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Zaheer et al., 2007; Qu et al., 2011; Kempuraj et al., 2013; Thangavel et al., 2017). Over the last few decades, different approaches have been made by a large number of researchers and pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for the treatment of AD, of which vaccination immunotherapy is one of the most popular. No study has verified the potential beneficial effect of the immune neutralization effect of GMF antibody in AD.

In the present study, we hypothesized that the blockade of GMF with GMF specific antibody may afford neuroprotection in AD through improvements in neuroinflammationand behavioral impairment and Aβ pathology. The objectives of the present study were (1) to evaluate whether the anti-GMF antibody treatment attenuates neuroinflammation in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region, (2) to evaluate whether anti-GMF antibody treatment ameliorates neurodegeneration and Aβ pathology (3) to evaluate whether GMF-antibody treatment improves behavioral impairments in 5XFAD mice.

Material and Methods

Animals and Intravenous administration of anti-GMF antibody

Male 9- month old (25-35 g) 5XFAD mice was generated in our laboratory and colonies of these mice were maintained for the present studies. The C57BL/6 wild type mice (WT) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Mice were divided into three experimental groups, (1) wild type (WT) (2) 5XFAD control without anti-GMF antibody treatment (3) 5XFAD mice with anti-GMF antibody treatment (Anti-GMF IgG). Briefly, mice were anesthetized using Isoflurane and intravenously (iv) injected with single dose of (2 mg/kg b.wt/mouse) an affinity purified polyclonal anti-GMF antibody on day 0 and behavioral deficits were evaluated on week 1, week 2, week 3 and week 4. Samples were collected for biochemical and histopathological analysis as shown in schematic diagram below. Anti-GMF IgG were generated and characterized in our laboratory (Lim et al., 1989). This antibody cross reacts with human, rat and mouse species. All the experiments were conducted according to the protocol approved by the University of Missouri Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Histological Assessment and Immunofluorescence Staining

For the immunofluorescence, staining mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 0.9 % saline followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Alimov and Garmash, 1981; Ahmed et al., 2017a). Mouse brains were removed and fixed in the (PFA) for 24 h at 4 °C and thereafter, we transferred brain to 30 % sucrose at 4 °C until brain sank in sucrose. The (25 μm) sections of brain from the cortex and hippocampus were cut using a cryostat and collected. Thereafter, sections were properly washed for 20 min in 0.1 % PBS-Triton X-100 and incubated with a blocking solution containing 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated with rabbit anti-NeuN antibody (1:500, D4G40), rabbit anti-GMF (1:200, ab55063), rabbit anti-Aβ (1:250, ab1906), mouse anti-GFAP (1:500, MAB360), rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:500, D19-19741), mouse anti-MAP2 (1:250, MAB3418), overnight at 4 °C. The sections were then washed three times with 0.1% PBST, followed by incubation with specific secondary antibody goat anti-mouse/ goat anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568/488 (1:500, Thermo Scientific Rockford, IL) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were washed three times and mounted with mounting medium4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (H-1200; Vector Laboratories, Inc., CA, USA), and covered with glass cover slip. The images were captured by using laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCP SP8) with objective, 40X or 63 X oil immersions.

Preparation of Tissue Lysates and Western Blot Analysis

For the brain, tissue homogenate preparations, mice were sacrificed under deep anesthesia and brains were removed and cortex and hippocampus were rapidly micro dissected and homogenized as previously described (Ahmed et al., 2017a). Briefly, mice brain tissues were homogenized using a Teflon glass homogenizer in (RIPA) buffer (containing 20 mM Tris, 1 mM ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid, and 100 mM NaCl with protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The homogenates of cortex and hippocampus were centrifuged at 12,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Following boiling of sample at 90°C, equal amount of protein (35-50 μg) were loaded in each well and separated on 4–12 % NuPAGE Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and the separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane using wet protein transfer system (Life technologies). The PVDF membrane were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently membranes were washed and incubated with specific primary antibody at 4 °C overnight with respective primary antibodies anti-GFAP (1:500), anti-Iba1 (1:500) and anti-GMF (1:400) and membrane were again washed three times and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Then the membrane was washed and bands were visualized with ECL solution (Super Signal West Pico PLUS Substrate (Cat No. 34580; Thermo Scientific). β-actin bands were used as loading control. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ software (Version 1.49; NIH, USA). Data were used as means ± SEM.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Pro-inflammatory Cytokine

The indirect (ELISA) assays were used in the present study to assay the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in AD mice brain. The lysates obtained from cortex and hippocampal CA1 region in 5XFAD mice following four weeks of anti-GMF antibody injection were used for pro-inflammatory cytokines assay (Gan and Patel, 2013; Ahmed et al., 2016). Briefly, equal amount of (30 μg) protein samples from cortex and hippocampus were diluted up to 50 μl with coating buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C in PVC ELISA microplates (Corning). Thereafter, following 3 washes, each well was blocked with 1 % BSA (blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Then, each well was incubated with respective antibodies against TNF-α anti-rat (1:200, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), IL-1β anti-rabbit (1:250, CST) and IL-6 anti-goat (1:200, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 2 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, following three washes each well was incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, wells were washed three times and color was developed by TMB solution (3, 3, 5, 5–tetramethyl benzidine, Thermo Fisher) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was eventually stopped by using sulfuric acid and the optical density was read at 450 nm on a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Data were analyzed as percent change compared with the WT mice.

Barnes Maze

To check the spatial learning and memory in mice Barnes maze test, was performed as previously described (Lu et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2019). The maze consists of 122-cm-diameter circular metallic platform on a 1.0 m stand with 18 holes around the circumference with an escape box placed under any one of the holes. Several colored-paper of different shape were mounted on the wall around the maze as a visual cues. Barnes maze test was performed in a dark room with bright incandescent light shining directly on the surface of maze. The Barnes maze test was performed on week1 through week 4 after anti-GMF antibody injection. Mice were placed in the center of the maze, and allowed 180 s to locate the hidden escape box. If mouse failed to find and enter the escape box within the time limit, it will be slowly guided and directed to the box and allowed to remain there for 30 s before returning to the home cage. Each mouse was given one trial per week. The time take by mice to enter into the target hole were recorded. The probe trial was performed following last trial during which escape box was removed and each mouse given a 90-s period and the time spent in the target quadrant was recorded. Following each experiment maze and escape box were cleaned with 70 % ethanol and dried.

Novel Object Recognition Test

Novel object recognition test (NOR) was evaluated to check the learning (Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988; Antunes and Biala, 2012) and recognition memory (Ennaceur and Aggleton, 1994; Steckler et al., 1998). On previous day of test, all animals were given a familiarization session, in which they were allowed to freely explore the open field arena for 5 min. Next day, mice were allowed to explore the familiar arena with two similar kind of objects placed at an equal distance inside the box. After the completion of 5 min session, mice were returned to their home cage. Following this mice were exposed to familiar objects. The next day (test day), mice were allowed to explore one familiar and one novel object of different shape but similar height. The time spent in exploring each object was recorded. The Recognition Index (RI) was calculated as the percent of time spent by mice exploring the novel object divided by the total time spent exploring both objects (Anderson et al., 2008; Botton et al., 2010).

Y-maze test

The Y-maze test evaluates rodents short-term memory, locomotors activity and stereotypical behavior (Alfieri et al., 2016). The Y-maze consists of three equally spaced arms labeled with letters A, B and C. Each mouse was placed at the end of one arm for 5 minutes and allowed to move freely to enter another arm. Entries into each arm were manually recorded and alternation behavior was defined as entry into all three arms sequentially, such as ACBCABCACABCABA. We observed that mice made a total of 15 arms entries and out of 15 only 9 entries are correct alternation. The number of maximum spontaneous alternation was calculated as (actual alternations /maximum alternations) x 100.

Statistical analysis

All data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc tests, Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison analysis to determine statistically significant differences. In addition, unpaired Student’s t- test was used for two-group comparison. All the results were analyzed by GraphPad prism 7 software. Statistical significance was accepted at the 95 % confidence level.

Results

Anti-GMF-antibody injection promotes neuroprotection, inhibits GMF expression and attenuates amyloid plaque load in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region of 5XFAD mice

We evaluated whether anti-GMF antibody treatment is able to protect neurons and Aβ loads in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region of 5XFAD mice. Histological evaluations were performed after immunofluorescence staining by using MAP2 and NeuN (neuronal marker). MAP2 staining is an indicator of neurodegeneration in AD and NeuN is used to indicate survival of neurons in AD as shown in (Fig. 1a, b). We observed significantly extensive MAP2 and NeuN staining in cortical and hippocampal region in GMF-antibody treated group compared with 5XFAD mice (Fig. 1c, d). Previous reports showed that elevated level of Aβ followed by continuous changes in aggregation of Aβ trigger neuroinflammation in AD (Citron, 2000). In a previous study, we have shown the co-localization of pro-inflammatory protein GMF with Aβ in human AD brain (Ahmed et al., 2017b). Representative images of GMF and Aβ in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region are shown in (Fig. 1e, f). Quantitative analysis showed, GMF neutralizing antibody delivery significantly reduced the expression and co-localization of GMF and Aβ in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region compared with 5XFAD mice (Fig. 1g, h).

Anti-GMF- antibody injection attenuates glial activation and co-localization with Aβ in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region of 5XFAD mice

Abundance of activated microglia and astrocytes around the vicinity of Aβ is a common feature in AD pathogenesis. Representative images from the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region showed higher expression and co-localization of microglia (Iba1) with Aβ in 5XFAD mice (Fig. 2a, b). However, treatment with GMF-antibody showed significant reduction in both Iba1 expression and Aβ plaque burden compared with untreated 5XFAD mice (Fig. 2c, d). Further, we performed immunofluorescence staining of GFAP (green) and Aβ (red) in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region. Representative images show the robust expression of reactive astrocytes and its co-localization with Aβ in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region (Fig. 2e, f). Anti-GMF antibody treated mice showed significant decreased in the expression of GFAP and its co-localization with Aβ compared with untreated 5XFAD (Fig. 2g, h).

Anti-GMF-antibody injection inhibits expression of activated astroglia in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region of 5XFAD mice brain

Microglia and astrocyte activation play major role in neuroinflammation and pathogenesis of AD (Zaheer et al., 2008); (Delekate et al., 2014). Immunofluorescence staining was performed to evaluate microglia and astrocyte activation in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region of 5XFAD mice (Fig. 3a, b). We observed significantly higher expression of GFAP (green) and Iba1 (red) in the cortex and the hippocampal region of 5XFAD mice compared with WT mice. Treatment with anti-GMF antibody in 5XFAD mice significantly reduces the intensity of GFAP and Iba1 in the cortex and hippocampal CA1region compared with untreated 5XFAD mice (Fig. 3c). We further performed western blot and quantitative analysis of GFAP and Iba1in the total protein lysates obtained from the cortex and the hippocampal CA1 region. The levels of GFAP and Iba1were significantly increased in 5XFAD group compared with WT mice. Intravenous injection of anti-GMF antibody to 5XFAD mice significantly decrease in the level of GFAP and Iba1 compared with untreated 5XFAD mice (Fig. 3d-g).

Expression of GMF and activated astroglia in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region of 5XFAD mice are reduced post anti-GMF antibody injection

Next we showed the expression of glia maturation factor (GMF) with Iba1 (marker for microglia activation) and GFAP (marker for astrocytes) in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region of 5XFAD mice. Representative confocal images of GMF (green) and GFAP (red) in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region of 5XFAD mice are shown in (Fig. 4a, b). We observed increased GMF expression and its co-localization with GFAP in 5XFAD mice. Treatment with anti-GMF antibody reduces the expression of GMF and GFAP in the 5XFAD mice compared with untreated 5XFAD mice. Quantification of image intensities showed elevated expression of GMF and GFAP in the cortex and hippocampus as shown in (Fig. 4c). We also performed western blot analysis of GMF in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region to check the level of GMF following anti-GMF antibody delivery in 5XFAD mice. Quantitative analysis of GMF on total protein lysates from the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region showed that the GMF levels in the 5XFAD mice were increased compared with WT mice (Fig. 4d, e). However, delivery of anti-GMF antibody significantly decreases the level of GMF compared with untreated 5XFAD mice. Representative confocal microscopy images shows that 5XFAD mice have higher expression and co-localization of GMF (green) and Iba1 (red) in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region compared with WT mice. Injection of anti-GMF antibody significantly reduces the expression of GMF and Iba1 compared with untreated 5XAD mice (Fig. 4f, g, h, i) shows the quantification of GMF with Iba1image intensities.

Release of Alzheimer’s disease- associated pro-inflammatory cytokines in cortex and hippocampal CA1 region of 5XFAD mice are inhibited by anti-GMF antibody

To check the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) levels, we performed highly sensitive ELISA method using cortical and hippocampal protein homogenate. ELISA results revealed that the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly increased in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region in 5XFAD mice compared with WT mice. However, after the intravenous anti-GMF antibody treatment there was marked reduction in the level of all pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 5a-f). These data suggest that anti-GMF antibody treatment attenuated neuroinflammation in the cortex and CA1 region of hippocampus by preventing the maturation of inflammatory cytokines 'release' of inflammatory cytokines. This strongly suggests that GMF- antibody exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by neutralizing the inflammatory actions of GMF in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD.

Anti-GMF-antibody injection significantly improves learning, memory and enhances recognition memory and spontaneous alternations in novel object recognition (NOR) and Y-maze test in 5XFAD mice

The Barnes maze task, novel object recognition and Y-maze tests were performed to check the spatial learning and memory and object recognition memory in 5XFAD mice (Barnes, 1979); (Broadbent et al., 2004). To investigate the effect of anti-GMF antibody treatment on memory and cognition in 5XFAD mice, we performed Barnes maze test` on week, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th following anti-GMF antibody injection. (Fig. 6a, b) Representative traces and latency, shows that 5XFAD mice demonstrated increase in latency to find the hidden box compared with WT mice. However, 5XFAD mice treated with anti-GMF antibody, showed significantly decreased in latency to find the hidden escape box. The probe trial test was conducted at the end of Barnes maze trial. (Fig. 6c, d) Representative traces and quantitative analysis showed that 5XFAD mice spent significantly less time in the target quadrant compared with WT mice. However, Anti-GMF IgG treated mice spent more time in target quadrant. (Fig. 6e, f) Represent traces from training and test day in (NOR) test after anti-GMF antibody injection. (Fig. 6g, h) demonstrates that the exploration and recognition indices were significantly decreased in 5XFAD mice on the last day of experiment compared with WT mice. This decrease was effective and significantly reversed post GMF-antibody injection in 5XFAD mice. We next performed Y-maze spontaneous alternation test to check the locomotion and depressive spatial memory in radial arm maze (Fig. 6i). WT mice showed the expected alternation value and avoiding the previously visited arms, while 5XFAD mice showed altered chance by visiting previously visited arm. However, post-delivery of anti-GMF antibody to 5XFAD mice improved alternation compared with untreated 5XFAD mice (Fig. 6 j). The number of arm entries assessed locomotion, activity is shown in (Fig. 6k). The present study shows that administration of GMF-antibody significantly increases the percentage alternation (right alternation) in the Y- maze test.

Discussion

The presence of aggregated amyloid peptide Aβ has been reported in human post-mortem brain and transgenic mouse models of AD that promote neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (McAlpine et al., 2009; Ahmed et al., 2017b). Neuronal cell death is known to occur following Aβ deposition in AD (Oakley et al., 2006; Eimer and Vassar, 2013). There are several therapeutic agents in the market that only target neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration but unable to treat AD. Previous studies have shown Aβ clearance and improvement in behavioral changes following acute monoclonal antibody treatment in mice (Dodart et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2010). There has been substantial research focus on vaccination and immunotherapy as a potential and useful tool in combating AD. The active immunization and prolonged passive immunization using anti-Aβ antibody have been found to reduce cortical Aβ burden by facilitating Aβ efflux or clearance from brain and reverse memory impairment in transgenic mouse model of AD (DeMattos et al., 2001; Dodart et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2006). The precise mechanism regarding the beneficial effect of immunotherapy used in animal model is poorly understood, however efficacy of immunization used in mouse model will help in strategic and potential therapeutic approach in human being. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown massive activation of GMF and dynamics of inflammatory response in the context of human AD brain (Thangavel et al., 2017; Thangavel et al., 2018). In the present study, we have investigated the effect of intravenous delivery of anti-GMF antibody in 5XFAD mouse brain. We have demonstrated that intravenous delivery of anti-GMF antibody protect cortical and hippocampal CA1 region neuronal death as confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of MAP2/NeuN.

GMF is a pro-inflammatory protein responsible for neuroinflammation. Previous studies from our laboratory have reported on the precise role of GMF in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (Ahmed et al., 2017b; Thangavel et al., 2017). However, the relationship and the mechanism of GMF in the aggregation of Aβ in AD progression is not known. We used anti-GMF-antibody to check the localization and expression of GMF with Aβ in the cortex and CA1 region of hippocampus. We found that anti-GMF-antibody treatment significantly reduced the expression of GMF and Aβ in the cortex and CA1 region of hippocampus in 5XFAD mice. The striking feature of microglia in both AD mouse model as well as in human AD patient is that they make cluster around plaques and provide a protective barrier between neurons and Aβ that are able to phagocytose Aβ complexes thus preventing neuronal dysfunction (Ulrich et al., 2014; Condello et al., 2015; Jay et al., 2015). Anti-GMF-antibody treated mice showed reduced expression of GFAP and Aβ compared to WT and untreated 5XFAD mice. Astrocytes plays an important role in the development and preservation of the neural environment (Pellerin et al., 2007; Attwell et al., 2010). The activation of astrocytes as demonstrated by an increase in GFAP expression has significant impact in neurodegenerative circumstances (Maragakis and Rothstein, 2006). Our experiments demonstrated that improper astrocytes activation in AD leads to the impairment in Aβ clearance. Interestingly, it has been found that when microglial cells were removed from AD mouse model, there was significant elevation of astrocytes reactivity at the vicinity of plaques and the Aβ load was not affected (Grathwohl et al., 2009). Concomitantly, anti-GMF-antibody treated 5XFAD mouse showed reduced reactive astrocytes and load of Aβ deposition following antibody injection. GMF, a pro-inflammatory protein appears to trigger aggregation of Aβ and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative disorders. Previously we have reported the involvement of GMF in the pathogenesis of human AD in studies on postmortem brains (Stolmeier et al., 2013; Ahmed et al., 2017b). However, the precise role and mechanism of action of GMF in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease is not known. We used coronal sections from 9- month old 5XFAD mice brain to demonstrate the effect of GMF neutralizing antibody on the expression and co-localization of GMF with GFAP, IBA1 and at the site of Aβ aggregation using immunofluorescence staining. Our results demonstrated the massive expression and co-localization of GMF with GFAP, IBA1and Aβ seen in 5XFAD mice that can be brought down by using anti-GMF antibody to levels comparable to WT mice. Experimental and clinical studies from several researchers have reported on the relationship between increased synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their up-regulation in AD brain (Abbas et al., 2002; Sastre et al., 2006; Ojala et al., 2009). Chronic aggregation of Aβ promotes activation of microglia which ultimately leads to the neuroinflammation, in AD (Prinz et al., 2011). Association between Aβ and microglia induces pro-inflammatory gene expression and eventual elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) levels, which leads to the neurodegeneration (von Bernhardi et al., 2010). GMF-antibody treated animal show down regulation of reactive gliosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) production following four weeks of delivery of GMF- antibody to 5XFAD mice. In order to investigate the in vivo effect of anti-GMF antibody on behavioral changes, we used Barnes maze test. Our study revealed that intravenous administration of GMF-antibody significantly improved escape latency and probe test in 5XFAD mice. Furthermore, we also evaluated non-spatial recognition memory and spontaneous alternation test using NOR and Y-maze test, which showed that intravenous injection of GMF-antibody significantly, ameliorated the recognition memory loss and alternation in 5XFAD mice. Thus, our current data revealed that hippocampal integrity is necessary for the memory and cognition, as previously reported (Broadbent et al., 2004). Altogether, our findings highlight that anti-GMF antibody treatment ameliorates neurocognitive deficits seen in 5XFAD mice. Our findings clearly support the observation that intravenous (iv) injection of GMF-antibody induces improvement in neurocognition, preserving neuronal loss and reduce neuroinflammation and Aβ plaque load in 9- month old 5XFAD mice.

Conclusions

In this study, we demonstrate that anti-GMF antibody treatment to 9-month 5XFAD mice improved cognitive function, attenuated astrogliois by down regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and reduction in the burden of aggregated Aβ in the cortical and CA1 region of hippocampus. Collectively, our results support the notion that direct antibody mediated antigen depletion, such as an anti-GMF antibody, therapy may be beneficial in controlling and reverting the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD. We believe that therapeutic approaches targeting glial cell activated neuroinflammation are crucial in future pre-clinical AD trials.
