Objectives:

Nursing homes (NHs) are critical end-of-life (EOL) care settings for 70% of Americans dying with Alzheimer’s disease/related dementias (ADRD). Whether EOL care/outcomes vary by NH/market characteristics for this population is unknown but essential information for improving NH EOL care/outcomes. Our objectives were to examine variations in EOL care/outcomes among decedents with ADRD and identify associations with NH/market characteristics.

Design:

Cross-sectional. Outcomes: place-of-death (hospital/NH), presence of pressure ulcers (PUs), potentially avoidable hospitalizations (PAHs), hospice use at EOL. Key covariates: ownership, staffing, presence of Alzheimer’s special care units (ASCUs), market competition.

Setting and Participants:

Long-stay NH residents with ADRD age 65+ who died in 2017 (N=191,435; 14,618 NHs) in NHs or hospitals shortly after NH discharge.

Methods:

National Medicare claims, Minimum Data Set, public datasets. Descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regressions.

Results:

As ADRD severity increased, adjusted rates of in-hospital deaths and PAHs decreased (17.0% to 6.3%; 11.2% to 7.0%); adjusted rates of dying with PUs and hospice use increased (8.2% to 13.5%; 24.5% to 40.7%). Decedents with moderate and severe ADRD had 16% and 13% higher likelihoods of in-hospital deaths in for-profit NHs. In NHs with ASCUs, likelihoods of in-hospital deaths, dying with PUs, and PAHs were significantly lower. As ADRD severity increased, higher licensed nurse staffing was associated with 14%-27% lower likelihoods of PAHs. Increased NH market competition was associated with higher likelihood of hospice use, and lower likelihood of in-hospital deaths among decedents with moderate ADRD.

Conclusions and Implications:

Decedents with ADRD in NHs that were non-profit, had ASCUs, higher licensed nurse staffing, and in more competitive markets, had better EOL care/outcomes. Modifications to state Medicaid NH payments may promote better EOL care/outcomes for this population. Future research to understand NH care practices associated with presence of ASCUs is warranted to identify mechanisms possibly promoting higher-quality EOL care.


INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) affected more than 5 million Americans in 2014; projections estimate 13.9 million people will have ADRD by 2060.1 Almost 40% of Americans with ADRD live in nursing homes (NHs) and nearly 70% die there,2 making NHs critical end-of-life (EOL) care settings.3 In addition to declining physical functioning, residents with ADRD lack autonomy and memory capacity, potentially requiring particularly intensive services at EOL.4

The clinical course of ADRD is well documented.5 Advanced ADRD is terminal, with median survival time (1.3 years) and 6-month mortality rate (25%) similar to other conditions considered terminal.6 NH residents with ADRD frequently experience pneumonia, eating problems, fevers, and infections, often resulting in burdensome transitions at the EOL.5 Hospitalizations pose significant risk of infections and disruptive care, and nearly 50% of hospitalizations among NH residents occurring at the EOL may be potentially avoidable.7

Our understanding of how EOL care and outcomes among NH residents with ADRD relates to NH and market characteristics is limited, and could inform areas for improvement. As a case in point, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services’ (CMS) NH Compare metrics are commonly used to assess NH quality, but measures of care delivered specifically at the EOL to residents with ADRD are not included.8 A handful of prior studies identified several EOL care measures (e.g., place of death,8,9 hospice use8) and outcomes (e.g., potentially avoidable hospitalizations [PAHs]10) for NH decedents, and others found associations between NH and market characteristics and care quality (ownership,7,11–13 staffing levels,14–16 competition,17,18 presence of Alzheimer’s units).19–21 Still others demonstrated associations between hospice use,22 pressure ulcers,23 hospitalization rates,24 and deficiency citations25,26 and state-level factors such as Medicaid payments (covering 63% of NH stays27), bed-hold policies (where NHs receive payments for holding residents’ beds during hospitalizations), and staffing requirements. In addition, geographic variations in place of death among decedent NH residents indicate higher rates of in-hospital deaths in NHs located in southeastern states.28 These measures, associations, and variations, however, are not well characterized specifically among dying residents with ADRD. Identifying such relations is a necessary initial step in targeting meaningful policy interventions aimed at improving EOL care and outcomes for this vulnerable population.

To fill this knowledge gap, we addressed two objectives. First, we examined variations in EOL care and outcomes (in-hospital/NH-death, death with pressure ulcers, PAHs, hospice use) among residents dying with mild, moderate, and severe ADRD. Second, we identified associations between EOL care and outcomes and NH and market characteristics among NH decedents with ADRD.

METHODS

Data Sources and Sample

We used 2016-2017 national data from CMS’ Medicare Provider Analysis and Review File (MedPAR),29 Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF),30 and Minimum Data Set (MDS)31 to identify long-stay NH residents with ADRD who died in 2017 and their characteristics. Data from CMS’ NH Compare file,32 LTCfocus,33 Area Health Resources File (AHRF),34 MACPAC,35 2016 updated state NH Medicaid pay rates,36 and 2017 updated state NH staffing requirements37 were used to identify NH, market, and state-level covariates. NH Medicaid pay rates and state NH staffing requirements were updated following approaches used previously.26

Long-stay residents were identified based on presence of quarterly or annual MDS assessments in 2017. Presence of ADRD was defined using residents’ last assessment before death: items for Alzheimer’s Disease or Dementia and ICD-10 diagnosis codes included F00/dementia in Alzheimer disease; F01/vascular dementia; F02/dementia in other diseases; F03/unspecified dementia; and G30/Alzheimer dementia. Using the Cognitive Function Scale,38 a validated MDS measure of cognitive status,39 residents with ADRD were classified into three levels of cognitive impairment: intact/mild, moderate, and severe.

Analyses included residents who died in NHs or hospitals within 8 days following NH discharge, were not comatose, and were at least 65 years old upon death. The analytical sample included 191,435 decedents with ADRD from 14,618 NHs.

This study protocol was reviewed and approved by University of Rochester’s institutional review board with a waiver of informed consent.

Outcome Measures

We focused on two measures of EOL care quality (place of death,8,9 hospice use8) and two outcome measures (pressure ulcers,40 PAHs10) important to NHs and previously examined, but not specifically at EOL among residents with ADRD. Following prior literature on these NH measures, we consider as preferable NH deaths, lower prevalence of pressure ulcers and PAHs, and more hospice use.

Place of death was determined from MDS discharge assessments, a validated approach to identify hospitalizations among NH residents,41 and coded as ‘NH’ if death occurred there, and as ‘in-hospital’ if residents were discharged to hospitals and died within 8 days. Residents discharged to hospitals died an average 5 days post-NH discharge. We chose 8 days because more than 85% of in-hospital deaths were captured by this cutoff, and it has been previously used.8 Deaths occurring later than 8 days post-discharge may reflect care complexities NHs may be unable to adequately address.

MDS assessments during residents’ last 90 days of life determined hospice use, specifically: hospice care while a resident and within the last 14 days. We coded decedents as using hospice if this item was checked. Average duration of hospice enrollment before death was 49 days.

If the last MDS assessment before death (median time between assessment and death:21 days) indicated presence of stage II-IV pressure ulcers, we coded decedents as dying with pressure ulcers.

PAHs were identified from admitting diagnosis codes in MedPAR as based on recommendations of an expert panel commissioned by CMS to define PAHs.10 The panel identified 23 conditions as potentially preventable/manageable in NHs. If residents were admitted to hospitals in the last 90 days of life for these conditions, we coded them as experiencing PAHs. The median number of PAHs was 1, occurring a median 25 days before death. Pneumonia and bronchitis, urinary tract infection, dehydration, congestive heart failure, and falls/trauma accounted for 76% of PAHs among our sample.

Covariates

Individual Risk Factors

Using MDS assessments and MBSF, we included resident socio-demographics, behavior and functioning, and medical information, which prior studies have identified as important risk adjusters.8–10,40 Socio-demographics included age, race (white/non-white), enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans in the month of death, dual eligibility for Medicare/Medicaid, gender, and marital status (married/not married). Aggressive behavior was measured as moderate/severe (score of 3-12 on the Aggressive Behavior Scale42) vs. none/mild (score of 0-2), and functional status43 was based on activities of daily living (ADL) (0-28, higher scores=greater impairment). We also included number of diagnoses and presence/absence of medical conditions: diabetes; heart/circulation; musculoskeletal; cancer; COPD; dehydration; pneumonia; stroke; urinary tract infection; urinary incontinence; bowel incontinence; swallowing problem; anxiety; depression; feeding tube; oxygen therapy; indwelling catheter; pain medication; antipsychotic, antianxiety, antidepressant medication; and pressure ulcer in the last 90 days of life. Missing information for chronic conditions was imputed from earlier assessments (diabetes [3.6% imputed], heart/circulation [16.0% imputed], musculoskeletal [23.7% imputed], cancer [5.6% imputed], COPD [7.2% imputed]).

Nursing Home and Market Factors

We included NH and market factors associated with care quality and outcomes in prior studies.7,11–21 The MDS was used to define prevalence of NH-level ADRD, volume of NH hospice days in the last 90 days of life,44 and proportion of NH-level PAHs in the last 90 days of life. For-profit status (vs. government-owned/non-profit), chain membership, total staffing hours per resident day (sum of registered nurses [RNs], licensed practical nurses, and certified nursing assistants), RN/total staffing hours per resident day, number of beds, occupancy rate, presence of Alzheimer’s units, % Medicare and Medicaid residents, and 5-star overall and staffing ratings (reference=2-4 stars) were obtained from the CMS NH Compare file and LTCfocus data.

We also included several county-level covariates, capturing NH market characteristics. Market competition for NH beds as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index was calculated by summing the squared shares of beds for all NHs present in the county. The index ranges in score from 0 to 1; by subtracting all scores from 1, higher scores indicate greater competition (i.e., a decrease in shared market power). We also included number of hospice providers in the county, number of hospital beds per 1,000 persons 65+, and whether NHs were located in urban (vs. rural) counties.

State Factors

To account for state variations in key state characteristics associated with NH care quality in prior studies,22–26 we included several state-level covariates: payment type for NH Medicaid reimbursement (cost-based, hybrid, price-based); NH Medicaid payment rates; minimum total nurse staffing requirements (hours per resident day); and presence/absence of monetary adjustment for behavioral problems and mental health/cognitive impairment (add-ons), and bed-hold policy.

Statistical Analyses

We first examined associations between independent variables and dependent measures across decedents with differing levels of ADRD severity using chi-square tests and analyses of variance. Multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for resident, NH, market, and state-level factors, and NH-level random effects, were estimated for each dependent measure among decedents with mild, moderate, and severe ADRD. We then compared standardized coefficients among several key NH-level covariates from these models to assess variable importance (ownership, staffing hours, presence of Alzheimer’s units, and competition). Furthermore, we stratified for presence of Alzheimer’s units to more closely examine associations between EOL care and outcomes among decedents with ADRD. We also assessed geographic variation in EOL care and outcomes by mapping predicted rates from multivariable logistic regression models for each dependent variable.

Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC).

RESULTS

Most associations across ADRD severity levels were significant (Table 1). NH decedents with severe ADRD were more likely female, non-white, and dually eligible for Medicare/Medicaid compared to decedents with mild or moderate ADRD. Prevalence of moderate/severe aggressive behaviors, higher ADL scores, presence of urinary and bowel incontinence, and feeding tubes increased with ADRD severity. NH decedents with severe ADRD more likely resided in non-profit NHs and NHs with Alzheimer’s units compared to decedents with mild or moderate ADRD. Although statistically significantly different across ADRD severity levels, NH staffing levels and star ratings did not meaningfully differ in magnitude by decedent ADRD severity. Decedents with severe ADRD more likely resided in NHs in states with bed-hold and higher minimum nurse staffing requirements.

As ADRD severity increased, observed rates of in-hospital deaths and PAHs significantly decreased (17.3% to 6.4%; 12.0% to 7.5%), whereas observed rates of dying with pressure ulcers and hospice use significantly increased (8.5% to 13.9%; 23.4% to 39.7%) with ADRD severity (Figure 1).

After controlling for resident, NH, market, and state-level covariates, in-hospital deaths were 16% and 13% more likely among residents with moderate and severe ADRD in for-profit NHs (Table 2; full models: Tables A1–A4). Residents with moderate ADRD in NHs in more competitive markets were 18% less likely to die in-hospital. Among residents in NHs with Alzheimer’s units, in-hospital deaths were 14%-20% less likely. Residence in NHs in states with hybrid reimbursements was associated with 15%-22% lower likelihood of in-hospital deaths.

Dying with pressure ulcers was 17% less likely among residents with moderate or severe ADRD in NHs with Alzheimer’s units. Odds of dying with pressure ulcers decreased 9% for every ten-minute increase in licensed nurse staffing among decedents with severe ADRD. Residents with moderate or severe ADRD in NHs in states with price-based reimbursements were 13%-22% more likely to die with pressure ulcers. Dying with pressure ulcers was 14%-15% less likely among residents with moderate or severe ADRD in states with bed-hold policies.

Odds of PAHs decreased 14%-27% for every ten-minute increase in licensed nurse staffing. PAHs were 11%-13% less likely among residents with moderate or severe ADRD in NHs with Alzheimer’s units. Residents with mild ADRD in NHs in more competitive markets were 28% less likely to experience PAHs. In states with add-ons, PAHs were 11%-19% more likely. Every $10 increase in Medicaid pay rate was associated with 3%-4% decreased likelihood of PAHs. Odds of PAHs increased 4%-5% for every hour per resident day increase in minimum nurse staffing requirements.

In terms of hospice use, residence in for-profit NHs was associated with 10% and 7% increased odds of hospice use among decedents with mild and severe ADRD. Residents in NHs in more competitive markets had 27%-38% higher odds of hospice use. However, for every ten-minute increase in licensed nurse staffing, odds of hospice use decreased 10%-15%. Residence in NHs in states with price-based reimbursements was associated with 15% and 12% decreased odds of hospice use among decedents with mild and moderate ADRD. Residence in NHs in states with add-ons was associated with 7%-14% lower likelihood of hospice use. For every $10 increase in Medicaid pay rate, the likelihood of hospice use decreased 2%-4%.

Figure 2 summarizes results of stratified analyses by Alzheimer’s units. Presence of Alzheimer’s units related to significantly lower adjusted rates of in-hospital deaths (3.4%, 2.1%, 2.6%), dying with pressure ulcers (0.6%, 2.1%, 4.2%), and PAHs (1.7%, 1.2%, 2.3%). Presence of Alzheimer’s units related to significantly lower adjusted rates of hospice use (1.5%) among decedents with moderate ADRD.

State variations in predicted rates for each dependent variable, after controlling for resident, NH, market, and state characteristics, were relatively consistent across decedents with mild, moderate, and severe ADRD. Therefore, we present the predicted rates by state for decedents with severe ADRD only (Figure 3). Decedents with severe ADRD in NHs located in southeastern states, and NY, CA, and NV had generally higher predicted rates of in-hospital deaths, deaths with pressure ulcers, and PAHs compared to decedents with severe ADRD in other parts of the country. Predicted rates of hospice use were higher among decedents with severe ADRD in NHs generally located in the middle part of the country.

DISCUSSION

This national study is the first to provide evidence that EOL care among NH residents with ADRD varies by NH organizational and market characteristics not previously examined in this context. Our findings show as ADRD severity increased, decedent NH residents were less likely to experience in-hospital deaths and PAHs and more likely to experience pressure ulcers and use hospice. Overall, this may suggest that NHs appropriately identified residents dying with ADRD and provided appropriate levels of EOL care.

Perhaps the most striking finding was the potential role of Alzheimer’s units. We found that residents dying with ADRD in NHs with Alzheimer’s units were more likely to die in NHs than in hospitals, and less likely to have had pressure ulcers or experienced PAHs. However, we did not find more hospice use in NHs with Alzheimer’s units, which may be due to substitution effects between Alzheimer’s units and hospice: additional staffing and increased attention for residents with ADRD in Alzheimer’s units20 may decrease hospice referrals.

Some previous studies have found associations between Alzheimer’s units and better care and outcomes17,19–21 as we did, but evidence is mixed.19,45 Standardization across NHs defining Alzheimer’s units is lacking,46 making interpreting findings difficult. A 2008 study21 examined effects of Alzheimer’s units on broader NH quality and found no difference in outcomes before and after implementation of Alzheimer’s units, suggesting knowledge and skill do not diffuse from Alzheimer’s units throughout NHs. Rather, the authors suggested care practices and knowledge among staff in NHs taking initiatives to implement Alzheimer’s units are unique and drive quality. Others suggest NHs may be investing in Alzheimer’s units to increase marketability, contributing to increased quality.20 Regardless of underlying reasons for improved quality, we found clear associations between Alzheimer’s units and EOL care and outcomes among decedents with ADRD, except in relation to hospice use.

We also found significant associations with NH market competition. In more competitive markets, residents with ADRD were less likely to die in-hospital or experience PAHs but more likely to use hospice. As preferences for dying in home-like settings increase, it is unsurprising that deaths in NHs were more likely in more competitive markets; NHs in these markets may also aim to maintain full occupancy. To improve marketability, NHs in more competitive markets may strive to increase knowledge of appropriate practices among staff or invest in on-site medical equipment, avoiding stressful hospitalizations; but these assumptions merit further study.

While advanced ADRD is terminal, many residents with ADRD may not be viewed as terminal and therefore may be considered ineligible for hospice, even though many die sooner than NH staff anticipate.47 However, hospice growth and increasing focus on NH patients for stable referrals48 may help explain higher likelihood of hospice use among residents dying with ADRD in more competitive markets.

Non-profit NHs7,11–13 and those with higher staffing levels14–16 have been associated with better care and outcomes in previous studies. Our findings confirm these relationships among residents dying with ADRD. We found higher likelihood of in-hospital deaths and hospice use among decedents with ADRD in for-profit NHs. Profit-maximizing incentives may encourage for-profit NHs to hospitalize residents even at EOL if it is less expensive than providing care on-site.7 Similarly, shared costs with hospice providers48 may increase hospice enrollment among residents of for-profit NHs. Regardless of severity level, we found decedents with ADRD in NHs with higher licensed nurse staffing less likely experienced PAHs and used hospice. Having more licensed nurse staff may increase capacity for on-site care and attending to unique needs of patients at EOL rather than hospice referrals.

States vary significantly in how NH Medicaid payments are reimbursed, provision of add-ons, and presence of bed-hold policies.35 Price-based reimbursements may create incentives to underutilize services to stay within rate limits. We found supporting evidence in lower likelihood of in-hospital deaths among residents in NHs in states using hybrid reimbursements but did not find support regarding PAHs. Dying with pressure ulcers was more likely among decedents in NHs in states using price-based reimbursements, where financial constraints may disincentivize aggressive treatment of pressure ulcers. Add-ons were associated with lower likelihoods of hospice use, suggesting NHs in states receiving these adjustments may have more resources to care for residents and value hospice collaborations less. However, these adjustments were associated with higher likelihood of PAHs, which requires further study to fully explain.

That Medicaid pay rate was associated with lower likelihood of PAHs and hospice use, and state minimum nurse staffing requirements were associated with higher likelihood of PAHs and hospice use, corroborate other studies22,24,26 and provide evidence among residents with ADRD at EOL. Future studies are needed to understand the possible complex effects of these types of state policies on EOL care for residents with ADRD.

We also found significant geographic variations in EOL care and outcomes. Similar to a prior study of in-hospital deaths among decedent NH residents,28 decedents with ADRD in NHs located in southeastern states and NY experienced more hospitalizations and pressure ulcers at the EOL. By controlling for resident, NH, market, and state characteristics, the remaining variations in EOL care and outcomes across states may be due to regional differences in practice styles,49 which were not directly included in our analyses.

Our study has several limitations. Potential omitted variable bias may be present, but we included an extensive set of individual and NH-level characteristics, likely considerably diminishing this concern. Also, ADRD may be underdiagnosed, potentially resulting in underestimations, or conservative estimates, of associations between EOL care and outcomes and NH and market characteristics among residents with ADRD. Additionally, we were unable to capture resident preferences for EOL care and advance directives as such data are not available nationally. Further, while we were unable to control for potential selection bias into hospice, we did control for NH-level volume of hospice days44 among residents’ last 90 days of life (proxy for NH potential for hospice use). Finally, while we could identify NHs in which Alzheimer’s units exist, we were unable to determine specific residence in Alzheimer’s units. We assume, however, based on prior studies,21 that NHs with Alzheimer’s units are somewhat different than those without, and expect presence of Alzheimer’s units to be associated with NH EOL care.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

NH decedents with ADRD in NHs that were non-profit, had Alzheimer’s units, higher licensed nurse staffing, and increased NH market competition received better EOL care quality. Residents with ADRD in NHs with Alzheimer’s units were consistently more likely to die in NHs rather than hospitals and had fewer pressure ulcers and PAHs at EOL.

Our findings suggest presence of Alzheimer’s units may create environments where better outcomes are possible for residents dying with ADRD. However, because there is no standard definition of Alzheimer’s units, identifying specific dimensions promoting better care is difficult. Future research to understand NH practices and care processes associated with presence of Alzheimer’s units is warranted to identify possible mechanisms promoting higher quality EOL care for residents with ADRD.

Figure 3: Predicted rates of in-hospital death, death with pressure ulcer, potentially avoidable hospitalizations, and hospice use by state among decedents with severe ADRD. Logistic regression models controlled for resident, NH, market, and state characteristics. States with ‘NA’ were dropped from the multivariable models due to missing data. States with predicted rates nearest the average rate are identified, as well as states with the minimum and maximum predicted rates for each dependent variable.
