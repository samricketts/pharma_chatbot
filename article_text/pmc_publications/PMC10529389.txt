Background:

Positron emission tomography (PET) scans for amyloid-β can aid in the early and accurate detection of Alzheimer’s disease. The results of amyloid PET scans could help people with cognitive impairment and caregivers better understand their diagnosis; however, there are concerns that they could also cause psychological harm.

Methods:

A systematic review of psychosocial and behavioral quantitative outcomes following the disclosure of an amyloid PET scan for persons living with cognitive impairment (subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer’s Disease and other dementias) and caregivers.

Findings:

10 papers were identified from 7 studies. There was little evidence of an association between disclosure and depression. However, persons with MCI and their caregivers with elevated levels of amyloid had an increased risk of distress or anxiety compared with those without elevated amyloid. Participants correctly recalled the scan results; however, it is unclear whether this led to an increased understanding of their diagnosis. We did not identify any studies measuring behavioral outcomes.

Conclusions:

We found mixed evidence on the relationship between amyloid scans and psychosocial and behavioral outcomes in people with cognitive impairment and caregivers. These findings highlight the need for more methodologically rigorous research on this topic.

There has been rapid progress in the development of biomarkers for detecting the neuropathology associated with Alzheimer’s disease, potentially enhancing the accuracy of diagnoses, and transforming how Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are diagnosed and treated1. Amyloid-β is a pathophysiological change which can be detected using positron emission tomography (PET) scans2. The results from amyloid scans are disclosed to recipients as a binary outcome, where a positive scan result indicates elevated levels of amyloid, consistent with the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease, and a negative scan does not indicate elevated amyloid3. This can have differing implications depending on the scan recipient’s level of cognitive impairment. For persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), amyloid scans can be used to make a differential diagnosis4. For persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), elevated amyloid may indicate an increased risk of developing dementia1. However, this relationship is not definitive. Elevated levels of amyloid may occur in persons with other neurodegenerative diseases or in cognitively healthy individuals5,6. In the US, amyloid scans have been limited to use for research purposes due to their limited predictive value at the individual level7. Evidence from the Imaging Dementia - Evidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS) study shows amyloid scans are associated with changes in the clinical management of ADRD4, although the impact of disclosure on scan recipients and their caregivers is less understood.

Ethical debates regarding the disclosure of amyloid scan results in clinical practice center on the potential benefits and harms to the scan recipient and caregivers. Arguments in support of disclosure propose the scan recipient and caregiver would benefit from a more accurate diagnosis, allowing them to better understand their condition, receive appropriate treatments and engage in advance care planning8,9. Counter arguments cite concerns that scan recipients may experience psychological harm, workplace or social stigmatization9–11. Two previous systematic reviews have summarized the evidence of the impact of amyloid disclosure on cognitively healthy persons8,10 and found there was very little change in psychological outcomes following the disclosure of the scan result. However, previous research has yet to summarize caregiver outcomes following the disclosure of an amyloid scan. As amyloid scans can be used to assess suitability for amyloid targeting therapies (anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies), it is becoming increasingly more likely that they will be incorporated into routine clinical care for people with dementia. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review is to update the findings from the two previous reviews on this topic and summarize quantitative psychosocial and behavioral outcomes following the disclosure of an amyloid PET scan for persons living with cognitive impairment and their caregivers.

Methods

This review was developed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines12,13 (eTable 1 in supplementary materials) and was registered in advance on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022371876).

Eligibility criteria

Studies had to meet the following criteria: 1) studies included participants with subjective cognitive decline, MCI or ADRD, and/or their caregivers. Studies of cognitively healthy participants were included if subjective cognitive decline was explicitly stated as an inclusion criterion; 2) all study designs (with or without comparison groups) were included, however, outcomes were limited to those reported after the participant received the results from their own amyloid PET scan; 3) reported quantitative psychosocial and/or behavioral outcomes for patients or caregivers. Psychosocial outcomes were broadly defined as measures capturing mood, emotions, reaction to the scan, quality of life, and caregiver burden. Behavioral outcomes were broadly defined as changes in behavior, knowledge, or decision making following amyloid disclosure. 4) studies published in English, and 5) studies published in peer reviewed journals. Papers which reported outcomes from larger studies were included if outcomes were not duplicated.

Studies were excluded if they: 1) reported associations between amyloid positivity/ deposition without the disclosure of the scan result, 2) only reported qualitative data 3) disclosed hypothetical or fictitious results to participants, 4) tested other dementia-related biomarkers, or reported outcomes from plasma or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, 5) only include cognitively healthy participants without subjective cognitive decline, or 6) were reviews, discussion articles, case studies, pre-prints or conference abstracts.

Information sources, search strategy and selection process

We searched Embase, MEDLINE and PsychInfo, independently on OVID, on 3rd October 2022 with no limits on the search. The search terms included variations on the key words: amyloid, PET scan and dementia. MesH terms were also included for dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and PET scan. See eMethods 2 for the full search strategy.

The search results were exported to Covidence, where duplicates were removed. References were screened by title and abstract and then by full text. All articles were double screened by EC and MA and conflicts were resolved by MP.

Data Items and extraction

Relevant data items were extracted by EC using Covidence and a second author (WZ) checked the extracted items for accuracy. Extracted information included: study name, author names, year, country, study aims, design, participant diagnosis, details of amyloid disclosure, number of participants, participants average age, number and proportion of women, number and proportion of white participants, number and proportion of participants with elevated amyloid, outcomes and measures reported, analysis used, and results.

Study critical appraisal

Studies were critically assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool that corresponded to their study design14,15. EC conducted the critical appraisal, which was double checked for accuracy by WZ.

Synthesis

Due to the heterogeneity of designs, participants, and outcomes used by the included studies a meta-analysis would not be meaningful; therefore, results were summarized by a narrative synthesis16. Results for persons with cognitive impairment and caregivers were presented separately. We tabulated the key findings from each study by outcome.

Results

Study selection

We identified 16,534 references (Figure 1). After duplicates were removed, we screened 10,495 references for inclusion. We screened the full text of 59 papers and included 10 in this systematic review. Reasons for exclusion included wrong publication type (N=25), outcomes were not collected post-disclosure (N=9), participants were cognitively normal (N=7), scan results were hypothetical or fictitious (N=3), only qualitative data were reported (N=3), and papers did not include psychosocial or behavioral outcomes (N=2).

Study and participant characteristics

We identified ten papers from seven studies. Table 1 presents an overview of the study characteristics. Three studies presented data from the CARE-IDEAS study, a cross-sectional survey of people with MCI, ADRD and their caregivers17–19, and two studies presented data from the RAISR randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing amyloid PET scan disclosure with psychoeducation20,21. Four papers presented findings from pre/post designs, two with participants with subjective cognitive impairment22,23 and one with participants with early onset ADRD24, and one with participants with MCI and mild ADRD25. One study presents findings from a cross-sectional study of caregivers26. Sample sizes ranged from 11 to 3,690 (1,845 caregiving dyads). The quality of the included studies varied greatly (see eTables 1, 2 and 3). Although most studies aimed to understand the participant’s emotional responses to amyloid PET scan disclosure, 6/9 reported associations between the scan result and outcomes. Another key weakness was the lack of a comparison group among the included studies. Only the RAISR study compared outcomes between scan recipients and non-scan recipients20. All studies included in this review reported psychosocial outcomes. We did not identify any behavioral outcomes.

Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of included participants. The average age of persons with cognitive impairment was 69.6 and 46.8% were female. The proportion of scan recipients with elevated amyloid ranged from 23.8% - 78.1% (mean = 43.7%). Caregivers had an average age of 65 and 64% were female. Only the CARE-IDEAS and RAISR studies presented information on the participants race/ethnicity. Most persons with cognitive impairment and caregivers were white, 94.1% and 93.0% respectively. Persons with cognitive impairment and caregivers in the included studies were highly educated in terms of degrees earned and number of years in education.

Results of individual studies

The association between amyloid scan disclosure and outcomes for persons with cognitive impairment

Eight studies assessed the association between amyloid PET scan disclosure and psychosocial and behavioral outcomes for persons with cognitive impairment (Table 3).

Five studies assessed the association between amyloid PET scan disclosure and depressive symptoms in persons with MCI (N = 2), MCI &amp; ADRD (N = 1), and subjective cognitive decline (N = 2)20–23,25. These studies assessed depressive symptoms at a wide range of time points following the scan. The shortest timepoint was 14 days and the longest timepoint was 52 weeks. None of these studies detected any significant changes in depressive symptoms at any timepoint after the scan. Similarly, four studies assessed levels of anxiety at multiple timepoints ranging from 14 days to 52 weeks after the scan. None of these studies found significant changes in levels of anxiety after the scan at any timepoint20–22,25. However, one study found greater variation in anxious and depressive symptoms among persons with MCI and elevated amyloid compared to those without elevated amyloid in the 2 weeks following disclosure21.

The association between disclosure and test-related distress varied depending on the participant’s level of cognitive impairment and the scan result. Two studies of participants with subjective cognitive decline found there was no differences in test-related distress between those with elevated and non-elevated amyloid22,23. One study measured test-related distress 6 weeks after post-disclosure22 and the other measured distress 9 or 18 months post-disclosure23. However, a RCT comparing amyloid PET scan disclosure to psychoeducation in persons with MCI found those with elevated amyloid experienced greater levels of distress on two separate measures compared to those without elevated amyloid20. This study measured test-related distress 4, 24, and 52 weeks post-scan. Participants with elevated amyloid’s distress scores did decline over time, however they remained consistently higher than those without elevated amyloid.

One study assessed the impact disclosing scans as part of the diagnostic process on quality of life measures in persons with young onset AD24. They found a change in diagnosis was associated with improvement in Alzheimer’s related quality of life and increased clinician confidence following the scan was associated with improvement in a generic measure of quality of life. Although, the size of this effect may not constitute a clinically meaningful difference. Lingler et al20 also assessed the impact of amyloid scan disclosure on person’s with MCI’s self-efficacy for coping and found no significant difference in scores between those randomized to receive the scan and those randomized to receive psychoeducation.

Two studies assessed patient’s understanding of the scan result or diagnosis following disclosure. James et al18 found 83% of persons with MCI or ADRD correctly recalled their scan result 4.5 months after disclosure. Lingler et al20 found scan recipient’s knowledge of MCI/Alzheimer’s disease or perceived ambiguity of MCI did not change between baseline and 4, 24 or 52 weeks after disclosure. Furthermore, knowledge scores did not differ between those randomized to receive an amyloid scan and those who received psychoeducation. However, a subgroup analysis found that participants who received a result for non-elevated amyloid reported greater perceived ambiguity about MCI. The authors suggest that participants correctly understood that their symptoms remained unexplained.

Jutkowitz et al19 assessed the impact of amyloid PET scan disclosure on participant’s willingness to accept risky treatments to restore their memory. They found on average, participants were willing to accept a 27.94% risk of death to restore their memory to normal and participants with elevated amyloid were willing to accept more 5.6% risk than those without elevated amyloid.

The association between amyloid scan disclosure and caregiver outcomes

Five studies included in this review reported caregiver outcomes following the disclosure of an amyloid scan (Table 4).Three studies assessed the effect of disclosure on depressive and anxious symptoms among caregivers17,20,26. There were no significant differences in depressive symptoms17,20,24. Likewise, Bensaidane et al26 did not find an association between the scan result and caregiver anxiety, however the authors did not use a validated scale. Belanger and Lingler17,20 both assessed caregiver anxiety using some form of the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory. Lingler et al found anxiety increased in the 4 and 24 weeks after disclosure but returned to baseline levels at week 52 for all caregivers3. They did not detect differences in levels of anxiety by scan result20. However, they noted that the increase in anxiety was below the cut off for clinical significance. On the other hand, Belanger et al stratified their analysis by the scan recipient’s level of impairment and found that elevated amyloid was associated with increased anxiety for caregivers to persons with MCI but not ADRD approximately 4.5 months following disclosure17.

Bensaidane et al26 assessed the impact of amyloid PET scan disclosure on caregiver quality of life and found no significant difference between elevated and non-elevated groups. Lingler et al20 found caregivers to scan recipients experienced decreased self-efficacy for coping compared to those who received psychoeducation. For caregivers to persons with elevated amyloid this decline occurred at 4 weeks post disclosure, whereas the decline occurred at 24 weeks for caregivers to persons without elevated amyloid.

Three studies assess caregivers’ understanding of the diagnosis or scan result18,20,26. James et al18 found that 85% of caregivers correctly recalled the scan result 4.5 months after disclosure. Lingler et al20 found caregiver knowledge of MCI/Alzheimer’s disease improved for all caregivers between baseline and 52 week follow-up. However, there was no significant difference in knowledge scores between caregivers to persons who received an amyloid scan and those who received psychoeducation. Similarly, there was no difference in knowledge scores between caregivers to persons with elevated amyloid compared to non-elevated amyloid. Bensaidane et al26 found no significant difference in understanding of the scan result between caregivers to persons with elevated and non-elevated amyloid on an author-developed measure. Similarly, they found no significant difference in expectations for the future between caregivers to persons with elevated and non-elevated amyloid26.

Jutkowitz et al19 assessed caregiver perceptions of the scan recipient’s willingness to accept risky treatment to return their memory to normal. On average, caregivers believed scan recipients would accept at 29.68% risk of death. Approximately one quarter of caregivers were in exact agreement with the amount of risk the scan recipient was willing to accept. However, 35% underestimated and 41% over-estimated the amount of risk they were willing to accept.

Discussion

The aim of this review was to summarize the association between the disclosure of amyloid PET scan results and psychosocial and behavioral outcomes for persons with cognitive impairment and caregivers. We identified ten papers from seven studies. All but one of the included studies used observational designs and two thirds were conducted in the US. We found some evidence that the psychological impact of receiving an amyloid scan on psychological responses varied by the scan recipients’ level of impairment. Participants were able to correctly recall the scan result, however, it is not clear whether this is associated with increased knowledge of their diagnosis. We did not identify any studies reporting behavioral outcomes. The small number of papers included and the heterogeneity of study design, participant characteristics and outcomes limit the strength of the conclusions we can draw.

Amyloid scan disclosure had little association with measures of anxiety, depression and self-efficacy for coping for persons with cognitive impairment, which is consistent with findings from two systematic reviews of amyloid disclosure on cognitively healthy participants8,10. However, test-related distress may vary depending on the participant’s level of impairment and scan result. One study found persons with MCI and elevated amyloid reported greater levels of test-related distress on two separate measures (the Impact of Events Scale (IES) and Impact of Genetic Testing – Alzheimer’s Disease (IGT-AD)20. Similar effects were not found in those with subjective cognitive decline as measured by the IES22,23 however, neither of these studies stratified their analysis by the scan result and the timing of the assessments differed greatly. Therefore, it is not possible to be sure if the observed differences at due to the participant’s level of cognitive impairment or are a result of differing methodologies. A more recent study of persons with subjective cognitive decline, found a positive amyloid scan was associated with increased test-related distress27. Similarly, two studies in this review found caregivers to persons with elevated amyloid and MCI may experience increased anxiety post-disclosure17,20. The observed increases in distress among persons with MCI and elevated amyloid and their caregivers may be due to the implication of the scan result. A scan showing elevated amyloid among people with MCI indicates a strong risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease in the future. Persons with MCI and elevated amyloid and their caregivers may require additional post-diagnostic support following the disclosure of an amyloid PET scan.

Most participants with MCI, ADRD and their caregivers correctly recalled the scan result18. Participants included in this review were highly educated, however, James et al18 found neither scan recipient nor caregiver levels of education affected the likelihood of correctly recalling the scan result. It is unclear what impact accurate recall has on participants’ understanding of their diagnosis. Lingler et al20 found generally scan recipients’ knowledge of their condition did not change after disclosure and did not differ significantly from the control group who received psychoeducation for MCI, although a subgroup analysis found persons with MCI and elevated amyloid may correctly understand their symptoms remain unexplained. Furthermore, caregiver’s knowledge of the condition did improve but a similar improvement was also observed in participants randomized to receive psychoeducation20. Findings from the analysis of qualitative data indicate scan recipients and caregivers can be confused by the language used when disclosing the scan result18. The included studies reported using a variety of protocols for disclosing the amyloid PET scan results. In most cases, the results were disclosed by a member of the study team, which may not reflect clinical practice. Future research should explore how the delivery of amyloid scan results influences the patient and caregiver’s understanding of the diagnosis.

Ethical debates regarding the use of amyloid PET scan during the dementia diagnosis process focus on the potential benefits and the risk of harm. The findings of this review indicate there may be a small risk of psychological harm among persons with MCI and elevated amyloid and their caregivers. However, this relationship is not conclusive. Similarly, there is no clear benefit of amyloid PET scan disclosure in terms of enhancing persons with cognitive impairments and caregivers understanding of the diagnosis. Despite concerns held by clinicians and researchers, people with cognitive impairment may wish to know their amyloid status. Future research should explore how to lessen the impact of potential “bad news” when disclosing amyloid PET scan results, especially in the case of elevated amyloid among persons with MCI or subjective cognitive decline where there are no disease modifying treatments available. Researchers have proposed this could be done through pre-disclosure counselling and by providing follow-up support post-disclosure28.

Strengths and limitations

This review draws together the evidence on the impact of amyloid disclosure on persons with cognitive impairment and caregivers and indicates a nuanced and mixed experience of amyloid disclosure by the scan recipients’ level of impairment and scan result. Patient and caregivers experiences of amyloid PET scan disclosure is a growing area of research - four new studies have been published on this topic since running our search27,29–31. We used broad search terms and did not include search terms for outcomes to capture as many studies in this area as possible. We identified a small number of studies, which varied greatly in terms of participants characteristics, sample size, study design, and outcomes, limiting the strength of the evidence on this topic. Only three studies included participants with ADRD, two of which also included participants with MCI. It is possible that psychosocial and behavioral responses may differ between those with MCI and ADRD due to the differing implications of the scan result. A scan result indicating elevated amyloid can be used to make a differential diagnosis for persons with ADRD but can only be used to determine the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease in the future for persons with MCI. This is an important area for further investigation. Although we aimed to explore the association between receiving an amyloid scan on psychosocial and behavioral outcomes, most studies compared associations between the scan result and outcomes, making it difficult to determine if the observed effects are from getting the scan or from the recipient’s amyloid status. Additionally, we did not identify any behavioral outcomes. Therefore, we cannot determine whether an amyloid scan leads to changes in behaviors for persons with cognitive impairment or their care partners. Future research should examine if receiving an amyloid scan is associated with changes to lifestyle, employment, health service utilization or advanced care planning. Furthermore, only one study included in this review used a comparison group meaning changes in outcomes cannot be attributed to the scan alone. Finally, only two out of seven studies reported the race/ethnicity of their participants, who were predominantly white, limiting the generalizability of the findings from this review. Future research should be methodologically rigorous, with a comparison group and ethno-culturally diverse samples.

Conclusions

It is becoming increasingly important to understand the impact of amyloid PET scan disclosure on persons with cognitive impairment and caregivers. In this review, we identified a small number of studies assessing the psychosocial and behavioral impact of amyloid disclosure. The scan recipient’s level of distress and caregiver’s levels of anxiety post-disclosure may vary depending on the scan recipient’s level of cognitive impairment and the scan result. Scan recipients and caregivers could correctly recall the scan result, but it is not clear this is associated with a better understanding of their diagnosis. More rigorous research with diverse samples of cognitively impaired participants and their caregivers is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the potential harms and benefits of disclosing amyloid PET scan results.
