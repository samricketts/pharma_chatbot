INTRODUCTION:

Diabetes and dementia are diseases of high healthcare burden worldwide. Individuals with diabetes have 1.4 to 2.2 times higher risk of dementia. Our objective was to evaluate evidence of causality between these two common diseases.

METHODS:

We conducted a one-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Million Veteran program. The study included 334,672 participants ≥65 years of age with type 2 diabetes and dementia case-control status and genotype data.

RESULTS:

For each standard deviation increase in genetically-predicted diabetes, we found increased odds of three dementia diagnoses in non-Hispanic White participants (all-cause: OR=1.07[1.05–1.08],P=3.40E-18; vascular: OR=1.11[1.07–1.15],P=3.63E-09, Alzheimer’s: OR=1.06[1.02–1.09],P=6.84E-04) and non-Hispanic Black participants (all-cause: OR=1.06[1.02–1.10],P=3.66E-03, vascular: OR=1.11[1.04–1.19],P=2.20E-03, Alzheimer’s: OR=1.12 [1.02–1.23],P=1.60E-02) but not in Hispanic participants (all P&gt;.05).

DISCUSSION:

We found evidence of causality between diabetes and dementia using a one-sample MR study, with access to individual level data, overcoming limitations of prior studies utilizing two-sample MR techniques.

pmc1.0 Background

Diabetes and dementia each impose a high healthcare burden on the U.S. population. In March 2020, the CDC estimated diabetes prevalence at 14.7%1 of the adult U.S. population. Separately, a 2019 study reported that 11.5% of adults ≥65 years of age had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease(AD) or related dementias(ADRD), representing 1.6% of the U.S. population, a rate projected to double by 2060.2 Observational studies have demonstrated a clear association between diabetes and dementia.3–7 Individuals with diabetes have a 1.4–2.2 greater relative risk of dementia than those without diabetes,3,7 with the level of increased risk varying by specific dementia diagnosis.8,9 Given the projection of 17.9% diabetes prevalence in the U.S. by 2060,10 it is critical to gain additional understanding regarding the relationship between diabetes and dementia. The uncertainty is whether the association is due to shared genetic susceptibility, pathophysiology that independently leads to these two common diseases, or if diabetes – which typically occurs at younger ages than dementia – triggers metabolic and/or neurological changes leading to dementia.11–13 Our previous work in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) demonstrated that a genetic risk score (GRS) for type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with all-cause dementia and vascular dementia (VaD), and less strongly with AD.14 Like prior observational studies, however, our study strictly assessed an association between T2D and dementia diagnoses without evaluating a causal relationship.

Mendelian randomization (MR)15 is an analysis approach utilizing genetics to assess evidence of causality between an exposure and an outcome. In observational studies, it is difficult to establish causality because environmental factors can influence both the exposure and outcome. The MR methodology was developed to mitigate these limitations by using genetic variation as an instrumental variable randomized at conception, making the analysis less susceptible to environmental confounders. Given the widespread availability of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), two-sample techniques16 have become popular options for conducting MR analysis. In two-sample MR studies, summary statistics from a GWAS of the exposure are analyzed against summary statistics from a GWAS of the outcome. These techniques are efficient but do not allow for sensitivity tests requiring individual-level data. Two-sample MR studies assessing the causal relationship of T2D and other glycemic traits with the risk of AD or reduced cognitive function have found little evidence of such a relationship.5,17–20 However, the opportunity to apply similar methods to assess causal relationships with outcomes such as vascular dementia has been limited by the lack of published GWAS for this diagnosis.5 One-sample MR is an alternative approach that can take advantage of individual level genotype, exposure, and outcome data in a single study, if the sample has enough power to conduct such analysis. Large clinical biobanks with physician diagnoses and other clinical data are well-suited to this approach.

Our objective in this study was to conduct a one-sample MR analysis in MVP, the largest clinical biobank in the U.S., to evaluate if diabetes (our exposure) causes dementia (our outcome).

2.0 Methods

2.1 Population

We conducted our study in MVP,21 a biobank linking clinical data from the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VA) with genotype data on over 650,000 racially/ethnically diverse individuals.22 The VA Central Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.23 We analyzed MVP participants who were ≥65 years of age at the time of the release of their genotype data, stratified by harmonized ancestry and race/ethnicity classifications (HARE)24 of Non-Hispanic White (EUR), Non-Hispanic Black (AFR), and Hispanic (HIS). HARE classifications are determined through a self-report of race/ethnicity validated with genetic data. An analysis of the statistical power afforded by the available sample for each race/ethnicity can be found in the Supplement (Methods S1, Figure S1).

2.2 Exposure: Instruments Using Genotype Data

We utilized the study sample (N=334,672) of participants with a coefficient of kinship ≤0.088, whose imputed genotype data was from Release 4 of MVP 1.0 as previously described.14,25 Our instruments were 331 statistically significant variants from a T2D GWAS conducted by the Diabetes Meta-analysis of Trans-ethnic Association Studies (DIAMANTE) Consortium26 with European effect sizes from Mahajan et al., 2018.27 We chose not to use a more recent GWAS of type 2 diabetes23 to avoid overfitting, as detailed previously.14 The variants were not in linkage disequilibrium (R2≤0.5),26 and for our initial steps, we retained the rs429358 variant known to be associated with both diabetes and dementia.14

2.3 Outcome: Case-Control Definitions of Dementia

Our outcomes were three clinical diagnoses of dementia (Figure S2): all-cause dementia, vascular dementia (VaD), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), based on International Classification of Diseases 9th (ICD9) or 10th (ICD10) Revision28 diagnosis codes (Table S1). In the VA electronic health record, these codes are logged by presiding physicians during routine clinical care. A case was defined as a participant with at least two ICD 9 or 10 codes corresponding to one or more outcomes, as defined by the grouping in Table S1. Individuals meeting the case definition of AD and VaD were included as cases for both –AD and VaD were not mutually exclusive. Controls were participants without a single dementia ICD code in VA clinical records.

2.4 Statistical Analysis

We compared individuals with/without prevalent T2D using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Prevalent T2D cases were defined as individuals whose first diagnosis occurred prior to MVP enrollment. We used MR15 analysis to evaluate evidence of causality between T2D and dementia diagnoses. The use of MR requires that three assumptions are satisfied (Figure 1): A. The genetic variants serve as strong instruments for the exposure (relevance); B. the instrumental variable (IV) is related to the outcome only through the exposure (exclusion restriction); and C. the IV is not associated with any confounders between the exposure and outcome (exchangeability).

2.5 Two Stage Least Squares Method

We used a two stage least squares (2SLS) MR29 approach to estimate causal associations between T2D and three dementia diagnoses. The 2SLS method employs two regression equations where stage 1 evaluates the genetic risk with the exposure and stage 2 estimates the outcome from the predicted Stage1:x1=γ1+π1G1+v1

Stage2:y=α+β1x^1+u

exposure. For our genetic risk, we regressed a standardized weighted score of valid genetic instruments and effect sizes from published GWAS30 against the log odds of T2D in the MVP biobank, adjusting for 10 genetic principal components. In stage 2, we evaluated the association of the standardized genetically predicted probability of T2D (‘genetically predicted T2D risk’) from stage 1 with our three dementia outcomes using logistic regression adjusting for age, and self-reported sex. To account for the uncertainty inherent in the first stage of the analysis, we utilized the ‘ivtools’ methodology31 to provide estimates for nonlinear models. More precisely, we specified the ‘ts’ estimation method in the R function ‘ivglm’ supplying the regression model output from both stages and reported the resulting estimates. The beta coefficient estimates are the log odds of dementia per standard deviation increase in genetically predicted T2D risk. All models were stratified by HARE group, with a significance threshold of 0.017(0.05/3) to account for multiple testing.

2.6 Quartiles of Genetic Risk

To evaluate the impact of increasing genetic risk of diabetes on the three dementia diagnoses, we also assessed the difference in the odds of dementia by quartiles of diabetes genetic risk. That is, we divided the genetically predicted T2D risk from the first stage of our analysis into quartiles and evaluated the top three quartiles of risk against the lowest risk quartile (reference). In this evaluation, the quartile was treated as a factor input to the second stage of the model and we used the ‘ivglm’ method to account for uncertainty in the first stage. Additionally, we assessed trends in the quartiles of progressive genetic risk using a Cochran Armitage trend test.32,33

2.7 Summarized Data and Pleiotropy Assessment

We also assessed the causal association using two-sample MR methods. We calculated estimates using the inverse-weighted (IVW), median, and MR Egger15 methods recommended in the MendelianRandomization34 R package (v0.3.0). These methods provide effect estimates and standard errors based on summary measures of the relationship with the exposure versus the relationship with the outcome and assess evidence of pleiotropy. We additionally used MR-PRESSO35 to test for outliers (Methods S2) in the list of valid genetic instruments (R version 1.0).35

To additionally assess pleiotropy, we identified variants in the T2D GRS that are associated with potential confounders in large GWAS studies (P&lt;5-e08, MAF&gt;0.1%): BMI,36 smoking initiation,37 glycemic traits (glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]),38 and blood pressure.39 We constructed alternate GRSs removing the overlapped variants and performed a 2SLS MR analysis with each alternate score (Methods S3).

2.8 Glycemic Trait Analysis

We conducted analysis for three glycemic traits associated with diabetes: HbA1c, fasting glucose (FG), and fasting insulin (FI). We did not have individual level data for FG and FI – measures not available in routine clinical care – so we used a two-sample approach for all three traits with published variant weights38 in IVW and MR Egger methods (Methods S4). We assessed consistency, meaning the two methods produced significant results with the same effect direction. Additionally, for HbA1c, individual level data (value nearest to the MVP enrollment date) was available in most MVP participants, so we used a 2SLS approach for this trait in addition to the two-sample approach.

2.9 Addressing Mendelian Randomization Assumptions

We used linear regression to evaluate the weighted instrument strength with diabetes status by race/ethnicity population to test assumption A. An F-statistic &gt;10 in the linear relationship between the instrument and the exposure is conventionally accepted as an indicator of a strong instrument.40 To evaluate pleiotropy (assumption B), we used the MR-Egger method from the R package ‘MendelianRandomization’15,41,42. MR-Egger constructs the best fit line in the relationship between the exposure effects and outcome effects. Pleiotropy is concluded to occur if the slope interceptof this relationship differs from zero. We also used MR_PRESSO35 to check for pleiotropy, with a leave-one out strategy to test for the impact of any single variant. If we found any variants violating the no-pleiotropy assumption, we removed those variants from the analysis. To address assumption C, we calculated E-Values.43 An E-Value puts a boundary on the potential bias introduced by unmeasured confounders. The E-Value is the effect size of an unmeasured confounder, with both the exposure and the outcome, required to explain away the exposure-outcome effect.

3.0 Results

We had 82,980/251,692 participants with/without a T2D diagnosis for a sample size of 334,672 meeting our study inclusion criteria (Table 1). Compared to those without T2D, those with T2D were younger (74.0 versus 74.7 years), less likely to be female (2.5% versus 3.2%), and more likely to be AFR (17.4% versus 11.4%) or HIS (7.5% versus 4.7%). The study sample was 96.7% male, and the prevalence of diabetes and dementia diagnoses differed by sex: diabetes 25% overall, 21% in females, 25% in males; all-cause dementia 7.2% overall, 5% in females, 7.3% in males; VaD 1.3% overall, 0.8% in females, 1.3% in males; AD 1.3% overall, 1.2% in females, 1.3% in males. All-cause dementia and VaD cases were more prevalent in those with T2D than in those without: 8.7% vs 6.7% overall, 6.4% vs 4.6% in females, and 8.8% vs 6.7% in males for all-cause dementia; 2.0% versus 1.0% overall, 1.2% vs 0.7% in females, and 2.0% versus 1.0% in males for VaD. Prevalence of AD was similar between those with/without T2D: 1.4% vs 1.3% overall, 1.1% vs. 1.2% in females, and 1.4% vs 1.3% in males. EUR met the required sample size (96,899) to detect an odds ratio of 1.05 with 80% power (Methods S1), while AFR (43,089) and HIS (18,156) did not.

3.1 Two Stage Least Squares Results

We identified 330 variants meeting our criteria for valid instruments. We call the standardized weighted combination of these variants ‘GRS330’. In stage 1 of the 2SLS model, the odds of diabetes were significantly associated with GRS330 for all three HARE groups (OR of T2D per standard deviation increase in GRS330 in EUR:1.50,P=4.6E-308; AFR:1.28,P=5.2E-125; HIS:1.46,P=3.2E-118). The standardized predicted probability of T2D risk from stage 1 (‘GRS330_Predicted’) was calculated for each individual and the distribution of this value differed by T2D status (Figure 2).

GRS330_Predicted was associated with all dementia diagnoses (Table 2) in EUR. For each standard deviation increase in GRS330_Predicted, the odds of all-cause dementia increased by 1.07([1.05–1.08]P=3.40E-18). We found similar results for VaD (OR=1.11[1.07–1.15],P=3.63E-09) and AD (OR=1.06[1.02–1.09],P=6.84E-04). In AFR, GRS330_Predicted was associated (Table 2) with all-cause dementia (OR=1.06[1.02–1.10],P=3.66E-03), VaD (OR=1.11[1.04–1.19],P=2.20E-03), and AD (OR= 1.12[1.02–1.23],P=1.60E-02). For HIS, there were no statistically significant associations (Table 2) between GRS330_Predicted and any dementia diagnosis (all P&gt;.05).

3.2 Quartile Analysis Results

The risk of dementia diagnosis differed by quartile of GRS330_Predicted (Figure 3). In EUR, the 4th quartile of GRS330_Predicted increased the odds of all dementia diagnoses compared to the 1st quartile (Figure 3a): all-cause dementia (OR=1.18,[1.14–1.24], P=3.82E-15), VaD (OR=1.33[1.20–1.47]P=3.08E-08), and AD (OR=1.14[1.03–1.25]P=8.13E-03). We observed similar results for the comparison of the 4th quartile of genetically-predicted T2D risk to the 1st in AFR (Figure 3b) for all-cause dementia (OR=1.18[1.06–1.32]P=3.33E-03) and VaD (OR=1.42[1.16–1.74]P=6.63E-04), but not for AD (P=.07). In HIS, none of the quartile associations were statistically significant (all P&gt;.18).

The Cochran-Armitage32,44 trend test (Table S2) for the relationship between GRS330_Predicted quartiles and dementia diagnoses was significant for all-cause dementia (P=3.6e-05) and VaD (P=3.6e-05) but not AD (P=.82) in EUR. The trend tests for GRS330_Predicted quartiles and dementia were not significant for any diagnosis in AFR or HIS (all P&gt;.05).

3.3 Summarized Data/Pleiotropy Results

For the two-sample MR approaches, we used GRS330 for the exposure. All methods for assessing the association between GRS330 and all-cause dementia in EUR provided consistent, significant effect directions with the primary 2SLS analyses (Figure 4a, Table S3). Results for AFR (Figure 4b) and HIS (Figure 4c) were directionally consistent with those of EUR except for the MR Egger approach in AFR (Figure 4b), though the associations were not always statistically significant (Table S3). Similarly, the two-sample methods provided consistent results with the primary one-sample analysis for other dementia subtypes, though not always achieving statistical significance (Results S1, Figure S3).

In additional evaluation of pleiotropy, MR results (Results S2.a, Table S4) for all dementia diagnoses were consistent in EUR when performed using alternate GRS that excluded variants associated with potentially confounding traits. For AFR, all-cause dementia and VaD retained their associations when MR was performed with alternate GRS while AD did not. None of the associations with the alternate GRS in HIS were significant. To provide a comprehensive list of other potential pleiotropic effects, we extracted associations from other GWAS using gwasrapidd (Results S2.b, Table S5).45

3.4 Glycemic Trait Results

Using the two-sample method for glycemic traits, we found no associations for FG with any dementia diagnosis in any population (Results S3, Table S6). We found consistent, significant associations for FI with all-cause dementia (IVW:1.58[1.26,2],P= 1.03E-04; MR Egger:1.07[1.07,1.08],P&lt;6.82E-03) and AD in EUR (IVW:2.09[1.28,3.41],P=3.33E-03; MR Egger:1.17[1.15,1.2],P&lt;8.15E-03) but not in AFR and HIS. We found consistent, significant associations for HbA1c with VaD in AFR (IVW:1.45[1.26,1.67],P=2.21E-07;MR Egger:1.48[1.26,1.74],P=1.61E-06) and risk-lowering associations in HIS (Results S3,Table S6).

In the 2SLS approach used for HbA1c, we found a significant relationship between genetically predicted HbA1c (1.02[1,1.03],P=.012) with all-cause dementia in EUR (Results S4, Table S7, Table S8) but not for any dementia diagnosis in AFR (all P&gt;.12). In HIS, the results were risk-lowering (Results S4, Table S7, Table S8).

3.5 Assessment of Mendelian Randomization Assumptions

Assumption A.

Strong Instrument (relevance): The final 330 valid instruments (GRS330) demonstrated a significant association with diabetes. The F-statistics in the linear associations between the instruments and diabetes were 61.8 for HIS, 57.3 for AFR, and 740.4 for EUR.

Assumption B.

Pleiotropy (exclusion restriction): The MR Egger test with GRS330 did not exhibit pleiotropy (P&gt;.05, Table S9). However, when additionally including the rs429358 variant known to be associated with both T2D and dementia, heterogeneity was detected (Table S9, all P&lt;.017) except in the case of HIS with VaD. This heterogeneity was attenuated when removing rs429358 from the tests (all P&gt;.01). The MR_PRESSO test (Table S10) characterized rs429358 as an outlier in the relationship between the exposure effect and outcome effect for all HARE groups and all clinical dementia diagnoses except HIS with VaD. Given the pleiotropy and heterogeneity results, we excluded rs429358 and used GRS330 as our valid instrument.

Assumption C.

Unmeasured Confounders (exchangeability): The sensitivity E-Value calculations were based on our previous work14 in which we calculated odds ratios for the association of GRS330 with each clinical diagnosis of dementia stratified by HARE group. We used the recommended risk ratio formula43 for the scenario in which disease prevalence is less than 15%. As the odds ratios ranged from 1.02 to 1.15, the E-Value ranged from 1.16 to 1.57 with the E-Value of the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval ranging from 1.0 to 1.4. (Table S11).

4.0 Discussion

We found evidence of causality between T2D and all-cause dementia and clinically diagnosed VaD in EUR, with similar results in AFR. The effect estimates in HIS were similar to EUR/AFR but without statistical significance. The relationship between T2D and clinically diagnosed AD had a reduced effect estimate in EUR in comparison to all-cause dementia but an increased effect estimate in AFR, indicating a need for further research to elucidate the differences by HARE group.

Given the wealth of observational data linking T2D and dementia, researchers have hypothesized a causal relationship between the two but have found little evidence to support such a conclusion. In work focused on AD, several studies found no evidence of a relationship with genetically predicted T2D risk: a Danish study by Thomassen et al.,5 the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project by Østergaard et. al.,18 the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) by Walter et al.,17 and DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) and Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) by Pan et. al.46 When focused on general cognitive impairment as the outcome, Ware et. al.20 (HRS) and Garfield19 (UK Biobank) had similar results. A key reason our study was able to identify evidence of causality was because we had multiple diagnoses of dementia: the broad category of all-cause dementia as well as VaD and AD. Studies that utilize two-sample approaches must rely on published GWAS which have only been conducted on the specific diagnosis of AD. Additionally, the dementia phenotype definitions in our Table S1 are quite extensive while other studies have utilized just a few ICD codes. As examples, Thomassen5 used F00 and G30 for AD, F01 for VaD, and F03 for unspecified dementia, and Garfield19 used the UK Biobank definitions for AD: F00 and G30, a subset of Table S1. The earlier studies did not achieve statistical significance in their results, yet the strength and direction of effect in our study for AD (OR=1.06[1.02–1.09]) is comparable to Thomassen5 (OR=1.04[0.98–1.10]) while Garfield19 in the UK Biobank had a stronger effect and wider variability (1.15[0.87–1.52]) but directional consistency with our results. It is unlikely that the one-sample versus two-sample methodology explains the difference given the consistent results we found when utilizing the two-sample approach.

While previous studies linking T2D with AD did not report evidence supporting causality, studies deciphering mechanisms related to T2D have offered insight. Walter et al.,17 discovered that genetically-predicted insulin sensitivity was causally associated with AD in HRS, consistent with our MR associations of FI with all-cause dementia and AD in EUR. In a like manner, Pan et.al.,46 detected a causal relationship when assessing genetic instruments for higher fasting glucose and lower HOMA-β-cell function with AD using a two-sample MR approach across the DIAGRAM and MAGIC consortia, which we did not confirm in MR analysis of FG in our study sample. Tschritter et.al.,12 demonstrated a cortical activity response difference to insulin infusion between carriers and non-carriers of the 972Arg variant of the IRS-1 gene known to be associated with T2D,48 as well as a similar response difference between lean (insulin-sensitive) and obese (insulin-resistant) individuals. Finally, the significant two-sample MR association with a large effect size of HbA1c with VaD in AFR is consistent with associations of HbA1c with vascular disease49. However, the MR analyses of HbA1c were inconsistent between methods and across race/ethnicity groups, making a coherent interpretation challenging.

We had several limitations in our study. First, given the small proportion of females, our results are largely driven by male participants and so cannot be generalized to both sexes. Given the preponderance of male participants (96.7%), we did not conduct interaction tests by sex. However, we did see a difference in all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD by diabetes diagnosis in males and females, suggesting that the underlying association of interest did not differ by sex. Second, our outcomes were determined based on a physician’s diagnosis which may cause some imprecision. Lastly, we did not have the necessary power to detect an effect in the African American and Hispanic populations and our T2D weighting structure, based on a previous study of European ancestry might overlook important genetic architecture specific to the other two study populations.

Despite these limitations, we conclude from our one-sample MR study in a large US biobank that there is evidence of a causal association of diabetes with dementia. Our alternate GRS tests when eliminating variants associated with potential confounders further strengthen this evidence. Moreover, the difference in the strength of effect in the association of VaD versus AD in the European population is suggestive of different mechanisms and the strength of association for both VaD and AD in the African population (despite being underpowered) invites further investigation. Establishing a causal association represents a first step toward examining the potential impact of the expanding prevalence of diabetes on dementia incidence and whether diabetes prevention and/or treatment can mitigate dementia risk.
