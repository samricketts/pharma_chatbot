Risk genes influence the chance of an individual developing disease over their lifetime, while age at onset (AAO) genes influence disease timing. These two categories are not disjoint; a gene that influences AAO might also appear to influence risk. When an allele influences both AAO and risk, a reasonable question is whether we would have more power to detect association using a statistical test based on risk or AAO. To address this question, we compared power analytically for the Cochran-Armitage trend case-control test for risk and a linear regression case-only test for AAO. We also used simulations to compare the power of these tests with a 2-df joint test (which combines the risk and AAO statistics) and the Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) survival model testing AAO (with censored data in controls). We found that when there is little heterogeneity the case-control risk test has more power than the case-only AAO test (with equivalent sample sizes), but when the model is complex (e.g., with heterogeneity or reduced penetrance) the relationship reverses. The joint test generally outperforms the risk or AAO test alone and ultimately is our recommendation as a powerful alternative in many scenarios.

Introduction

Genetic studies of complex diseases often look for genes that influence one’s risk of developing disease, or more specifically try to identify variants where genotypes increase or decrease the probability of an individual having disease. This is typically accomplished by comparing genotype (or allele) frequencies between a group of affected individuals (cases) and a group of unaffected individuals (controls). A test for frequency differences may be referred to as a case-control test, and genetic variants with genotypes that are significantly associated with disease are referred to as risk variants since they directly or indirectly influence one’s risk of developing disease. Most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have focused on identifying risk genes, and many have resulted in several well-established risk genes for complex diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease and macular degeneration (Edwards et al., 2010; Fritsche et al., 2016; Naj et al., 2011).

Instead of modeling disease risk, endophenotypes or other disease-related metrics may be investigated to aid the discovery of genes related to the etiology of the disease. The timing of disease onset, or age at onset (AAO), has been of great interest. To identify genes that control AAO, some statistical tests assess association between genotypes (or alleles) and AAO (as a quantitative variable) in a group of cases. Since unaffected individuals do not have disease, and hence have no AAO, they are not used in traditional AAO association tests; such AAO tests are thus case-only tests and genetic variants with genotypes that are associated with AAO are referred to as AAO variants. Genetic associations with AAO have been identified for many complex human diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, asthma, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington disease (e.g., Naj et al., 2014; Blauwendraat et al., 2019; Forno et al., 2012; Mehta et al., 2019).

These two categories, risk and AAO variants, are not disjoint. A variant that influences AAO could also be considered a risk variant; for example, if a specific allele lowers AAO, then we would expect that allele to be enriched in a set of cases (relative to controls) taken at any cross-sectional timepoint, and therefore be associated with increased disease risk. An example of a genetic variant that has been shown to have both AAO and risk effects on Alzheimer disease is the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). The APOE-e4 allele has been shown to increase risk, with each additional allele (OR~3 for APOE-e4e3 heterozygotes and ~15 for APOE-e4 homozygotes) and each APOE-e4 allele decreases AAO by several years (Corder et al., 1993).

In this paper we explore the scenario in which a variant influences AAO and also risk specifically through its influence on AAO. We address the question of whether we would have more power to detect such a variant using a case-control risk test or a case-only AAO test, or some alternative. For this paper, we derive analytic approximations for power of case-control risk tests and case-only AAO tests under a unified genetic model for AAO and risk. These approximations allow us to compare power over a wide range of parameter values. Simulations were used to expand this exploration to consider alternative statistics, a joint test and survival analysis. The results have important implications for choice of test statistic(s), study design and interpretation.

Methods

Genetic Model for AAO and Risk

We assume that there is a biallelic variant that influences AAO through a classic quantitative trait model. Specifically, assume that an individual has AAO given as a random variable, Y, where the probability distribution of Y is a mixture of normal distributions, with mixing probabilities dependent on genotype frequencies at some variant locus. We denote an individual’s genotype as a random variable G, which is the count of the number of minor alleles: G = g, for g =0, 1 or 2, and let the population genotype frequencies be pg. Suppose that for each value of G, the AAO variable Y is normally distributed: fg(Y∣G=g)≡N(μg,σ2)forg=0,1,2.

This allows each genotype to have a different mean AAO, but we assume for simplicity that they all have the same within-genotype variance. We note for clarity that we use G when we refer to the random variable and g when we refer to values or indices. The assumption of normality for the genotype-specific AAO distributions in the population is a simplifying assumption, but it is not an unrealistic approximation for AAO for late-onset diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (Kamboh et al., 2012). For early-onset diseases a Weibull distribution, which is commonly assumed in survival analysis, might be more appropriate for AAO.

In order to model disease risk, we assume that individuals are ascertained at a fixed age A and their affection status is determined by their AAO relative to this age. Specifically, if Y ≤ A then the individual is affected with some probability γ1; otherwise the individual is unaffected. This allows us to compute the genotype-specific penetrances: (1) πg=γ1Fg(A)forg=0,1,2,

where Fg(·) is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of Y for genotype G = g. The factor γ1 allows for reduced penetrance, so not everyone with AAO (due to this locus) smaller than A becomes affected. This means that achieving one’s AAO is necessary but not sufficient for developing disease, a model that is more appropriate for complex diseases than a fully penetrant model. It is then straightforward to compute the genotype frequencies in affected and unaffected individuals, pag and pug, respectively: (2) pag=P(G=g∣affected)=πgpgKand

pug=P(G=g∣unaffected)=(1−πg)pg1−Kforg=0,1,2,

where K is the disease prevalence: K=∑g=02πgpg.

The above model allows for reduced penetrance, but all affected individuals have AAO determined by this locus, an unrealistic assumption for complex diseases. To model heterogeneity of AAO in affecteds, we assume that a proportion of individuals, θ, have AAO determined by the locus of interest (LOI), while the remaining individuals have AAO (and affection status) determined by some other factor or factor (OF). The other factor(s) may be genetic or environmental, but are assumed to be unrelated to the locus of interest. Under this heterogeneity model, AAO has a mixture distribution with proportion θ following the genotype-specific distribution given above, fg(Y∣G = g), and proportion 1 – θ following the distribution fh(Y)≡N(μh,oh2), where μh and oh2 are constants independent of G. Under this model, the penetrances for genotype g become (3) πg=θγ1Fg(A)+(1−θ)γ2Fh(A)forg=0,1,2,

where Fh (·) is the cdf of Y when AAO is due to OF and γ2 is a probability allowing for reduced penetrance of OF. The genotype frequencies in affected and unaffected individuals, pag and pug, can be calculated as in (2) with this new definition of πg.

To visualize the above model, examples of the AAO distributions are shown in Figure 1. We show the AAO distribution in the population at large, and in affected and unaffected individuals from which cases and controls are drawn, respectively. The area under each genotype-specific distribution gives its genotype frequency, shown in the legends. Figure 1A shows that when there is no heterogeneity (θ = 1) and complete penetrance (γ1 = 1), the population AAO distribution is bisected at the ascertainment age (A = 85); all affected individuals have AAO before age 85 and all unaffected individuals have AAO after age 85. Incomplete penetrance at the LOI (γ1 = 0.2) allows some unaffected individuals to have AAO smaller than 85 (bottom right panel of Figure 1A), but it does not change the AAO distribution for affecteds. Because penetrance is small in this example, a substantial part of the AAO distribution for unaffecteds is smaller than 85, which makes the genotype frequencies in unaffecteds much more similar to frequencies in affecteds than in the full penetrance case. The impact of heterogeneity (θ = 0.2) is shown in Figure 1B. Heterogeneity of AAO leads to more variation of AAO in the population and brings AAO genotype-specific means in the affected population closer together. In the heterogeneity model, reducing penetrance changes the AAO distributions for both affected and unaffected individuals, making genotype frequencies in both more similar to population frequencies. Reduced penetrance further shrinks the difference between the genotype-specific AAO means in the affecteds; the means are less than half a year apart in our example with θ = 0.2 and γ1 = 0.2.

Case-Control Test for Risk

Here we consider the Cochran-Armitage (CA) trend test because of its limited assumptions and ease of analytic power calculations. Following Slager and Schaid (2001), let rg and sg be the number of cases and controls, respectively, with genotype g = 0,1, or 2. The total number of cases is R=∑g=02rg and total number of controls is S=∑g=02sg, and the total sample size is N = R + S. Then U=∑g=02g(SNrg−RNsg)

and Var(U)^=RSN3[N∑g=02g2(rg+sg)−(∑g=02g(rg+sg))2]

and the CA test statistic is T=UVar(U)^.

Slager and Schaid (2001) show that the power of the two-sided CA test at significance level α is (4) power=Φ(−z(1−α∕2)σ0−μσ1)+1−Φ(z(1−α∕2)σ0−μσ1)

where Φ(·) is the cumulative distribution from a standard normal distribution and z(1–α/2) is the standard normal quantile corresponding to probability 1–α/2. The term μ is the expected value of U: μ=Nφ(1−φ)∑g=02g(pag−pug),

where φ = R/N. The variance of U under the alternative hypothesis is σ12=Nφ(1−φ)2[∑g=02g2pag−(∑g=02gpag)2]+Nφ2(1−φ)[∑g=02g2pug−(∑g=02gpug)2].

Under the null hypothesis pag = pug = pg and the form of the variance simplifies to σ02=Nφ(1−φ)[∑g=02g2pg−(∑g=02gpg)2].

We note that for power/sample size calculations, we use the formula pg = φpag + (1 – φ)pug in this null-variance formula.

As described by Slager and Schaid (2001), these calculations can be turned around to compute the required sample size for a specified level of power. Define μ* = μ/N, σ1∗2=σ12∕N and σ0∗2=σ02∕N. Then (5) N&gt;z(1−α∕2)σ0∗−z(1−power)σ1∗μ∗2ifμ∗&gt;0orN&gt;z(1−α∕2)σ0∗+z(power)σ1∗μ∗2ifμ∗&lt;0.

The required sample size is infinite at μ* = 0 because this represents the null hypothesis.

Case-Only Test for AAO

For the case-only test for AAO, we consider the linear regression model with AAO as the outcome (dependent) variable and genotype as the predictor (independent) variable: (6) Yi=β0+β1Gi+εi

where Yi and Gi are the values of the AAO and genotypic variables, respectively, for the ith individual. A test of H0: β1 = 0 assesses association between genotype and AAO, and is based on a statistic with the form (7) Q=β1^Var(β1)^^.

The regression model above assumes that the εi are independent with mean 0. Though we defined the genotypic-specific AAO distributions each to have the same variance σ2 in the general population, this may not be true for the genotypic-specific AAO distributions among cases; thus we assume that a robust heteroscedasticity-consistent estimate is used to estimate Var(β1^)^, e.g., in verifying our power calculations with simulations, we used HC1 from Hinkley (1977). With these assumptions, the statistic Q follows an asymptotic normal distribution: Q∼AN(β1Var(β1)^,1).

The parameter β1 is a function of the covariance between AAO and the genotypic random variable and the variance of the genotypic variable specifically in the case population: β1=Cov(Y,G∣affected)Var(G∣affected).

The denominator of β1 is straightforward based on previous parameter definitions: Var(G∣affected)=∑g=02g2pag−(∑g=02gpag)2.

The numerator, Cov(Y, G∣affected), can be computed by recognizing that for each value of g = 0,1,2, the AAO among the affecteds follows a mixture of truncated normal distributions with truncation point at the ascertainment age A. Under the heterogeneity model described above, this mixture distribution for genotype G = g is (8) fg(Y∣G=g,affected)≡(πg1πg)truncN(μg,σ2,A)+(πh2πg)truncN(μh,oh2,A),

where πg = πg1 + πh2 is the penetrance for genotype g = 0,1, 2; πg1 = θγ1 Fg(A) is the joint probability of being affected and AAO coming from the LOI given genotype G = g; and πh2 = (1 – θ)γ2 Fh(A) is the joint probability of being affected and AAO due to the OF, which is the same for all g.

The truncated normal distribution truncN(μg, σ2, A) has mean (9) μTg=μg−σϕ(A−μgσ)Φ(A−μgσ)

and variance (10) σTg2=σ2(1+(A−μgσ)ϕ(A−μgσ)Φ(A−μgσ)−(ϕ(A−μgσ)Φ(A−μgσ))2),

where ϕ(·) the standard normal probability density function (and from before Φ(·) is the standard normal cdf). For the second term of (8), μTh and σTh2 can be defined analogously for truncN(μh,oh2,A).

It follows from the properties of mixture distributions that E(Y∣G=g,affected)=(πg1πg)μTg+(πh2πg)μTh

andE(Y∣affected)=∑g=02E(Y∣G=g,affected)pag

=∑g=02(πg1K)μTgpg+(πh2K)μTh.

Similarly, E(YG∣affected)=∑g=02(πg1K)μTggpg+(πh2K)μTh∑g=02gpgandE(G∣affected)=∑g=02gpag.

We can then write the numerator of β1:

Cov(Y,G∣affected) = E(YG∣,affected) – E(Y∣affected)E(G∣affected) =[∑g=02(πg1K)μTggpg+(πh2K)μTh∑g=02gpg]−[∑g=02(πg1K)μTgpg+(πh2K)μTh][∑g=02gpag]=∑g=02(πg1K)μTgpg[g−(∑g=02g′pag′)]+(πh2K)μTh∑g=02g(pg−pag).

These expressions can be used to compute the value β1 of for any set of parameter values: (11) β1=∑g=02(πg1K)μTgpg[g−(∑g′=02g′pag′)]+(πh2K)μTh∑g=02g(pg−pag)∑g=02g2pag−(∑g=02gpag)2.

The variance of β1^ is derived in the Appendix: (12) Var(β1^)=E(Var(β1^∣G))+Var(E(β1^∣G))≈1R{∑g=02pagBg(g−μ)2+[∑g=02Cppag(g−μ)]2Λ[∑g=02pag(g−μ)2]2},

where Λ={∑g=02pagCg2(g−μ)2−2[∑g=02pagCg(g−μ)2][∑g=02pagCg]+[∑g=02pagCg]2[∑g=02pag(g−μ)2][∑g=02Cgpag(g−μ)]2+{∑g=02pag(g−μ)4}[∑g=02pag(g−μ)2]2−2{[∑g=02pagCg(g−μ)3]−(∑g=02pagCg)(∑g=02pag(g−μ)3)}[∑g=02Cgpag(g−μ)][∑g=02pag(g−μ)2]}

Bg=[(πg1πg)σTg2+(πh2πg)σTh2+(πg1πg)(πh2πg)(μTg−μTh)2]

Cg=[(πg1πg)μTg+(πh2πg)μTh]

Finally, we can use asymptotic normality of Q and the expressions for β1 and Var(β^1) to derive formulas for power and required sample size of the AAO test: (13) power=Φ(−z(1−α2)−β1Var(β^1))+1−Φ(z(1−α2)−β1Var(β^1))

If we define Var∗(β1^)=R[Var(β1^)], then we can write the required sample size for a specified power as follows: (14) R&gt;(z(1−α∕2)−z(1−power))2Var∗(β1^)β12β1&gt;0;R&gt;(Z(1−α∕2)+z(power))2Var∗(β1^)β12β1&lt;0.

At β1 = 0 the required sample size is infinite.

Joint Test for Risk and AAO

We also consider a joint test for risk and AAO. We can view the AAO and risk data as arising from a two-part model, where one part is the binary indicator of affection status and the second part is the AAO, which is observed only in affecteds. This is a variation of the two-part models discussed by Lachenbruch (Lachenbruch, 2001a; Lachenbruch, 2001b). We can write the joint statistic as the sum of squared risk and AAO statistics: J=T2+Q2.

Under the null hypothesis of H0:(pag = pug ∀g) and (β1 = 0), the joint statistic has a central chi-square distribution with 2df: J∼χ(2df)2. Under our genetic model, where genotype frequency differences between cases and controls are the result solely of an AAO effect, this null is equivalent to equality of genotype-specific AAO means, H0:μ0 = μ1 = μ2. Though under the null hypothesis, the parts (T and Q) are independent, Belotti et al. (2015) emphasize that consistency does not require independence between the two parts of the joint statistic. It is not straightforward, however, to compute power analytically due to correlation between the statistics when the alternative hypothesis is true. For this reason, we used computer simulations to estimate the power of the joint test.

Survival Analysis

We focused initially on the case-only linear regression statistic for a test of AAO because of its classic use in QTL models and ease in theoretical derivations. However, a case-only test loses information about genotype and age contained in control individuals. The AAO for control individuals is censored at their latest age of exam (or age of ascertainment in our model). Survival analysis methods can be used to recapture this information. Here we consider the test from Cox Proportional Hazards model with time t defined as either the AAO for cases or ascertainment age, A, for controls. The hazard function at time t given genotype G is defined as follows: (15) λ(t∣G)=λ0(t)eβsG,

where λ0(t) is the baseline hazard at G = 0. In our context, the hazard function is equivalent to the probability that an individual is affected at age t given their genotype. The null hypothesis of the Cox model is βs = 0, which makes the hazard function independent of genotype. This will be true whenever the genotypic AAO means are all equal: μ0 = μ1 = μ2. Based on the partial log-likelihood of the hazard function, the effect of genotype on AAO (β^s) can be estimated through maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and can be tested by the Wald test. In this study, we obtained empirical power for the survival model using simulation studies.

Simulations

Simulations were used to validate our analytic approximations and estimate power when analytic approximations were not feasible (for the joint and survival analysis). Data were simulated using R following the genetic model for AAO and risk described above. Given values for model parameters and sample sizes, we estimated the power and/or Type I error as the average number of significant tests over the total number of replicates (1000 replicates for power estimates and 10,000 for Type I error). The following R functions were used to compute p-values for the different tests: CochranArmitageTest() for the case-control CA Test for risk, glm() with AAO as an outcome for the case-only test for AAO, and coxph() for survival analysis. For the glm model, we used coeftest with variance-covariance model=HC1 to provide a test with a heteroscedasticity-consistent variance estimator (D. Hinkley, 1977).

Results

We began by comparing the required sample size from our analytic formulas for the Cochran-Armitage trend test for risk (CA-Test) and the case-only linear regression test for AAO (QT-Test) to achieve 80% power at a significance level of 0.00001. These values were chosen arbitrarily and it is expected that conclusions would be qualitatively the same for different values of power and significance levels. Sample size is defined as the total number of individuals in the test: the number of cases and controls needed for the CA-Test or the number of cases needed for the QT-test. For all examples, we set genotypic-specific AAO means to be similar to what we see in a large Alzheimer disease sample for APOE-e4 genotypes (μ0 = 75, μ1 = 72, μ2 = 69) (Martin et al., 2019). We first considered the simplest case of no heterogeneity of AAO and then introduced complexity into the model.

Models with No Heterogeneity

For these simple models, we fixed θ = 1 and looked at the impact of varying minor allele frequency (MAF), the within-genotype AAO standard deviation (σ), ascertainment age (A), and penetrance (γ1). We used default parameter values of MAF = 0.15, σ = 6 (similar the APOE effect in AD (Martin et al., 2019)), A = 85 (reasonable for a late-onset disease), and γ1 = 1 (full penetrance), and varied each parameter in turn. We assumed that genotype frequencies in the population follow Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for our examples, though this is not required for validity of analytic calculations.

The results in Figure 2A show that the required sample sizes for the CA-test of risk (solid line) and the QT-test (dashed line) are similar across the range of MAF (e.g., with MAF = 0.25 the QT-test requires 333 cases, while the CA-test requires 156 cases and 156 controls totaling 312 individuals). There are small differences in required sample sizes at the extremes. For common alleles, the required sample size is larger for the QT-test than the CA-test, while the pattern reverses for rarer alleles. For both tests, required sample size decreases as MAF gets close to its maximum value of 0.5. Results are also similar for the two tests as for small values of σ (Figure 2B). For larger values of σ the QT-test requires a larger sample size than the CA-test. For both tests, the required sample size increases with increasing σ, but the effect is more dramatic for QT-test.

In Figure 2C, we varied the ascertainment age A. We see that the required sample sizes for the CA-test and QT-test are similar for large values of A; however, there is a dramatic difference in the required sample size for the lower values of A, with the QT-test requiring far more samples than the CA-test. The CA-test is well powered when A is small because this creates large differences between genotype frequencies in cases and controls. This occurs because, under our model, when A is small (see Supplemental Figure 1 for a visual example), most individuals in the population will be unaffected since their AAO is greater than A. So control genotype frequencies will be close to the population genotype frequencies. On the other hand, cases come from the left tail of the AAO distribution and will be enriched for the minor allele, which is associated with earlier AAO. In our examples, this enrichment actually makes the minor allele the more frequent allele among the cases for A =40 and 50, leading to large differences in case and control genotype frequencies and very small required sample sizes for the CA-test (N=49 and 85, respectively). In contrast, the QT-test requires samples sizes of 9249 and 4412 cases for A =40 and 50, respectively. This is because when A is small, the distribution of AAO among cases becomes very narrow (since all cases must have AAO &lt; A), making it difficult to distinguish the genotype-specific AAO means. For example, when A = 50, the genotype-specific AAO means among cases (equation 9) are μTg = 48.69, 48.55 and 48.37 for g = 0, 1, 2, respectively; and the genotype-specific AAO variances among cases (equation 10) are, σTg2=1.58, 1.91, 2.36 for g = 0, 1, 2, respectively (see Supplemental Figure 1). Therefore, large sample sizes are needed to detect the small differences with the QT-test.

To begin to introduce complexity, we considered reduced penetrance models (Figure 2D) by varying γ1. Note that the required sample size for the QT-test does not vary as we change the penetrance because the AAO distribution in affected individuals is unchanged with reduced penetrance when θ = 1 (as in Figure 1A). This follows from our analytic derivations by noticing that pag, μTg and σTg2 are independent of γ1. On the other hand, the required sample size for the CA-test is much larger for small values of γ1. This is because although γ1 has no impact on genotype frequencies in the cases, it does change genotype frequencies in controls, with smaller γ1 making control genotype frequencies look more like those in cases (see for example Figure 1A).

Models with Heterogeneity

For complex diseases, we expect a specific variant to contribute only a small proportion to the overall variation in AAO or disease risk. To model a more complex situation, we re-examined the previous scenarios with θ = 0.2, which allows for a 20% chance that an individual’s AAO is controlled by the locus of interest (LOI) and 80% chance that it is controlled by other factors (OF). We used the same AAO distribution for the LOI and default parameter values as above (A=85, MAF=0.15, σ = 6 and γ1 = 1), varying each for Figures 3A-3D. All examples used values of μh = 72 and σh = 15 for the distribution of AAO due to the OF. The penetrance associated with OF was set to γ2 = 1 for Figures 3A-3D and varied in Figure 3E.

Comparing the plots in Figure 3 to Figure 2, we see that heterogeneity has a strong impact on the power of both CA- and QT-tests. Required sample sizes when there is heterogeneity are orders of magnitude larger than in the model with no heterogeneity (θ = 1, Figure 2). The patterns and relative difference of required sample sizes for the CA-Test and QT-test are also significantly altered by heterogeneity. For example, the QT-test now shows a clear advantage, needing far fewer samples than the CA-test, for all MAF values (Figure 3A).

Figure 3B shows the required sample size of the QT-test behaves as expected, steadily increasing with increasing σ. However, the CA-test shows a different pattern, with larger sample sizes required when σ is small. In fact, the required sample size of the CA-test goes to infinity as σ goes to 0. Though initially counter-intuitive, this result does make sense for our model with the following reasoning (see Supplemental Figure 2 for an example with σ = 3). With heterogeneity, AAO may come from either the LOI or OF. If σ is small, the bulk of the AAO distribution from the LOI will be smaller than A (because our genotypic AAO means are all much smaller than A), and thus almost all individuals with AAO from the LOI will be affected, regardless of their genotype. Some affected individuals will also have AAO from the OF distribution, but genotype at the LOI is assumed to be independent of these values. Taken together, this means that in the affected population overall, genotype frequencies at the LOI will be similar to the population frequencies. It also follows for small σ that, since almost all individuals with AAO determined by the LOI will be affected, controls are more likely to have their AAO determined by the OF. Since LOI genotype is independent of AAO from the OF distribution, controls, like cases, will also have genotype frequencies similar to the population frequencies at the LOI. The genotype frequencies in cases and controls become more similar as σ shrinks, becoming equal in the extreme example of σ = 0, explaining the diminishing power for the CA-test. This scenario with small σ is particularly interesting as it represents a scenario when an AAO gene with a detectable AAO effect has a negligible risk effect.

A similar phenomenon happens when ascertainment age, A, is large (Figure 3C). The effect of large values of A is the same as small values of σ, resulting in almost all individuals with AAO from the LOI being affected, leading to similar genotype frequencies in cases and controls. This is why required sample size for the CA-test increases for A&gt;~80. The QT-test, on the other hand, benefits from capturing more of the AAO distribution from the LOI when A is large and needs relatively fewer samples to detect the difference in AAO means. Small values of A have the opposite effect: almost all individuals with AAO from the LOI will be unaffected and cases will have AAO determined largely from OF. The outcome is increasing required sample size with smaller ascertainment age for A&lt;~70 for both the CA-test and QT-test (see Supplemental Figure 3A for examples with A=90 and 50).

The results for the extreme values of A in Figure 3C make sense, but The behavior of the results for the QT-test for A in the middle (~70-80) are initially perplexing. The required sample size increases relatively steeply at A~70 but then sharply decreases at A~77, continuing to decrease as A increases. The reason for this non-monotonic behavior of the QT-test is not immediately obvious, but we can gain some intuition if we consider how the genotype-specific means change for values of A in the middle. When A is large (e.g., Figure 1B), most individuals with AAO determined by the LOI will be affected; the genotype-specific AAO means among affecteds are shifted and closer together (because of heterogeneity and truncation), but they maintain the same order as the means in the population. As A decreases, the proportion of cases due to the LOI decreases brings the means even closer together (e.g., A=77 Supplemental Figure 3B); this explains the generally increasing required sample size for the QT-test as A decreases to ~77 (Figure 3C). However, between A=77 and A=76, the genotype-specific AAO means actually change order in the affected population. At A=76, the heterozygous genotype, which has mean AAO between the means of the other genotypes in the population, actually becomes the largest mean AAO in the affecteds (Supplemental Figure 3B). As A moves from 73 to 72, the order of the means flips completely in the cases such that the minor allele has the latest mean AAO (Supplemental Figure 3C). This order of means is maintained as A gets smaller and at first the required sample is decreases, but as A gets smaller than ~70, the increasing proportion of affecteds with AAO due to OF brings the means close enough together that the required sample size begins to increase again. Notably, in this region of A~70-80, where the required sample size of the QT-test increases, the required sample size for the CA-test is at its smallest.

Figure 3D shows that, unlike the previous example with θ = 1 (Figure 2D), when there is heterogeneity changing the penetrance, γ1 does affect the power of the QT-test. We can see from formulas (2) and (3) that when θ ≠ 1 genotype frequencies in the affected individuals are dependent on γ1 (provided γ2 ≠ 0). We find that both the CA- and QT-tests have decreasing required sample sizes as γ1 increases, but the QT-test consistently requires fewer samples. The QT-test also needs fewer samples than the CA-test across values of γ2, the penetrance associated with the OF (Figure 3E). The QT-test requires the fewest samples when γ2 is small, and even for large values of γ2, the QT-test needs &lt;20% of the samples as the CA-test.

For Figures 4A-C, we used the same default parameters as in Figures 3A-C (θ = 0.2, A = 85, MAF=0.15, σ = 6), but made the model even more complex by letting there be incomplete penetrance for both the LOI and OF, γ1 = 0.2 and γ2 = 0.2. The results for the QT-test are exactly the same as in the full penetrance models in Figures 3A-C. This occurs because whenever γ1 = γ2, the weights (πg1πg) and (πh2πg) in equation (8) are constant, and hence the AAO distribution in affecteds is unchanged. There is, however, a substantial increase in required sample size for the CA-test compared to the full penetrance model.

Figures 4D and 4E vary γ1 and γ2, respectively. Interestingly, the QT-test in Figure 4D requires fewer samples than the model with γ2 = 1 (Figure 3D). This is because decreasing γ2, increases (πg1πg), the proportion of AAO among affecteds attributable to the LOI versus OF, which increases power of the QT-test. In Figure 4E, we see that both tests lose power relative to the model with γ2 = 1 (Figure 3E). For all examples in Figures 4A-E, the CA-test needs far more samples than the QT-test.

The Joint Test and Survival Analysis

We also considered a joint test and survival analysis that utilize both AAO and case-control status information. Since analytic approximations of required sample size were not straight forward, we used simulations to estimate power. Tables 1-3 show power estimates for four tests: the CA-test for risk, the case-only linear regression test for AAO (QT-test), the joint test for risk and AAO, and Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) survival analysis Wald test with cases and censored controls. Tables 1-3 use the same parameter configurations as those used in Figures 2-4, respectively, with a total sample size of 500 for the homogeneous AAO models (Table 1) and 50,000 for the models with heterogeneity (Tables 2 and 3). For the first four columns of results (Columns I), sample size was divided equally between cases and controls, thus it is important to note that the case-only QT-test there uses half the sample size of the other tests in these examples (which differs from Figures 2-4 which assumed the same total sample size for the CA-test and QT-test). For comparison, the last column of Tables 1-3 (Column II) shows power of the QT-test if twice as many cases were available, so that the total sample size was equivalent to the case-control tests. Comparing those results with the others allows us to address the question of whether we would have more power if all resources were put into cases rather than dividing them between cases and controls.

Examining the homogeneous models first (Table 1), we see that for Tables 1A-1C, that the joint test is more powerful than the CA-test or the QT-test alone (Columns I), and even has more power than the QT-test with double the sample size (Column II). The CoxPH test has the most power except for the examples with reduced penetrance (γ1 &lt; 1), where we see power drop precipitously for the CoxPH test (Table 1D). Notably with reduced penetrance, the case-only QT-test is most powerful (even with half the sample size). The joint test has slightly less power than the QT-test for reduced penetrance models (Columns I), but takes advantage of the high power gained from the case-control test when γ1 = 1 to achieve a substantial increase in power. The results in Column II (Table 1D) show that, except in the full penetrance example (γ1 = 1), far more power can be gained by doubling the case sample than dividing it between cases and controls (Column I).

In Table 2, we introduce heterogeneity (θ = 0.2). Interestingly, we find that even with half the sample size (Columns I), the case-only QT-test is more powerful than the CA-test except when σ is large (Table 2B) or when A is ~70-80 (Table 2C). With few exceptions, the joint test is more powerful than either the CA-test or QT-test alone. Those exceptions are when σ is small and when A is large, when the case-only QT-test has more power that the joint test. In these situations, the power of the joint test is limited by the poor power of the CA-test, as discussed above. Unlike the examples with homogeneity of AAO (Table 1), when there is heterogeneity the joint test also has more power than or similar power to the CoxPH test over the range of scenarios. Doubling the number of cases in the QT-test (Column II) typically boosts power of the QT-test above the joint test except for large σ is large or when A is ~70-80.

In Table 3, with heterogeneity and reduced penetrance, the QT-test has the most power of all tests except for when A=70, which is the only example in which the CA-test has any appreciable power (Table 3C). This is the mid-region of ascertainment age where we saw previously that the QT-test lost power relative to the CA-test (Figures 3C and 4C). In this example, the joint test is the most powerful; in other examples, the power of the joint test is not far below the power of the case-only QT-test using half the sample (Columns I). Doubling the number of cases in the QT-test (Column II) leads to more power than the other tests except when A=70, when the joint test is still the most powerful. The power of the CoxPH test is smaller than the joint test in all scenarios and is relatively poor across the board unless penetrance at the LOI (γ1) is large (Table 3D).

Type I Error

To examine Type I error of the tests, we simulated data setting the genotype-specific AAO means equal, such that μg = 72 for all g (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). We found that the CA-test and CoxPH test have type I errors near the nominal level for all scenarios examined. The case-only AAO linear regression test (QT-test), and consequently the joint test, sometimes had inflated Type I error when sample size was small (Supplemental Table 1). For larger sample sizes all tests maintained the correct Type I error (Supplemental Table 2).

Example of the Joint AAO and Risk Test in Alzheimer Disease

As an example to illustrate the advantage of the joint test in real data, we used the results from Table 1 of Naj et al (2014), which includes AAO- and Risk-test results for late-onset AD genes. Based on the p-values of AAO and risk tests, we computed their corresponding chi-square statistics and then the p-value for the 2-df joint test. The results from Naj et al (2014) and the Joint test are shown here in Table 4. This table highlights the top ten risk variants identified in a late-onset AD GWAS for risk (Naj et al., 2011). Our results show that the joint test is more significant than either test alone, and can offer the evidence for variants that have effects on both AAO and risk of AD, such as CR1, BIN1, PICALM and APOE.

Discussion

We began this investigation to try to understand how we should best analyze data to identify a genetic locus that influences AAO and disease risk through its AAO effect. In particular, we asked the question of whether we should prefer a case-control test of risk or a case-only test of AAO, or perhaps some combination of the two. We found that over a wide range of scenarios, when there is homogeneity and high penetrance at the locus of interest, the Cochran-Armitage case-control test for risk requires fewer samples to have the same power as the traditional linear regression-based case-only AAO test. However, when AAO is heterogeneous (being determined by the locus of interest and other factors) or there is reduced penetrance at the locus of interest (not all people who should be affected based on AAO are actually affected), the case-only AAO test generally requires fewer samples than the case-control risk test.

An interesting observation is that, despite our intuition that any AAO gene can be thought of as risk gene, we do find some examples under our genetic model where there is negligible risk effect in the sample even though there is an AAO effect. We see examples of this when σ is small or A is large, which result in most of the AAO determined by the LOI being smaller than A for all genotypes. As a consequence, gentotype at the LOI is independent of affection status and allele frequencies are similar in cases and controls, even though genotypes have different AAO means in the cases. This suggests that genes with strong effects on AAO at younger ages that could be easily detected with a case-only AAO test may be missed completely in standard case-control risk tests when we ascertain at late ages.

Ascertaining at too early an age can be also problematic. Not surprisingly, we saw that risk and AAO tests both lost power when A is very small. We also saw a non-monotonic curve for the QT-test in the mid-range of A. This resulted when the genotype-specific AAO means in affecteds changed order, actually reversing the direction of the AAO effect. This is a feature of our statistical model and may not be generalizable or reflect reality, but what is important to take from this is that is we ascertain too early, we will not get an accurate picture of the AAO distribution in the population, and this could lead to unpredictable behavior for statistical tests.

We introduced a simple joint statistic that summed the case-control risk and case-only linear regression AAO statistics. Our results showed that this joint test was a powerful alternative to either test alone in many scenarios, particularly when there was heterogeneity of AAO. It is possible that this joint test could be improved by considering different two-part models or weighting, e.g., a modified Tobit model. Theory tells us that the two-part model is expected to more powerful than single-part models when the allele/genotype that is more frequent in cases is also the one that has the lower mean AAO (Lachenbruch, 2001a), which is true for our genetic model, and likely more reasonable than the alternative in reality. Thus further investigation of two-part models for this application could be promising.

Like the joint test, survival analysis uses both case-control status and AAO information and has been advocated for genetic studies of AAO (van der Net et al., 2008, Staley et al. 2017). In general, we found that analysis the Cox Proportional Hazard model performed well relative to the other tests only when the AAO distribution was homogeneous and genotypes were strongly penetrant. It is known that the coefficient estimates from the Cox proportional hazards model can be biased in case-control studies due to violations of assumption such as non-informative censoring, and this makes it difficult to generalize about power. It is possible that appropriate weighting in the Cox model as has been suggested for case-cohort or case-control studies would improve the estimates and relative power from the Cox proportional hazards model (Prentice, 1986; Leffondre et al., 2008). The choice of weights and consideration of different censoring mechanisms would be of interest for future comparisons.

There are some limitations to our study that should be noted. The most obvious is that the genetic model that we specified is just one example of how AAO and risk may be determined in reality; and some of our assumptions are not realistic, but were necessary to simplify the mathematics. For example we assumed normality for genotype-specific AAO distributions in the population and that only their means may differ. Though convenient for our derivations, this normality assumption is not a limitation in practice since one can transform their AAO data to be close to normal distribution. There are many parameters in our model and it is difficult to know where true values lie. To try to provide general guidance, we chose values of parameters based on Alzheimer’s disease datasets and covered a wide range of different scenarios. For ease of illustration, we assumed a fixed ascertainment age with no error, which is not the case for most studies that may specify upper or lower thresholds but ascertain more or less randomly given constraints. We did, however, demonstrate the impact of different fixed ascertainment ages with both analytical and simulation studies here. Our model also assumes that affection status is correlated with genotypes at the locus of interest only through the AAO effect. It is possible that the genotypes may have an effect on risk in addition to their effect of AAO. In this scenario, our conclusions about the relative benefit of risk vs. AAO tests may not hold. However, it is our expectation that if there were an additional risk effect due to the LOI, the joint test of risk and AAO would perform well.

Finally, there are some scenarios that we did not consider in this study, but should be examined in future studies. One consideration is that in real studies AAO is measured with error and the definition of AAO may even vary among cohorts. Studying the impact of error in the AAO distribution and the impact of using harmonized AAO data would be of practical interest, especially for large meta-analyses. Also of practical importance, throughout our investigations in this manuscript we assumed equal sample sizes of cases and controls; but in many real analyses, case and control samples are not balanced. It would be interesting to study the impact of varying the case-control ratio on the relative power of the tests.

In conclusion, our study provides a framework under which we can relate AAO and risk effects and compare the relative power of several statistical tests in case-control or case-only datasets. Under the reasonable assumption that heterogeneity and reduced penetrance are most likely for AAO of complex traits, our results have important implications for study design and analysis when we are seeking AAO genes. From a study design perspective, with restricted sampling or genotyping resources, a case-only design would be most efficient (providing the most power per subject). However, we recognize that there are often other reasons to collect control subjects or we may be starting with and existing case-control dataset. From an analysis perspective, if data from both cases and controls are available, a joint test that combines risk and AAO tests will be most powerful. Ultimately, understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex human diseases involves knowledge of both risk and AAO genes, and hence we expect an ensemble approach will be required. Our results provide guidance on how we may best detect AAO genes and show that risk and AAO information can be combined to improve power.

Table 4. Results for the AAO and Risk tests from Table 1 in Naj et al (2014) and the P-value for the Joint test computed from these results. AAO P is from the case-only AAO test (minimal covariate adjustment model, linear regression from Naj et al., 2014) and the previous case-control test of risk (logistic regression from Naj et al., 2011). Results are shown for only the most significant variant within each gene.
