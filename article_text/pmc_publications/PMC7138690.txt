Aging globally effects cellular and organismal metabolism across a range of mammalian species, including humans and rabbits. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are an attractive model system of aging due to their genetic similarity with humans and their short lifespans. This model can be used to understand metabolic changes in aging especially in major organs such as liver where we detected pronounced variations in fat metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein degradation. Such changes in the liver are consistent across several mammalian species however in rabbits the downstream effects of these changes have not yet been explored. We have applied proteomics to study changes in the liver proteins from young, middle, and old age rabbits using a multiplexing cPILOT strategy. This resulted in the identification of 2,586 liver proteins, among which 45 proteins had significant (p&lt;0.05) changes with aging. Seven proteins were differentially-expressed at all ages and include fatty acid binding protein, aldehyde dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, apolipoprotein C3, peroxisomal sarcosine oxidase, adhesion G-protein coupled receptor, and glutamate ionotropic receptor kinate. Insights to how alterations in metabolism affect protein expression in liver have been gained and demonstrate the utility of rabbit as a model of aging.

1. Introduction

Aging is complex, multifactorial, and progressive1, and the main risk factor for several chronic physiological and cognitive diseases that ultimately lead to death2, 3. The global proportion of the older population (aged 60 or above) has doubled from 392 million in 1980 to 962 million in 2017, and will double again to 2.1 billion by 2050 4. Persons aged 80 years or over are projected to increase more than threefold between 2017 and 2050, rising from 137 million to 425 million persons5. The drastic increase in the aging population will bring many challenges such as higher incidence of age-related diseases6, 7, increased health care costs8, higher morbidity, and mortality rates of elderly populations9. Currently, a complete understanding of aging processes does not exist6, 10 nor an understanding of how to minimize the effects of aging that increase risk of age-related diseases.

Senescence is physiologically important for normal development and tissue homeostasis, however, it influences aging hallmarks such as telomere shortening, DNA instability, chronic inflammation, mitochondrial, epigenetic, proteostatic, and nutrient signaling-dysfunction10, 11. Metabolic dysfunction is a well-known contributor to physiological aging12–14 and plays a large role in age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases15, 16, type-2 diabetes17, and various cancers13, 18. Altered bile acid profiles19, long-term dietary imbalances20, caloric-restriction21, exercise22, roles of post-translational modifications23–26, metabolic dysfunctions12, as well as lipid-metabolism associated proteins have been extensively studied in liver 27–29. Liver is pivotal for several metabolic processes30 such as detoxification and energy production31 for the periphery and central nervous system. Protein, carbohydrate, and fat metabolic regulations are central to the liver, and thus, make the liver an ideal organ to study key regulatory, metabolic, homeostatic, and signaling pathways during aging.

Laboratory animals such as yeast,7 round worms,9 fruit-flies,32 mice33, and rodents34, 35 have been employed as models of aging because their lifespans range from 2–3 weeks to 200 months, respectively. Such shortened lifespans compared to humans make aging studies highly feasible. These models also share a broad range (21 to 85 percent) of genome information with humans36–38. Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), a lagomorph specie, is often used in biomedical research and has multiple applications in antibody production, pharmaceutical sciences, biotechnology, and circulatory physiology39. Despite its longer lifespan (5–6 years), high human genome overlap (up to 85 %), pathogen sharing with humans, presence of complex in-vivo environment, and puberty and post puberty stages, applications of rabbit models in aging remain limited. There are a few examples however of proteomic analyses of eye lens8, tears40, adipose tissues41, and rabbit sclera42 which have been reported during the last decade.

Quantitative proteomics has been demonstrated as a method of choice to elucidate aging or age-related processes15, 21, 22. Comparative proteomic studies of liver in the senescence-accelerated mouse model (SAMP8) exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction43. Age-related proteomic alterations in fatty acid metabolism, increased oxidative stress, and declines in bile acid synthesis were reported through analysis of liver and kidney peroxisomes in mice44, 45. Lower levels of proteins associated with metabolism, reproduction, and development have been reported in aged adult fruit flies32. Moreover, disturbed intracellular signaling mechanisms were also studied by comparative proteomics in the liver, muscle, and heart of young and aged x-linked muscle dystrophy mice which may lead to a progressive muscle wasting process46. High-throughput MS-based proteomics that incorporate isobaric tags can be used to understand dynamic changes in metabolism and other pathways that change with organismal aging. Isobaric tagging strategies allow as many as 12 samples to be multiplexed in a single analysis47, 48. In this study, we apply a combined precursor labeling and isobaric tagging (cPILOT) strategy49–51 to study aging processes in the liver of young, middle, and old age rabbits.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Animal husbandry and ethical statement

Male New Zealand white rabbits were purchased from Covance (Denver, CA) and housed in the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources at the University of Pittsburgh. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. Rabbits were fed standard rabbit laboratory diet and kept in a 12-h light/dark cycle. National Institute of Health (NIH) guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals have been followed. Liver tissues were harvested from rabbits with a mean age of 252 days (N = 4), 683 days (N = 4), and 1350 days old (N = 4) rabbits (Table 1) and stored at −80 °C.

2.2 Tissue homogenization, protein extraction, and digestion

Samples were prepared by dissecting the right lobe of the liver. Liver tissues (80 – 100 mg) were homogenized in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with 8M urea. A mechanical homogenizer (Fastprep 24, MP Biomedical) was used to generate tissue lysates at 4.0 m/sec for 20 sec with 300 sec pause on ice. The cycle was repeated. Lysates were centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 4 °C, 15 min) and supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was determined using bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Scientific) as per manufacturer’s protocol. A pooled sample was generated by mixing equimolar amounts of proteins from each individual rabbit and used as an internal standard. Proteins (100 μg) from each sample and the pool were reduced (dithiothreitol 1:40 mol ratio), alkylated (iodoacetamide 1:80 mol ratio), quenched (L-cysteine 1:40 mol ratio), and digested with a trypsin: Lys-C mix (1:100 mol ratio) for 18 h. Peptides were acidified, desalted using an HLB C18 cartridge, and dried down by centrifugal evaporation.

2.3 cPILOT- labeling

Peptides (~50 μg) were dissolved in 1% acetic acid (0.25 μg/μL). Formaldehyde / 13C 2H2-formaldehye (60 mM) and sodium cyanoborohydride/-deuteride (24 mM) were added to label peptides with either light or heavy dimethyl groups at the N-termini, respectively. All samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min with constant shaking and quenched with 16 μL of 1% ammonia for 5 min. Dimethylated (DM) peptides were reacidified with 5% formic acid and light and heavy samples were combined per isobaric tag (e.g. 126 light DM and 126 heavy DM), desalted, and dried down by centrifugal evaporation. Dimethylated peptides were dissolved in 100 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Tandem mass tags (TMT) were prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were incubated at room temperature with TMT reagents for 1 h with continuous shaking. Labeled peptides were quenched with 5% (w/v) hydroxylamine-hydrochloride for 15 min and reacidified with formic acid. Peptides were then pooled together to create a single mixture that was desalted and dried down by centrifugal evaporation. The combined cPILOT-labeled sample was subjected to basic pH fractionation.

2.4 Offline basic pH reverse-phase fractionation

Labeled peptides were fractionated with increasing concentration of acetonitrile (ACN; pH 10.0) using reverse phase chromatography. Briefly, peptides (350 μg) were dissolved in 1% acetonitrile solution, pH 10.0 and loaded onto a pre-activated HLB C18 cartridge. Peptides were eluted off the resin into 12 fractions with a gradual increase of ACN solution in water (3–80%, pH 10.0). Fractionated peptides were acidified, dried down by centrifugal evaporation, and dissolved in 0.1% formic acid.

2.5 LC – MS/MS and MS3analyses

Peptides were loaded onto a commercial trap column (2 cm, 3 μm, 100 Å, Thermo scientific) for 10 min (2 μL/min) and separated by a 120 min gradient on an in-house analytical column (100 μm, 30 cm) packed with 2.5 μm, 130 Å C18 material. The gradient was as follows: 0–75 min, 2–30 % mobile phase B; 75–89 min, 30–60 % B; 89–92 min, 60–90 % B; 90–97 min, 90 % B; 97–99 min, 90–10 % B; 99–120 min, 10 % B, where mobile phases (A and B) represent 0.1 % formic acid in water or acetonitrile, respectively. Peptides were detected on a Fusion Lumos instrument. Precursor scan parameters were as follows: peptides 350–1600 m/z were analyzed at 120,000 resolution in the Orbitrap with 50 ms injection time (IT) and 4.0 e5 AGC target. Peptides with 2–8 charges were included and excluded after 1 repeat for 30 sec. Light and heavy dimethylated precursor partners separated by 7.038 and 8.044 Da (±10 ppm tolerance) within 70–100% intensity of the opposite partner were targeted for selection. The top most intense ions within 3 sec (Top speed) were selected and isolated for MS/MS fragmentation. 100 ms IT, 1.0 e4 AGC target, 10 ms of 30 % collision energy (CID), and 2 m/z isolation window were selected for peptide fragmentation. Fragment ions were detected in the linear ion trap (LIT). An additional fragmentation scan was performed on the ten most intense fragment ions called synchronous precursor selection (SPS10) from MS2 using higher energy collision dissociation (HCD-MS3) with a scan range 100–400 m/z, 150 ms IT, 5.0e5 AGC target, 55 % collision energy at 60,000 resolution and 2 m/z isolation window. TMT reporter ions were detected in the Orbitrap. In source fragmentation and step collision were disabled.

2.6 Data analysis

Raw files were analyzed with Proteome Discoverer v. 2.2 software (Thermo Scientific) and searched against the rabbit UniProtKB redundant database (08/19/2018, 21,177 sequences). SEQUEST HT search parameters were as follows: maximum two trypsin miscleavages, precursor mass tolerance 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance 0.6 Da; static modifications were either light or heavy dimethyl +28.031 or 36.028 Da (N-terminus) and carbamidomethyl modification/+57.021 Da (Cys); dynamic modifications were TMT 10-plex +229.163 Da (Lys) and oxidation modification +15.995 Da (Met). Decoy database search was employed to generate high (p&lt;0.01) and medium (p&lt;0.05) confidence peptide lists. Only rank 1 peptides from Proteome Discoverer, which refer to the most likely assignment based on the MS/MS spectral correlation, were considered with peptide deviation of 10 ppm. TMT reporter ions (i.e. m/z 126 – 129) were identified with the following parameters: most confident centroid and 30 ppm for reporter ion mass tolerance. Individual proteins are the unique translation products of genetic information and are composed of one or more unique amino acids polymers. Protein groups, however, are the assembly of homologous proteins and isoforms that were not uniquely identified by Proteome Discoverer v. 2.2, and referred as “proteins” in this articles. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the Pride52 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD013220.

2.7 Data normalization and statistics

Each fraction of labeled peptides was analyzed with technical triplicates. Reporter ion intensities corresponding to protein groups were summed across 12 fractions and averaged across technical replicates prior to normalization using a two-tailed internal reference scaling (IRS) method53 as described previously. Briefly, protein intensities were summed for each TMT channel, and a channel-specific scaling factor (SF) was generated by dividing the sum intensity of the pooled channel by the sum intensity of each channel. The abundance of an individual protein was normalized by multiplying with SF of that channel within each technical replicate.

A protein-specific SF was generated by dividing the geometric mean of pools by the intensity of each protein in the pool channel to normalize the abundance across technical triplicates. To identify statistically-significant proteins, an unpaired student t-test was performed on proteins with 95% confidence interval. A fold-change cutoff value of 1.23 was considered. Protein abundances and p-values were transformed to log2 and log10 scale, respectively for the visual demonstration of statistically-significant proteins across age groups. Here, we have avoided multiple-hypothesis testing, which provides a stricter criterion on p-values, and also which may not be suitable for proteomics data54, 55. Additionally, we were most interested in changes between any two of the three age groups and focused on t-tests between those ages.

2.8 Parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (PRM-MS)

Labeled peptides by cPILOT were loaded onto an in-house trap column (2 cm, packed with 5 μm, 200 Å C18 material) for 10 min (2 μL/min) and separated by a 120 min gradient on an in-house analytical column. The column specifications and gradient were similar to that described in section 2.5. Peptides were detected on a Fusion Lumos instrument. Precursor scan parameters which are different from section 2.5 were as follows: peptides 375–1800 m/z were analyzed in the Orbitrap with 100 ms IT and 5.0 e5 AGC target. An inclusion mass list of selected peptides from differentially-expressed proteins across all ages was included. Retention time of precursor peptides was made flexible at ±15 seconds. The top most intense ions within 3 sec (Top speed) were selected from 150 ms IT, 2.0 e4 AGC target, and fragmented as described in section 2.5. Fragments ions were detected in the LIT. The ten most intense fragment ions (SPS10) from MS2 were further fragmented using HCD-MS3 with a scan range 100–400 m/z, 200 ms IT, 5.0e5 AGC target, 55 % collision energy at 60,000 resolution and 2 m/z isolation window. TMT reporter ions were detected in the Orbitrap. In source fragmentation and step collision were disabled. Data were analyzed as described above.

3. Results

In this study, we demonstrate successful application of cPILOT to study aging in rabbit liver. This cPILOT application enabled us to analyze 14 samples simultaneously which tremendously reduced instrument and analysis time, costs, and individual handling errors. Rabbits of similar age and sex were grouped together to represent young [251.5 ± 36.4 days (N=4)], middle [682.8 ± 82.7 days (N=4)], and old [1349.5 ± 207.1 days (N=4)] ages. We note that all male mice were used in this study which may introduce bias and result in sex-specific expression of proteins. Peptides were chemically labeled using cPILOT, then subjected to fractionation to reduce sample complexity prior to MS analysis (Figure 1). Labeling efficiencies of both dimethylation and TMT steps were &gt;98 and 99%, respectively. Samples were subjected to triplicate technical injections for LC-MS, CID-MS/MS, and HCD-MS3 analysis on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. From this analysis, &gt; 2,500 protein groups corresponding to 14,000 peptides were detected per each high pH fraction. Overall, 22,229 peptides from 2,586 proteins were quantified across three technical replicates (Table 1).

After normalization using the IRS method53, the coefficient of variation (CV) among biological replicates declined. The linearity of reporter ion intensities corresponding to protein groups across technical replicates was an average R2 = 0.999 (Supplemental Figure S1). The benefit of the cPILOT approach is demonstrated as biological replication and several ages were assessed for 2,586 proteins in a single experiment. We do note however that the dual labeling strategy of cPILOT does lower the number of proteins identified, as does any labeling technique. Additionally, because of the requirement of MS3 to minimize reporter ion compression, our duty cycles are longer and result in less proteins identified and quantitfied despite having comprehensive fractionation. While label-free is possible, cPILOT afford much overall shorter data acquisition times and improved sample error than label-free approaches.

3.1 Comparison of liver proteins across age group

In our 14-plex cPILOT study, a total of ~ 2,115 proteins in young, middle, and old age rabbits were quantified for which reporter ion intensities were above the signal-to-noise (S/N) threshold for all 14-channels. The reporter ion intensities corresponding to a specific age group were used to determine proteins (i.e., 45) that were differentially expressed with age (Table 2). While the number of differentially-expressed proteins may be low relative to the total number of proteins identified we have conservative criterion for differential expression that require fold-change and statistical cut-offs.

3.1.1 Young vs middle age

Sixteen hepatic proteins were differentially-expressed between young and middle age groups (Figure 2A) with most proteins increasing in level with age. Fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1; ratio 0.56, p-value 0.047), mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2; ratio 0.77, p-value 0.011), chloride intracellular channel protein (CLIC1; ratio 0.68, p-value 0.015), 40S ribosomal protein S30 (FAU; ratio 0.60, p-value 0.049), and acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2 (ACSS2; ratio 0.66, p-value 0.027) were detected with lower levels in middle aged rabbits, on the other hand, nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 3 (NSD3; ratio 1.40, p-value 0.016), enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (EHHADH; ratio 1.52, p-value 0.027), rab geranyl geranyl-transferase alpha (RABGGTA; ratio 1.28, p-value 0.029), basigin (BSG; ratio 1.29, p-value 0.035), NADH dehydrogenase 1 alpha subcomplex 2 (NDUFA2; ratio 1.31, p-value 0.041), hydroxysteroid-17-beta dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13; ratio 1.32, p-value 0.039), family with sequence similarity 160 member (FAM160A1; ratio 1.36, p-value 0.034), metalloreductase (STEAP4; ratio 1.48, p-value 0.031), cytochrome P450 (CYP4B1; ratio 1.46, p-value 0.036), and solute carrier organic anion transporter family (SLCO1B3; ratio 1.54, p-value 0.046), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase (HMGCS2; ratio 1.59, p-value 0.047) were prominently higher in middle age rabbits. Fold-change values are shown in Table 2.

3.1.2 Young vs old age

Slightly more proteins (i.e., 19 proteins) were differentially-expressed when comparing young vs old age rabbits than young vs middle age (Figure 2B). Proteins such as FABP1 (ratio 0.46, p-value 0.025), ALDH2 (ratio 0.76, p-value 0.017), and collagen alpha-1 (COL14A1; ratio 0.62, p-value 0.041) were detected with lower levels in old compared to young age. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (ADGRF3; ratio 1.39, p-value 0.026), serine and arginine rich splicing factor (SRSF3; ratio 1.24, p-value 0.015), mago exon junction complex core component (MAGOH; ratio 1.41, p-value 0.024), peripherin (PRPH; ratio 1.57, p-value 0.023), glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate subunit 2 (GRIK2; ratio 1.46, p-value 0.028), charged multi-vesicular body protein (CHMP2A; ratio 1.25, p-value 0.008), sideroflexin (SFXN2; ratio 1.49, p-value 0.030), EHHADH (ratio 1.52, p-value 0.038), peroxisomal sarcosine oxidase (PIPOX; ratio 1.29, p-value 0.039), apolipoprotein (APOC3; ratio 1.25, p-value 0.048), ATP synthase (ATP5F1E; ratio 1.33, p-value 0.041), ATP binding cassette subfamily D member (ABCD3; ratio 1.29, p-value 0.026), TRAF2 and NCK interacting kinase (TNIK; ratio 1.34, p-value 0.043), aspartate oxidase (DDO; ratio 1.36, p-value 0.026), diaphanous related formin (DIAPH1; ratio 1.42, p-value 0.049), and dimethylaniline monooxygenase [N-oxide-forming] 1 (FMO1; ratio 1.43, p-value 0.038) were among the 16 proteins with higher levels in old age rabbits. Fold-change values are shown in Table 2.

3.1.3 Middle vs old age

The least number of proteins (i.e., 10 proteins) were different between middle and old age rabbits (Figure 2C). Cytochrome P450 (CYP1A2; ratio 0.71, p-value 0.028), and 3-alpha-(17beta)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (PGER6; ratio 0.49, p-value 0.031), and uncharacterized protein (ratio 0.78, p-value 0.022) levels were lower in old age rabbits. Levels of APOC3 (ratio 1.36, p-value 0.019), GRIK2 (ratio 1.25, p-value 0.019, ADGRF3 (ratio 1.52, p-value 0.023), PIPOX (ratio 1.32, p-value 0.034), 40S ribosomal protein (RPS25; ratio 1.30, p-value 0.046), voltage-dependent P/Q-type calcium channel (CACNA1A; ratio 1.67, p-value 0.049), and RNA-binding protein (RBM39; ratio 1.40, p-value 0.039) were higher in response to increasing age. Fold-change values are shown in Table 2.

3.1.4 Common proteins at all ages

Among the 45 differentially-expressed proteins across young, middle, and old rabbits (Figure 3), seven proteins were differentially-expressed across middle and old ages. The abundance of FABP1 and ALDH2 proteins decrease in liver with increasing age while the abundances of GRIK2, EHHADH, APOC3, and PIPOX increase in liver with age. The levels of EHHADH, HSD17B13, HMGCS2, and SLCO1B3 were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the liver of middle and old age compared to young rabbits. Levels of DDO increased linearly from young to old rabbits, though were not statistically significant among young and middle age rabbits, but only when compared among young to old age rabbits. A significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in the level of PIPOX and APOC3 was detected in old age related to young and middle age rabbits, while ABCD3 has increased in old age compared to young rabbits. Levels of FABP1 and ALDH2 were decreased in middle and old age rabbits to that of young rabbits. GRIK2 abundance decreased notably in middle and old age rabbits compared to young rabbits, while levels of ADGRF3 decreased in old age rabbits compared to that of young and middle age rabbits (Figure 3).

Distinctive behaviors of liver cytochrome P450 and 40S ribosomal protein families were observed (Figure S2). Cytochrome P450 1A2 decreases, while cytochrome P450 4B1 abundance increases with age. Both cytochrome P450 members belong to distinctive classes and carry characteristic amino acid sequences. The unique amino acid stretches of cytochrome P450 identified in this study are shown in Table S1. Members of 40S ribosomal protein family were also quantified with unique peptide sequences. FAU, and RPS25 were high in young and low in middle age rabbits, respectively. Their distinct biological and molecular functions are discussed below.

3.2 Verification of protein levels in rabbit liver

PRM analysis was used to verify the levels of the seven common differentially-expressed proteins. Low levels of ALDH2 (PRM: ratio 0.57, p-value 0.076; cPILOT: ratio 0.76, p-value 0.017 young/old, and PRM: ratio 0.69, p-value 0.071; cPILOT: ratio 0.77, p-value 0.011 in young/middle), and FABP1 (PRM: ratio 0.39, p-value 0.018; cPILOT: ratio 0.46, p-value 0.025 in young/old, and PRM: ratio 0.59, p-value 0.056; cPILOT: ratio 0.56, p-value 0.047 in young/middle), and high levels of PIPOX (PRM: ratio 1.16, p-value 0.394; cPILOT: ratio 1.32, p-value 0.034 in middle/old), and HMGCS2 (PRM: ratio 1.38, p-value 0.051; cPILOT: ratio 1.59, p-value 0.047 in young/middle) were confirmed in old compared to middle and young age rabbits. High levels of hydroxyl steroid 17-beta dehydrogenase (PRM: ratio 1.28, p-value 0.114; cPILOT: ratio 1.32, p-value 0.039 in young/middle), and CYP4B1 (PRM: ratio 1.22, p-value 0.139; cPILOT: ratio 1.46, p-value 0.036 in young/middle) were also verified in middle age group to that of young rabbits. Similar trends were observed between cPILOT and PRM analysis, but total reporter ion intensity for each protein was lower in PRM analysis and most peptides were not significant. This likely reflects the smaller number of peptides selected for PRM (1–2 peptides / protein) compared to cPILOT analysis. Fold-change values are shown in Table S2.

4. Discussion

The liver performs a wide range of functions in vertebrates, and being a vital organ, it is crucial for metabolism, storage, and homeostasis of diverse classes of molecules. Dysregulation in hepatic functions frequently leads to a wide range of metabolic diseases e.g., non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes type II, obesity, cardiomyopathies, and neurodegenerative diseases e.g., Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or Huntington’s disorders17, 31.

In this study, we identified a small fraction of proteins that were differentially-expressed in rabbit liver relative to the 2586 total proteins identified. There are anticipated wide and large-scale changes in liver metabolism in aging and it could be rationalized that a substantial number of proteins would change with age. However, our observation of 45 differentially-expressed proteins suggests that the liver is relatively stable with aging and that we are observing the most profound and significant changes.

In the current study, we have found lower levels of ATP synthase (ATP5F1E) and NADH dehydrogenase (NDUFA2) in the liver of old rabbits. ATP5F1E is the hydrogen ion transporting, epsilon subunit of ATP synthase56. It produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane. The proton gradient is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain56, 57. NDUFA2 is necessary for mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain58, 59 to liberate and transfer electrons from NADH to ubiquinone and to extract part of their energy to drive proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane60. NDUFA2 creates an electrochemical proton gradient for the synthesis of ATP59, 60. Decreased ATP production from ATP5F1E and impaired NDUFA2 function occur in Alzheimer’s disease61, 62. Down-regulation of ATP5E transcript was suggested as a tumor marker in papillary thyroid cancer 57, 63. Mutations in NDUFA2 complex may lead to Leigh disease60 while, &gt; 4-fold higher-expression of NDUFA2 was validated in degenerative scoliosis64. Differential-expression of these proteins in the liver of middle and old age compared to young rabbits contribute to decline in energy metabolism and mitochondrial functions. We hypothesize that, this persistent decline might be associated with the development of age-related diseases.

Following, we discuss some major pathways in the rabbit liver in which dynamic levels of proteins involved in lipid metabolism, protein degradation, and mitochondrial dysfunction are detected in response to increasing age.

4.1 PPAR signaling pathway and lipid metabolism

Enriched classes of interacting genes/proteins that contribute to peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor (PPAR) signaling, oxidation-reduction processes, and protein degradation were identified in our study (Figure 4). PPAR are steroid hormone nuclear receptors and multiple isoforms are expressed in various body tissues such as liver, kidney, heart, muscles, and adipose tissues65. In liver, PPAR alpha expression is dominant and plays a central role in lipid metabolism and homeostasis66. PPAR alpha target genes are mainly involved in fatty acid catabolism, lipoprotein assembly, ketone body synthesis, and gluconeogenesis65, 67. Beta oxidation of fatty acid occurs in peroxisomes with oxidation, thiolytic cleavage, dehydrogenation, and hydration as major enzymatic reactions that break down fatty acids68. EHHADH is essential to catalyze the hydration and dehydrogenation steps (2nd and 3rd) of fatty acid catabolism 69, 70. It is one of the seven proteins we found to change statistically across all age-groups. In the current study, EHHADH abundance increased with rabbit age. This enzyme promotes the transition of enoyl CoA to beta ketoacyl CoA and generates NADH for energy production through electron transport chain. Fatty acids are the foremost source of fuel and an important component of lipid bilayer. We hypothesize that increase in fatty acid catabolism may dysregulate intracellular signaling as well as compromise the structural integrity of cells. In mice, fatty acid catabolism decreases with aging and is restored upon caloric restriction71.That this is in contrast to our observations in rabbits suggests that either our rabbits may have low calorie consumption with age and hence different feeding behaviors or that fatty acids are necessary for other functions in older rabbits. Moreover, abnormal profiles of fatty acids have been reported to lead to peroxisomal disorders,70 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease72, and Alzheimer’s disease73.

Omega-oxidation of long chain dicarboxylic acids occurs in liver microsomes by cytochrome P450 family of enzymes74. Cytochrome P450 family belongs to the group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases, oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics, and generates the substrates for peroxisomal beta-oxidation75. Lower levels of cytochrome b and b-c complex were reported previously in cardiac mitochondrial rats through proteomic analysis76. There is growing evidence that members of cytochrome P450 enzymes contribute to regulation of developmental processes77. A homozygous deletion of NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 oxireductase is lethal during organogenesis78. A significant reduction in activity of some cytochrome P450s is associated with aging79. Drug, endogenous metabolite, and carcinogen clearance appear to be reduced in parallel in ageing79 which increases the risk of toxic reactions and susceptibility to age-associated metabolic diseases75, 80.

Alpha-oxidation of fatty acids take place in peroxisomes68. Metabolism of fatty acids is dependent on their activation to fatty acyl-CoA derivatives. Acyl-CoA synthetase activates acetate for the synthesis of lipids and energy production67. In this study, lower levels of ACSS2 were detected with increasing age in rabbits. PPAR alpha in liver and PPAR gamma in fat tissues control the transcriptional rate of ACSS2 and promote fatty acid transport across membranes as well as their metabolism 67, 68. We suggest an ACSS2 knockdown or overexpression model will further understanding of its role in aging.

Branched-chain fatty acids and C27 bile acids are transported into peroxisome by ATP-binding cassette, sub-family D, member 3. The latter function is a crucial step in bile acid biosynthesis19. Compared to young rabbits, ABCD3 abundance increased in old age rabbits. whereas liver FABP1 decreased. FABP1 binds cholesterol, free fatty acids, and their coenzyme A derivatives, bilirubin, and some other small molecules in the cytoplasm and mediate the uptake of cholesterol in hepatocytes with the help of lipoproteins82. FABP1 is also involved in intracellular lipid transport14. Liver FABP1 is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease83 as well as with the progression of chronic kidney disease84. Apolipoprotein C3, a component of triglyceride-rich very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) in plasma, plays multifaceted roles in triglyceride homeostasis29. Its abundance in this study increased with age. APOC3 promotes the assembly and secretion of VLDL1 intracellularly in liver, while it also attenuates hydrolysis and clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) in the extracellular space85, 86. APOC3 impairs the lipolysis and the hepatic uptake of TRLs by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase28. We conducted H&amp;E staining of liver tissue sections from the young to old age rabbits and found evidence for increased lipid accumulation in the old age rabbits (Supplemental Figure S3). This was despite any evidence of hepatocellular degeneration, biliary disease or fibrosis in any of the examined livers. Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 regulates ketone body production and inducing beta oxidation of fatty acids by condensing acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to form the substrate for HMG-CoA reductase87, 88. Differences in the levels of ACSS2, ABCD3, FABP1, APOC3, and HMGCS2 have been correlated with age-related diseases. For example, a significant association of APOC3 was confirmed in a Chinese sub population with increased risk of ischemic stroke89, 90 and atherosclerosis91. ACSS2 is reported to enhance tumorigenesis and is indicative of poor prognosis for patients with renal cell carcinoma92, 93. Increased ABCD3 expression was demonstrated to correlate with the prostate tumor 94. It is likely that aberrant levels of these proteins leading to metabolic alterations in liver and increase susceptibility to metabolic pathologies and co-morbidities.

4.2 Protein degradation

Impaired protein homeostasis is often associated with aging95, 96. It involves mechanisms of the stabilization and degradation of proteins, both of which coordinate together to prevent the accumulation of damaged components and assure the continuous renewal of intracellular proteins96–98. Increased levels of protein degrading proteins/enzymes were detected in old rabbits. PIPOX, EHHADH, and HMGCS2 degrade amino acids. PIPOX metabolizes sarcosine, pipecolic acid, and proline. It is involved in lysine degradation and metabolizes glycine, serine, and threonine in liver. Increased levels of PIPOX were also reported previously in the liver of aged mice99. EHHADH and HMGCS2 have multifunctional roles in lipid metabolism as discussed above. Besides the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, they take part in protein digestion and absorption, particularly, the degradation of valine, leucine, and isoleucine100. Higher levels of HMGCS2 were previously reported in SAMP8 mice using proteomics approaches and is indicative of early liver dysfunction43. Proteasome-mediated protein degradation may potentially contribute to the progression of aging and age-related disease101–103. Moreover chronic expression of unfolded, misfolded, or aggregated proteins may contribute to the development of age-related pathologies, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and cataracts104.

4.3 Ribosomes and peroxisomes

In the current study, we observed differential-expression of hepatic 40 S ribosomal proteins FAU, and RPS25 across young, middle, and old age rabbits. FAU and RPS25 are 40 S ribosomal proteins required for the processing of pre-rRNA and maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits. A few of the ribosomal proteins are species-specific, though much interspecies similarity exists105. Young and old tissues from several species were compared through microarray analysis and aging-associated transcriptional aberrations were reported in genes encoding the key components of inflammatory, mitochondrial, and lysosomal degradation pathways105, 106. Our findings are consistent with reports of lower levels of ribosomal proteins in embryonic and adult Drosophila ovary105. Contrasting findings (i.e., higher levels of ribosomal proteins) have also been reported for the S25 ribosomal protein from gene expression profiling of aging rat liver 107. Expression profiling of the S25 gene was increased by 165 % with age107. It was hypothesized that aberration of ribosomal proteins is associated with the aging and may influence lifespan by targeting components of longevity networks or transcription108. However, further experiments are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

4.4 Mitochondrial dysfunction

Declined mitochondrial functions are associated with human aging14 and have been demonstrated in engineered mouse models with accelerated aging phenotypes109, 110. In previous studies, we reported the Increased level of enzymes involved in the electron transport chain in mice15. Results of this current study are consistent. Proteins center to oxidation-reduction processes in mitochondria (ALDH2, ACSS2, HSD17B13, EHHADH, PIPOX, DDO) and cytochrome P450 family members (CYP4B1 and CYP1A2) have been detected with higher levels in old rabbits compared to young and middle age-groups. Increased reactive oxygen species are toxic and cause oxidative stress, a known hallmark of aging111.

4.5 Age-related proteins

Differentially-expressed liver proteins were further filtered for GO Terms and KEGG pathways to understand the biological processes and molecular functions of liver proteins. A majority of age-related proteins (i.e., ALDH2, PIPOX, ACSS2, FMO1, FAU, CYP4B1, HMGCS2, RABGGTA) are associated with metabolic processes in liver 44, 99, 112 (Figure 5A). FABP1, CHMP2A, APOC3, GRIK2, and CLIC1 perform regulatory functions and contribute to nutrient and ion-transport across liver, periphery, and the central nervous system 28, 29, 82. SRSF3, TNIK, ADGRF3, MAGOH, DIAPH1, and HSD17B13 are solely involved in regulation of metabolic processes in hepatic system 113, 114, while GRIK2 is multifunctional and is the key component of cellular homeostasis, communication, defense response and regulatory and transport functions43, 115. ABCD3, BSG, and NSD3 are mainly responsible for cell organization and biogenesis14, 61 while SFXN2, and SLCO1B3 are transporter proteins in liver 14.

As far as molecular functions are concerned, a large number of statistically notable proteins are involved in catalytic activity (Figure 5B). Overall, the liver experiences various changes with aging1, 8, 13–15, 58. Liver volume as well as blood flow deceases significantly with age21, 22, 58. These proteomics analyses support the physiological changes in liver as many pathways have differences in expression due to aging. We hypothesize these changes increase the risk of liver dysfunction and age-related metabolic pathologies and co-morbidities.

5. Conclusions

These experiments demonstrate successful application of the cPILOT multiplexing strategy to study changes in the liver proteome in aging. Overall, aging causes metabolic perturbations including proteins associated with energy and lipid metabolism. This study supports the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction and protein degradation are featured aging hallmarks. Rabbit proved useful as an alternative laboratory model to understand complex aging processes and more studies taking advantage of this system should be employed. The combination of these proteome changes in the liver may lead to increased risk of age-related diseases. Future studies should examine sex-specific effects and species-specific effects in aging. Arguably, these changes will impact the quality of life for the elderly and impact healthcare costs for a growing aging population.

Figure 1. Experimental workflow:

Male, New Zealand white rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) of mean age 251 days (N=4), 682 days (N=4), and 1349 days (N=4) were categorized as young, middle, and old age groups, respectively. Proteins were extracted from liver tissues and pooled samples were generated by mixing equimolar amounts of protein from all rabbits prior to trypsin/Lys-C digestion. Peptides were labeled using the cPILOT strategy, pooled, and separated by offline high-pH fractionation. Each of the 12 fractions was analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos MS. Light and heavy dimethylated peptide peak pairs were fragmented with CID-MS/MS, and the 10 most intense MS/MS fragments were subjected to HCD fragmentation for the detection of reporter ions at the MS3 level.
