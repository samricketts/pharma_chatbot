Background.

The dystonias are a group of disorders characterized by excessive muscle contractions leading to abnormal repetitive movements or postures. In blepharospasm, the face is affected, leading to excessive eye blinking and spasms of muscles around the eyes. The pathogenesis of blepharospasm is not well understood, but several imaging studies have implied subtle structural defects in several brain regions, including the cerebellum.

Objective.

To delineate cerebellar pathology in brains collected at autopsy from 7 human subjects with blepharospasm and 9 matched controls.

Methods.

Sections from 3 cerebellar regions were sampled and processed using Nissl and silver impregnation stains. Purkinje neurons were the focus of the evaluation, along with as several other subtle pathological features of cerebellar dysfunction such as Purkinje neuron axonal swellings (torpedo bodies), proliferation of basket cell processes around Purkinje neurons (hairy baskets), empty baskets (missing Purkinje neurons), and displacement of cell soma from their usual location (ectopic Purkinje neurons).

Results.

The results revealed a significant reduction in Purkinje neuron and torpedo body density, but no changes in any of the other measures.

Conclusions.

These findings demonstrate subtle neuropathological changes similar to those reported for subjects with cervical dystonia. These findings may underly some of the subtle imaging changes reported for blepharospasm.


pmcIntroduction

The dystonias are a group of disorders characterized by excessive muscle contractions leading to abnormal repetitive movements or postures (Jinnah, 2019). The most common subtypes of dystonia involve one region of the body such as the neck (cervical dystonia), the upper face (blepharospasm), the larynx (spasmodic dysphonia), or an upper limb (writer’s cramp). Although different areas of the body may be affected, the focal dystonias are thought to share pathogenesis that involves the brain’s motor network (Balint et al., 2018; Jinnah et al., 2013).

In a minority of cases, structural imaging of the brain may reveal discrete lesions thought to be responsible for focal dystonia (Corp et al., 2019; Khooshnoodi et al., 2013; Liuzzi et al., 2016). These lesions may occur in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, or midbrain and brainstem. In the majority of cases, structural brain imaging does not reveal any overt anatomical abnormalities. However, subtle microstructural or functional abnormalities are often found with more advanced neuroimaging methods such as voxel-based morphometry, diffusion tractography, or functional imaging (Berman et al., 2018; Chirumamilla et al., 2019; Glickman et al., 2020; Jochim et al., 2018; Neychev et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2013).

Because the dystonias are rare, histopathological studies of autopsy material are scarce. In one previous autopsy study of six cases of cervical dystonia, a methodical and quantitative survey revealed no consistent abnormalities in any brain region, except for subtle loss of Purkinje neurons (PNs) in the cerebellum (Prudente et al., 2012). A similar result was found in another study of two cases of cervical dystonia combined with tremor (Ma et al., 2012). Similar quantitative autopsy studies are lacking for other types of dystonia. However, a small loss of PNs was also reported in a study that involved 14 cases with dystonia, although the types of dystonia brains studied was not described (Louis et al., 2019). For blepharospasm, a review of the literature disclosed only 8 reports describing a total of 12 cases, and no consistent abnormalities were found (Table 1).

Since the focal dystonias may have a shared pathogenesis, the current study took advantage of prior findings from cervical dystonia to guide histopathological studies of the human brain for blepharospasm. Specifically, the current study compared seven blepharospasm brains with nine matched controls for PN density, as well as several other subtle pathological features of PN dysfunction such as axonal swellings (torpedo bodies), proliferation of basket cell processes around PN (hairy baskets), empty baskets (missing PN), and displacement of PNs from their usual location (ectopic Purkinje neurons).

Materials and Methods

Autopsy material.

The Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders at the University of Maryland was searched for autopsy specimens of subjects with blepharospasm. Cases were included if they had diagnoses of isolated focal blepharospasm, craniofacial dystonia (blepharospasm with or without oromandibular dystonia), or Meige syndrome (blepharospasm plus oromandibular dystonia, occasionally with cervical dystonia). Of the cases reviewed, five had sufficient tissue of good quality (BSP1-4,6). Tissue from one additional case was obtained from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program (BSP5) and another from Washington University of St. Louis (BSP7). Cases from the public brain bank had a diagnosis, but more detailed clinical information was lacking. Tissue from nine controls without blepharospasm or other forms of dystonia was obtained from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program, Emory Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, and the National Institute of Health NeuroBioBank (Table 2).

Formalin-preserved tissue was methodically sampled, focusing on the cerebellum due to prior histopathological findings in cervical dystonia. In the cerebellum, PN densities vary according to age and sex; and neuropathological changes may be restricted to specific cerebellar regions (Andersen et al., 2003). As a result, several regions of the cerebellum were sampled from each brain wherever possible. The study design aimed to include 2 sections each from the anterior and posterior vermis, and the left and right lateral hemispheres, for a total of 8 sections per brain. Sections from all regions were available for all cases with 3 exceptions due to limited tissue availability. BSP6 included 2 independent tissue blocks, but from unknown regions of the cerebellum. BSP1 included only one tissue block from the lateral cerebellum region and BSP7 included only one tissue block from an unspecified cerebellum region. All tissues were paraffin-processed and sectioned at 10 μm.

Histological procedures.

A two-stage staining process was used. First, all tissue sections were subjected to preliminary histological analysis with Nissl stains to assess tissue quality. Second, tissues from all regions underwent the modified Bielschowsky method for paraffin sections or Hirano silver stains (Hirano and Zimmerman, 1962). Since the Hirano stains were the main targets of quantification and can vary in quality from run to run, all cases and controls were Hirano-stained simultaneously in a single run.

Quantitative morphology.

Digital images for each tissue section were collected and analyzed with an Olympus BX51 microscope supported by the StereoInvestigator and Neurolucida platforms (MicroBrightField, Inc., Williston, VT, USA) as previously described (Prudente et al., 2012) Independently, digital images were also obtained for each section at using a Leica Aperio AT2 scanner at 20X at a higher nominal resolution of 0.47 μm/pixel. Two raters blinded to diagnosis viewed each section independently, one at the original resolution used in the prior study, and one at the higher resolution. Both were blinded to diagnosis. Several variables were quantified simultaneously. PNs were quantified in two ways, one was based on any PN soma visible with typical staining characteristics in the PN layer, and the other was based on PNs with visible nucleoli. PN nucleoli provide a more stringent criteria for PN and yield lower counts that total PNs, because the section must pass through the middle of the cell at the precise level of the nucleolus. Hairy baskets are processes of inhibitory neurons that surround PN and may to reflect pathological activity of PNs (Erickson-Davis et al., 2010). Hairy baskets were quantified using a 4-point rating scale that focusses on degree of hairiness as previously described (Erickson-Davis et al., 2010). Empty baskets were defined as hairy baskets where the PN soma was missing, a phenomenon that may reflect an artifact of cell loss during tissue processing. Torpedo bodies are pathological axonal swellings comprised of aggregated proteins (Louis et al., 2011; Louis et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2012). They were counted as dark brown or black swellings in Hirano stains. Finally, ectopic PNs were defined as cell soma with staining characteristics typical of normal PNs with a visible nucleus, but falling outside the normal PN layer, operationally defined as being surrounded on all sides by molecular layer (Kuo et al., 2011). To account for differences in section sizes, the PN layer was digitally traced for each section, and the length used to calculate the linear density of each variable counted. The linear density of hairy baskets depends on the linear density of PN soma, and the important variable is degree of hairiness rather than frequency of hairy baskets. Consequently, results for hairy baskets were normalized according to PN density and each level is presented as a percentage of total hairy baskets.

Statistical analyses.

Descriptive statistics are presented as average values ± standard error of the mean. Linear regression with adjustments for intra-individual correlation was used to estimate the association between the measured variables in blepharospasm cases as compared to controls. In the linear regression models, pathological target measures were the response variable and both group (blepharospasm or control) and location (cerebellar vermis or hemisphere) were explanatory variables. Because the initial statistical model did not reveal any significant effect of cerebellar region, results for different regions were merged. Although there was a good correlation between the two raters’ findings for most measures, only data from the rater who viewed the higher resolution images were used in the final linear regression model.

Results

The blepharospasm cases consisted of 4 women and 3 men (Table 2). Mean age at onset was 57±9.6 years, and mean age at death was 72±5.0 years. Mean duration of illness was 12.8±3.7 years. Post-mortem intervals ranged from 5–25 hours. The controls consisted of 9 age-matched controls of 4 women and 5 men. Mean age at death was 71±5.0 years. Post-mortem intervals ranged from 5–27 hours (Table 2). Nissl stains revealed good tissue preservation for all cases.

All cases were quantitatively evaluated for PNs, PN nucleoli, hairy baskets, empty baskets, torpedo bodies, and ectopic PNs (Figure 1). These variables were measured in at least 2 sections of the cerebellum for all 16 cases, except for 2 blepharospasm cases for which only 1 high quality section was available. The average length of PN layer available for measurement was 199.2±20.1 mm for the blepharospasm group and 110.9±10.5 mm for the control group. The total counts for each target and the correlation between the individuals who counted them are shown in Table 3. The correlations between the two raters’ counts varied according to the target measure: PN/mm, +0.78; PN nucleoli/mm, +0.74; average hairy basket level, +0.54; empty baskets/mm, and +0.47; torpedo bodies/mm, +0.57; ectopic PNs/mm, +0.14. The lower correlations for some of these measures is likely to reflect the very low counts for these items.

The linear density of PNs (expressed as PN/mm) ranged from 5.8 to 12.6. The PN linear density was 7.4±0.3 for the blepharospasm group and 8.3±0.5 for the controls. The linear regressions analysis indicated a statistically significant difference between these groups (p&lt;0.005). The linear density of PN nucleoli ranged from 1.7 to 4.5 PN nucleoli/mm, with a mean of 2.8±0.2 for the blepharospasm group and 2.9±0.2 for the controls. The group difference for PN nucleoli/mm was not statistically significant (p=0.29).

The linear density of hairy baskets was expressed according to a 4-point scale in which HB1 referred to the least hairy and HB4 referred to the most hairy (Erickson-Davis et al., 2010). Each level was normalized as a percentage of the total PN density and plotted as a histogram to represent the relative distribution of levels in both blepharospasm and control groups (Figure 2). A Chi-squared test of independence revealed no statistically significant differences between these groups. To further evaluate HB density between groups, a weighted average was calculated for each section, indicating the average level of “hairiness” in that specimen. The mean ± SEM for the average HB level was 1.85±0.14 for the blepharospasm group and 1.95±0.12 for the controls, a difference that was no statistically significant.

All of the remaining pathological abnormalities were uncommon. In the regression analyses, only the torpedo bodies showed a significant decrease in blepharospasm versus control cases (p=0.01; Figure 1). However, the low frequency of torpedoes and other abnormalities in the samples studied made meaningful statistical comparisons difficult.

Discussion

In the current studies, human brains collected at autopsy from seven individuals with blepharospasm and nine controls were compared for subtle neuropathological abnormalities in the cerebellum. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the linear density of PNs in blepharospasm compared to controls. However, there were no significant changes for any of the other pathological features quantified including PN nucleoli, hairy baskets, torpedo bodies, ectopic PNs, or empty baskets.

These results obtained for brains from individuals with blepharospasm are similar to those previously reported for brains from individuals with cervical dystonia (Ma et al., 2012; Prudente et al., 2012). In cervical dystonia, prior studies have shown a decrement in PN density, along with other histopathological features of cerebellar dysfunction such as increased torpedos and hairy baskets. However, the current studies revealed only a decrement in PN density, with no evidence for increased torpedos or hairy baskets. These results are also consistent with another study that showed a slight reduction in PN density in the brains of subjects with different types of dystonia (Louis et al., 2019). In this study, different types of dystonia were studied as a group, so relevance specifically for blepharospasm is not clear.

Limitations of histopathological studies for blepharospasm.

The abnormalities described here were not apparent in any of the prior histopathological studies of human blepharospasm brains. There are several reasons for the apparent discrepancy between the current and prior studies. First, most prior studies relied on the subjective impressions of a neuropathologist, most often with no quantitative measures. The small decrement in PN density found in the current study would not be detected without quantitative comparisons. However, it is noteworthy that three of the twelve prior cases studied were described as having a mild loss of cerebellar PNs (Table 1). Second, most prior studies included only 1–3 blepharospasm cases, making it difficult to appreciate any consistent changes in relation to control brains. Finally, many prior studies analyzed blepharospasm brains together with other neurological disorders. By combining blepharospasm cases with other disorders, it would be easy to miss abnormalities limited to the blepharospasm cases. Finally, many prior studies focused on the basal ganglia, not the cerebellum.

The current study avoided some of the limitations of the prior studies. It involved quantitative studies of the largest number of blepharospasm brains ever studied, with independent review of stained sections by two microscopists blinded to diagnosis. Nevertheless, the current study still had some shortcomings. Although it describes the largest number of blepharospasm brains ever evaluated, the total of seven cases is still relatively small. Larger studies are limited by the rarity of the disorder, and the lack of widely available brain samples. Another limitation of the current study was that it relied on tissue in part from public sources, where clinical details were limited. As a result, more detailed clinico-pathological correlations are not feasible. Another limitation is that prior sampling of brains from brain banks sometimes limited the tissue available. As a result, detailed comparisons of changes across regions was not possible. It is also possible that other comorbidities or conditions associated with brain collection affected PN numbers, although this concern is relevant for both the blepharospasm and control groups equally. Finally, the current study focused on the cerebellum because of recent histopathological studies in cervical dystonia. Therefore, subtle histopathological changes in other brain regions cannot be excluded.

Despite the limitations of the current study, the results are consistent with recent imaging studies that have frequently pointed to abnormalities of the cerebellum in subjects with blepharospasm. For example, focal lesions of the cerebellum have been associated with blepharospasm in several case studies (Khooshnoodi et al., 2013). Volumetric MRI studies have suggested mild cerebellar atrophy in blepharospasm (Tomic et al., 2020), and volume-based regional cross-correlation network analyses have implied decreased structural connectivity of the cerebellum (Chirumamilla et al., 2019). There also is evidence of abnormal cerebellar function in blepharospasm. In one study involving resting state fMRI with region of interest analyses, there was reduced functional connectivity of the cerebellum (Jochim et al., 2018). In another study EMG activity corresponding to eye spasms was linked with specific areas in the cerebellum (Glickman et al., 2020). Finally, diffusion tensor imaging has suggested abnormalities of the red nucleus, a major target of cerebellar outflow (Berman et al., 2018). Thus there is ample imaging evidence for subtle structural changes in the cerebellum. A reduction in PN may explain these imaging findings, because PN are the major source of output from the cerebellum.

Specificity of histopathological findings for blepharospasm.

PN loss is not specific to blepharospasm. In fact, it is a relatively non-specific finding associated with many conditions (Louis et al., 2019; Sarna and Hawkes, 2003). PN loss has been reported for many degenerative disorders including many types of ataxia, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and others. PN loss has also been reported for developmental disorders such as autism. Loss of PN can also be acquired from hypoxia/ischemia, traumatic brain injury, drugs and toxins, and normal aging. These observations imply that cerebellar PNs are vulnerable to many different types of insults. Therefore, it is impossible to make any conclusions regarding a causal relationship between PN loss and BL.

Subtle loss of PNs along with other neuropathological evidence of cerebellar dysfunction also has been reported extensively for essential tremor (Louis, 2018). In this regard, it is important to point out the well-known relationships between the dystonias and tremors. A recent study demonstrated that the likelihood of tremor depended on the body region affected with dystonia (Shaikh et al., 2021). Approximately two thirds of subjects with cervical dystonia have a co-existing tremor, while only one fifth of subjects with blepharospasm also have tremor. Thus, it is feasible that neuropathological changes in the cerebellum of cervical dystonia reflect co-existing tremor. Although the loss of PN in blepharospasm is much less likely to reflect co-existing tremor, more detailed clinical information regarding the co-existence of tremor in our blepharospasm cases was not available. In any event the reduction of PN density is not specific to blepharospasm, but likely instead provides only indirect evidence for abnormal cerebellar function. Further studies that probe the function of remaining PNs may provide additional insights into the changes occurring in the cerebellum.

Figure 1. Cerebellar neuropathologic features. Panel A shows the usual anatomical arrangement with 4 Purkinje neurons (PN) in the PN cell layer between the molecular layer (ML) and the granule cell layer (GCL). Also evident in this section is an ectopic PN in the middle of the molecular layer. Panel B also shows the PN cell layer between the ML and GCL, with a large torpedo body extending into the ML. Panel C shows the PN cell layer at higher magnification with an example of one PN and its nucleolus along with an empty basket (EB). Bar graphs at the bottom of the figure show average values ±SEM for blepharospasm (n=7, gray) and controls (n=9, black). To account for differences in tissue section sizes, all histopathological features counted were normalized according to length of the Purkinje neuron layer measured, and expressed as linear density (items/mm). Double asterisk denotes p&lt;0.005, and single asterisk denotes p&lt;0.02 in linear regression analyses.

Figure 2. Cerebellar hairy baskets. The left side of the figure provides examples of hairy basket severity where individual Purkinje neurons are associated with few or no stained fibers (HB1), a few fibers close to the soma (HB2), a more extensive fiber network nearly surrounding the soma (HB3), and a fiber network nearly encasing the soma (HB4). The distribution of severity appeared to be shifted to the left (less severe) in blepharospasm cases compared to controls, but the difference was not statistically significant.
