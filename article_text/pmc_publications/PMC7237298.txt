Sufficient sleep is critical for health in older adults, but prescription sleep aids are associated with numerous health risks (e.g., cognitive impairment, falls). We examine usage prevalence of two medication categories - sedative hypnotics (SH) and medications commonly used for insomnia (MCUFI) - among adults ages 45+ in the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center dataset. Analyzing visits conducted between September 2005 and June 2018, we determine factors associated with SH and MCUFI use, including sociodemographic, health, independence, and cognitive statuses. Usage rates were 9% for MCUFI (N=3,279) and 4% for SH (N=1,382). Multivariable logistic regression identified white race, higher education, younger age, depression, and sedative polypharmacy as factors associated with prescription sleep aid use. We conclude that sleep medication usage rates among older adults, higher likelihood of sedative medication polypharmacy, and higher likelihood of MCUFI use among adults with cognitive impairment are findings of concern and may warrant clinical intervention.


INTRODUCTION

Sufficient sleep is critical for health and well-being in older adults (Grandner, 2019) yet 20–30% of this population meet the diagnostic criteria for chronic insomnia (Neikrug &amp; Ancoli-Israel, 2010). Increased awareness of sleep’s importance to health has coincided with the development, promotion, and increased prescription of sleep medications (Barbee, Moloney, &amp; Konrad, 2018; Bertisch, Herzig, Winkelman, &amp; Buettner, 2014; Grandner, 2019; Mooallem, 2007). Between 1993 and 2007, rates of sleep medication prescriptions increased 30-fold in the United States (U.S.) (Moloney, Konrad, &amp; Zimmer, 2011).

Currently, an estimated 3–11% of the U.S. population use prescription sleep medications (Aparasu, Mort, &amp; Brandt, 2003; Bertisch et al., 2014) and long-term use is common (Chong, Fryar, &amp; Gu, 2013). Although the potential for residual confounding cannot be ruled out, multiple, well-designed studies have found a clear dose-response effect between the use of prescription sleep aids and increased risk of morbidity and mortality (Kripke, 2016; Kripke, Langer, &amp; Kline, 2012; Weich et al., 2014). Short-term risks include falls and impaired cognition (American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel, 2015, 2019; Treves, Perlman, Kolenberg Geron, Asaly, &amp; Matok, 2018); long-term risks include neurocognitive disorders (Glass, Lanctôt, Herrmann, Sproule, &amp; Busto, 2005; Kripke et al., 2012). Even moderate use (91–180 doses), is linked with a 43–51% increased odds of developing Alzheimer’s disease (Biolloti de Gage et al., 2014).

These potential risks have resulted in calls for clinicians to: a) avoid prescription sleep medications as first-line insomnia therapy and b) limit their overall use, particularly in older adults (Qaseem et al., 2016). Since 2015, the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria recommendation has been to avoid these drugs altogether because their well-documented harms outweigh their limited efficacy (American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel, 2015, 2019).

Nevertheless, multiple studies have found older age to be associated with prescription sleep medication use (Bertisch et al., 2014; Leggett, Pepin, Sonnega, &amp; Assari, 2016). Other studies, however, have found the age group 45–64 to be the most likely to receive a prescription sleep medication (Moloney, Ciciurkaite, &amp; Brown, 2019; Moloney et al., 2011). Factors consistently associated with sleep medication use include: white race, female sex, higher socioeconomic status, depressive symptoms, polypharmacy, and poor self-rated health (Aparasu et al., 2003; Bertisch et al., 2014; Chong et al., 2013; Morgan et al., 2016).

When considering prescription data most useful for clinicians, health researchers, and policy makers, two distinct but overlapping classes of sleep aids are typically analyzed: a) sedative hypnotics (SH), defined as non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics and select benzodiazepines that are FDA-approved for insomnia, (Moloney et al., 2019; Moloney et al., 2011; Rasu, Shenolikar, Nahata, &amp; Balkrishnan, 2005) and b) medications commonly used for insomnia (MCUFI), which include SH, as well as barbiturates, doxepin, quetiapine, ramelteon, and trazodone (Bertisch et al., 2014).

Given their narrow therapeutic scope, SH are the more commonly analyzed category of prescription sleep medications. However, SH analyses tend to be based on office-based studies and exclude multiple medications that “are more often prescribed for treatment of insomnia than for other indications” (Bertisch et al. 2014, p344). The MCUFI categorization is based on patient-reported sleep medication use with medication reconciliation and verification among community dwelling adults (Bertisch et al. 2014) and may more accurately reflect the wide range of prescription medications individuals use for sleep. Like SH, MCUFI have myriad short and long-term side effects and are not recommended for adults ages 65+.

Uniquely, the present study determines factors associated with sleep medication use, including sociodemographic characteristics, health, and independence status among participants aged 45+ in the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center dataset (NACC) for both SH and MCUFI. Importantly, we also leverage the unique strengths of the data collected through NACC and assess the understudied association between cognitive function and SH/MCUFI use. Adults with impaired cognition may be particularly susceptible to sleep medication side effects including confusion and memory impairment (Bell et al., 2011). These medication side effects may be erroneously misattributed to pre-existing cognitive deficits, missing an opportunity for improved health through medication change or cessation (Bell et al., 2011; Coupland et al., 2019).

Based on previous literature, we hypothesize that the following factors will be associated with higher odds of MCUFI and SH use in the NACC dataset: white race, female sex, higher socioeconomic status, depressive symptoms, polypharmacy, and poor self-rated health. Although we acknowledge the variation in prior findings related to age as a factor associated with sleep medication use, we predict, based on the most up-to-date prescription trend data (Moloney et al., 2019), that middle age (45–64) will be associated with higher odds of sleep medication use. As highlighted by recent research, identifying potentially inappropriate medication use in middle age may offer increased opportunities for patient education and deprescribing interventions (Coupland et al., 2019).

METHODS

Study Population

The data were drawn from NACC, which was established in 1999 and funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) with an administrative and a research purpose (Beekly et al., 2004). In 2005, NACC designed a standard data protocol, Uniform Data Set (UDS), and collected data from approximately 39 Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs). Data including sociodemographic characteristics, family history, medical history, neurological evaluations, and medication use information was collected at participants’ initial and follow-up visits (Beekly et al., 2007; Morris et al., 2006). For this study, we used the UDS initial visit packet for visits conducted between September 2005 and the June 2018 data freeze. Inclusion criteria were: (1) 45 years or older at their initial UDS visit; (2) medication data recorded at the initial UDS visit. These data are deidentified and thus this study was exempt from review by the authors’ university’s institutional review board.

Outcomes of Interest

Medication use was identified from the self-reported data collected at enrollment using the “brown bag” medication review approach (Garcia, 2006). In this approach, the participant or family member are asked to bring all current medications (used within the preceding two weeks) to the research assessment visit (Morris et al., 2006). Our outcome of interest was the use of one or more medications commonly used for insomnia (MCUFI). Our MCUFI variable was based on Bertisch et al.’s (2014) categorization and captured use of the following drugs: amobarbital, amobarbital-secobarbital, chloral hydrate, doxepin, estazolam, eszopiclone, flurazepam, quetiapine, ramelteon, temazepam, trazodone, triazolam, quazepam, zaleplon, zolpidem. Additionally, we created a “sedative hypnotic” (SH) variable that captured use of the following drugs, all FDA-approved for insomnia: benzodiazepines (triazolam, temazepam, estazolam, flurazepam hydrochloride, quazepam) and benzodiazepine receptor agonists (zolpidem, zolpidem tartrate, eszopiclone, zaleplon, ramelteon, suvorexant) (Ford et al., 2014; Moloney et al., 2019; Moloney et al., 2011; Rasu et al., 2005).

Covariates of Interest

With the exception of cognitive status, we based our co-variate selection on the work of Bertisch et al. (2014); variables that were missing from NACC or unavailable prior to the 2015 version (e.g., arthritis) were excluded from our analyses. All covariates of interest, including demographics and medical history, were assessed at the participants’ initial visit. Demographic information included age (45 to 64, or 65+), sex, race (White, Black or African American, or other), level of education (high school or less, bachelor’s degree, or over master’s degree), level of independence (able to live independently, requires some assistance, or completely dependent), and marital status (married/cohabitating, previously married, or never married).

Self-reported medical history included depression (active depression within the last two years or depression episodes more than 2 years ago), diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, smoke cigarettes in the last 30 days, alcohol abused over a 12 months period, body mass index (BMI = underweight: &lt;18.5; normal: 18.5–24.9; overweight: 25–29.9; obese: 30+), and other sedative medications (as described by Bertisch et al. and listed in the supplementary S1) (Bertisch et al., 2014).

When calculating number of medications reported for the MCUFI users and non-users, the number of medications for MCUFI was excluded. Similarly, for the sedative hypnotic users and non-users, the number of medications for sedative hypnotic was excluded. We measured cognitive function using the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes (CDRSUM). CDRSUM scores range from 0 to 18. The score is obtained by summing 6 domains: memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on 5-point scales (0: no impairment; 0.5: questionable impairment; 1.0: mild impairment; 2.0: moderate impairment; 3.0: severe impairment). Higher scores indicate greater cognitive impairment (Morris et al., 2006; O’Bryant et al., 2008).

Statistical Methods

Baseline characteristics were compared using descriptive statistics. We used chi-square statistics to assess the statistical association between the categorical variable and the use of MCUFI and SH. We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate the factors associated with use of MCUFI and SH, including cognitive status, medical history, and demographic characteristics. Participants with missing values (N=2,328), including unknown (except BMI which had a large number of participants in the unknown category, thus was treated as a separate category), were excluded from the multivariable logistic regression. Because quetiapine is commonly prescribed for conditions other than insomnia (e.g., schizophrenia, episodes of mania or depression), we also conducted MCUFI analyses excluding participants who reported quetiapine use. To identify the best fitting logistic models (e.g., reduced models), backward elimination using Akaike’s Information Criterion values was obtained from the full models. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval were reported for the full and reduced models. All data analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4®,(SAS Institute Inc., 2013–2017) and α = .05 was set as the significance level.

RESULTS

Distribution of MCUFI and SH Medications

Trazadone was the most commonly used MCUFI medication (34%), followed by zolpidem (26%) and quetiapine (25%) (see Figure 1). Of SH medications, Zolpidem was the most commonly used (65%), followed by temazepam (16%), and eszopiclone (10%) (see Figure 2).

Demographic Characteristics

Table 1 presents the demographic characteristics of NACC participants by MCUFI and SH use status. Of 37,289 participants, 3,279 (9%) reported using MCUFI and 1,382 (4%) reported using SH. MCUFI and SH usage patterns typically overlapped. Compared with adults reporting no use, MCUFI and SH users tended to be younger, white, and more highly educated. MCUFI users were more likely to be male, compared to non-users; for SH users there was no significant difference by sex. Compared to non-users, MCUFI users were more likely to require some living assistance or be completely dependent; SH users were more likely to live independently.

Unadjusted prevalence of MCUFI use was higher among adults with a high school degree (10%), ages 45–64 (10%), married or previously married (9% each) and white (9%). Unadjusted prevalence of MCUFI use among completely dependent adults was 28%; prevalence was 10% for adults who required some assistance.

Unadjusted prevalence of SH use was 4% for ages 45–64 and 65+. It was roughly equal (3–4%) among adults of all levels of educational attainment and levels of independence. Prevalence of SH use was equal (4%) among all marital statuses.

Health Status and Medication Use

MCUFI and SH users were more likely to report active or past depression, cardiovascular disease, and alcohol abuse (see Table 2). Higher CDRSUM scores were significantly associated with MCUFI use compared to non-use; this trend was reversed in SH users. MCUFI users were more likely to be underweight, compared to non-users; for SH users there was no significant difference by body mass index. When compared to non-users, MCUFI and SH users were more likely to be taking a higher number of medications generally and sedative medications specifically.

MCUFI usage rates were highest among those with current (15%) or past depression (16%), or alcohol abuse (14%). Participants reporting five or more medications or use of non-MCUFI sedative medications also had high prevalence rates of MCUFI use (11% and 19% respectively). Unadjusted prevalence rates of SH use did not differ by age group or marital status (4% for all categories). Rates were slightly lower for adults with a high school education (3%) compared to those with a bachelor’s degree or beyond (4%).

Similar to MCUFI use, participants with current or prior history of depression (6%) and those with a history of alcohol abuse (5%) had higher rates of SH use. Participants reporting five or more medications or non-MCUFI sedative medications also had higher usage prevalence rates (5% and 8% respectively).

Rates of MCFU and SH use by year were relatively stable over the period of analysis (2005–2018). Prevalence of MCUFI use was lowest in 2007 (7.9%) and highest in 2018 (10.5%). Prevalence of SH use was lowest in 2015 (3.2%) and highest in 2014 (4.5%) (see supplementary S2).

Factors Predictive of MCUFI and SH Use

To determine predictive factors, we ran full and reduced models. Although the C-statistics and outcomes did not meaningfully vary between models, the reduced models have better AIC value (see Table 3). Factors significantly associated with higher odds of MCUFI and SH use included: higher education, active or past depression, history of alcohol abuse, non-MCUFI sedative medication use, and higher number of medications. Factors significantly associated with lower odds of MCUFI and SH use were older age (65+) and Black race.

Some factors were significant for either MCUFI or SH use. Higher CDRSUM scores were significantly associated with MCUFI use but not SH use. The BMI category of “unknown,” and an independence status of “complete dependence” were significantly associated with higher odds of MCUFI only. A prior history of diabetes was significantly associated with lower odds of MCUFI use. Individuals who reported requiring some living assistance had significantly lower odds of SH use compared to those living independently.

As noted, we ran a sensitivity analysis excluding quetiapine. While most outcomes were unchanged, history of diabetes, higher CDRSUM scores, and BMI were no longer associated with MCUFI use. Please see supplementary S3 for the results of these additional analyses.

DISCUSSION

Given the potential risks associated with sleep medication use, (Glass et al., 2005; Kripke et al., 2012) it is important that clinicians and policy makers know which sub-populations are most likely to use these drugs. Evaluating usage patterns and factors associated with sleep medication use may aid in refining recommendations; identification of “at-risk” patients may facilitate implementation of guideline-driven treatments (Leggett et al., 2016).

While previous research has tracked the increased use of sleep medications over time and identified important associations with socio-demographic factors, health, and independence (Aparasu et al., 2003; Bertisch et al., 2014; Chong et al., 2013; Ford et al., 2014; Moloney et al., 2019; Morgan et al., 2016) the present study is unique in its consideration of two sleep medication categories: sedative-hypnotics (SH) and medications commonly used for insomnia (MCUFI). Although the SH category is more commonly found in the literature, it is possible that the MCUFI category more accurately captures how individuals in the community use a wide range of prescription medications for sleep. In addition to examining patterns of SH and MCUFI use for similarities and differences, the NACC data allow us to evaluate understudied associations between sleep medication use and cognitive status. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess usage patterns and factors associated with prescription sleep medication use among NACC participants.

Rates of sleep medication use in this sample, 4% for SH and 9% for MCUFI, were on par with nationally representative data (Aparasu et al., 2003; Bertisch et al., 2014). The majority of SH and MCUFI users within NACC were white, ages 65+, married or co-habiting, and held at least a bachelor’s degree.

Support for our hypotheses was mixed. For instance, sex was not significantly associated with sleep medication use in our sample, nor were chronic health conditions. As we predicted, and consistent with prior studies, white race, greater educational attainment, active or past depression, history of alcohol abuse, polypharmacy generally, and sedative polypharmacy specifically, were factors associated with MCUFI and SH use within this sample. Further, middle age (45–64) was associated with higher odds of MCUFI and SH use, compared to older age. The well-documented dose-response effect between sleep medications and increased risk of health harms (Kripke, 2016; Kripke et al., 2012) and the propensity for long-term use of these drugs (Chong et al., 2013) suggests that middle-age may be an ideal time for sleep aid education and/or intervention (Coupland et al., 2019).

Two findings were of particular concern. The first is that use of non-MCUFI sedative medications was associated with more than double the odds of MCUFI use (aOR 2.23, 95% CI 2.05, 2.43); the odds associated with SH use were even higher (aOR 2.46, 95% CI 0.94, 1.47). Even more alarming, taking 1 to 4 additional medications was associated with 5.49 times higher odds (95% CI 3.67, 8.21) of MCUFI use and 9.05 times higher odds (95% CI 4.03, 20.31) of SH use. Use of five or more medications was associated with 7.16 times higher odds (95% CI 4.79, 10.69) of MCUFI use and 13.67 times higher odds (95% CI 6.10, 30.64) of SH use. Previous studies consistently indicate that polypharmacy increases the risk of inappropriate medication use in older adults, especially those with cognitive impairment, and results in negative health consequences (Moga, Abner, Wu, &amp; Jicha, 2017; Ramsey, Gnjidic, Agogo, Allore, &amp; Moga, 2018).

Further, both “complete dependence” in their living situations and higher cognitive impairment scores were associated with significantly higher odds of MCFUI use. As previously noted, adults with cognitive impairment may be more susceptible to sleep medication side effects like confusion. There is some evidence that prescription sleep medications may speed cognitive deterioration and/or hasten death (Ellul et al., 2007; Kripke et al., 2012). These factors, in conjunction with the aforementioned high rates of polypharmacy, may signal the need for intervention. Research indicates that deprescribing interventions and medication therapy management to reduce potentially inappropriate medication use, including sleep medications, can be successful (Moga, Abner, Rigsby, et al., 2017; Tannenbaum, Martin, Tamblyn, Benedetti, &amp; Ahmed, 2014).

In sum, insomnia is a public health problem (Grandner, 2019) but treating it with potentially harmful prescription sleep medications may increase rather than decrease health risks. Given the high rates of polypharmacy found in our study, clinicians may wish to consider routine drug regimen reviews with patients (van der Spek et al., 2018). This may be particularly critical for patients with cognitive impairment and those who cannot live independently, as participants in our sample possessing those characteristics had higher odds of MCUFI use. Clinicians should also be mindful of other possible predisposing factors to sleep medication use including middle age, advanced degree, white race, and history of depression. Specific medication cautions should be tailored to patients’ age, health, living situation, and cognitive status.

Importantly, clinicians may wish to consider therapeutic options beyond the reduction or cessation of medication, as insomnia itself is a risk factor for multiple negative health outcomes. For instance, some research indicates that insomnia, independent of medication use, increases the risk of falls (Avidan et al., 2005; Min &amp; Slattum, 2018). When appropriate, healthcare providers may encourage patients to consider effective, non-pharmacologic therapies including mindfulness-based stress reduction programs, and/or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia (Gallegos, Moynihan, &amp; Pigeon, 2016; Mitchell, Gehrman, Perlis, &amp; Umscheid, 2012). CBT has also been suggested as a means to address mood and behavioral issues associated with dementia (Sadowsky &amp; Galvin, 2012), and may be paired with other non-pharmacologic therapies (e.g., reducing environmental stimulation, use of hearing aids) (Barton, Ketelle, Merrilees, &amp; Miller, 2016).

Although our analysis benefitted from the addition of participants’ CDRSUM scores, the NACC dataset has notable limitations. NACC participants have, on average, higher levels of education and are not representative of the general population. Though we intentionally limited our analysis to the initial visit to more closely mirror community prescribing patterns (as enrollment in NACC may have influenced use of prescription drugs), our cross-sectional data do not capture changes in sleep medication use over time. Further, the NACC dataset does not collect indications for prescribed medication.

Though we replicate sleep medication categories previously used in the sleep literature (Bertisch et al., 2014; Ford et al., 2014; Moloney et al., 2019; Moloney et al., 2011; Rasu et al., 2005) it is possible that not all of the prescriptions we evaluated were being used to treat insomnia and that other medications used for sleep were not analyzed. Thus, our results likely reflect some misclassification bias. For instance, when we excluded quetiapine - the third-most oft-prescribed MCUFI drug - from the analysis, we found that history of diabetes, higher CDRSUM scores, and BMI were no longer associated with MCUFI use. It is possible that quetiapine may have been primarily used for episodes of anxiety or depression, or behavioral issues that commonly co-occur with neurocognitive disorders.

NACC lacks a number of variables that would have been valuable to assess, including geographic region and health insurance type. Most critically, potentially relevant diagnosis variables including sleep disturbance and anxiety were not added to the NACC dataset until 2015. Limiting our analytic period to begin in 2015 would have resulted in a sample size too small for meaningful analysis. However, previous research has demonstrated that complaints of sleep disturbance and prescription of sleep medication do not necessarily co-occur (Ancoli-Israel &amp; Roth, 1999; Moloney et al., 2019; Moloney et al., 2011). Assessing factors associated with medication use within a specific dataset is not generalizable to other populations and is in no way equivalent to claiming causation.

Finally, we had a high number of missing responses to BMI data, and chose to analyze those respondents as an “unknown” category. Imputation analyses did not change our results. Despite these limitations this work contributes to the literature by assessing prevalence and predictive factors of both SH and MCUFI use among participants of the NACC and investigating the role of cognitive status, as assessed by the CDRSUM.

In conclusion, rates of sleep medication use among older adults in NACC do not align with American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria recommendations. Higher rates of SH and MCUFI use in middle-aged adults present an opportunity for education and/or deprescribing interventions. As cognitive impairment was associated with MCUFI use, interventions should target deprescribing in people who are at increased risk of dementia. Higher likelihood of sedative medication polypharmacy, as well as higher likelihood of MCUFI use among adults with the inability to live independently are also findings of concern. Clinicians should be mindful of health conditions and socio-demographic factors that are associated with higher likelihood of sleep medication use and implement behavioral insomnia interventions when feasible. Future research should further investigate the effects of various sleep medications on cognition. Interventions designed to reduce the uptake or duration of sleep medication use in all patients, will be important next steps.
