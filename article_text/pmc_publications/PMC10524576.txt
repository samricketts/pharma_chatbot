INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with increasing relevance as dementia cases rise. The etiology of AD is widely debated. The Calcium hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease and brain aging states that the dysfunction of calcium signaling is the final common pathway leading to neurodegeneration. When the hypothesis was originally coined the technology did not exist to test it, but with the advent of Yellow Cameleon 3.6 (YC3.6) we are able to test its validity.

METHODS

Here we review use of YC3.6 in studying Alzheimer's disease using mouse models and discuss whether these studies support or refute the Calcium hypothesis.

RESULTS

YC3.6 studies showed that amyloidosis preceded dysfunction in neuronal calcium signaling and changes in synapse structure. This evidence supports the Calcium hypothesis.

DISCUSSION

In vivo YC3.6 studies point to calcium signaling as a promising therapeutic target, however, additional work is necessary to translate these findings to humans.

pmc1 Narrative

1.1 Alzheimer’s disease

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that results in memory and cognitive impairments. It is a major cause of dementia that currently affects over six million Americans [1] and 47.5 million people worldwide [2]. The number of individuals with dementia is expected to increase to more than 135 million by 2050. As the sixth leading cause of death in the US, AD takes an enormous toll on patients and their families and is a tremendous burden to society. AD and related dementias are a major health concern.

Alzheimer’s pathology is characterized by the presence of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, as well as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that lead to significant synaptic and ultimately neuronal loss. Currently the therapeutic treatment options for AD are limited, with the majority of therapies focusing on relieving the symptoms. There is no cure for AD [3]. Understanding AD etiology is critical in developing effective therapeutics that target disease progression.

1.2 Calcium hypothesis

The etiology of AD is widely debated [4–7]. One of the hypotheses surrounding the etiology of AD is the Calcium hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease and brain aging [8]. The Calcium hypothesis was originally coined in 1984 [8] and has been revised since [9–11]. In its original form, the Calcium hypothesis was a way to redirect the field of aging and dementia to focus on the cellular events preceding the degeneration [8]. In 1984, the calcium hypothesis was a theory on the mechanisms regulating cellular calcium homeostasis. With this novel hypothesis pushing the field to explore the cellular mechanisms, the theory was revised multiple times, in 1989, 1994, and 2017 to support the emerging findings [9–11] (Table 1).

Calcium ion plays a critical role in regulating a myriad of cellular functions. In neurons, calcium regulates neurotransmission, synaptic activity, as well as the processes of learning and memory. Learning and memory are dependent on synaptic plasticity, that regulates which synaptic connections are strengthened, and which are weakened. Calcium signaling is vital to synaptic plasticity. Neurons maintain intracellular calcium at around 100nM through calcium homeostasis. Upon neuronal activation, intracellular calcium concentrations rise as calcium enters the cell where it is responsible for activating downstream pathways. Upon entry into the nucleus, calcium results in gene expression which ultimately leads to synaptic plasticity [12, 13]. Thus, proper calcium signaling within neurons is necessary for circuits in the brain to function properly. And maintenance of low intracellular calcium through calcium homeostasis is critical for healthy neuronal function.

Disruptions in calcium homeostasis have been observed in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [14–17]. The Calcium hypothesis of AD posits that sustained changes in the molecular mechanisms underlying calcium homeostasis result in calcium elevations that are beyond normal modulations. These intracellular calcium elevations play a critical role in the neural dysfunction underlying AD [9]. The perturbations in calcium homeostasis ultimately lead to the neuropathophysiology underlying Alzheimer’s disease. There are numerous molecular events that can occur, but all lead to calcium dysregulation, thus initiating a downstream cascade. Here we will discuss whether these molecular mechanisms that lead to disruptions in calcium homeostasis ultimately result in neuropathophysiology in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease.

Despite the existence of the calcium of hypothesis for decades, evidence for the molecular mechanisms leading to neuropathological changes were lacking until recently, since it was a challenge to test calcium hypothesis in 1980s. However, recent advent of chemically- and genetically-encoded calcium sensors as well as multiphoton microscopy, has allowed testing some points of the hypothesis. Technological advancements including the development of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as Yellow Cameleon 3.6 (YC3.6) allowed monitoring calcium levels in individual neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Thus, calcium imaging using multiphoton microscopy led to generation of the data critical to test the Calcium hypothesis. Here we review the studies providing substantial support for the cascade that ultimately leads to the neuropathophysiology underlying Alzheimer’s disease, including these major events:

Amyloidosis precedes neuronal calcium dysregulation, and basal calcium elevations in neurons are directly affected by amyloid-beta.

Calcium elevations also occur in astrocytes, resulting in disruptions of calcium transients indicating a global astrocytic response.

Disruption in calcium homeostasis causes morphological changes in neurons and synapses.

We need to understand better how elevations in basal calcium levels are induced by amyloid-beta and how these calcium elevations in turn lead to neuropathological changes associated with AD. Only then will we be able to develop effective therapeutics for patients with AD.

1.3 YC3.6 and calcium imaging

Calcium imaging is a powerful tool used to monitor calcium activity in vivo using high resolution multiphoton microscopy [18]. Differential approaches of targeting the genetically encoded calcium indicators to specific cell types or cellular compartments were developed [19–23]. These approaches allowed visualization of calcium within distinct cells and cellular compartments. The use of these genetically encoded calcium indicators allowed visualizations of calcium activity in healthy animals, and in animal models of AD. Throughout this review, we will focus on one particular calcium indicator, YC3.6. Review of other calcium indications such as GCaMPs has been done elsewhere [24].

YC3.6 is a ratiometric calcium sensor that utilizes fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)[25]. This calcium sensor consists of ECFP, calmodulin (CaM), a glycylglycine linker, the CaM binding peptide of the myosin light-chain kinase (M13), and cpVenus (Figure 1). It allows quantitative measurements of intracellular calcium concentrations in individual neuronal and non-neuronal cells as well as distinct cellular organelles [19, 23]. Use of YC3.6 provides an attractive methodology for visualizing basal calcium changes as part of disease progression or a treatment regimen. Multiphoton imaging is a high-resolution imaging technology that allows imaging of structure and function within intact mouse brains and performing calcium imaging using YC3.6. It allows imaging at the cellular and subcellular levels with high spatial (up to 1 micron) and temporal (up to 30Hz) resolutions. Multiphoton imaging has been extensively used in studying neuropathological features as part of Alzheimer’s progression using transgenic mouse models of AD. Next, we will review the use of YC3.6 in transgenic mouse models of AD.

1.4 Application of YC3.6 in vivo

Transgenic mouse models of amyloidosis, such as APP/PS1 and Tg2576 mice exhibit a small yet vulnerable cortical neuronal population with elevations in basal intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i , calcium overload [26, 27]. Neuronal calcium elevations are evident early in the disease progression around the time of cortical amyloid deposition at 5 months of age in APP/PS1 mice and increase in the course of the disease progression amounting up to ~20% of neuronal processes exhibiting calcium overload [26]. Neuronal processes in close proximity to amyloid plaques were more vulnerable to calcium dyshomeostasis and exhibited greater incidence of calcium overload [26]. Moreover, neuronal calcium overload also altered the morphology of individual neurons and disrupted the compartmentalization of calcium in dendritic spines [26].

The deposition of amyloid plaques and elevations of neuronal calcium around the same time and the correlation of calcium overload with the proximity to amyloid plaques raises the question of whether amyloid-beta causes calcium disruptions. Application of amyloid-beta oligomers as transgenic conditioned media (TgCM) or amyloid-beta derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) increased resting calcium levels in those neurons [28, 29] and resulted in loss of dendritic spines or synapses within 24 hours of treatment [28]. Thus, oligomeric amyloid-beta elicits neuronal calcium elevations in mouse models of amyloidosis.

In addition to monitoring resting calcium levels within neuronal processes in vivo, YC3.6 can be targeted to specific intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria in neurons of APP/PS1 mice [30]. Multiphoton imaging revealed disruption of calcium homeostasis in mitochondria of these mice. The number of neuronal mitochondria with calcium elevations increased significantly after amyloid plaque deposition in APP/PS1 mice [30]. Application of soluble Aβ oligomer-rich TgCM led to calcium elevations in mitochondria of non-transgenic mouse brains. Thus, mitochondrial calcium overload is amyloid-β dependent [30]. Furthermore, elevation in mitochondria calcium correlated with rare instances of neuronal cell death in APP/PS1 mice [30]. Thus, amyloid-beta drives calcium elevations in both neuronal processes and intracellular organelles like the mitochondria.

In addition to monitoring basal calcium levels within neurons, calcium indicators allow visualization of calcium levels within non-neuronal cells. Oregon green Bapta (OGB) coupled with astrocytic marker, SR-101, was used to monitor the resting intracellular calcium in OGB-expressing astrocytes. A percentage of astrocytes exhibited calcium elevations regardless of their proximity to individual plaques, indicating a global response of astrocytic calcium elevations to amyloid in APP/PS1 mice [31]. Astrocytic calcium overload also resulted in increased frequency of astrocytic calcium transients, independent of neuronal activity [31]. Thus, amyloid-beta not only affects neurons but leads to calcium disruptions in astrocytes. It also increases the frequency of calcium transients, which can indicate increased activity of astrocytes across the brain in response the Alzheimer’s disease pathology.

In addition to animal models of amyloidosis, YC3.6 was used to monitor basal calcium levels in an animal model of tauopathy. These mice overexpress P301L human mutant form of tau protein that continues to aggregate into neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the cortex and hippocampus with increasing age [32]. Even though adult rTg4510 mice exhibit signs of neurodegeneration, such as loss of dendritic spines and ultimately neurons, the resting calcium levels within neurons were not significantly altered by the accumulation of NFT [33]. Furthermore, the dendritic spine loss in rTg4510 mice did not correlate with changes in neuronal calcium levels [34]. The basal calcium levels were stable in neurons, dendrites and dendritic spines, despite accumulation of NFT in adult rTg4510 mice [33, 34]. These results support the idea that amyloid-β accumulation and calcium dysregulation are upstream of tau pathology.

Thus, coupling of the ratiometric calcium probe YC3.6 with multiphoton imaging allowed monitoring basal calcium levels in transgenic mouse models of amyloidosis and tauopathy. These studies elucidated neuronal and astrocytic vulnerability to amyloid-β that resulted in calcium elevations within processes and cellular compartments, such as mitochondria. Disruption of calcium homeostasis was an early event in disease progression preceding formation of NFT and thus provides an attractive timepoint for therapeutic intervention.

1.5 Therapeutic use of YC3.6

Multiphoton imaging of genetically encoded calcium sensor YC3.6 allows monitoring resting calcium levels in neurons of healthy animals as well as in animal models of AD. In addition to using amyloid plaques as a measure of AD progression, neuronal calcium overload can be used as a functional indicator of treatment efficacy. While amyloid plaques do not correlate with cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s patients, synapse loss does. Neuronal calcium overload precedes synapse loss in mouse models, indicating neuronal calcium overload could be a more accurate measure of AD progression[35]. Here we will describe the studies that have tested the effect of therapeutic treatments on neuronal calcium levels in vivo.

Anti-amyloid immunotherapies showed great promise in mouse models of AD [36, 37]. The therapeutic effect of chronic treatment with an amyloid-β immunotherapy aducanumab was evaluated using calcium imaging in adult Tg2576 mice, which overexpress amyloid precursor protein with Swedish mutation and start depositing amyloid-β plaques at 13 months [27]. Neuronal calcium levels were monitored in YC3.6-expressing cortical neurons prior to antibody treatment and in the course of treatment with administration of aducanumab for a period of 6 months. Prior to antibody treatment, Tg2576 mice exhibited significant calcium elevations, calcium overload, in their cortical neurons. Remarkably, weekly systemic treatment with aducanumab decreased the number of neurons with calcium overload in the course of treatment and restored neuronal calcium levels to control levels [27]. Aducanumab was recently approved by FDA as Aduhelm as the first disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibody ACU3B3, targeting Aβ oligomers (AβOs) specifically, was tested in adult non-transgenic mice challenged with AβOs [29]. Calcium imaging revealed that the calcium in YC3.6-expressing neurons was significantly increased after brain exposure to AβOs. These calcium elevations were prevented by pre-treatment of the brains with ACU3B3 [29]. Utilization of YC3.6 has allowed us to observe that calcium overload is both preventable and reversible. Accumulation of amyloid-beta is upstream of calcium dysregulation which makes it a promising therapeutic target at early stages of disease progression.

Also, therapeutic potential of a novel multimodal botanical drug, NB-02 (formerly known as DA-9803) was tested using YC3.6 in vivo [38, 39]. These studies implemented APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of amyloidosis, that also exhibit calcium overload in cortical neurons. The first study tested the potential of NB-02 to prevent AD pathophysiology in young APP/PS1 mice. Oral gavage with NB-02 prevented calcium elevations in cortical neurons of young APP/PS1 mice [39]. Subsequently, NB-02’s potential was tested as treatment in older APP/PS1 mice. To that end the effect of NB-02 on restoring neuronal calcium levels was determined. Older APP/PS1 mice exhibit extensive calcium overload within their cortical neurons. Gavage treatment with the botanical drug normalized calcium homeostasis and restored basal calcium to control levels in APP/PS1 mice [38]. Treatment with NB-02 showed prevention of calcium elevations and was able to reverse calcium overload. NB-02 holds promise as a preventative or therapeutic agent for AD.

Finally, the effect of brain rhythm manipulation was determined on Alzheimer’s progression using multiphoton imaging of YC3.6-labelled neurons. In addition to memory impairments, Alzheimer’s patients exhibit sleep disruptions, which can be recapitulated in APP/PS1 mice. Slow wave activity is prevalent during deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and is important for memory consolidation during sleep. Slow wave activity was disrupted in APP/PS1 mice. Optogenetic restoration of slow wave activity at the endogenous frequency prevented neuronal calcium overload, thus slowing disease progression in APP/PS1 mice [40]. On the other hand, optogenetic doubling of slow wave frequency increased the number of neurons with calcium overload, thus facilitating disease progression in APP/PS1 mice [41]. Therefore, calcium imaging of YC3.6-expressing neurons established a causal link between disruptions in sleep-dependent brain rhythms and Alzheimer’s progression. In other words, dysfunction of slow wave activity is not simply symptomatic of the disease but actively contributes to its progression. Furthermore, these studies highlighted the potential of sleep-dependent brain rhythm recovery to slow the disease progression, however maintaining the right pattern is of outmost importance.

In addition to amyloid-beta, changes in slow wave activity contribute to the calcium overload in neurons. By targeting slow wave activity through optogenetics, we could reduce the calcium overload and prevent AD progression.

1.6 Future Directions

Given that these studies utilizing YC3.6 were performed in mouse models of AD, it is important to see if this calcium dysfunction is translated to AD human patients. To visualize calcium signaling in the human brain, imaging techniques including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) would allow the depth and resolution needed but would need to be adapted to image calcium. The use of calcium sensors in conjunction with MRI has been investigated but is still in the beginning stages with animal models [42]. This noninvasive calcium imaging would allow insight into how calcium signaling is disrupted in AD patients.

Biomarkers of AD have recently gained much attention as early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease could lead to early intervention and better outcomes. Currently, both amyloid and tau are being explored as promising biomarkers of AD [43–46]. In addition to positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma are becoming increasingly popular as they are able to detect AD earlier [43–45]. With the disruption of calcium levels early in disease progression, and calcium dysfunction being the final common pathway in neurodegeneration, calcium has potential as an early biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease [9].

Understanding the etiology of AD and the major pathways involved is a step towards effective drug treatments. Calcium dysregulation is a common thread for the neuropathology that occurs early in AD [9]. As seen in AD mouse models, treatment with therapeutics including NB-02 and Aducanumab, calcium overload is reversible [27, 38, 39]. This opens the possibility of tarting calcium pathway and related proteins with therapeutics. Reversing the calcium overload occurring in neuronal processes will allow to potentially stop the downstream processes, thus preventing or treating Alzheimer’s disease. For these calcium-related drug targets to be identified and therapeutics to be developed, more tools and advancements will need to be made to allow calcium imaging in humans.

1.7 Conclusion

YC3.6 has been successfully utilized to understand the mechanisms underlying Alzheimer’s progression and as a functional indicator of treatment efficacy in a variety of AD mouse models. Its advent has allowed researchers to test and garner support for the Calcium hypothesis, developed decades before the technology existed to test its validity. Amyloid-beta production and deposition occurs upstream of and contributes to the calcium overload that is observed in neuronal processes. This calcium overload is the common final pathway leading to neuropathophysiology associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Calcium disruptions occur early in disease progression, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Despite the scientific knowledge that we have gained using YC3.6, there is much more to be discovered about mechanisms of calcium disruption and how it affects Alzheimer’s patients. A number of questions are outstanding. Would reversal of neuronal calcium overload rescue pathology? Would it affect circuit function? Would it have an effect on cognition and memory? To answer these questions, calcium imaging needs to be adopted to humans. Perhaps then restoration of calcium homeostasis would become a promising potential therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat AD.

Figure 1. This illustration shows YC3.6 and conformational change that occurs after binding calcium. In the absence of calcium, CaM and M13 are in an extended conformation, which results in ECFP and cpVenus being further from each other. When ECFP is excited at 440nm, emission is measured at 480nm. After CaM binds 4 calcium ions, there is a conformational change between CaM and M13, which causes ECFP and cpVenus to be in closer proximity. This proximity increases the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), so when ECFP is excited at 440nm, emission of cpVenus is measured at 535nm.

Year	Iterations of the Calcium Hypothesis		
1984	Scientific challenges and opportunities related to Alzheimer’s disease	The original proposal of the Calcium Hypothesis was the first attempt to steer researchers in a new direction, examining the role of calcium in aging and disease. With an increase in interest into the neurobiology of aging, the hypothesis was a reasonable way to connect all the age-related cellular and functional changes that had been observed. However, there was limited direct evidence to demonstrate the role of calcium in the progression of aging and disease [8]	
1989	The role of calcium regulation in brain aging: reexamination of a hypothesis	Within the years since the first proposal of the Calcium Hypothesis, more evidence was gathered that merited a revision to demonstrate the importance that calcium has shown in cellular processes. The development of technology such as patch clamp, and increased understanding of calcium biochemistry has allowed researchers to discover that calcium is important for neurotransmitter release, membrane excitability, triggering downstream cascades, among other cellular processes. With all the evidence showing the importance of calcium in maintaining homeostasis and the negative impact that aging has on calcium signaling, there is still a lack of understanding of the progression of events that causes calcium disruption and how this ultimately leads to decline in cellular functions [11].	
1994	Calcium hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease and brain aging	This revision of the Calcium Hypothesis synthesizes the research that has been conducted to demonstrate the role of calcium in aging and proposes 6 postulates that govern the Calcium Hypothesis. The hypothesis states that sustained changes in intracellular calcium are responsible for the aging and neuropathological changes in AD, and that these neuropathological changes in AD are a consequence of the same processes responsible for age-related decline in cellular functioning. The dysfunction of these processes is a result in the change of equilibrium between the processes governing regeneration and growth versus degeneration. The hypothesis also says that the disruption in calcium homeostasis is the final common pathway in leading to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. However, there are multiple variables and perturbations that could ultimately lead to the calcium disruptions. This iteration of the Calcium Hypothesis has synthesized the current work and conceptualized the process of aging and neurodegeneration. However, there remains a lack of understanding of how and what variables cause disruptions in calcium, and what the downstream effects of this are. It will be vital to understand how calcium ultimately triggers neuronal dysfunction and cell death, as well as understanding how these can be targeted for potential therapeutics [9].	
2017	Calcium Hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease and brain aging: A framework for integrating new evidence into a comprehensive theory of pathogenesis	There is much evidence presented in the most recent revision of the Calcium Hypothesis. With over 2 decades of additional research, it has become evident that multiple different upstream events lead to calcium disruption, including amyloid deposition and presenilin mutations. Calcium has been implicated in multiple cellular processes such as energy production, lysosomal degradation, and metabolic function, which makes calcium-related targets promising therapeutic targets. While there has been much progress made since the 1994 revision of the Calcium Hypothesis, there are still many limitations that prevent a comprehensive understanding of the process of aging and neurodegeneration. Calcium is sequestered in different parts of the cells, so it is unclear how these calcium stores are disrupted and how they could potential contribute to disease progression. The lack of technology to visualize calcium in vivo limits our understanding of calcium fluctuations within cells and within the neural circuits. A key to understanding the process of neurodegeneration will be connecting the disruptions occurring at the molecular level to the changes in neural circuitry to the clinical symptoms. The development of technology, as discussed in this review, is a step toward understanding how the small disruptions in calcium contribute to downstream cascades that ultimately lead to global neurodegeneration [10].

Research in Context

Systematic Review:

Authors examined literature on the calcium hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease and literature implementing multiphoton imaging using genetically-encoded calcium indicators in mouse models. Calcium imaging of Yellow Cameleon 3.6 (YC3.6) was used to evaluate the calcium hypothesis.

Interpretation:

Multiphoton imaging of YC3.6 targeted to neurons and astrocytes led to generation of data supporting the calcium hypothesis. Literature showed that amyloid beta (Aβ) led to elevations of neuronal calcium, resulting in calcium overload, as well as disruptions of astrocytic calcium transients. Tau accumulation was downstream of the calcium dysregulation. In vivo imaging using YC3.6 showed that calcium overload is reversible with therapeutics targeting Aβ.

Future Directions:

Future work should aim to develop methodologies using calcium imaging in humans and evaluate calcium as an AD biomarker. Calcium disruptions occur early in disease progression, which makes it an attractive target for biomarker development. Therapies aimed to restore calcium signaling in neuronal and non-neuronal cells hold promise for AD.
