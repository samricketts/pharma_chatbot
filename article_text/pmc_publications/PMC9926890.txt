Objective:

The association of pregnancy with later-life cognition is not well understood. We examined whether full-term and incomplete pregnancies were associated with cognition in a sample of post-menopausal women, and whether socioeconomic status (SES) factors mediated these relationships.

Methods:

1,016 cognitively normal women from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were examined. Cognitive measures included Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Animal Fluency (AF), Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) Word Learning (CERAD-WL) and CERAD Delayed Recall (CERAD-DR) tasks. Analyses examined the relationship between number of term and incomplete pregnancies with cognitive performance, as well as the mediating effects of education and income-poverty ratio (PIR).

Results:

A greater number of term pregnancies was associated with worse performance on DSST (β = −0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.12 to −0.06), AF (β = −0.03, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.00) and CERAD-DR (β = −0.04, 95% CI −0.08 to −0.01). More incomplete pregnancies were associated with better CERAD-DR performance (β = 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.13), 28% (95% CI: 0.17–0.42) of the association of term pregnancies with DSST was mediated by PIR.

Conclusions:

Higher number of term pregnancies was associated with worse cognitive performance, whereas higher number of incomplete pregnancies was associated with better cognitive performance. Results indicate the necessity to consider SES factors when studying the relationship between pregnancy and cognition.

pmcIntroduction

Women have higher rates of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) than men [1]. Almost two-thirds of Americans living with AD are women [1,2]. Reproductive events unique to women (e.g. menarche, childbearing, menopause) and their relation to later life cognition have gained increasing attention in recent literature and might contribute to sex differences in ADRD risk [3–8]. Pregnancy in particular results in a myriad of physiological changes that are known to impact brain health, including fluctuation in hormone levels, changes in neuroplasticity, immune function, and changes in cardiac output [9–12].

Most prior research on reproductive history and late-life cognition to date has taken an endocrine focused approach, hypothesizing that estradiol exposure in particular is beneficial to cognitive function [13]. This would suggest a positive relationship between pregnancy history and cognitive function, as estrogen levels rise during pregnancy. However, the relationship between pregnancy history and cognition has been inconsistent [3–5,14]. In a longitudinal study of 361 post-menopausal women, those who reported having never given birth to a live child exhibited better global cognitive functioning over 12 years than women who had given birth to a child [14]. Pregnancy related changes in progesterone, which also increases as pregnancy progresses, have not shown clinically important impacts on cognition in the same way estrogen does [15].

Similar studies suggest grand multiparity, defined as having 5 or more children, is negatively associated with cognition as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and DSM-IV criteria for dementia diagnosis [4,5,7,16]. Alternatively, Lange et al. [3] found that women with higher number of previous pregnancies showed signs of slower brain aging in striatal and limbic regions. Finally, other studies found better cognitive function or no difference in cognition when comparing women reporting term pregnancies with those reporting having never being pregnant [17–19].

Research suggests that the number of incomplete pregnancies may impact later-life cognition however the underlying mechanism of this relationship is not well understood [5,20]. Exposure to estrogen will be different for a woman who has had term pregnancies versus incomplete pregnancies. Pregnancy may also influence brain and cognitive health via changes to inflammatory responses in the body. Alterations in production of T regulatory cells (Treg), cells that play a role in regulating inflammation, vary by trimester. Treg cells peak in the first two trimesters, stay stable during the third trimester, and slightly increase postpartum [21,22]. Considering these changes at specific points during a pregnancy it’s important to understand if a pregnancy was term or incomplete when studying number of pregnancies within the context of cognitive function.

The role of socioeconomic status (SES) in the association of pregnancy with cognition is an important, yet understudied research question [23,24]. While early life education has been associated with cognitive outcomes in later life, there is also a connection between early education and adult SES, as more access to education is associated with higher paying jobs and higher income levels in later life [25]. Lower SES has been associated with younger age at first pregnancy and higher number of pregnancies. Additionally, complications during pregnancy have been linked to poor cognitive outcomes for women later in life [26–28]. Given that education level and other SES markers relate to both number of pregnancies and later life cognition, it’s possible that these variables could mediate the relationship between number of pregnancies and cognitive function among women, especially those who had a greater number of children. However, no prior study has examined the mediating role of SES variables in this relationship.

Due to inconsistencies in previous literature related to both term and incomplete pregnancies and cognition, the objective of this study was to understand the relationship between pregnancy and cognition within the context of two socioeconomic factors, education level and federal income-to-poverty ratio (PIR). To do this, we conducted a secondary data analysis of data obtained from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and examined the association of number of full-term and incomplete pregnancies with later life cognition among postmenopausal women while taking into consideration the potential mediating effects of education level and PIR on this relationship.

Materials and methods

Study Population

Data were obtained from NHANES, a population-based study that aims to understand the health and nutritional status of a nationally representative sample of adults and children living in the United States. The survey is administered by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Information is collected through participant interviews and health examination. We utilized data available from two waves collected during 2011–2014. Participants who did not provide demographic data, reproductive history, or complete neuropsychological data, and women who had 12 or more pregnancies were excluded. The final analytic sample included 1,016 women (see supplemental Figure 1).

Measures

Per the NHANES protocol, participants aged 60 years and older were eligible to complete the cognitive assessment. Three cognitive tests were administered: Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Animal Fluency (AF) and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease Word Learning task and Delayed Recall (CERAD-WL/CERAD-DR). The DSST requires participants to match symbols to numbers according to a key located at the top of the page. The participant is tasked with writing down the corresponding symbol with each digit as fast as they can in a two-minute time frame. The score is calculated as the total number of correct matches. DSST assesses sustained attention and processing speed, and is sensitive to cognitive deficits in a wide range of brain diseases and conditions [29]. In AF participants are asked to name as many animals as possible in one minute. A point is given for each animal named within the one-minute time frame. This exercise has been shown to differentiate between individuals with normal cognitive functioning, those with mild cognitive impairment, as well as more severe forms of cognitive impairment such as AD [30,31]. The CERAD consists of three consecutive learning trials, and a delayed recall. Participants were instructed to read aloud 10 unrelated words, one at a time, as they were presented on a computer monitor in large, bolded format. Immediately following the presentation of the words, participants were asked to recall as many words as possible. Approximately 8–10 minutes after the last learning trial, participants were administered the delayed recall trial in which they were again asked to recall all the words in the list as they could remember [32]. Total score for the three learning trials (CERAD-WL, possible range 0–30) and a total for the delayed recall (CERAD-DR, possible range 0–10) trial were used for our purposes. The test was developed to assess patients suspected of having progressive memory problems. The delayed recall portion in particular has been shown to effectively distinguish between individuals with dementia and their cognitively normal counterparts [33].

Reproductive History

Participants self-reported pregnancy history was obtained via a structured interview with NHNAES personnel. For the current analysis we calculated number of term pregnancies by adding the total number of reported vaginal and cesarean deliveries. We calculated the number of incomplete pregnancies by taking the difference between the questions: 1) how many times have you been pregnant? And 2) the total number of reported vaginal and cesarean births. Length of reproductive span was calculated as the difference between the self-reported ages at first and last period.

Covariates

Sociodemographic characteristics included age at screening, race (Hispanic, White, Black, Asian, Multi-Cultural), and body mass index (BMI). Smoking status was defined by whether participants reported having at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) was administered to determine the frequency of depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks. PHQ is a 9-item instrument with response categories of “not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the days” and “nearly every day,” which were given a point ranging from 0–3. Total was calculated by taking the sum of the points in each item ranging 0–27 [34]. A composite score of self-reported medical conditions was calculated as the sum total of the following diagnoses: diabetes, heart disease, thyroid disease, history of stroke, sleep disorders, and hypertension.

Federal income-to-poverty ratio (PIR) was derived per Department of Health and Human Services guidelines (the proportion of total family income to the poverty level); a smaller family PIR suggests a lower current family income level). Guidelines for PIR are issued annually and determine financial eligibility for federal programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). PIR considers current family size and geographic location, with guidelines for each individual state. Education level was recorded as follows: Less than 9th grade, 9–11th grade, High School/GED, some college, and college graduate or above.

Statistical analysis

Linear regression models were used to determine associations of term and incomplete pregnancies with measures of cognitive functioning [35]. Each cognitive measure (DSST, AF, CERAD-WL, CERAD-DR) was examined in a separate model. Term and incomplete pregnancies were tested as continuous variables. Age at screening, race, length of reproductive span, BMI, smoking status, number of medical conditions, and depressive symptoms were included as covariates (Model 1) as these variables could be impact the relationship between pregnancy and cognition and have been utilized as covariates in previous literature on the subject [4,18,19]. Preliminary tests of mediation by education level (Model 2) and PIR (Model 3) were conducted by systematically introducing these variables into the model, and then evaluating the subsequent change in effect for term and incomplete pregnancies. Finally, we added both education level and PIR together in a separate model to understand the potential mediating effect of these two variables together on pregnancy and cognitive outcomes (Model 4). All analyses were conducted using the R Statistical language (version 1.4.1106) along with the ‘gtsummary’ package [36]. Cognitive test scores were standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 prior to analysis. This allowed for comparison of results for the 4 cognitive tests despite differing raw score scales. Statistical significance was regarded as two-sided p &lt; 0.05.

Formal mediation analyses were performed according to the Imai et al. approach [37], using the R ‘mediation’ package [38]. The Imai et al approach allows for the calculation of causal mediation effects without reference to a specific statistical model and allows for an accommodation of both continuous and discrete mediators and sequential ignobility was assumed. The accommodation of both continuous and discrete mediators in this approach is important, as our education variable was a categorical variable. The model is superior to the previously mentioned preliminary tests of medication, as it allows for the calculation of indirect effects, average direct effects, total effects, and proportion mediated [37]. Regression models were fit using term pregnancies as the exposure variable and each of the four standardized cognitive test scores as the outcome variables. We adjusted for the same covariates as used in Model 1. The 95% CI for all effects were based on 1000 bootstrap samples. Statistical significance was regarded as two-sided p &lt; 0.05.

Results

Analyses were conducted on 1,016 women, mean age 67.31 (SD = 5.36) years. Demographic characteristics by term pregnancy category are displayed in Table 1. Twenty percent of the sample described themselves as Hispanic, 46% as White, 24% Black, 8.9% Asian, and 1.4% multi-cultural. Eleven percent (N=116) of participants reported never having a term pregnancy and 89% (N = 900) reported at least 1 term pregnancy. Approximately 37% of the sample reported experiencing at least one incomplete pregnancy. Significant differences between term pregnancy groups were found in the following variables: age, education level, PIR, BMI, and medical conditions. Some of the strongest differences were found in between term pregnancy groups in education level and PIR variables. For example, 41% of women that reported having no term pregnancies reported graduating college or above while only 6.4% of women with 5 or more term pregnancies reported having graduated college or above. Women who reported having no term pregnancies or 1–2 term pregnancies, reported an average PIR of 2.78–2.95 (SD = 1.69) while those women who reported having 5 or more term pregnancies reported an average PIR of 1.68 (SD=1.21). Demographic characteristics by term pregnancy category are displayed in Table 1, to increase readability, table 1 is organized by number of term pregnancies in the following groups: 0, 1–2, 3–4, and 5 or more.

Results for Term Pregnancy

For DSST, AF, and CERAD-DR, there was a significant negative association with number of term pregnancies, such that after adjustment for sociodemographic covariates (Model 1), each additional term pregnancy was associated with a 0.09 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.12 to −0.06) standard deviation (SD) decrease in DSST scores, a 0.03 (95% CI: −0.07 to 0.00) SD decrease in AF scores, and a 0.04 SD (95% CI: −0.08 to −0.01) decrease in CERAD-DR scores. However, for all three cognitive tests, the relationship was attenuated and no longer significant when education, PIR, or education and PIR were included in our models (Models 2, 3, and 4). Term pregnancies were not significantly associated with CERAD-WL scores (βs = −0.02 to 0.01) in any of our models. See Table 2 for full results of linear regression models.

Results for Incomplete Pregnancy

Having higher incomplete pregnancies was associated with a 0.07 SD (CI: 0.01 to 0.13) higher CERAD-DR performance across all models even after accounting for education and PIR (β = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.13).There was no significant association between incomplete pregnancies and DSST across all models (βs = 0.0 to 0.01). Furthermore, incomplete pregnancies were not significantly associated with AF scores across models (βs = 0.03 to 0.06) or with CERAD-WL scores across all models (β = 0.05, 95% CI: −0.01 to 0.11).

Formal Mediation Analysis

In the formal mediation analysis, the associations between term pregnancies and DSST, AF, and CERAD-DR scores were significantly mediated by PIR but not education level. We observed that 28% (95% CI: 0.17–0.42) of the association of term pregnancies with DSST was mediated by PIR. Additionally, we found that PIR mediated 34% and 26% of the associations of term pregnancies with AF (β = −0.01, 95% CI: −0.02 to −0.01) and CERAD-DR (β = −0.01, 95% CI: −0.02 to −0.01), respectively. Education did not significantly mediate the association of term pregnancies on DDST, AF, or CERAD-DL. Full results for the mediating effect of PIR and education level on the relationship between term pregnancies and cognitive tests can be found in Tables 3.

Discussion

Women who had more term pregnancies showed significantly worse cognitive performance on the DSST, AF and CERAD-DR tasks, however this association was attenuated when adjusting for PIR and education level. We found a positive relationship between incomplete pregnancies and CERAD-DR scores. In our formal mediation analysis, we found the associations of term pregnancies with DSST, AF, and CERAD-DR scores were significantly mediated by PIR but not education level.

Previous studies have reported a positive association of incomplete pregnancies. To our knowledge, only two studies have explored differences between incomplete and term pregnancies on later-life cognition, both found a positive relationship between incomplete pregnancies and cognition as measured by the MMSE and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) [5,20]. It is important to note both studies relied upon one cognitive measure (MMSE and CDR) to classify cognition. These measures provide an overall idea of cognitive status but little specificity as to which specific cognitive abilities are altered [5,20]. Given significant associations were found between incomplete pregnancies and CERAD-DR even after adjusting for education level and PIR suggests there may be a biological component to this relationship. During pregnancy, estrogen steadily increases and reaches its peak level in the third trimester [39,40]. After childbirth, at roughly 6 months post-partum, estrogen drops and eventually returns to pre-pregnancy levels [40,41]. Different exposures to estrogen levels based on whether a pregnancy was complete or incomplete could be a potential differentiation between the relationship between incomplete pregnancies and cognition. However, given that this dataset does not provide hormonal data we cannot confirm this hypothesis. Additionally, given that significant results were only found using one of the four cognitive tests in our study, further research is needed to understand the relationship between cognitive function and incomplete pregnancies.

Our results support previous research indicating SES plays an important role in cognitive performance in later life [42–44]. Early life education has been associated with cognitive outcomes in later life and more access to education is associated with higher paying jobs and higher income levels in later life [25]. Lower SES has been associated with younger age at first pregnancy and higher number of pregnancies. Finally, Women with low SES generally have children at a younger age and experience higher rates of unintended pregnancy [23,27]. Having a child at a younger age makes access to education more difficult. Previous research demonstrates a negative relationship between education level and number of children [28]. Interestingly, in our study, we found that PIR mediated the relationship of term pregnancy history and multiple domains of cognitive performance, but not education level. We suspected that education level did not significantly mediate the relationship between term pregnancy and cognition because of temporality of our education variable. We assume the highest level of education was most likely achieved before these women were pregnant.

There are several limitations of the present study. First, many of our variables (e.g., age of first period, number of pregnancies, education level) were collected by self-report and may be vulnerable to recall bias. Regarding the calculation of term pregnancies and incomplete pregnancies, these variables are imperfect measures as the NHANES protocol did not allow us to distinguish between the many unique pregnancy situations that arise such as twins, children born prematurely, abortions, spontaneous incomplete pregnancies, and recurrent incomplete pregnancies. Finally, cognitive function was only measured by a limited number of cognitive tasks; thus, we were unable to assess a comprehensive number of cognitive domains.

It should be noted that our effect sizes were in the small range and while statistically significant the differences attributable to number of pregnancies may not be clinically significant. In this situation, we would expect to see noticeable effects in cognition in participants who were at the lower ends of cognitive functioning with these small effect sizes, where a 0.3 SD might be indicative of cognitive impairment.

The present findings indicate that the number of pregnancies is associated with cognitive functioning and SES factors appear to play an important role in mediating this relationship. A low SES can impact access to education across the lifespan and is associated with higher rates of pregnancy [27,28]. While reproductive history factors like pregnancy are important to consider as potential risk or protective factors for cognitive aging and dementia, these factors should be examined in appropriate socioeconomic context.

Conclusions

Women with a greater number of term pregnancies were found to have worse processing speed and fluency performance, whereas a greater number of incomplete pregnancies was associated with better memory performance. Our results were partially mediated by the effects of PIR. These findings suggest that further research needs to take into consideration variables that account for both social and biological factors to fully understand the relationship between pregnancy and cognition in women. Future studies could also look to include the impact of parental stress and its impact on cognition across the lifespan. To date, most research on parental stress focuses on cognitive and psychological impact on children but focusing on parents own stress and its impact on later life cognition could be an important characteristic in the relationship between pregnancy and cognition in both mothers and fathers across the lifespan.
