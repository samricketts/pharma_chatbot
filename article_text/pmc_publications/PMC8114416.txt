BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:

Early detection of delirium in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) is a priority. The extent to which delirium screening leads to a potentially inappropriate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) is unknown.

DESIGN:

Nationwide retrospective cohort study from 2011 to 2013.

SETTING:

An SNF.

PARTICIPANTS:

A total of 1,175,550 Medicare enrollees who entered the SNF from a hospital and had no prior diagnosis of dementia.

EXPOSURE:

A positive screen for delirium using the validated Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), performed as part of the federally mandated Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment.

MEASUREMENTS:

Incident all-cause dementia, ascertained through International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), diagnosis in Medicare claims or active diagnoses in MDS.

RESULTS:

Positive screening for delirium was identified in 7.7% of cases (n = 90,449), and most occurred within the first 7 days of SNF admission (62.5%). The overall incidence of ADRD was 6.3% (n = 73,542). Nearly all new diagnoses of ADRD (93.5%) occurred within the first 30 days of SNF admission. Patients who screened CAM positive for delirium had a nearly threefold increased risk of receiving an incident ADRD diagnosis on the same day (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.50–4.63). Among patients who screened CAM positive for delirium, those who were cognitively intact or had mild cognitive impairments were, on average, six times more likely to receive an incident ADRD diagnosis (HR = 6.64; 95% CI = 1.76–25.0) relative to those testing CAM negative.

CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE:

Among older adults not previously diagnosed with dementia, a positive screen for delirium was significantly associated with higher risk of ADRD diagnosis after admission to a SNF. This risk was highest for patients in the first days of their stay and with the least cognitive impairment, suggesting that the ADRD diagnosis was potentially inappropriate.

INTRODUCTION

Both delirium and new-onset Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) play a role in the cognitive decline of patients who enter skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) for rehabilitation after a hospitalization.1 Delirium and ADRD are often unrecognized or mistaken for each other, although they are distinct conditions with separate methods for recognition and different modes of clinical management. Delirium is an acute change in mental status that usually presents with inattention or fluctuating consciousness. ADRD is a progressive and chronic decline in cognition. Delirium and ADRD can coexist, and emerging research reveals that delirium is a strong predictor of new-onset ADRD.2–5 Approximately 15% of patients admitted to SNFs after hospitalization have delirium, and patients with delirium are at a 12.5-fold increased risk of receiving a new diagnosis of ADRD over the subsequent 4 years.6,7

The early detection of delirium in the SNF setting facilitates efforts to address underlying causes, including medications, and develop a care plan to prevent complications and promote functional recovery. Screening for delirium also helps distinguish delirium from ADRD and is required by the Medicare program for all SNF admissions as part of the Minimum Data Set (MDS) evaluation.8,9 If delirium is detected, best practices recommend that ADRD not be diagnosed until delirium is resolved.1 Delirium can persist for months, although most episodes resolve within 30 days of onset in the SNF setting.10 Diagnosing ADRD while delirium symptoms are still present may result in misdiagnosis. Neuropsychological testing of SNF residents and neuropathic results at autopsy suggest that misdiagnosis rates of ADRD are common and range from 18% to 85%.11,12

Although delirium and ADRD are difficult to distinguish and often co-occur, they have not been examined together in an SNF population. The purpose of this study was to use Medicare data on new SNF admissions to investigate the relationship between delirium detection and a potentially premature or inappropriate diagnosis of ADRD in a nationwide population.

METHODS

Data

This study used 2011 to 2013 data from the Medicare program linked together for this analysis: (1) SNF MDS 3.0; (2) Medicare enrollment files; (3) Medicare Parts A, B, and D claims; and (4) SNF Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting (CASPER) surveys.

The SNF MDS is a federally mandated, 400-item standardized clinical assessment of every resident living in Medicare/Medicaid-certified U.S. SNFs. MDS assessments occur at admission, days 14, 30, 60, and 90, and then every 90 days or with change in health status. Data include active diagnoses, psychosocial well-being, and physical functioning. Validity and reliability have been demonstrated with MDS data.13

The Medicare data contain beneficiary enrollment information, including sex, race, age, and Medicaid eligibility. The Medicare Parts A and B claims contain information on inpatient and outpatient healthcare services and diagnoses. Medicare Part D claims contain information on prescription drugs.

CASPER is a repository of federally mandated onsite surveys of all Medicare/Medicaid-certified U.S. SNFs (and was formerly called OSCAR until 2012). The SNF surveys are conducted by state survey agencies and must occur at least every 15 months, or when complaints have been filed. Data domains include the facility operational characteristics, health inspections, and aggregate patient characteristics. Validity and reliability have been demonstrated in these data.14,15

Study Population

Our study sample included Medicare enrollees who entered an SNF facility from a hospital and stayed in the facility for at least 7 days to ensure complete data capture (n = 1,402,850). Individuals were excluded who had preexisting ADRD (n = 224,081) identified from Medicare data before SNF admission or a first positive delirium screen more than 30 days after the ADRD diagnosis (n = 3,219), including the preceding hospitalization. This study was approved by the institutional review board at Northeastern University.

Study Measures

Delirium

Delirium was assessed in two ways in this study. The first was a positive screen for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) diagnostic algorithm, which has been previously validated in the hospital setting and tested for feasibility in SNFs. The CAM algorithm requires: (1) acute onset or fluctuating symptoms AND (2) inattention with either (3) disorganized thinking OR (4) altered level of consciousness to establish delirium presence. In the academic medical center setting, the CAM has shown strong psychometric performance compared with a clinical reference standard (sensitivity = 94%; specificity = 89%; high interrater reliability).16

In the SNF setting, the CAM is conducted as part of the required MDS assessment. It is conducted by a registered nurse after completing an assessment of the patient’s mental status using the Brief Interview for Mental Status. The nurse is instructed to assess the signs and symptoms of delirium from direct observation of the patient as well as communications with family members and direct care staff and a review of the medical record. CAM assessments are made based on a 7-day look-back period and scored according to a standard method.17 Research shows SNF clinical nursing staff can accurately detect these symptoms and score the CAM.18,19 However, evidence is lacking on accuracy of CAM screening in SNFs nationwide.

The second indicator for delirium was by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), diagnoses in Medicare claims, as previously established.20 A diagnosis of delirium in claims data is an indicator of clinical recognition and documentation, although known to be underreported. We included a broad range of delirium-related codes, including those for encephalopathy, to maximize sensitivity (see Supplementary Table S7 for codes). Delirium ICD-9 diagnoses that occurred before the SNF admission are identified as a history of delirium.

Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia

We identified ADRD as indicated by one ICD-9 diagnosis in hospital claims, two diagnoses in outpatient claims, or an active diagnosis in MDS, as previously established.21–24 Prevalent ADRD occurs before the SNF admission; incident ADRD occurs after SNF admission. We also included use of a cholinesterase inhibitor before SNF stay as a secondary marker for prevalent ADRD (see Supplementary Table S8 for breakdown of sources).

SNF Characteristics

Facility bed size, chain ownership, and for-profit status, each variable associated with SNF quality, were extracted from CASPER.14

Covariates

Age, sex, race, Medicaid, and health status, including active diagnosis flags and functional limitations (activities of daily living), came from the Medicare summary files and the first MDS admission assessment. Cognition was measured using the Cognitive Function Scale, an integrated measure of self-report and staff report with demonstrated validity.25

All multivariate analyses were risk adjusted using the 2012 Prescription Drug Diagnostic Cost Groups/Hierarchical Condition Category (Rx DCG/HCC) model. The risk adjustment is a validated measure for controlling for confounding based on prescription drug use.26

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were calculated for the occurrence of positive delirium screens, newly diagnosed ADRD, and a delirium diagnosis in Medicare data during the SNF stay. We also assessed time from a positive delirium screen to ADRD or delirium diagnosis for up to 365 days in the SNF.

We conducted Cox proportional hazard models and logistic regression models with generalized estimation equations to account for the nested structure of residents clustered within SNFs. Analyses were stratified by baseline cognitive level and time in the SNF. Our main outcomes were the likelihood of receiving an incident ADRD diagnosis or delirium diagnosis by status of and timing of delirium screenings adjusted for both facility and resident characteristics.

All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).

RESULTS

At baseline, 1,175,550 individuals were included in the analysis. Table 1 provides characteristics by delirium screening status. Positive screening for delirium was identified in 7.7% of SNF admissions (n = 90,449). Most positive delirium screenings occurred within the first 7 days of the SNF stay (62.5%); 86.2% occurred within the first 30 days (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S1). The risk of a positive delirium screen was most strongly associated with baseline cognitive impairment: mild impairment (odds ratio (OR) = 4.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.61–5.00); moderate impairment (OR = 12.97; 95% CI = 12.45–13.50); and severe impairment (OR = 12.92; 95% CI = 12.28–13.60) (Supplementary Table S2).

The overall incidence of a new diagnosis of ADRD was 6.3% (n = 73,542), with nearly all (93.5%) occurring within the first 30 days of SNF admission (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Figure S2).

A new diagnosis of ADRD greatly increased with a positive CAM delirium screen (16.3% CAM positive vs 5.5% CAM negative), especially during the early days of the SNF stay (Table 2). At SNF admission, patients who screened CAM positive for delirium had nearly a threefold increased risk for receiving an incident ADRD diagnosis on the same day (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.63; 95% CI = 1.50–4.63) (Table 2). This elevated risk persisted through the first week and the first 30 days of the SNF stay: first 7 days (HR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.52–1.62) and first 30 days (HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.52–1.60), even after adjustment for baseline cognitive impairment (Supplementary Table S4A–S4C).

When the risk of an incident ADRD diagnosis was stratified by level of cognitive function at SNF admission, the association with a positive CAM delirium screen increased most among patients with mild or moderate cognitive impairments (Figure 1). Among patients who screened CAM positive for delirium on SNF admission, those who had mild or moderate cognitive impairments were, on average, three to four times more likely to receive an incident ADRD diagnosis (HR = 4.25; 95% CI = 1.14–15.9; and HR = 3.22; 95% CI = 1.36–7.59, respectively) relative to those testing negative for delirium. This association is greater than among patients with moderate cognitive impairment (HR = 3.22; 95% CI = 1.36–7.59) or those with severe cognitive impairment (HR = 2.05; 95% CI = 0.85–4.93). The increased risk of being diagnosed with ADRD associated with a positive CAM delirium screen could be detected across all cognitive levels, but it was highest for patients with intact cognition or mild cognitive impairment, and this elevated risk persisted for the first 30 days of SNF stay (Supplementary Table S6A–S6C).

In fact, patients with a positive CAM delirium screen were more likely to receive a new ADRD diagnosis than a delirium diagnosis in this Medicare data. Only 2.6% of our study population received a delirium diagnosis within first 30 days in the SNF stay. Patients who tested CAM positive for delirium on admission were no more likely to receive a delirium diagnosis than those who tested negative (HR = 1.40; 95% CI = 0.88–2.23) (Table 3). After the first 7 days, the association between a positive CAM delirium screen and a positive delirium diagnosis became significant (HR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.26–1.38), although the association remained consistently weaker than for incident ADRD diagnosis (Supplementary Table S5A–S5C).

DISCUSSION

Using a linked Medicare claims, MDS, and CASPER data set containing over 1 million SNF admissions, we found that a positive CAM screen for delirium is independently associated with an incident all-cause dementia diagnosis in the SNF setting. The risk of incident ADRD following a positive delirium screen is highest for patients in the first days of SNF stay and with less severe cognitive impairment. Patients screening positive for delirium are at higher risk for receiving a new diagnosis of dementia than a new diagnosis of delirium.

To our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the relationship between the mandatory screening for delirium in SNF and a new diagnosis of ADRD. The strong relationship between delirium and ADRD is well known, but this study is the first to assess the role of clinical recognition of delirium symptoms and the subsequent diagnosis of both ADRD and delirium. The pattern observed here suggests that delirium symptoms, as identified through the MDS-mandated CAM assessment, are often leading to a new diagnosis of dementia rather than a diagnosis of delirium. This is inconsistent with the guidance of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which states dementia should not be diagnosed in the face of active delirium.27 Because delirium symptoms can persist for weeks to months in some patients, our finding that ADRD diagnoses frequently occur on the same day as the positive screening for delirium, and most often within 7 days, suggests that clinical decision-making is at best premature and at worst incorrect. The appropriate identification and differentiation of delirium and ADRD is critically important because the clinical management of these conditions is distinct. Given that delirium is an acute condition that is usually reversible, it is critical to treat any underlying conditions that may be causing the delirium, restore function, prevent complications, and be certain older adults are free of delirium before prematurely labeling them with a dementia diagnosis.

The finding that the risk of a new diagnosis of ADRD is highest among individuals with CAM positive versus CAM negative screenings may seem counterintuitive. However, it is important to recall that without significant cognitive impairments the only remaining reason persons are receiving the ADRD diagnosis is due to the presence of delirium. This interpretation is consistent with our results.

Of course, these findings should be considered in the context that some individuals may have had undiagnosed dementia before being admitted to the hospital and developing delirium. Also, it is possible that users of the MDS CAM could be identifying some impairment of cognition that is overlapping with dementia. Delirium superimposed on dementia is common and may present unique challenges for screening tools, such as the MDS CAM. However, if delirium superimposed on dementia is suspected, then that should be the diagnosis rather than dementia alone because this syndrome is associated with poor outcomes if not recognized and treated appropriately.28

LIMITATIONS

This study was designed to reduce threats to validity but nonetheless has several limitations. First, because we lack complete clinical information about patients in the study (e.g., laboratory values, physician notes), we cannot determine the appropriateness of the diagnoses. Our method to exclude individuals with prevalent dementia likely identified only about 90% of cases.29 Second, MDS and claims-based measures may underreport outcomes (diseases, limited functioning). However, our main measure of a positive delirium screen is based on a validated instrument applied to all patients. However, lower rates of sensitivity, specificity, and reliability have been documented when the CAM is administered by clinical nurses without formal training.18 Third, our data span the period 2011 to 2013, so may be outdated. However, we have no indication that the general practice patterns in SNFs of screening for delirium and diagnosing ADRD have changed more recently. We cannot exclude the possibility that delirium detection and diagnosis in SNFs have improved in more recent years since the CAM was introduced in 2010; our data may have captured a “learning curve” period. Last, our findings should be replicated to ensure they are valid and reliable.

CONCLUSION

Among older adults without evidence of dementia, a positive CAM screen for delirium at SNF admission was significantly associated with risk of a new ADRD diagnosis, which was higher than the risk of a new delirium diagnosis. This risk of receiving an ADRD diagnosis was highest immediately after a positive CAM delirium screen, and among patients with the least cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest the potential for premature or inappropriate diagnosis of ADRD among older adults admitted to SNFs with delirium.
