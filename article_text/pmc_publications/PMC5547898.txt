SUMMARY

Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. We sought to understand whether mGluR5’s role in AD requires glutamate signaling. We used a potent mGluR5 silent allosteric modulator (SAM, BMS-984923) to separate its well-known physiological role in glutamate signaling from a pathological role in mediating amyloid-β oligomer (Aβo) action. Binding of the SAM to mGluR5 does not change glutamate signaling but strongly reduces mGluR5 interaction with cellular prion protein (PrPC) bound to Aβo. The SAM compound prevents Aβo-induced signal transduction in brain slices and in an AD transgenic mouse model, the APPswe/PS1 ΔE9 strain. Critically, 4 weeks of SAM treatment rescues memory deficits and synaptic depletion in the APPswe/PS1ΔE9 transgenic mouse brain. Our data show that mGluR5’s role in Aβo-dependent AD phenotypes is separate from its role in glutamate signaling, and silent allosteric modulation of mGluR5 has promise as a disease-modifying AD intervention with a broad therapeutic window.

In Brief

Haas et al. investigate the role of mGluR5 in Alzheimer’s disease. They describe a compound that blocks the action of amyloid β through this receptor but preserves glutamate signaling. This amyloid-selective blocker rescues transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease and, by sparing glutamate signaling, avoids the side effects of typical mGluR5 antagonists.


INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting over five million people in the United States alone, with no preventive or disease-modifying treatment available. The amyloid hypothesis of AD is based on the early and progressive accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide as well as the genetic effects of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin (PSen) 1/2 mutations, both suggesting that Aβ peptide species are the initial triggers of the disease (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). Oligomers of Aβ (Aβos) have been implicated in triggering synaptic dysfunction, dendritic spine loss, inflammatory mediator recruitment, and memory dysfunction, all of which are key characteristics of the disease (Berman et al., 2008; Cleary et al., 2005; Hong et al., 2016; Lacor et al., 2007; Lambert et al., 1998; Laurén et al., 2009; Lesné et al., 2006; Li et al., 2009; Palop and Mucke, 2010; Shankar et al., 2008; Walsh et al., 2002). Cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a high-affinity binding receptor for Aβo, and pathological signals can be transmitted via metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) onto intracellular signaling molecules (Beraldo et al., 2016; Gimbel et al., 2010; Haas et al., 2016; Haas and Strittmatter, 2016; Hu et al., 2014; Kaufman et al., 2015; Larson et al., 2012; Laurén et al., 2009; Um et al., 2012, 2013). Aβos have been demonstrated to enhance the interaction of PrPC with mGluR5, which is critically involved in AD disease pathogenesis (Haas et al., 2014, 2016).

Separately from PrPC coupling, other studies of AD models have implicated mGluR5 and altered glutamate signaling (Hamilton et al., 2014, 2016; Hu et al., 2014; Overk et al., 2014; Renner et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2015). Glutamate activation of this metabotropic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) leads to multiple signal transduction pathways, including phospholipase C, inositol triphosphate, and intracellular calcium release, as well as Homer, Arc, eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), and fragile X mental retardation protein (FRMP) regulation of protein translation at synapses, plus calcium/calmodulin-activated protein kinase II and Fyn kinase activation (Bhakar et al., 2012; Heidinger et al., 2002; Lüscher and Huber, 2010; Nicodemo et al., 2010; Um et al., 2013). The regulation of mGluR5 and synaptic plasticity by therapeutic molecules has been described extensively because mGluR5 is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative and psychiatric CNS disorders (Bruno et al., 2001; Gasparini and Spooren, 2007; Gregory et al., 2011, 2012; Molck et al., 2014; Ribeiro et al., 2010; Sheffler et al., 2011).

Both genetic loss and pharmacological inhibition studies have demonstrated that reduced mGluR5 activity alleviates synaptic and memory deficits in various AD-related models (Beraldo et al., 2016; Hamilton et al., 2014, 2016; Hu et al., 2014; Overk et al., 2014; Raka et al., 2015; Renner et al., 2010; Um et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2015). However, none of these interventions have separated the mechanistic benefit as being due to inhibition of glutamate signaling versus Aβo/PrPC signaling versus a combination of both. For example, pharmacological inhibition studies have utilized the negative allosteric modulators 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), 3-((2-Methyl-4-thiazolyl)ethynyl)pyridine (MTEP), and 2-chloro-4-((2,5-dimethyl-1-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethynyl)pyridine (CTEP), all of which reduce physiological glutamate signaling through mGluR5 as well as pathological AD signaling. Genetic deletion of grm5 obviously eliminates all modes of mGluR5 signaling. Trans-heterozygous crosses with prnp demonstrate a role for mGluR5 interaction with Aβo/PrPC but do not exclude glutamate signaling (Haas et al., 2016). Because the amino acid residues required for mGluR5 interaction with Aβo/PrPC cover several domains, there are no known point mutations that eliminate one mode of signaling versus another (Haas et al., 2014; Um et al., 2013). It should be noted that blockade of glutamate signaling genetically or by pharmacological inhibitors impairs mouse learning and memory and disrupts behavior independent of AD (Abou Farha et al., 2014; Campbell et al., 2004; Lu et al., 1997; Porter et al., 2005; Rodriguez et al., 2010; Um et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2009). At specific doses, there is a window for functional benefit in several preclinical conditions (Hamilton et al., 2016; Michalon et al., 2012; Um et al., 2013). Clinically, mavoglurant impairs cognitive performance at 200 mg even though receptor occupancy reaches only 55% at 100 mg and 85% with 400 mg (Rutrick et al., 2017). For this reason, separating the need to block glutamate signaling at mGluR5 from beneficial effects of blocking Aβo/PrPC/mGluR5 signaling is critical to enhance the therapeutic index of this target.

Here we focus on mGluR5 ligands that distinguish between glutamate and Aβo/PrPC/mGluR5 signaling. Allosteric modulators of mGluR5 are subdivided into positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), and silent allosteric modulators (SAMs). PAMs and NAMs affect glutamate-induced G protein-mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and/or shift the efficacy of glutamate for activation. In contrast, SAMs do not alter basal or glutamate-induced Ca2+ signaling (Gregory et al., 2010, 2011, 2012). Our previous studies identified a low-potency SAM compound, 3,3′-Dichlorobenzaldazine (DCB), as blocking Aβo-induced interaction of PrPC with mGluR5 (Haas et al., 2014), but the pharmacological properties of this compound prevent utility for in vivo experiments. We now report that the SAM BMS-984923, compound 16 of Huang et al. (2016), potently inhibits the PrPC-mGluR5 interaction and prevents pathological Aβo signaling without affecting physiological glutamate signaling. We tested the therapeutic efficacy of BMS-984923, here referred to as SAM, to reverse AD-related deficits in vitro and in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic model mice in vivo. We show that the SAM prevents Aβo-induced inhibition of synaptic plasticity as well as Aβo-dependent signaling in acute brain slices. The SAM further rescues behavioral and synaptic abnormalities in AD transgenic model mice and alleviates Tau pathology without altering amyloid plaque load or gliosis. Here, we show that inhibition of glutamate signaling at mGluR5 is not essential for the benefits of blocking Aβo/PrPC signaling at mGluR5 for in vivo AD models, thereby expanding the therapeutic window for mGluR5 as a disease-modifying therapeutic target in AD.

RESULTS

A High-Potency SAM for mGluR5

The present study utilizes a high-potency mGluR5 SAM to distinguish blockade of glutamate/mGluR5 function from inhibition of AD-specific Aβo/PrPC signaling through the mGluR5 complex. BMS-984923 was identified in a development program initiated to identify mGluR5 PAMs for schizophrenia (Huang et al., 2016). The compound is a high-affinity SAM with competitive antagonism of MPEPy binding at a Ki of 0.6 nM but has no detectable agonist and antagonist activity at mGluR5 signaling (Figure S1A; Huang et al., 2016). We confirmed that the SAM does not affect glutamate/DHPG ((S)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine)-induced Ca2+ signaling in mGluR5-overexpressing HEK293T cells and extended these observations to days in vitro (DIV) 21 cortical neurons (Figures 1A and 1B). In contrast, a NAM, MTEP, strongly suppresses glutamate/DHPG-induced Ca2+ responses. Co-application of SAM and MTEP prevents MTEP-induced inhibition of glutamate/DHPG-induced Ca2+ responses (Figures 1A and 1B). This confirms that the SAM behaves as a silent allosteric modulator of mGluR5, consistent with competition at the MTEP site.

We considered whether the SAM is well tolerated by mice, without the side effects of mGluR5 deletion or NAM-based inhibition. First we conducted pharmacokinetic studies to determine the appropriate dose. The SAM BMS-984923 has good oral bioavailability and an apparently linear dose response (Figure S1B). At an oral dose of either 7.5 or 15 mg/kg, the plasma concentration exceeded 2 μM at 10 hr. Brain concentrations were nearly as high as plasma concentrations when measured 3 hr after a 7.5 mg/kg oral dose (Figure S1C). Compounds chemically related to the SAM but with PAM activity induce seizures (Yang et al., 2016). To demonstrate that the SAM compound at the 7.5 mg/kg dose occupies mGluR5, we assessed the degree to which SAM pretreatment prevented PAM-induced seizures (Figures 1C and 1D). During the 90 min following PAM administration, 50% of vehicle-pretreated mice exhibited seizures, whereas none of the SAM-pretreated mice did so. Thus, the SAM effectively occupies brain mGluR5 sites to prevent PAM action. Based on the BMS-984923 pharmacokinetics, brain penetration, and potency for mGluR5, we chose the BMS-984923 dose of 3.75 mg/kg by oral gavage twice a day as the dose to ensure nearly complete continuous receptor occupancy by BMS-984923 in subsequent pharmacology experiments.

It is known that higher doses of allosteric mGluR5 modulators like MTEP negatively affect electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude in mice (Um et al., 2013). At 15 mg/kg/d twice a day (B.I.D.), MTEP is tolerated in mice and has been applied successfully to recover AD-like phenotypes in transgenic mice (Um et al., 2013). However, we show that a 5-fold increased dose of MTEP (75 mg/kg) strongly impairs EEG amplitude in mice (Figures 1E and 1F), demonstrating MTEP’s narrow therapeutic window. In contrast, neither a 1 × dose (3.75 mg/kg) nor a 10 × dose (37.5 mg/kg) of the SAM impairs EEG amplitude in mice (Figures 1E and 1F). Thus, doses of SAM well above the effective dose appear to be well tolerated with regard to CNS function in mice.

Protection from Aβo Action by the SAM

Although it is clear that the SAM does not alter mGluR5 activation with or without glutamate, a key issue is whether it interrupts AD-related Aβo signaling via PrPC through mGluR5. As one measure of this coupling, Aβo has been shown to enhance the association between PrPC with mGluR5 detected by immunoprecipitation from transfected HEK293T cells (Haas et al., 2014). The SAM dose-dependently inhibits the interaction of PrPC with mGluR5 detected by reciprocal precipitations without Aβo, but 1 μM concentration is required under basal conditions (Figures 2A–2C). In the presence of Aβo, mGluR5 interaction with PrPC is increased more than 2-fold (Figures 2D–2H). For this Aβo-driven protein interaction, the SAM eliminates association at a 100-fold lower concentration with an inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) of 10 nM, consistent with the concentrations required for SAM displacement of MPEPy from mGluR5 (Figures 2D–2H). Thus, in this nonneuronal assay, the SAM appears to have properties that allow selective blockade of Aβo action even though there is no effect on basal or glutamate signaling.

To determine whether inhibition of Aβo-induced enhanced binding of PrPC to mGluR5 has functional consequences and extends to neurons, we analyzed the effect of the SAM on mouse hippocampal slice synaptic plasticity with or without addition of Aβo in the CA3 to CA1 Shaffer collateral pathway (Figure 3A). Aβos are known to impair synaptic function by inhibiting long-term potentiation (LTP) acutely (Shankar et al., 2008; Walsh et al., 2002; Figures 3B and 3D). The presence of 100 nM SAM does alter basal field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) amplitude or theta burst-induced LTP in the absence of Aβo (Figures 3A, 3C, and 3D). Critically, preincubation of brain slices with SAM prevents Aβo-induced inhibition of LTP (Figures 3A, 3C, and 3D). Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between SAM and Aβo treatment (p = 0.033). Thus, SAM-induced conformational changes in the PrPC-mGluR5 complex prevent Aβo-induced impairment of synaptic plasticity in brain slices.

SAM Treatment of AD Model Mice Rescues Established Memory Deficits

These positive in vitro outcomes with the SAM after acute Aβo treatment led us to examine whether the SAM might recover AD phenotypes in transgenic mice even though it has no effect on glutamate or basal signal transduction. To investigate whether the SAM could ameliorate behavioral deficits of aged APP/PS1 transgenic mice (Jankowsky et al., 2003, 2004), we assessed their behavior in multiple behavioral paradigms after 4 weeks of treatment with the SAM or vehicle. Because this mouse strain develops behavioral deficits starting at 6 months of age, when Aβo levels rise (Gimbel et al., 2010; Kostylev et al., 2015; Park et al., 2006), their deficits were well-established when SAM treatment started at an average age of 14 months (Figure S2). First, mice were subjected to novel object recognition testing (Figure 4A). Wild-type mice express a clear preference for a novel over a familiar object, which is not affected by SAM treatment (Figure 4A). Vehicle-treated transgenic mice lack a preference for either object, revealing a deficit in this memory behavioral paradigm. Importantly, SAM-treated transgenic mice show a significant preference for the novel object. Thus, the SAM significantly recovers the memory in transgenic mice back to wild-type behavior (Figure 4A).

We used the Morris water maze spatial navigation task as a second behavioral assessment for mouse memory. Here, mice were trained to navigate within spatial cues to find a hidden platform submerged in a pool. During the entire behavioral task, the location of the platform remained constant, whereas the starting position of the mice was varied between trials. A total of 24 training trials were completed in 3 consecutive days, and mice were analyzed in a probe trial test on day 4. During the last eight trials, the vehicle-treated APP/PS1 group differs significantly from all other groups by one-way repeated-measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparisons test, whereas all other comparisons are not significantly different (Figure 4B). A two-way RM-ANOVA over the last eight trials further shows a significant effect of genotype and treatment and of their interaction (Figure 4B). The apparent improvement in learning by the transgenic mice after SAM treatment cannot be attributed to changes in swimming or overall activity because the distance traveled to the platform during the last block of trials showed the same rescue of transgenic mouse performance by the SAM (Figure 4C) and no differences in swim speeds (Figure 4D). During the probe trial test 24 hr after completion of the training, the platform was removed from the pool. The time mice spent in the target quadrant, the quadrant of the pool where the platform was originally located, was recorded to analyze spatial memory. Here, the vehicle-treated APP/PS1 group showed a significant deficit compared with the wild-type (Figure 4E). Importantly, SAM-treated APP/PS1 mice have a significant improvement compared with vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice. A two-way ANOVA further reveals a significant effect of genotype, of treatment, and of their interaction (Figure 4E). Thus, SAM treatment rescues behavioral deficits of transgenic mice in the Morris water maze spatial navigation task.

Passive avoidance testing was used as a third behavioral assessment for mouse memory. Here, mice were habituated to a light compartment. A guillotine door connected the light to a dark compartment, which enabled mice to enter the dark compartment upon opening of the door. When located in the dark compartment, mice received a 2-s shock (0.5 mA) as an aversive stimulus. We assessed the learning of mice to associate the dark compartment with an aversive stimulus in a retention test 5 min after learning. Transgenic mice demonstrate clear deficits in passive avoidance testing, as can be observed by a reduced latency to enter the dark compartment in the retention test (Figure 4F). Importantly, SAM treatment significantly recovers memory deficits of transgenic mice to wild-type levels in passive avoidance testing (Figure 4F). Notably, SAM treatment does not affect wild-type behavior in any behavioral assessment (Figures 4A–4F).

Plaque and Gliosis Are Not Altered by the SAM

To investigate the underlying cause of behavioral recovery, we analyzed the brains of treated mice immunohistologically. Amyloid plaques are an essential characteristic of the AD brain, which is reproduced in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Previously we demonstrated that genetic deletion of mGluR5 had no significant effect on Aβ plaque deposition or TBS-soluble Aβ or TBS-soluble, PrP-interacting Aβ oligomers (Figure S9 in Haas et al., 2016). Thus, SAM treatment is not predicted to alter Aβ levels or accumulation. Here, we compared the amyloid plaque load between vehicle-treated and SAM-treated transgenic mice. Although the amyloid plaque load of transgenic mice is obvious relative to wild-type mice, no significant changes are observable between both transgenic groups (Figures 5A and 5B). Gliosis is a second important feature of neurodegenerative diseases, which also occurs in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We analyzed activation of astrocytes by GFAP-staining and activation of microglia by Iba1 staining. The APP/PS1 transgenic brain demonstrates pronounced activation of astrocytes and microglia compared with the wild-type brain (Figures 5C–5F). However, we found astro- and microgliosis to be unaltered by SAM treatment (Figures 5C–5F). Thus, neither changes in Aβ plaque load nor alterations in gliosis are able to explain behavioral rescue effects upon SAM treatment. This is consistent with SAM blocking downstream action of mGluR5-mediated events at neuronal synapses and not altering upstream Aβ accumulation or glial reaction to its accumulation.

SAM Treatment Reverses Synapse Loss in AD Mice

Next we analyzed the density of synaptic markers by immunostaining because synaptic depletion is a characteristic of AD tightly linked to memory deficits (Scheff et al., 1990) and expected to be downstream of Aβ/PrPC/mGluR5 signaling. As expected, we observed a significant loss of the presynaptic marker SV2a as well as the postsynaptic marker PSD95 in the transgenic brain compared with the wild-type (Figure 6). Importantly, SAM treatment significantly recovers synaptic marker levels to wild-type levels (Figure 6B). Thus, restoration of synapse density is a plausible explanation for memory recovery by SAM therapy, via interruption of Aβo signaling without changes in glutamate/mGluR5 coupling.

To understand the underlying basis of synaptic recovery, we monitored the activation of mGluR5-linked signaling molecules that might be involved in synaptic plasticity as well as synaptic survival. Treatment of acute brain slices with Aβo induces activation of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2, PTK2B) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (Figures 7A–7C). Interestingly, our data demonstrate that pretreatment of brain slices with the SAM prevents Aβo-induced activation of Pyk2 and CaMKII in brain slices (Figures 7A–7C). We further analyzed signaling molecules in the mouse brain. We found that Pyk2 as well as eEF2 are aberrantly activated in the transgenic AD model brain (Figures 7D–7F). SAM therapy does not affect signaling molecules in the wild-type brain but significantly relieves signaling abnormalities in APP/PS1 transgenic mice treated with SAM (Figures 7D–7F). Thus, normalization of Aβo/PrPC/mGluR5 signal transduction abnormalities in SAM-treated transgenic mice is likely to underlie synaptic and behavioral recovery.

The SAM Rescues Tau Pathology in Triple-Transgenic Mice

Pathological tau is a further characteristic of AD (reviewed in Ballatore et al., 2007), but it is not modeled in the APP/PS1 transgenic model. Therefore, we studied triple-transgenic (3×Tg) mice expressing human mutant Tau as well as mutant APP and PS1 (Oddo et al., 2003), in which pathology driven by the Tau transgene is enhanced by the APP/PS1 transgene pathology. We treated 3×Tg mice with 7.5 mg/kg/day of SAM over 4 weeks to investigate the effect of SAM on tau pathology. Phospho(S199/S202)-Tau is significantly enhanced in 3×Tg brain compared with wild-type brain in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA)-soluble fractions and recovered to wild-type levels in 3×Tg mice treated with SAM (Figure S3). Notably, Tau insolubility increases with disease progression. We observed an increase of total Tau in formic acid-extracted, RIPA-insoluble brain fractions in 3×Tg mice that is reduced to wild-type levels by SAM therapy (Figure S3). We further analyzed pathological Tau by immunostaining of 3×Tg brain treated withvehicle or SAM compared with wild-type brain. There is enhanced pathological phospho(S199/S202)-Tau immunostaining in the hippocampal CA1 area as well as in the frontal cortex of 3×Tg mice, both of which are largely reduced by SAM (Figure S4). Thus, SAM-induced conformational changes of the PrPC-mGluR5 complex are beneficial for Tau pathology.

DISCUSSION

The PrPC-mGluR5 complex is critically involved in AD (Beraldo et al., 2016; Haas et al., 2016; Hamilton et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2014; Overk et al., 2014; Um et al., 2013). Our previous work utilized a NAM of mGluR5 to recover AD phenotypes in mice (Um et al., 2013). However, that initial study was unable to distinguish between a role of mGluR5 that is dependent on glutamate-induced calcium signaling and other mechanisms involving Aβo/PrPC pathophysiology. Here, we use a SAM to separate two distinct molecular roles of mGluR5: its physiological role in glutamate signaling and a patho-physiological role in response to Aβo/PrPC in AD. PrPC forms a physiological complex with mGluR5 and intracellular signaling molecules in the brain that is altered by Aβo as well as AD pathogenesis (Haas et al., 2016; Haas and Strittmatter, 2016). Thus, targeting the Aβo-regulated interaction between PrPC and mGluR5 has the potential to selectively prevent neurotoxic signals from propagating from extra cellular Aβo onto intracellular targets.

Silent allosteric modulation has generated promising new approaches for CNS therapeutics that allow prevention of selective signaling without affecting G protein-mediated Ca2+ signaling (Lüscher and Huber, 2010; Xu et al., 2009). Aβo/PrPC-induced signaling via mGluR5 regulates multiple pathways (Haas et al., 2014, 2016; Haas and Strittmatter, 2016; Heiss et al., 2016; Kaufman et al., 2015; Um et al., 2012, 2013). Here, we show that Aβo-induced receptor interactions can be targeted specifically by silent allosteric modulation of mGluR5 without affecting physiological glutamate signaling and without EEG amplitude suppression, even at doses 10-fold higher than efficacious levels. We hypothesize that the SAMstabilizes the structure of mGluR5 in a conformation that renders the receptor non-responsive to conformational changes induced by Aβo binding to PrPC while maintaining glutamate-induced activation. Thus, SAM potently and selectively blocks Aβo/PrPC-induced signaling via mGluR5.

We further explored the potential of targeting mGluR5 with the SAM as a disease-modifying AD therapeutic. We report preclinical success of the SAM to reverse AD-related phenotypes in vitro and in transgenic model mice in vivo. Mouse models of AD are imperfect models of AD, and the APP/PS1 model relies on forced over expression of both mutant human mutant APP and PS1 (Jankowsky et al., 2003, 2004). However, mice of this strain develop normally and subsequently accumulate Aβ plaque and Aβo from 6–12 months, in parallel with the onset of learning and memory deficits (Kostylev et al., 2015; Park et al., 2006). As noted above, the SAM does not interfere with glutamate-induced Ca2+ responses in vitro or EEG patterns in mice in vivo. Thus, selectively targeting the PrPC-mGluR5 interaction with SAM recovers Aβo-dependent aberrant intracellular signaling, synaptic plasticity, pathological Tau, synapse loss, and learning and memory deficits in AD transgenic mice. We speculate that SAM-stabilized conformations of mGluR5 prevent the transmission of Aβo signals to intracellular signaling molecules. This uncoupling mechanism is sufficient to stabilize transient spines suffering from Aβo exposure and allows the formation of new synapses. Synaptic recovery restores brain anatomy over 4 weeks and permits learning and memory improvements. Previously, we studied dendritic spine turnover in APP/PS1 mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice as a function of age and Prnp genotype (Heiss et al., 2016). The APP/PS1 transgene accelerates spine loss but does not impede the formation of new spines. Because the dendritic spine turnover rate is high in the AD model, if damage is prevented as with SAM treatment, then new synapses can be replaced over a period of several weeks at a potential rate of 10%–20% of total spine density per week. We suggest that the synapse-restoring effect of SAM does not occur instantaneously but relies on a gradual natural replenishment process over 2–4 weeks.

In the APP/PS1 model, we initiated SAM treatment long after the development of Aβ plaque, gliosis, synapse loss, and memory impairment. The month-long SAM treatment restores synapses and memory-function even though plaques and gliosis persist. Extrapolation of these data to clinical AD is not straightforward because neuronal cell loss and tauopathy do not occur in the mouse model. However, the findings suggest that SAM intervention could be effective after Aβ plaque accumulation. During the early phases of mild cognitive impairment because of AD, when Aβ accumulation is already present, the SAM may reverse some or all symptoms and prevent progression to AD. In more advanced states, when both synapse loss and neuronal cell death occur, SAM therapy may either slow or halt disease progression but seems highly unlikely to reverse existing symptoms dependent on neuronal cell loss. Any benefits of the SAM are not expected to require a decrease in Aβ accumulation. However, if successful Aβ-lowering therapy were developed, then it would be predicted to act synergistically with the SAM in disease modification.

Importantly, a second characteristic of AD in humans is the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the form of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (reviewed in Ballatore et al., 2007). To investigate whether the SAM could modify pathological tau, we treated a cohort of 3×Tg mice with 7.5 mg/kg/day SAM. 3×Tg mice express the human tau (P301L) transgene in addition to the APPswe transgene and a PS1 transgene with the familial Alzheimer’s disease (fAD) M146V mutation (Oddo et al., 2003). In this line, Tau is thought to accumulate both because of the Tau mutation and acceleration by Aβ pathology. Our data revealed that the SAM lowered phospho(S199/S202)-Tau in RIPA-soluble 3×Tg brain fractions compared with vehicle-treated 3×Tg brain. We further found that RIPA-insoluble Tau was reduced in 3×Tg mice after treatment. Notably, the solubility of Tau is an important aspect of Tau pathology and indicates deposition of Tau. From this line, we cannot distinguish whether the effects are solely due to interruption of Aβ-induced acceleration or whether there might be some Aβ-independent effect of SAM on Tau pathology. Overall, the effect is similar to that observed for Fyn kinase activation (Kaufman et al., 2015). Nonetheless, the SAM was able to reduce insoluble Tau after mutant transgene-induced Tau pathology in this mouse strain occurred.

Reversal of signaling, synaptic, Tau, and behavioral phenotypes in transgenic mice occurred without recoveries in amyloid plaque load or gliosis. Thus, our data reveal that treatment of transgenic mice with the SAM permits brain repair after mutant APP/PS1 transgene-triggered damage in this mouse strain occurred. We hypothesize that targeting the PrPC-mGluR5 interaction enables the uncoupling of extra cellular Aβo from the cellular machinery required for Aβo toxicity. Notably, work by others suggested that Aβo-induced synaptic deficits occur because of clustering and over stabilization of mGluR5 receptors within the membrane (Renner et al., 2010). Further studies are necessary to determine whether the SAM also prevents the clustering of mGluR5 within synaptic structures.

SAM therapy is predicted to be a most specific mGluR5 approach for AD compared with NAM or PAM administration because it is selective for Aβo over Glu and appears to have a broad therapeutic window for benefit. It should be noted that NAMs can have benefits within a specific tolerated dose window (Hamilton et al., 2016; Michalon et al., 2012; Um et al., 2013). In addition, PAMs may have pro-cognitive effects originally targeted for schizophrenia (Foster and Conn, 2017; Parmentier-Batteur et al., 2014) but be of potential benefit in AD with a mechanism to both enhance Glu signaling and occlude Aβo/PrPC signaling. Signaling pathway-biased mGluR5 PAMs may have better tolerability (Foster and Conn, 2017; Rook et al., 2015).

In conclusion, the SAM is a silent allosteric mGluR5 modulator that potently inhibits the interaction of PrPC with mGluR5. Treatment of transgenic mice with the SAM over 4 weeks rescued signaling abnormalities, behavioral deficits, synaptic depletion, and pathological Tau in transgenic mice without altering amyloid plaque load or gliosis. We hypothesize that synaptic recoveries depend on corrections of signaling molecules and that synaptic improvements are the underlying cause of behavioral recoveries. Future work should explore a dose response for the SAM to define the receptor occupancy required for benefit as well as the therapeutic index relative to any toxicity at high doses. It will also be important to determine whether the benefits of SAM persist after treatment cessation, as predicted for a disease-modifying therapy. This work provides proof for targeting the PrPC-mGluR5 complex to modify the course of AD without interfering with the physiological role of mGluR5 in glutamate signaling. Additional studies will clarify the potential for translation of SAM intervention as an AD therapeutic.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

BMS-984923

The synthesis of this compound at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) laboratories has been described previously (compound 16; Huang et al., 2016).

Experimental Design

All experiments were conducted in a blinded fashion with respect to genotype and treatment, and groups were matched for age and gender (Figure S2). The number of animals used for each subsequent experiment was calculated based on previous results to enable adequate statistical power.

Biochemical, Behavioral, Electrophysiological, and Histological Analyses

These methods followed various published methods and are detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. All animal work was approved by the relevant Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Statistics

All results are presented as means ± SEM. IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 and Prism 6 software were used for statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using one-way or two-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test, or Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) post hoc pairwise comparisons test as specified in the figure legends. Only two-sided tests were used, and all data analyzed met the assumption for the specific statistical test that was performed. Probability levels of p &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Figure 1 SAM BMS-984923 Does Not Interfere with Glutamate-Induced Calcium Signaling and Does Not Impair EEG Amplitude in Mice

(A) mGluR5-expressing HEK293T cells were incubated with a Ca2+-sensing dye and monitored by fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) calcium assay. Cells were treated with compounds after 16 s as indicated. After 76 s, 50 μM glutamate was added, and the change of intracellular Ca2+ concentration was recorded. Data are mean ± SEM from three individual experiments, where 15–17 wells of a 96-well plate were averaged per experiment.

(B) DIV21 neurons were exposed to the SAM and/or MTEP for 20 min prior to recording the change of intracellular Ca2+ concentration in response to 50 μM DHPG at 18 s. Each line represents the induced mean ± SEM. The Ca2+ response was averaged from 18–20 wells of a 96-well plate.

(C) Mice were treated with either 7.5 mg/kg SAM or vehicle by oral gavage 90 min prior to receiving 20 mg/kg PAM by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Graphs depict the occurrence of seizure activity that scored 3 or greater on the Racine scale following PAM administration. Each group is comprised of eight animals, and differently colored lines represent different animals in the group.

(D) Seizure-free survival of animals pretreated with either 7.5 mg/kg SAM or vehicle prior to receiving 20 mg/kg PAM by i.p. injection. A seizure event is defined as an episode scoring 3 or greater on the Racine scale (*p &lt; 0.05 by log rank test).

(E and F) Mice were treated with SAM/vehicle by oral gavage (PO) or MTEP/vehicle by i.p. injection. (E) Characteristic EEG traces reordered pre- and post-treatment. (F) Power spectral blot of EEG traces 2 hr after treatment. EEG waves are grouped into delta waves (&lt;4 Hz), theta waves (4–7 Hz), alpha waves (8–15 Hz), and beta waves (&gt;16 Hz). Two hours after receiving a 1 × (3.75 mg/kg) or 10 × (37.5 mg/kg) dose of the SAM, the EEG remained unchanged compared with vehicle-treated mice. Contrarily, 2 hr after receiving a 10 × dose of MTEP (75 mg/kg), the EEG amplitude in mice was strongly suppressed compared with vehicle-treated mice.

Figure 2 The SAM Reduces the Interaction of PrPC with mGluR5 in Membrane Fractions

(A) HEK293 cells were co-transfected with PrPC and Myc-mGluR5. Membrane fractions were prepared in the absence of detergent and incubated for 2 hr at 4°C with the indicated concentrations of the SAM. Membrane proteins were extracted by NP-40, and membrane extractions (input) and immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with either anti-Myc or anti-PrPC.

(B and C) Data are mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. (B) Quantification of the PrPC signal in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates after treatment is normalized to the signal of untreated samples. Co-immunoprecipitation of PrPC with Myc-mGluR5 is significantly reduced by 10 μM SAM (*p &lt; 0.05 by one-way ANOVA with Fisher’s LSD post hoc pairwise comparisons). (C) Quantification of the Myc signal in anti-PrPC immunoprecipitates after treatment is normalized to the signal of untreated samples.

(D) HEK293 cells were co-transfected with PrPC and Myc-mGluR5. Membrane fractions were pre-incubated for 2 hr at 4°C with the indicated concentrations of the SAM, followed by 1 μM Aβo for 30 min (monomer-equivalent concentration, estimated oligomer of 10 nM). NP-40 membrane extractions (input) and immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with either anti-Myc or anti-PrPC.

(E and F) Data are mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. (E) Quantification of the PrPC signal in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates after treatment is normalized to the signal of untreated samples. Aβos trigger a significant enhancement of the co-immunoprecipitation of PrPC with Myc-mGluR5 in membrane fractions, which can be significantly reversed by 1 μM SAM (***p &lt; 0.001, ****p &lt; 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparisons test). (F) Quantification of the Myc signal in anti-PrPC immunoprecipitates after treatment is normalized to the signal of untreated samples. Co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-mGluR5 with PrPC is significantly enhanced by Aβo (**p &lt; 0.01 by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparisons test).

(G) The data from Aβo-treated samples in (E) are replotted as a function of SAM concentration and compared to the values with no SAM added (****p &lt; 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparisons test).

(H) The data from Aβo-treated samples in (F) are replotted as a function of SAM concentration.

Figure 3 The SAM Prevents Aβo-Dependent Inhibition of CA1 LTP

(A–C) Field potentials were recorded from the CA1 region of adult wild-type brain slices. The slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) is plotted as a function of time. Representative traces immediately before theta burst stimulation (TBS, denoted by an arrowhead at 0 min, black) and 60 min post-TBS (red) are superimposed (average, 5 sweeps) in each respective graph. Data are mean ± SEM of averaged slices per treatment group. Slices were pre-treated with or without 100 nM SAM for 2 hr, followed by vehicle or 1 μM Aβo (~5–10 nM oligomer) for 30 min prior to TBS. n = 6–11 slices per condition. (A) There is a significant difference between Aβo-treated slices compared with all other groups by repeated-measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA (*p &lt; 0.05). (B) Aβo treatment significantly inhibits LTP (*p &lt; 0.05 by RM-ANOVA). (C) There is no significant difference between vehicle and Aβo treatment in SAM-pretreated slices (ns, p &gt; 0.05 by RM-ANOVA).

(D) For slices pre-treated with vehicle but not SMA, the subsequent addition Aβo significantly decreased the fEPSPs measured 40–60 min after TBS. Aβo did not alter LTP 40–60 min post-TBS in SAM-pre-treated slices (*p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01 by one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test). By two-way ANOVA, there was a significant interaction between SAM and Aβo treatment (p = 0.033).

Figure 4 The SAM Reverses Learning and Memory Deficits in APP/PS1 Transgenic Mice after 4 Weeks of Treatment

(A) Mice were familiarized to two identical objects and then exposed to one familiar and one novel object. Novel object recognition is plotted as the time mice spent interacting with a novel object compared with the time spent interacting with a familiar object. Data are mean ± SEM; n = 18–25 mice/group. Vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice displayed no preference for either object (p &gt; 0.05), whereas all other groups showed a distinct preference for the novel object (***p &lt; 0.001 by two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test). The dashed line indicates an even amount of time spent with a familiar and novel object.

(B) Spatial learning in the Morris water maze is plotted as the latency to a hidden platform after 4 weeks of treatment. Data are mean ± SEM of 21–28 mice/group. Performance was analyzed by two-way analysis of variance with RM-ANOVA over the last eight trials and showed a significant effect of genotype (p &lt; 0.001), of treatment (p = 0.043), and of their interaction (p = 0.045). The vehicle-treated APP/PS1 group differed significantly from all other groups by one-way RM-ANOVA over the last eight trials with Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparisons test (*p &lt; 0.05, ***p &lt; 0.001), whereas all other comparisons were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05).

(C) The distance traveled to reach the hidden platform from (B) are plotted for each group. Data are mean ± SEM of 21–28 mice/group. The distance traveled for the vehicle-treated APP/PS1 group differed significantly from all other groups by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparisons test (**p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.005), whereas all other comparisons were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05).

(D) The average swim speed during the last block of swim trials from (B) are plotted for each group. Data are mean ± SEM of 21–28 mice/group.

(E) A 60-s probe trial test was performed 24 hr after completion of training in the Morris water maze. Plotted is the percent time spent in the quadrant where the platform was previously located. Data are mean ± SEM of 21–28 mice/group. Performance analyzed by two-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of genotype (p = 0.000), of treatment (p = 0.043), and of their interaction (p = 0.046). The vehicle-treated APP/PS1 group differed significantly from all other groups by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparisons test (*p &lt; 0.05, ****p &lt; 0.0001), whereas all other comparisons were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05). The dashed line represents chance performance.

(F). Mice were trained to avoid a dark compartment in a passive avoidance paradigm. The latency of vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice to enter the dark compartment in a retention test 5 min after training was significantly decreased compared with the wild-type (*p &lt; 0.05 by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc comparisons). The deficit in behavior of APP/PS1 mice was significantly rescued by SAM treatment (**p &lt; 0.01), which enabled an indifferent latency to enter the dark compartment compared with wild-type mice (p &gt; 0.05). Data are mean ± SEM, n = 21–27 mice/group.

Figure 5 Neither Aβ Plaque Load Nor Gliosis Are Altered by Treatment with the SAM

(B) Fractional area of Aβ immunoreactivity averaged from one image of the hippocampus and one image of the frontal cortex stained with anti-Aβ antibody 2454. A one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc comparisons shows that both APP/PS1 groups differ significantly from both wild-type groups (**p &lt; 0.01; *p &lt; 0.05). No difference was detected upon treatment with the SAM. Data are mean ± SEM from 11–14 mice/group.

(C) Representative images of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunofluorescent staining of the frontal cortex of wild-type and APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle or the SAM. Data are mean ± SEM from 12–14 mice/group. Scale bar, 20 μm.

(D) Fractional area of immunoreactivity averaged from one image of the hippocampus and one image of the frontal cortex per mouse. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc comparison test shows that both APP/PS1 groups differ significantly from wild-type mice (**p &lt; 0.01, *p &lt; 0.05). Treatment did not alter astrogliosis in either wild-type or APP/PS1 mice (p &gt; 0.05).

(E) Representative images of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1(Iba1) immunofluorescent staining of the frontal cortex of wild-type and APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle or the SAM. Data are mean ± SEM of 12 mice/group. Scale bar, 20 μm.

(F) Fractional area of immunoreactivity averaged from one image of the hippocampus and one image of the frontal cortex per mouse. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc comparisons shows that both APP/PS1 groups differ significantly from both wild-type groups (***p &lt; 0.001). Treatment did not alter microgliosis in either wild-type or APP/PS1 groups (p &gt; 0.05).

Figure 6 The SAM Recovers Loss of Synaptic Markers in APP/PS1 Mice after 5 Weeks of Treatment

(A) Representative immunofluorescent images of the dentate gyrus of the indicated groups stained with SV2a. Scale bar, 12 μm.

(B) Fractional area of immunoreactive puncta for SV2a in the dentate gyrus. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc comparisons shows that the vehicle-treated APP/PS1 group differs significantly from the SAM-treated wild-type group as well as the SAM-treated APP/PS1 group (*p &lt; 0.05). Data are mean ± SEM of 15–23 mice/group.

(C) Representative immunofluorescent images of the dentate gyrus of the indicated groups, stained for PSD-95. Scale bar, 12 μm.

(D) Fractional area of immunoreactive puncta for PSD-95 in the dentate gyrus of the indicated groups. Data are mean ± SEM of 16–23 mice/group. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc comparisons shows that the vehicle-treated APP/PS1 group differs significantly from the vehicle-treated wild-type group (*p &lt; 0.05), but the SAM-treated APP/PS1 group is rescued to wild-type levels (ns, p &gt; 0.05).

Figure 7 The SAM Recovers Aβo-Induced Activation of Intracellular Signaling Molecules

(A) Representative immunoblots of RIPA-soluble extracts from brain slices incubated with Aβo or vehicle for 30 min and pre-incubated with SAM or vehicle for 2 hr.

(B and C) Densitometric analysis of the immunoblots from (A) showing Aβo-induced activation of Pyk2 (B) and CaMKII (C), which was significantly reduced by pre-incubating brain slices with the SAM (*p &lt; 0.05 by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test). Data are mean ± SEM of three independent experiments with the brain slices per condition each.

(D) Representative immunoblots of RIPA-soluble brain lysates of mice treated with the SAM or vehicle for 5 weeks. Genotypes and treatment status are indicated above each lane, and each lane represents a separate mouse.

(E and F) Densitometric analysis of the immunoblots from (D). Data are mean ± SEM of 22–26 mice/group. The ratio of phospho-Pyk2(Y402) to Pyk2 (E) as well as phospho-eEF2(T56) to eEF2 (F) in vehicle-treated APP/PS1 brain was significantly elevated compared with wild-type brain. This ratio was significantly reduced and normalized to wild-type levels in SAM-treated APP/PS1 mice (***p &lt; 0.001, **p &lt; 0.01, *p &lt; 0.05; one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc comparisons).
