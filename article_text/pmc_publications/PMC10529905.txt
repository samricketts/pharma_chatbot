Animal fluency is a commonly used neuropsychological measure that is used in the diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although most individuals with aMCI have clinically normal scores on this test, several studies have shown that aMCI individuals’ performance is significantly lower than that of cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. The aim of this meta-analysis was to characterize the effect size of animal fluency performance differences between aMCI and CU individuals. Literature search with search terms used were: “animal fluency and mild cognitive impairment”, “semantic fluency and mild cognitive impairment”, “category fluency and mild cognitive impairment”. Both the standardized mean difference (SMD) and the raw mean difference (RMD) were derived from random effects analyses. Demographically adjusted z-scores for Animal fluency performance for the aMCI groups were obtained to determine normative performance. Nineteen studies were included in the analysis. The SMD for animal fluency performance between CU and aMCI was 0.89 (95% confidence interval: [0.73; 1.04], p&lt;0.001), I2 = 70.3% [52.7%; 81.4%], which reflects a large effect size with moderate heterogeneity. The RMD was −4.08 [−4.75; −3.38], p&lt;0.001. The mean animal fluency z-score for aMCI groups was in the Low Average range (z = −0.77). This study found a substantial difference on animal fluency performance between aMCI and CU individuals. The aMCI groups’ normative performance did not fall into the Impaired range indicating that there are important sub-clinical differences on animal fluency performance that may inform the design of cognitive endpoints for AD prevention trials.

Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is characterized by objective memory impairment that is at least 1.5 standard deviations below age- and education-adjusted normative performance and are at an increased risk for progressing to clinical Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)1. Although memory performance has been the primary focus of research relating to aMCI, there is evidence that non-memory domains may also be impacted suggesting that subtle, but significant, changes in these domains may be informative2,3. Several studies have reported that aMCI patients’ cognitive performance is intermediate to CU participants and early-stage AD patients not only on episodic memory measures, but also on verbal fluency and executive function measures3–5. Kramer et al4 suggest that isolated memory impairments are uncommon in aMCI patients, so the inclusion of fluency and executive function measures may enhance the sensitivity of cognitive composite scores that are being utilized in secondary prevention trials for AD6–8.

Lam et al9 reported that category fluency performance for Questionable Dementia (QD, Clinical Dementia Rating Global Score = 0.5) was intermediate to CU and AD subjects where the effect size for the difference between CU and QD subjects was 1.11 (Cohen’s d). A subsequent study by Malek-Ahmadi et al10 demonstrated that aMCI individuals performed significantly worse on category fluency measures when compared to age-, sex-, and education-matched CU older adults and reported a similar effect size for the difference in performance between aMCI and CU individuals (Cohen’s d = 1.05). Although Malek-Ahmadi et al10 reported a large effect size between CU and aMCI groups, it was noted that the aMCI group’s category fluency scores were in the normal range of performance. This discrepancy warrants further attention as AD research has shifted toward identifying preclinical AD where individuals demonstrate the presence AD-related pathology without the onset of cognitive symptoms11. In particular, there has been considerable effort put toward the development of cognitive endpoints that could be sensitive to subtle, but significant, cognitive changes associated with preclinical AD6–8. Although the construction of these cognitive measures is often empirically-based, episodic memory tests tend to feature quite prominently in these composite measures leaving little representation of executive function and other cognitive domains. Research diagnostic criteria for prodromal AD recognizes that decline in non-memory domains of cognition are likely to be informative in predicting future cognitive status when used with sensitive biomarkers of in vivo AD pathology12 so it is possible that the sensitivity of cognitive composite endpoints could be enhanced with the inclusion of additional tests from other domains. Previously reported effect sizes for semantic fluency differences between CU and aMCI individuals9,10 provide a solid basis for wider use of these measures in preclinical AD.

The aim of this meta-analysis is to characterize animal fluency performance differences between aMCI and CU older adults. A moderate to large overall effect size would provide convincing evidence for the wider use of animal fluency in assessing subtle cognitive changes associated with preclinical AD.

Methods

Inclusion Criteria

Prior to conducting the literature searches, the following criteria for study selection and inclusion were established: 1) The data could not come from a treatment or intervention trial, 2) The study must report raw means and standard deviations for animal fluency performance in both the CU and aMCI groups, 3) The study must use Petersen criteria1 to classify its aMCI subjects. When possible, only data from single-domain aMCI subjects were included although the majority of included studies did not differentiate single- and multi-domain aMCI.

Literature Search Terms

Prior to the literature search, seven articles from a previous meta-analysis13 were identified and had data extracted. Using PubMed, the first search term used was “animal fluency and mild cognitive impairment” which yielded 123 results. Of these, 26 were selected for further screening from which six studies were able to be included. A second search using the term “category fluency and mild cognitive impairment” yielded eight results of which five were screened with four meeting criteria for inclusion. The search term “semantic fluency and mild cognitive impairment” yielded 487 results from which 42 were screened with two meeting criteria for inclusion. These searches were also conducted in PSYCInfo where no additional articles were yielded beyond those already identified in the PubMed searches. The total number of studies included in this meta-analysis was 19 (Figure 1).

Data Quality and Extraction

The quality each study was assessed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies14 which yields ratings of ‘Good’, ‘Fair’, or ‘Poor’ based on 14 items. Of the 19 included studies, 11 were graded as ‘Good’ and 8 were graded as ‘Fair’. From the selected studies means and standard deviations for age, education, and animal fluency scores were extracted for both the CU and aMCI groups as well as the sample sizes for each group. The diagnostic method (Consensus, Clinical, Algorithmic, Unspecified) for each study was also classified as well as the study setting (Clinic, Community). It was noted that several studies utilized both Clinic (aMCI) and Community (CU) settings for recruitment.

Statistical Analysis

The primary analyses were carried out using the ‘meta’ and ‘metafor’ packages in R 4.0.3. Analyses of the standardized mean difference (SMD) (Hedge’s g) and the raw mean difference (RMD) for animal fluency were carried out. Results from random effects analyses were reported and the I2 statistic was used to quantify between-study heterogeneity which was classified as low, moderate, or high based on proposed guidelines15. Additional SMD analyses were carried out for subgroups based on study setting (clinic vs. community) and diagnostic method (clinical vs. consensus). The Egger’s test was used to determine the presence of publication bias among the included studies.

In order to provide results with additional clinical utility, the means of the aMCI groups’ animal fluency values were converted to z-scores using normative data16.

Results

A comprehensive list of the included studies4,17–34 with quantitative and qualitative information is shown in Table 1. A total of 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis which yielded data for 2,194 subjects (1,141 CU and 1,053 aMCI). The median number of CU subjects per study was 35 while the median number of aMCI subjects per study was 30. The CU and aMCI groups did not differ in terms of age (p = 0.40) or education (p = 0.68). Eight studies drew subjects from both community and clinic settings, another eight drew their subjects solely from clinic settings, and three studies were community-based. Ten studies utilized a consensus diagnosis while six used a clinical diagnosis. The diagnostic approach for three studies could not be determined.

The SMD for animal fluency performance between CU and aMCI was 0.89 (95% confidence interval: [0.73; 1.04], p&lt;0.001), I2 = 70.3% [52.7%; 81.4%], which reflects a large effect size with moderate heterogeneity (Figure 2). The RMD was −4.08 [−4.75; −3.38], p&lt;0.001 indicating that aMCI individuals generated significantly fewer animals than CU individuals. The Egger’s test indicated the significant influence of publication bias on these results (p = 0.002). Inspection of the funnel plot confirmed this finding as the distribution of effect sizes was not symmetric with the majority falling on the right half of the plot (Supplemental Figure 1).

For clinic-based studies (n = 8) the SMD increased to 1.02 (95% confidence interval: [0.84; 1.20], p&lt;0.001), I2 = 0.00% [0.0%; 58.4%] while community-based studies (n = 3) had a smaller, but still large, SMD of 0.84 (95% confidence interval: [0.57; 1.10], p&lt;0.001), I2 = 0.0% [0.0%; 80.4%]. Studies that were clinic- and community-based (n = 8), the SMD was the most conservative at 0.81 (95% confidence interval: [0.50; 1.11], p&lt;0.001), I2 = 83.5% [69.1%; 91.2%] with a high level of heterogeneity. However, the biggest disparity in SMD estimates was observed for diagnostic approach (consensus vs. clinical) where studies that used a consensus diagnosis (n = 10) had a SMD of 0.75 (95% confidence interval: [0.53; 0.96], p&lt;0.001), I2 = 68.4% [38.9%; 83.7%] and studies that used a clinical diagnosis (n = 6) had a SMD of 1.13 (95% confidence interval: [0.90; 1.35], p&lt;0.001), I2 = 0.0% [0.0%; 64.7%]. A summary of the effect sizes and heterogeneity statistics for all analyses can be found in Table 2.

Normative conversion of the aMCI groups’ animal fluency scores indicated that their overall performance was in the Low Average range (z = −0.75) where the z-scores for all studies ranged from −1.65 to −0.12 (Table 3).

Discussion

This meta-analysis of 19 studies found a substantial difference on animal fluency performance between CU and aMCI groups. On average, aMCI groups’ animal fluency performance was four points lower than that of the CU groups which equated to a large effect size (Hedge’s g = 0.89). The degree of heterogeneity (I2 = 70%) was moderate indicating that there was relative consistency among the reported effect sizes in the included studies. In the subgroup analysis for study setting studies that used clinic-based samples yielded a larger effect size (Hedge’s g = 1.02) when compared to community-based samples (Hedge’s g = 0.84) or when compared to studies that used both clinic- and community-based samples (Hedge’s g = 0.81). A similar pattern was noted in the subgroup analysis for diagnostic method where studies that utilized a clinical diagnosis had a much larger effect size (Hedge’s g = 1.13) than those that used a consensus diagnosis (Hedge’s g = 0.75). Larger effect sizes among studies with clinic-based samples have been noted previously35–37 which underscores the need for subgroup analyses to better evaluate how cognitive outcome effect size estimates are influenced when different sampling approaches are used.

The large effect size observed in this meta-analysis shows that animal fluency, and possibly other semantic fluency tasks, should be given greater consideration in the construction of cognitive composite endpoints that are intended to detect subclinical cognitive changes that occur prior to the onset of the overt clinical symptoms associated with AD8,38. This conceptualization of preclinical AD39 is now the prevailing paradigm for AD research and treatment7 and the results of this meta-analysis provide evidence that decline in non-memory domains in aMCI should be given greater attention. Given that regulatory authorities have suggested that approval for disease-modifying therapies could be based on a measure of cognition that shows “persuasive effects”40, constructing cognitive endpoints with sensitive memory and non-memory measures will continue to be extremely important.

It is possible that CU individuals with significant levels of AD pathology manifest similar, but slightly smaller, subclinical declines in animal fluency compared to aMCI individuals. In this regard, the inclusion of animal fluency in cognitive composite endpoints for both AD prevention and aMCI clinical trials may provide additional sensitivity to treatment effects38. Since the aMCI groups in the included studies yielded animal fluency performances that were mostly in the Low Average range of functioning, the clinical value of these findings is unclear. However, there is significant scientific value in a cognitive test that can detect a large effect size as this may enhance a cognitive composite measure’s sensitivity.

The findings of this study, and a previous meta-analysis13, suggest that there are notable changes in non-memory domains that may be useful in detecting clinically-meaningful cognitive changes in individuals with preclinical AD who are at-risk for progressing to aMCI. Given that there can be significant heterogeneity in the patterns of cognitive decline41, the inclusion of sensitive non-memory tests is important and others have suggested that fluency tests may be helpful in this regard42. However, cognitive trajectories in clinical trials are often different from that seen in observational studies where the effect sizes in rates of cognitive decline between placebo and treatment groups tend to be small and hard to detect42. It is important to note that treatment effects for AD prevention trials must be detected within the spectrum of clinically-normal cognitive functioning among their participants which underscores the need to accurately assess significant subclinical cognitive changes.

The question of how much change on a measure of cognition is needed to meet the threshold of being clinically meaningful has also been raised and continues to be debated. It is clear from these results that relying on the traditional clinical cutoffs, such as 1.5 standard deviations below the mean of age- and education-similar CU individuals, will not allow for meaningful cognitive changes to be detected in earlier parts of the disease trajectory. Borland et al43 derived minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for several common cognitive tests, including animal fluency. Among CU individuals it was reported that a decline of 2.8 points on the animal fluency test represents clinically meaningful change which aligns well with the current study’s findings of a four-point difference between CU and aMCI subjects. By itself, this MCID may not appear to be a particularly large effect, but when used as one component of a composite endpoint its addition may provide additional sensitivity beyond what would be attainable without its inclusion.

A limitation of this meta-analysis is that it framed animal fluency performance as a measure of executive function as there is debate about whether verbal fluency tasks are measures of language or executive function. Rabinovici et al44 propose that fluency (phonemic and semantic) is a primary component of executive function which supports the interpretation used in this study. However, there can be significant overlap between cognitive domains as mechanisms in one domain may underlie those in another so it is difficult to classify a single cognitive test as a pure measure of one particular domain45. An additional limitation to this study is the inability to differentiate single-domain aMCI from its multidomain counterpart in several of the included studies giving rise to the possibility that aMCI individuals with executive function impairment were included in the analysis. This may have resulted in reported effects sizes that are larger than what would normally be expected between CU and single-domain aMCI, thus inflating the effect sizes of this meta-analysis.

The results of this meta-analysis show that there are important subclinical differences on animal fluency performance between aMCI and CU older adults which should be given greater consideration when constructing cognitive outcomes for intervention studies.
