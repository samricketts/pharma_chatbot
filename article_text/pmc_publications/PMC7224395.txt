γ-Secretase is a membrane-embedded aspartyl protease complex with presenilin as the catalytic component that cleaves within the transmembrane domain (TMD) of &gt;90 known substrates, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) of Alzheimer’s disease. Processing by γ-secretase of the APP TMD produces the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), including the 42-residue variant (Aβ42) that pathologically deposits in the Alzheimer brain. Complex proteolysis of APP substrate by γ-secretase involves initial endoproteolysis and subsequent carboxypeptidase trimming, resulting in two pathways of Aβ production: Aβ49→Aβ46→Aβ43→Aβ40 and Aβ48→Aβ45→Aβ42→Aβ38. Dominant mutations in APP and presenilin cause early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD). Understanding how γ-secretase processing of APP is altered in FAD is essential for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms in FAD and developing effective therapeutics. To advance such understanding, we designed synthetic APP-based TMD substrates as convenient functional probes for γ-secretase. Installation of the helix-inducing residue α-aminoisobutyric acid provided full TMD helical substrates while also facilitating their synthesis and increasing the solubility of these highly hydrophobic peptides. Through mass spectrometric analysis of proteolytic products, synthetic substrates were identified that were processed in a manner that reproduced physiological processing of APP substrates. Validation of these substrates was accomplished through mutational variants, including the installation of two natural APP FAD mutations. These FAD mutations also resulted in increased formation of Aβ-like peptides corresponding to Aβ45 and longer, raising the question of whether such long Aβ peptides are indeed increased and might contribute to FAD pathogenesis.


Introduction

Intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) are membrane-embedded enzymes that carry out hydrolysis within the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer to cleave substrate transmembrane domains (TMDs).1 How I-CLiPs accomplish this challenging enzymological process is a central question in membrane protein biochemistry. The aspartyl protease γ-secretase is arguably the most biochemically complicated of the I-CLiPs.2 While other I-CLiPs are single polypeptides, γ-secretase is a complex of four different integral membrane proteins,3–11 with presenilin as the catalytic component containing two active-site TMD aspartates.12 Moreover, while other I-CLiPs cleave substrate TMD only once, the γ-secretase complex carries out multiple proteolytic events during processing of its substrate.13–17 With over 90 known substrates,18, 19 γ-secretase is known as “the proteasome of the membrane”.20

γ-Secretase is also a biomedically important I-CLiP. Among its many substrates is the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Proteolytic processing of APP by γ-secretase produces the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), and the 42-residue variant Aβ42 is the principle protein component of the characteristic cerebral plaques of Alzheimer’s disease.21 Dominant missense mutations in APP and in presenilin-1 and -2 (PSEN1 and PSEN2) cause early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD).22 After more than 30 years of searching, APP and the presenilins are the only known sites of FAD mutations. Thus, FAD mutations are found only in the substrate and in the enzyme that produce Aβ. Understanding how these mutations alter APP TMD processing by γ-secretase should shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms of FAD, which in turn should empower the search for effective therapeutic agents for FAD. Such advances would also likely have implications for the more common sporadic late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.

The processing of APP by γ-secretase is complex. APP substrate is initially cleaved near the cytosolic side of its TMD by γ-secretase to produce Aβ48 or Aβ49 (Fig. 1).23 This endoproteolytic (ε) cleavage also releases corresponding APP intracellular domain (AICD) products.23–27 Aβ48 and Aβ49 are then further processed by γ-secretase through a carboxypeptidase activity that generally trims every three amino acids.13–17 Thus, Aβ peptides are produced along two primary pathways: Aβ49→Aβ46→Aβ43→Aβ40 and Aβ48→Aβ45→Aβ42→Aβ38 (this last cut forming a tetrapeptide product). FAD mutations in APP and presenilins can increase the ratio of principal secreted products Aβ42 to Aβ40, and this is thought to lead to Aβ42 aggregation and plaque formation.28 However, a recent report revealed that many FAD PSEN1 mutations do not increase Aβ42/Aβ40.29 Moreover, our lab studied five FAD mutations in PSEN1 in detail and found that these mutations result in decreased carboxypeptidase activity of γ-secretase, thereby also increasing the proportion of longer Aβ peptides of 45-49 residues.16, 30

While the comprehensive study of APP processing by γ-secretase is apparently critical for unraveling the pathogenic mechanisms of FAD, such analyses are challenging. Aβ peptides of 42 residues and longer are highly aggregation prone. In addition, those of 45 residues and longer are poorly detected by mass spectrometry and have no specific ELISAs. To address this problem, we designed synthetic peptide substrates for γ-secretase based on the APP TMD. In this design, we installed the helix-inducing residue α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) into the N-terminal region of the APP TMD sequence. In addition to favoring a helical conformation needed for substrate recognition by γ-secretase, Aib installation facilitates peptide synthesis and increases the solubility of these hydrophobic substrates and their proteolytic products. Moreover, longer proteolytic products representing Aβ45 through Aβ49 are readily detectable by mass spectrometry. We show here that these synthetic Aib-containing substrates are processed in a manner similar to that seen physiologically with APP substrate, and validate these findings with mutant versions of the synthetic substrates. We further show that installation of two APP FAD mutations into these helical peptides resulted in increased formation of Aβ-like peptides corresponding to Aβ45 and longer. Taken together, these findings suggest Aib-containing synthetic substrates should be useful functional probes for the study of γ-secretase and its role in FAD.

Experimental Procedures

Peptide synthesis and purification.

All reagents for peptide synthesis were purchased from AAPPTec or Chem-Impex International Inc. All peptides were synthesized through standard Fmoc solid-phase chemistry using Rink amide MBHA resin (AAPPTec) with diisopropylcarbodimide (DIC) and ethyl cyanohydroxyiminoacetate (oxyma) as coupling reagents on an AAPPTec Focus 6RV automated peptide synthesizer. All amino acids were double coupled, with each coupling of 8 min at 70 °C. All peptides were amidated at the C-terminus and acetylated at the N-terminus. Cleavage of peptides from the resin was accomplished through treatment with cleavage cocktail trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) : triisopropylsilane (TIPS) : 2,2’-(ethylenedioxy)diethane dithiol (DODT) : H2O (92.5:2.5:2.5:2.5) at ambient temperature for 2.5 h. Volatile reagents were removed under vacuum, and the residual oily liquid was dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and incubated at 35 °C for 16 h. Final peptides were purified by preparative HPLC (Waters, Milford, MA) on a C8 column (Phenomenex, Luna, 10 μm C8, 100 Å pore size, 250 x 21 mm) by eluting with buffer A (0.1% aqueous TFA) and buffer B (0.1% TFA in 1:1 acetonitrile:isopropanol). After elution at 80:20 A:B for 5 min, a linear gradient elution to 2:98 A:B over 1 h was conducted. All final peptides were characterized by mass spectrometry. All the peptides were ≥92% purity as analyzed by UPLC on a Protein BEH C18 column. Stock peptides in DMSO were stored at −20°C.

Conformational analysis.

Circular dichroism: 1 mM solutions of peptides (HPS-1 through -6) in methanol were prepared by carefully weighing 0.001 mmol (&gt;4.0 mg) of the peptide lyophilized powders directly into vials on a calibrated balance with an accuracy of +/− 0.0001 g. To these vials, 1.000 mL of MeOH was carefully added using a calibrated micropipettor. Solutions were then incubated at 35 °C for 16 h. After dilution to 300 μM with methanol, far-UV CD spectra were obtained for each compound were measured in the range of 180-250 nm at 25 °C using a Chirascan Plus spectrometer and optical cells with path length 1 mm. The step size and monochromator bandwidth were set at 1 nm. Time-per-point was 0.5 s. The raw CD data (ellipticity, θλ) for each compound were converted into mean residual ellipticity, MRE, [θ]λ (deg cm2 dmol−1) at a given λ using the relationship: (1) [θ]λ=(θλ∗Mo)∕(10∗∣c∗)

Where θλ is the observed ellipticity in millidegrees, Mo is mean residual weight of peptide, I is the path length in centimeter, and c is the peptide concentrations in mg ml−1. Percent α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil were calculated from MRE values of peptide as a function of λ using the program k2d.31 NMR: All NMR spectra of HPS-4 (2 mM in CD3OH) were recorded on a Bruker 800 MHz NMR spectrometer with a 5 mm TCI cryoprobe at 278 °K. 2D COSY, TOCSY and ROESY experiments were performed using standard pulse sequences from the Bruker library. Data were collected with 4096 data points in T2 and 512 data points in T1. The relaxation delay was 2 s. Mixing times of 70 ms and 300 ms were used for TOCSY and ROESY experiments, respectively. Data were processed and analyzed using MestReNova.

Incubation of helical peptide substrates with γ-secretase.

Purified γ-secretase containing presenilin-1, obtained as previously described,32 was dissolved to a final enzyme concentration of 30 nM in assay buffer containing 50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCI, 0.1% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 0.025% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), and 0.25% zwitterionic detergent 3-([3-cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPSO). After pre-incubating 40 μL of this solution for 30 min at 37 °C, helical peptide substrate (HPS) in DMSO was added to a final concentration of 10 μM HPS and 2% DMSO, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Proteolytic products were then analyzed by mass spectroscopy as described below.

Mass spectrometric analysis.

Proteolytic products were analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) on a quadrapole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (QTOF Premier, Waters, Milford, MA). The enzyme reaction mixture was transferred to a vial, washing the Eppendorf reaction tube with 20 μL of methanol. 2 μL of heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) was added as an ion pairing reagent. 10 uL of this mixture was loaded on to a C18 column and eluted with a step gradient of 0.08% aqeous formic acid (A), CH3CN (B), isopropanol (C), acetone:dioxane, 9:1 (D), from 99:1:0:0 to 5:5:60:30 (details in Table S1). Acetone was used at the end of the gradient to remove lipid and detergent from the column. An initial MSE scan (high/low collision-induced fragmentation (CID) energy toggle not using the resolving quadrupole) of m/z from 500-2000 was performed to identify proteolytic products in the sample. After identification of the products and their retention times, a second LC/MS-MS experiment was run using the quadrupole to select M2H2+ for CID. The identities of the proteolytic products were confirmed using the Biolynx utility (Waters) that predicts a, b and y” sequence-specific fragment ions and annotates an acquired spectrum. All confirmed peptides had nearly complete a, b and y” ion series and the expected precursor ion.

Quantitative analysis of AICD-Iike C-terminal products LVMLKKK and VMLKKK.

The two observed C-terminal fragments (LVMLKKK and VMLKKK) were synthesized and analyzed by LC-MSE and LC/MS-MS experiments. HFBA was used as the ion-pairing agent as above. HPLC runs were carried out as above (step gradient details in Table S2). The five most abundant CID fragments were identified and used to quantify the peptide products from enzyme reactions and to plot a standard curve from synthesized standards. To obtain a peptide chromatographic area, the signal from the five most abundant ions were summed using an ion mass width of 0.02 u; data was acquired in “V” mode.

Results

Synthetic substrate design and synthesis.

We recently showed that the TMD of another γ-secretase substrate, the Notch1 receptor, is sufficient for high-affinity substrate binding and processing by γ-secretase.33 The juxtamembrane regions were not required; indeed, extension on the luminal/extracellular side reduced substrate binding and processing in a length-dependent manner. Also in earlier work, we demonstrated that Aib-containing helical peptides based on the APP TM D could be potent inhibitors of γ-secretase34, 35 and that these inhibitors bound to an initial substrate docking site on presenilin that is distinct from the active site36 where transition-state analogue inhibitors bind.37, 38 In the design of the helical peptide inhibitors, we installed the Aibs spaced 3-4 residues apart so that the Aibs would align along one face of the helix, while APP residues would be arrayed along the rest of the helix for interaction with the protease. In applying this approach to substrate design, we began from the full APP TMD plus three cytosolic lysines (Fig. 2a) to both aid solubility and to better mimic ε cleavage. Thus, the synthetic peptides are 27 residues long. In the initial design, we installed four to five Aibs, beginning near the N-terminus and spacing them three to four residues apart. The register of Aib installation was staggered in the three initially designed helical peptide substrates (HPS-1, -2, and -3; Fig. 2a), to present different faces of the APP TMD to γ-secretase. The C-terminal region of the peptides were devoid of Aib to allow helix unwinding for entry into the active site and multiple carboxypeptidase trimming events. Peptides were synthesized on solid-phase using Rink amide resin with standard Fmoc chemistry and oxyma/DIC as coupling agents. All peptides contain N-acetyl and C-amide termini.

Proteolytic products from HPS-1, -2, and -3.

These three initially designed helical peptide substrates were incubated at 10 μM with 30 nM purified γ-secretase at 37 °C for 16 h, followed by LC/MS analysis of proteolytic products. Product identity was further confirmed through MS/MS fragmentation produced by collision-induced dissociation (CID; example shown in Fig. S1). For the N-terminal cleavage products, Aβ-like peptides ‘Aβ43’, ‘Aβ45’, ‘Aβ46’, ‘Aβ48’, and ‘Aβ49’ were all detected for HPS-1 (Fig. 2B,C). In contrast, all these products except ‘Aβ43’ were detected for HPS-2, and all except ‘Aβ49’ were detected for HPS-3 (Fig. 2B). Thus, HPS-1 apparently undergoes processing at the expected ε sites to give ‘Aβ48’ and ‘Aβ49’ followed by tripeptide trimming of ‘Aβ49’→‘Aβ46’→‘Aβ43’ and ‘Aβ48’→‘Aβ45’. HPS-2 undergoes similar processing but does not effectively convert ‘Aβ46’ to ‘Aβ43. As for HPS-3, although it appears to only be cleaved at the ‘Aβ48’-producing ε site, the production of ‘Aβ46’ and ‘Aβ43’ suggest that ‘Aβ49’ is indeed formed but subsequently trimmed. This suspicion was confirmed through analysis of the corresponding C-terminal proteolytic products described next.

Analysis of the AICD-Iike C-terminal products by LC/MS revealed that all three helical peptide substrates were cleaved at the expected ε sites to give both LVMLKKK and VMLKKK peptides, the corresponding co-products with ‘Aβ48’ and ‘Aβ49’, respectively. These were the only AICD-like products formed; no AICD-Iike co-products corresponding with ‘Aβ43’, ‘Aβ45’, and ‘Aβ46’ were observed. These findings demonstrate that the shorter Aβ-like products were derived through carboxypeptidase trimming of ‘Aβ48’ and ‘Aβ49’ and not directly through endoproteolytic cleavage of the helical peptide substrates. To quantify these AICD-Iike products, we synthesized the two peptide standards and generated standard curves of peptide concentration versus the integrated areas of the five most abundant fragments of MS/MS fragmentation. Using this method, we found that HPS-1 and HPS-2 were cleaved at the two ε sites to almost equal degrees, while HPS-3 was preferentially cleaved to give LVMLKKK, corresponding with ‘Aβ48’ (Fig. 2D). This likely explains the inability to observe ‘Aβ49’ from HPS-3: what little of this Aβ-like peptide is formed is trimmed to ‘Aβ46’ and ‘Aβ43’.

We next sought to validate that the shorter Aβ-like peptides are indeed produced through a tripeptide trimming process and not random proteolysis of ‘Aβ48’ and ‘Aβ49’. To accomplish this, we took advantage of the only known sequence-dependent specificity for cleavage by γ-secretase: the inability to tolerate a bulky aromatic amino acid such as phenylalanine in the P2’ position. We recently demonstrated this specificity rule through systematic installation of phenylalanine into each P2’ position in APP substrate along the two major pathways Aβ49→Aβ46→Aβ43→Aβ40 and Aβ48→Aβ45→Aβ42→Aβ38.32 For the helical peptide substrates here, we synthesized phenylalanine-mutant versions of HPS-1. We found that HPS-1 I47F was processed by γ-secretase to give similar Aβ-like products as the parent substrate HPS-1, but notably ‘Aβ45’ was not observed (Fig. 3A). Instead, ‘Aβ44’ was detected. This finding is completely consistent with ‘Aβ48’ trimming to ‘Aβ45’ in HPS-1; I47F mutation places the phenylalanine in the P2’ position for the ‘Aβ48’ₒ‘Aβ45’ trimming step, thereby preventing this conversion. The protease instead cuts at the next available position to produce ‘Aβ44’. Similarly, we found that γ-secretase processing of HPS-1 V50F did not lead to detectable ‘Aβ45’ or ‘Aβ48’. Instead, ‘Aβ44’ and ‘Aβ47’ were detected. These observations are consistent with the P2’ phenylalanine blocking ε cleavage to give ‘Aβ48’, which in turn blocks ‘Aβ45’ production through tripeptide trimming of ‘Aβ48’. Instead, ‘Aβ47’ is produced, which is then trimmed to ‘Aβ44’. We then synthesized the double-phenylalanine mutant HPS-1 T48F/V50F. Processing of this doublemutant synthetic helical peptide substrate by γ-secretase resulted in ‘Aβ44’, ‘Aβ47’, and ‘Aβ49’ as the only detectable Aβ-like products. The V50F apparently has the same effect as described above in the single mutant, while the T48F mutation blocks trimming of ‘Aβ49’→‘Aβ46’→‘Aβ43’. Taken together, the results observed with the various phenylalanine mutations of HPS-1 are entirely consistent with the unacceptability of phenylalanine in the P2’ position of a given γ-secretase cleavage event in APP substrate and the tripeptide trimming pathway. Thus, the new helical peptide substrates undergo ε cleavage and tripeptide trimming in a manner similar to APP substrate.

As further validation that substrate recognition by the synthetic substrates is similar to that of APP substrate, we also installed a double-glycine mutation at positions 47 and 48 (Fig. 3B). We recently reported that I47G/T48G mutation in APP results in more than a threefold increase in ε proteolysis by γ-secretase and that the site of ε cleavage is skewed substantially in favor of the Aβ49 pathway over the Aβ48 pathway.39 This effect is thought to be due to the helix-destabilizing effect of the glycine mutations, making it easier for γ-secretase to unwind helical TMD substrate near the ε cleavage site. Through quantification of AICD-Iike peptides LVMLKKK and VMLKKK, we found that double-glycine mutation had only a subtle effect on HPS-1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, HPS-2 I47G/T48 is cleaved primarily to VMLKKK, the co-product corresponding to ‘Aβ49’, and the formation of this product is increased by approximately three-fold. Thus, the effect of this double-glycine mutation in HPS-2 is closely similar to its effect in APP γ-secretase substrate. Apparently, a similar helical destabilization near the ε cleavage site in this synthetic substrate enhances substrate recognition and proteolytic processing by γ-secretase.

Proteolytic products from second-round designed helical peptide substrates HPS-4, -5, and -6.

Proteolysis of initially designed HPS-1, -2, and -−3 by γ-secretase gave Aβ-like peptides ranging from ‘Aβ43’ to ‘Aβ49’. We sought to modify these synthetic substrates in a way that would favor further trimming to ‘Aβ40’ and ‘Aβ42’, corresponding to the principle secreted Aβ peptides in vivo and the major analytes in the study of Alzheimer’s disease. We reasoned that the most C-terminal Aib residue in HPS-1, -2, and -3 might hinder further trimming, as it is located at or near these trimming sites. Replacement of this Aib residue with the corresponding amino acid in the APP TMD sequence might allow the helix unwinding needed for γ-secretase to carry out the additional trimming steps to produce ‘Aβ40’ from ‘Aβ43’ and ‘Aβ42’ from ‘Aβ45. At the same time, we hoped that the closer similarity to APP substrate would result in a more physiological preference at the ε cleavage site in favor of ‘Aβ49’-type cleavage over ‘Aβ48’-type cleavage. Thus, HPS-4 was designed by replacing Aib42 in HPS-1 with alanine, HPS-5 was designed by replacing Aib43 in HPS-2 with threonine, and HPS-6 was designed by replacing Aib44 in HPS-3 with valine (Fig. 4A). These three new helical peptide substrates were synthesized and subjected to incubation with γ-secretase as before.

We found that all three of the new synthetic substrates gave an overall profile of shorter Aβ-like products (Fig. 4B). Only ‘Aβ40’, ‘Aβ42’, and ‘Aβ43’ were observed from HPS-4. Longer Aβ-like peptides were not detected. For HPS-5 and HPS-6, Only ‘Aβ42’, ‘Aβ43’, and ‘Aβ45’ were found. Thus, all three of the newly designed synthetic substrates apparently undergo effective tripeptide trimming, to the point where longer Aβ-like peptides are not detected. To validate that this is the case and that the Aβ-like peptides were not formed through direct endoproteolysis, we analyzed the formation of AICD-Iike peptides and confirmed that only LVMLKKK and VMLKKK, co-products corresponding to ‘Aβ48’, and ‘Aβ49’, respectively, were produced. Quantification of these AICD-Iike products as before revealed that HPS-4 and HPS-5 were cleaved by γ-secretase preferentially at the ε site leading to the more physiological ‘Aβ49’ pathway. Although ε cleavage for HPS-6 was similar at the two sites, giving LVMLKKK and VMLKKK in roughly equal levels, processing was still shifted in favor of the ‘Aβ49’ pathway in comparison to the parent peptide HPS-3 (Fig. 4C, cf. Fig. 2D). Thus, the replacement of the most C-terminal Aib residue had the desired effects on shifting ε-site selection and enhancement of tripeptide trimming for all three second-round peptides. For unequivocal validation of tripeptide trimming, we further analyzed HPS-4 proteolysis by γ-secretase and detected all of the expected tripeptide products by LC/MS (Fig. 4D). More detailed kinetic analysis of HPS-4 as a substrate revealed a Km of 12.2 +/− 0.3 μM and kcat of 0.21 +/− 0.02 min−1 (Fig. S2). In comparison, analysis of γ-secretase cleavage of recombinant APP-based substrate C100Flag gave a Km of 0.51 +/− 0.07 μM and kcat of 0.10 +/− 0.02 min−1. Thus, HPS-4 apparently has reduced affinity for the protease (insofar as Km can be used as an approximation for affinity) compared to APP substrate, while HPS-4 may be processed faster once bound. For both synthetic peptide and recombinant substrate, the turnover rate is extremely slow, a general characteristic of intramembrane proteolysis.40

Conformational analysis of synthetic substrates.

We had previous demonstrated the helical conformation of Aib-containing peptide γ-secretase inhibitors through circular dichroism and further showed that inhibitory potency is dramatically reduced through disruption of helicity.34, 35 CD analysis was also performed for the second-round designed peptides HPS-4, HPS 5, and HPS-6. CD spectra were obtained with each of the peptides dissolved in methanol. Trifluoroethanol (TFE) is more commonly employed as solvent; however, TFE stabilizes helical conformations, and we sought to avoid biasing the CD analysis in this way. For this same reason, we had previously used methanol for CD analysis of Aib-containing helical peptide inhibitors of γ-secretase.34, 35 Initial attempts using γ-secretase assay buffer resulted in noisy spectra, likely due to the high concentration of CHAPSO detergent.

All three peptides showed a strong negative peak at 222 nm and a weak shoulder in the 208-212 nm region (Fig. 5), peaks consistent with a helical conformation. However, the characteristic strong positive peak at 190 nm was not observed, suggesting the presence of substantial degrees of random coil conformation, which displays a strong negative band in this region. Indeed, using the program k2d to determine degrees of different secondary structures based on these CD spectra31 revealed considerable random coil conformation for all three peptides (Fig. 5). The degree of β-sheet conformation was relatively low, as expected. These CD results suggest that the Aib-containing peptide substrates achieve partial helical conformation but with considerable random-coil character. The Aib residues do appear to minimize β-sheet conformations, likely explaining their favorable solubility properties for testing as substrates for γ-secretase. Further confirmation for helical character was obtained for HPS-4 by 2D rotating-frame Overhauser spectroscosy (ROESY) NMR. This spectrum showed cross peaks of NH-αH hydrogen bond interaction of (i, i+3) and (i, i+4) residues, which is indicative of helical structure (Fig. S3; Table S3). Some (i, i+2) crosspeaks were also observed, although these were mostly of very weak intensity.

Effects of APP FAD mutations on the preferred ε cleavage site of synthetic helical peptide substrates and trimming of Aβ-1ike products.

We sought to test the potential of employing these synthetic substrates for the study of FAD by installing two FAD mutations found in the APP TMD: V44A and I45F. We chose these two in particular because they have opposite effects on the preferred site of ε proteolysis by γ-secretase. The V44A mutation skews ε cleavage toward the Aβ48 pathway, while the I45F mutation shifts ε cleavage toward the Aβ49 pathway even more than that seen with wild-type APP.32 We synthesized V44A and I45F mutant versions of HPS-4, HPS-5, and HPS-6 (Fig. 6A), and compared the quantitative production of AICD-Iike fragments by γ-secretase for each mutant peptide to its respective parent peptide.

In each of the three cases, the FAD mutants had the same effects on ε-site preference as observed with APP substrate: V44A skewed formation toward LVMLKKK, co-product of ‘Aβ48’, compared to the parent synthetic peptide substrate, while I45F skewed production of VMLKKK, coproduct of ‘Aβ49’ (Fig. 6B). However, HPS-4 is apparently the closest mimic of APP substrate. Cleavage of mutant version HPS-4 V44A by γ-secretase led to a clear decrease in the Aβ49-like pathway compared to the ‘wild-type’ HPS-4. In contrast, γ-secretase processing of HPS-4 I45F resulted in a substantial decrease in the Aβ48-like pathway compared to HPS-5. Overall, HPS-4 best represents natural APP substrate with respect to preferred ε cleavage site, effective trimming all the way to ‘Aβ40’, and giving similar shifts in ε cleavage site with two different FAD mutations from APP TMD.

We also examined the Aβ-like peptides formed from these FAD-mutant versions of HPS-4, -5, and -6 by γ-secretase. In each case, we observed longer Aβ-like peptides that were not seen with the parent peptides. Incubation of V44A- and l45F-mutant variants of HPS-4 with γ-secretase led to detectable ‘Aβ45’, ‘Aβ46’, ‘Aβ48’, and ‘Aβ49’ (Fig. 6C), N-terminal cleavage products that were not observed with the ‘wild-type’ HPS-4. The V44A and I45F mutations inhibit the trimming of Aβ48 and Aβ49 that otherwise occurs effectively to give only ‘Aβ40’, ‘Aβ42’, and ‘Aβ43’ with parent peptide HPS-4 (cf. Fig. 4B). Similar effects were seen with V44A and I45F mutation of HPS-5 and HPS-6: Whereas no Aβ-like peptides longer than ‘Aβ45’ were observed with either parent peptide, ‘Aβ46’, ‘Aβ48’ and ‘Aβ49’ were observed with the FAD-mutant peptide substrates (Fig. S4).

Effect of replacing the third Aib in HPS-4 with the corresponding APP TMD residue.

Processive proteolysis of APP substrate also produces small levels of Aβ37 and Aβ38, and small-molecule γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that decrease Aβ42 or Aβ40 simultaneously increase Aβ38 or Aβ37, by stimulating the conversion of Aβ42→Aβ38 or Aβ40→Aβ37. Therefore, we synthesized HPS-7, identical to HPS-4 but with the third Aib residue replaced with the corresponding residue (Gly) in the APP TMD. This replacement might permit further trimming to give Aβ37 and Aβ38. Surprisingly, HPS-7—with only two Aib residues—maintained sufficient solubility in enzyme assay buffer to allow testing as a substrate for γ-secretase. Incubation with the enzyme and LC/MS analysis revealed that HPS-7 is cleaved at the two natural ε sites to produce AICD-Iike peptides, but Aβ-like peptides ‘Aβ37’ and ‘Aβ38’ were now observed in addition to ‘Aβ40’ and ‘Aβ42’ (Fig. S5). ‘Aβ43’ was not detected, but a small amount of ‘Aβ41’ was seen. Further efforts to characterize and validate this peptide substrate are underway to explore the potential of HPS-7 as a functional probe for the effects of GSMs.

Discussion

For over 25 years, the study of Aβ production in Alzheimer’s disease has primarily focused on Aβ40 and Aβ42, because Aβ40 is the principle Aβ peptide secreted from cells and the aggregation-prone Aβ42 is the principle component of amyloid plaques.21 The relatively recent awareness of the complex proteolysis of APP substrate by γ-secretase, however, suggests that more comprehensive analysis of the proteolytic products would be critical for advancing understanding of Alzheimer pathogenesis. This is especially true for FAD, in which dominant mutations in the substrate (APP) and enzyme (PSEN1, PSEN2) that produce Aβ result in disease onset in midlife or earlier, with complete penetrance in most cases.28

The comprehensive analysis of the proteolytic processing of APP by γ-secretase, however, is challenging. Aβ peptides longer than 43 amino acids are difficult to detect by mass spectrometry, and no specific ELISAs have been reported for them. At present, the only way to detect these long Aβ peptides is through long, hand-cast urea-PAGE systems,17, 30 which are tedious, time-consuming, and difficult for quantification. Much of the problem stems from the poor solubility of Aβ peptides as well as the APP substrate, which contains the entire Aβ sequence. To address this problem and develop convenient functional probes for γ-secretase, we designed synthetic helical peptide substrates based on the APP TMD.

The installation of helix-inducing Aib residues in the N-terminal half of the APP TMD sequence is the key feature of these functional probes. With Aib residues aligned along one face of the helix, APP residues are arrayed along the rest of the helix and available for interaction with γ-secretase. The C-terminal region of the peptide is devoid of Aib residues and free to unwind and insert into the enzyme active site, setting up endoproteolytic ε cleavage and allowing subsequent carboxypeptidase trimming. Despite their installation along one helical face in the N-terminal half of the designed peptides, the Aib residues may nevertheless directly interact with the protease, alter interaction by other parts of the APP TMD sequence, or alter the various proteolytic events. For instance, replacement of the β-branched Ile with Aib may have effects on the conformation that may influence interaction with and processing by the protease complex. However, as we discuss below, the proteolysis of these peptides, particularly HPS-4, by γ-secretase closely recapitulates the proteolytic processing of APP substrate. NMR and CD analysis show that these peptides assume a mixture of primarily helical and random coil conformations in solution. A degree of helicity as well as conformational flexibility are likely critical to the ability of these peptides to be recognized by γ-secretase and processed in a manner closely similar to endogenous APP substrate. Indeed, detailed NMR analysis of APP substrate in lipid micelles and bicelles by Sanders and colleagues has shown that the APP TMD is a flexible helix.41

LC/MS analysis confirmed that these new synthetic helical peptide substrates are cleaved by γ-secretase at the same ε sites as APP substrate and that long Aβ-like peptide products are then trimmed. Mutation of these substrates with phenylalanine demonstrated that, like APP substrate, they cannot be cleaved by γ-secretase where this bulky aromatic residue is in the P2’ position. Blocking a cleavage event with phenylalanine prevents formation of peptides further along the specific carboxypeptidase pathway, validating tripeptide trimming. Installation of a double-glycine mutation can stimulate ε cleavage and favor the ‘Aβ49’ pathway, as with APP substrate. Replacement of the most C-terminal Aib residue allows more efficient trimming of Aβ-like peptides, all the way to ‘Aβ40’, with detection of all expected tripeptides from HPS-4 providing unequivocal evidence that processive proteolysis occurs as it does for APP substrate. Finally, two FAD mutations with opposite effects on ε-site selection in APP substrate showed the same preferences when installed into helical peptide substrates.

Beyond these validating experiments, we further used these FAD-mutant substrates to probe for the effects of the mutations on the formation of longer Aβ-like peptide products from γ-secretase. We found that formation of longer Aβ-like products, absent when using the wild-type helical peptide substrates, were now detectable with both APP FAD mutations V44A and I45F. The I45F mutation increased ‘Aβ46’, consistent with the placement of phenylalanine in the P2’ position for the ‘Aβ46’→‘Aβ43’ conversion, which is not tolerated by γ-secretase. However, this mutation also led to detection of other long Aβ-like peptides not seen with the parent peptide substrates. Although the V44A mutation had the opposite effect from I45F on shifting the preferred ε cleavage site, V44A likewise caused increased long Aβ-like peptides by decreasing tripeptide trimming of ‘Aβ48’ and ‘Aβ49’. Our validating experiments notwithstanding, we cannot rule out possible effects of Aib installation on binding and processing of the APP TMD by γ-secretase. Indeed, to the degree that the substrates are artificial (e.g., replacing certain natural residues with Aib), their interactions with and processing by γ-secretase may differ from those of natural APP substrate. With this important caveat in mind, our findings suggest that longer Aβ peptides may be produced in FAD with these two APP mutations and raise the question of whether these peptides might play a role in FAD pathogenesis. Thus, the new helical peptide substrates point to alternative forms of Aβ peptides of 45-49 residues as candidate pathogenic entities in FAD, an idea first suggested by lhara and colleagues upon their initial discovery of long Aβ variants.17 Further investigation of this possibility would seem warranted. Taken together, the studies reported here support the utility of synthetic helical peptide substrates as functional probes for the study of proteolytic processing by the γ-secretase complex and how this processing is altered by FAD mutations.

Figure 1. Processive proteolysis by γ-secretase. The protease first carries out endoproteolysis (ε) near the cytosolic end of the TMD of APP substrate, with release of the intracellular domain (AICD). This is followed by carboxypeptidase cleavages of the remaining long Aβ peptides—in intervals of roughly three amino acids—to secreted peptides of 38-43 residues in length. Two general pathways for Aβ generation are Aβ49→Aβ46→Aβ43→Aβ40 and Aβ48→Aβ45→Aβ42→Aβ38.

(A) The transmembrane domain of APP (italicized), with Aβ production pathways shown as arrows and ε cleavage sites denoted by arrowheads. Helical peptide substrates (HPS) HPS-1, HPS-2 and HPS-3 contain α-aminoisobutyric acid (U) residues designed to arrange along three different faces of the APP TMD helix. All HPS are N-acetyl and C-amide. (B) Aβ-like N-terminal cleavage products from the HPS were observed by ESI/MS. The calculated and observed mass of the first ion in the doubly charged isotope clusters is denoted. (C) UPLC/MS chromatogram retention times of the observed Aβ-like N-terminal cleavage products from HPS-1. These peaks are absent when enzyme is not included in the incubation. (D) Quantitation of the AICD-like C-terminal fragments VMLKKK (co-product with ‘Aβ-49’) and LVMLKKK (co-product with ‘Aβ-48’) formed from ε-site cleavage of HPS peptides. S.D., n = 3.

Figure 3. Validating the cleavage mechanism of HPS peptides by γ-secretase.

(A) In HPS-1 I47F, production of ‘Aβ45’ is blocked; instead, ‘Aβ44’ is observed. In HPS-1 V50F, production of ‘Aβ48’ is blocked; instead, ‘Aβ47’ and subsequent tripeptide trimming to ‘Aβ44’ are observed. In HPS-1 T48F/V50F, production of both ‘Aβ46’ and ‘Aβ43’ is further blocked; instead, ‘Aβ47’ and ‘Aβ44’ are observed. (B,C) Helix-destabilizing mutation GG in HPS-2 near the ε site (I47G/T48G) increases proteolysis leading to AICD-like product VMLKKK, co-product with ‘Aβ49’. In HPS-1, however, this GG mutation does not show a clear effect. S.D., n = 3.

(A) The most C-terminal Aib in HPS-1, -2, and -3 was replaced with the corresponding wild-type amino acid of APP in the design of HPS-4, -5, and -6, respectively. (B) MS identification of N-terminal cleavage products generated from these peptides by γ-secretase reveals effective carboxypeptidase trimming to shorter Aβ-like products ‘Aβ43’, ‘Aβ42’, and ‘Aβ40’, with no Aβ-like products detected corresponding to ‘Aβ46’ and longer. Sites of ε cleavage, determined through identification of AICD-like C-terminal fragments, are denoted with arrowheads. (C) Quantification of the AICD-like C-terminal fragments VMLKKK (co-product with ‘Aβ-49’) and LVMLKKK (co-product with ‘Aβ-48’) formed from ε-site cleavage of HPS peptides. S.D., n =3. Mutating the most C-terminal Aib back to the wild-type residue results in shifting ε cleavage in favor of the ‘Aβ49’ pathway with HPS-4 and HPS-5, as seen physiologically with APP substrate. HPS-6 shows equal preference for both ‘Aβ49’ pathway and ‘Aβ48’ pathways, but still shifts toward ‘Aβ49’ in comparison with parent HPS-3 (cf., Fig. 2D).

(B) LC/MS quantification of AICD-like C-terminal products from HPS peptides and their FAD-mutant versions by γ-secretase. S.D., n = 3. HPS-4 mutants showed clear shifts similar to that seen with APP substrate. (C) MS identification of N-terminal cleavage products generated from FAD-mutant variants V44A and I45F of HPS-4 by γ-secretase reveals reduced carboxypeptidase trimming, as evidenced by the detection of long Aβ-like products ‘Aβ45’, ‘Aβ46’, ‘Aβ48’, and ‘Aβ49’, not seen with parent peptide HPS-4. Arrowheads denote site of ε cleavage determined by identification of AICD-like peptides.
