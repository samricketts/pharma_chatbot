pmcSex differences in the incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders have been known for decades. Syndromes as diverse as depression and Alzheimer’s disease are roughly twice as common in females than males, and anorexia nervosa occurs more than an order of magnitude more frequently in females. By contrast, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is fourfold more common in males, with schizophrenia showing a modest (40%) higher incidence in males. Despite these epidemiological data, it is only relatively recently that insight into the molecular bases of such sex differences is beginning to appear. This progress coincides with the 2016 National Institutes of Health mandate requiring that all National Institutes of Health–funded research consider sex as a biological variable. Prior to this mandate, most clinical investigators focused on male subjects or did not power studies to analyze each sex separately, while most basic laboratories studied male rodents only, reasoning that including females would require several-fold more animals and add too much complexity due to their estrous cycle. Notably, recent efforts suggest that female rodents are in fact not more variable than males (1–3), arguing against excluding females to limit experimental variability. In just 5 short years since the National Institutes of Health mandate, the results have been transformational, as an increasing number of publications have validated and added to a long-standing literature of sex differences in neuroscientific phenomena. The advent of next-generation sequencing approaches (e.g., the quantification of all RNAs expressed in a tissue or given cell type through RNA sequencing) has provided an important additional level of evidence for dramatic sex differences in the biological underpinnings of a range of neuropsychiatric syndromes. This special issue of Biological Psychiatry focuses on these recent transcriptomic datasets and the fundamentally new insights they are providing into the influence of sex on brain function under normal and pathological conditions. Launch of this special issue of Biological Psychiatry coincided with a Neuroscience Forum Workshop sponsored by the National Academies highlighting sex differences in transcriptomic characterization of brain and nervous system disorders (4).

Recent transcriptomic analyses of brain disorders underscore two general principles. First, they are providing molecular correlates for sex differences at other levels of analysis—mostly behavioral—that have been described for decades. For example, there are several reported sex differences in learning and memory, with males tending to outperform females in certain measures of classical fear conditioning and females generally outperforming males in operant conditioning tasks [reviewed in (5)]. Recent transcriptomics studies of the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory, point toward potential molecular underpinnings of these behavioral sex differences (6).

Second, and more surprisingly, transcriptomic data are revealing unexpected sex differences that are seen even when both sexes display mostly similar functional properties. Major depressive disorder (MDD), for example, is more similar in men versus women than it is different, with the same range of behavioral, neuroendocrine, and brain imaging abnormalities characterizing this heterogeneous syndrome, and with similar responses to diverse types of antidepressant treatments. Despite this concordance between the sexes, several transcriptomic studies find little overlap (&lt;10%) in the gene expression abnormalities observed across several brain regions in depressed females compared with depressed males (7–9). Importantly, studies in mice report a similar lack of overlap in chronic stress–induced changes in gene expression across brain regions in female versus male animals (7,10). Extensive bioinformatic analyses confirm that this lack of concordance in transcriptional pathology is not an artifact of baseline sex differences in gene expression. This accumulating evidence suggests that even when behavioral responses are similar between the sexes, the underlying molecular mechanisms can be different (i.e., compensation or latent sex differences), and it establishes that stress-related disorders are driven by primarily distinct underlying molecular mechanisms.

How can this be, since we know for instance that females and males display mostly similar responses to a range of antidepressant treatments, as noted above? First, even though transcriptomic data reveal little overlap, 10% overlap still corresponds to hundreds of genes similarly affected by MDD in females versus males. Second, even when different individual genes are affected, they sometimes represent the same biochemical pathways. Third, manipulation of a given gene in mice, even when it is abnormally expressed in only one sex in depressed humans, may exert similar antidepressant-like effects in both sexes. Nevertheless, there are also a growing number of examples of genes and biochemical pathways uniquely affected in depressed females or depressed males, which when manipulated in mice exert clear antidepressant-like effects in only the affected sex [e.g., (7)]. Articles in this special issue highlight this range of sex differences in transcriptomic profiles across a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders.

The special issue begins with several articles focused on sex differences in mood and anxiety disorders, with four review articles (11–14) and one primary research article (15). Girgenti et al. (11) discuss studies suggesting sex-specific transcriptional alterations across mood-related brain regions in subjects with posttraumatic stress disorder, highlighting evidence that men and women exhibit distinct alterations in GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acidergic) signaling and immune function. They also emphasize how integration of genome-wide association studies with transcriptomic data has shed light on mechanisms of putative risk genes in both men and women. Seney et al. (12) review evidence from large-scale transcriptomics studies indicating sex-specific alterations in men and women with MDD. Intriguingly, many of the sex-specific findings in the postmortem brain in MDD point toward GABAergic signaling and immune function, similar to posttraumatic stress disorder, potentially suggesting overlapping mechanisms across disorders. In their review, Rainville et al. (13) discuss how different stress models recapitulate specific patterns of transcriptional alterations observed in humans with MDD and that different forms of stress exert different effects on the brain. They also emphasize how not all sex differences are simply caused by gonadal hormones differences, highlighting roles for sex chromosome complement, as well as immune and epigenetic mechanisms. Parel and Peña (14) focus on the role of early-life stress in determining sex-specific adult transcriptional outcomes. Importantly, they note that sex differences in gene networks may promote sex differences in behavior, or that these networks may instead converge on the same functional or behavioral end point (i.e., compensation or latent sex differences). They also suggest main areas for future research on the effects of early-life stress, including additional human studies, investigations on the role of gonadal hormones, and the need to understand how early-life stress sex-specifically alters transcriptional dynamics across development. Finally, van der Zee et al. (15) provide evidence that SLIT1, a gene with reduced expression in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex of females but not males with MDD (7), regulates stress susceptibility in a sex-specific manner. Notably, reducing expression of Slit1 in the mouse ventromedial prefrontal cortex increases stress susceptibility in females only, with concurrent alterations in neuronal excitability and dendritic arborization.

Two primary research articles (16,17) discuss sex differences in psychotic disorders. Examining the brain transcriptome from more than 300 subjects with schizophrenia compared with more than 400 control subjects, Hoffman et al. (16) found no significant sex-by-disease interactions that survived correction for multiple testing, suggesting that any sex-specific alterations are of small effect size. However, after reducing the dimensionality of the data using gene coexpression analysis, several modules were enriched for sex-by-disease interaction genes, with pathway analysis pointing toward neural development and neuron projection. Using genetic data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and iPsych, Blokland et al. (17) assess genotype-by-sex interactions for schizophrenia, MDD, and bipolar disorder. Across disorders, they find genome-wide significance for a locus encompassing NKAIN2, a gene encoding a Na+/K+ transporter that controls neuronal excitability.

The next two articles, one a review (18) and the other a primary research article (19), focus on sex differences in addiction. In addition to reviewing the current rodent literature on acute and chronic alcohol consumption, Hitzemann et al. (18) reanalyze previously collected data with an eye toward any potential sex-specific effects on the brain transcriptome. Notably, across datasets collected from multiple laboratories, they find sex-specificity of transcriptional alterations associated with alcohol consumption, with many female-specific effects loading onto immune-related genes. In their primary research article, Walker et al. (19) examine the effects of adolescent social isolation followed by adult cocaine administration on the transcriptome across several addiction-related brain regions. They find that adult cocaine administration elicits sex-specific transcriptional alterations in the brain (despite similar cocaine preference in males and females), and that adolescent social isolation enhances these transcriptional sex differences.

Neurodevelopmental (20) and neurodegenerative disorders (21,22) are discussed in the next three review articles. In their review of the literature on ASD, Kissel and Werling (20) lay out a conceptual framework for how to tackle the study of sex differences in ASD, highlighting that 1) male–female comparisons of cases provide insight into etiology or symptoms of a disorder and 2) male–female comparisons of control subjects combined with case-control comparisons provide insight into sex differences in risk. They discuss evidence suggesting that control males are transcriptionally closer to subjects with ASD than control females, which is consistent with the male-biased incidence of the disorder. Guo et al. (21) then discuss the contribution of sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones to sex differences in Alzheimer’s disease. The authors highlight evidence from bulk tissue as well as cell type–specific transcriptomics, suggesting sex-specific alterations in Alzheimer’s disease related to neuroinflammation and bioenergetic metabolism. In their review, Lopez-Lee et al. (22) summarize the literature related to sex differences in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis (which involves a neurodegenerative component secondary to autoimmune destruction of myelin). Evidence across these disorders points to sex differences in both acute and chronic neuroimmune processes that may play into observed clinical and pathological sex differences.

The special issue concludes with three primary research articles (23–25) focused on sex differences in nondisease states. Tavares-Ferreira et al. (23) examine the transcriptome in mouse whole dorsal root ganglion as well as the translatome (i.e., RNAs being actively translated) in putative nociceptors. They find higher expression of Ptgds in females and report sex-specific behavioral responses after modulation of this enzyme, suggesting sex differences in response to prostaglandins. These features could contribute to sex differences in nociception and chronic pain syndromes. In monogamous prairie voles, Duclot et al. (24) find time- and sex-dependent transcriptional alterations in the nucleus accumbens after opposite sex pairing, implicating several systems involved in neurotransmission. In addition, they report that cohabitation results in male-specific alterations in mitochondrial dynamics. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex from healthy control subjects, Logan et al. (25) examine molecular rhythms of gene expression using a time of death analysis. They find sex-specific rhythmic genes, especially in the anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting female-specific rhythms in synaptic transmission in this brain region.

This evolving transcriptomic literature of neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and animal models—still in its early phases—is providing new information concerning the molecular mechanisms involved in the etiology and pathophysiology of these diverse syndromes. The work is assisting efforts to identify genome sequence variations that confer risk (or resilience) to a given disorder, with some variations likely doing so in a sex-specific manner. The sex-based transcriptomic data are also offering important directions for developing novel therapeutics for psychiatric and neurological syndromes, raising the specter of treatments targeting pathological processes uniquely in one sex or the other. These investigations represent exciting future directions in psychiatric research.
