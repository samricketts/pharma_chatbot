This secondary analysis examined 1) factors associated with willingness to participate in clinical research for cognitive health among individuals with cognitive impairment and their care partners and 2) concordance regarding such willingness between individuals with cognitive impairment and their care-partners (dyads). Neuropsychological factors and willingness to participate in clinical research were collected using the self-reported questionnaires. Participants’ sociodemographic and clinical information was extracted from the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center record. Binary logistic regression and Cohen’s kappa coefficient analyses were performed. Greater trust in medical researchers (p=0.031, B=0.127) and more severe cognitive impairment (p=0.009, B=−0.289) were associated with willingness to participate in clinical research among individuals with cognitive impairment. Dyadic agreement on willingness to have the patient enroll in clinical research was poor to fair (k=0.380). The findings of this study suggest that cognitively impaired individuals with greater trust in health professionals are more likely to agree to clinical research participation. Nurses and other health care providers who are counseling individuals with cognitive impairment and their care partners should work to build trusting relationships with participants and be mindful of how increased trust can alter power dynamics between participants and health care professionals.

Cognitive impairment
decision-making
research ethics’ clinical trial recruitment

pmcBACKGROUND

In the United States, cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affect 11% of people aged 65 years and older (Hudomiet et al., 2018). However, interventions for effectively treating cognitive impairment are limited, and no treatment has been identified to prevent or reverse cognitive impairment caused by Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). In roles ranging from principal investigators to study coordinators, nurses have been at the forefront of clinical research designed to mitigate the public health threat of late-life cognitive disorders. Conducting such research requires the participation of both individuals who are already experiencing symptoms of ADRD as well as those who are at risk for such conditions, whether by virtue of family history, advanced age, or biomarker status. Recruiting these individuals into clinical trials can be difficult in that a unique set of factors and challenges may affect receptiveness to research participation among both these individuals and their informal care partners, who are often required to co-participate by acting as collateral sources of interview-based assessments (Fargo et al., 2016; Lingler et al., 2006).

Across a range of health conditions, many factors have been found to influence participants’ willingness to enroll in clinical research. These factors include awareness and understanding of the research study (Byrne et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2011), presence or absence of monetary compensation (Byrne et al., 2014; Lara et al., 2005), level of trust of medical researchers (Bouida et al., 2016a; Brown &amp; Topcu, 2003; Byrne et al., 2014; Liu &amp; Li, 2018), care provider’s attitude towards clinical trials (Byrne et al., 2014), and demographic factors such as race, gender, age, and socioeconomic status (Brown &amp; Topcu, 2003; Byrne et al., 2014). While previous investigations provide important insights into the complex clinical research enrollment decisions, most involved adults in mid-life, and many were focused in oncology settings. Less is known about how these potential factors influence willingness to participate in clinical trials among individuals with impaired cognition.

There is a pressing need to examine the role of the above-described factors in the context of ADRD clinical research, while also taking into considerations that may be unique to ADRD research recruitment. For example, candidates for ADRD research often have multiple medical conditions rather than one significant illness (Grill &amp; Karlawish, 2010). In addition, this population is at risk for altered decision-making capacity (Karlawish, 2008), impaired communication abilities (Johnson &amp; Lin, 2014) and, relatedly, the need for surrogate consent to research (Kim, 2011). Although decisional capacity for clinical research may be an especially important factor influencing willingness to participate in clinical trials (Kim, 2011), research on this and related factors in individuals with cognitive impairment is lacking. No previous studies of research participation have focused directly on ADRD participants’ understanding of the research study, nor have researchers focused specifically on the cognitive profiles of potential participants. This investigation addressed the following aims:

Aim 1: To examine the associations between willingness to participate in a clinical trial and 1) neuropsychological factors, 2) other psychological factors (level of decisional capacity, trust, and hopefulness), and 3) demographic factors, among individuals with cognitive impairment.

Aim 2: To explore dyadic (participants/care partner) correspondence/agreement regarding willingness to participate in two types of clinical trials (less-invasive drug trial vs. surgery-involved trial) designed to improve cognitive function.

METHODS

Study design, sample, and settings

A quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive study of the willingness to participate in clinical research on ADRD was conducted as a secondary analysis of existing data from a sample of 134 individuals (30 individuals with intact cognition, and 52 dyads of individuals with cognitive impairment [herein referred to as patient and their caregiver]) recruited from the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) (Lingler et al., 2014). Details of the study design and participant recruitment have been previously described (Lingler et al., 2014). Briefly, eligible individuals had an ADRC consensus diagnosis of normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or early-stage dementia, defined for the purposes of the study as Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975) score of 16 or higher. Participants were community-dwelling; lived within a 50-mile radius of the University of Pittsburgh; were willing to participate; and had a primary care partner (e.g., family member or kin-like friend) who was also willing to participate, as indicated by the provision of informed consent. Since the current study focuses on cognitively impaired individuals, we excluded 30 (22.39%) cognitively intact individuals from the analysis. Two (1.92%) participants with cognitive impairment and their care partners were excluded from the final analysis because they did not complete one of the study questionnaires. Written informed consent to the study was provided by all participants in this sample with no proxy consent employed (Lingler et al., 2014).

Procedures

Both the parent study and the current study were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board Institutional Review Board. Each patient and care partner participant were presented with two hypothetical clinical trials aiming at delaying or stopping memory problems (vignettes) involving differing levels of invasiveness. These included one vignette (Vignette 1) describing an experimental drug trial and a second vignette (Vignette 2) describing a neurosurgery trial. These two vignettes describing such recruitment scenarios were developed specifically for use in the context of dementia research and have been used for over two decades (Sachs et al., 1994). Minor modifications were made to the scenarios to reflect current research, as reported in a previous publication (Lingler et al., 2014).

Details of the two vignettes are as follows:

Vignette 1:

This research involves the use of a new medication that may help memory problems or even stop the progression of dementia. This new medicine is given through a vein in the arm and must be administered in a hospital setting. Its main side effect involves redness or irritation at the site of the injection. Less common, but more serious side effects include possible liver problems and brain swelling, which can be life-threatening. If these side effects should happen, the medicine would be stopped, and you would be monitored with blood tests and brain scans until all symptoms went away. No one has suffered any permanent damage as a result of this medicine, but several people have experienced life-threatening illness while taking a similar experimental medicine. Participating in this study would involve up to 10 visits to the research hospital over a 6-month period.

Vignette 2:

This research involves the use of a new medication to try to treat or stop memory problems, but also involves surgery. For the surgery, a neurosurgeon would put a small container under the scalp of a person with memory problems that would release the new medicine directly into the fluid that surrounds the brain through a small hole made in the skull. A very small piece of brain tissue would be removed during this operation to help learn what has been causing the person’s memory problems. The risks of this surgery include a small risk of infection, bleeding, or worsening mental condition from the surgery as well as the possible side effects of the medicine later on. There is an even smaller chance of dying from the anesthesia and surgery. Participation in this study would involve staying overnight in the hospital for 2 days and coming to the research hospital for up to 10 visits to the research hospital over a 6-month period.

For both vignettes, participants were advised that each hypothetical study visit included a battery of memory testing, interviews, and blood work. They were advised that, hypothetically, if the research procedures resulted in an injury, emergency medical treatment for injuries solely and directly related to participation in this research study would be provided by the hospital.

Measures

Neuropsychological factors

Global cognitive function

Global cognitive function was assessed using the MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975), a 30-point cognitive impairment measuring tool that examines registration, attention and calculation, recall, language, ability to follow simple commands, and orientation, with higher scores reflecting better cognitive functioning.

Neuropsychological function

Neuropsychological function was measured using a battery of tests including the Boston Naming Test (BNT)(Calero et al., 2002) and the verbal fluency tests. The BNT measures ability to name line drawings of objects, for a total possible score of 60. To assess participants’ verbal fluency, both category (semantic) fluency and letter (phonetic) fluency tests were performed (Lezak, 1995). For category fluency, the participants were asked to list all of the animals they can think of within 60 seconds. Letters F, A, and S were chosen for the letter fluency and the participants were asked to name all of the words that begin with F, A, and S in 60 seconds for each letter.

Other psychological factors

Trust in medical researchers

Trust in medical researchers was measured using the Trust in Medical Researchers questionnaire (Hall et al., 2006) by asking participants to rank 12 positively and negatively worded statements (e.g., “I completely trust doctors who do medical research,” and “Medical researchers treat people like “guinea pigs.”) on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Reverse coding was applied for negatively worded items, such that total scores ranged from 12 to 60 and higher scores indicate more trust in medical researchers.

Hopefulness

The Herth Hope Index (HHI) (Herth, 1993) is comprised of 12 items to assess participants’ hopefulness. Participants were asked to answer each item on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree); total possible scores therefore can range from 12 to 48, with higher scores indicating more hopefulness.

Decisional capacity for each vignette of research studies

The 10-item University of San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC) (Jeste et al., 2007; Seaman et al., 2015) was used to assess the participants’ capacity to understand, appreciate, and make sense of each research study vignette. Scores for each item range from 0 (little or no understanding) to 2 (clear understanding); total scores can range from 0 to 20, with scores of greater or equal to 14 indicate an adequate decisional capacity for Alzheimer’s disease research (Seaman et al., 2015).

Sociodemographic factors

Patients and care-partners’ sociodemographic information, including age (in years), gender (male or female), education (&lt; 16 years or ≥ 16 years of education), race (Caucasian or African American), marital status (married/living with a partner or widowed/divorced/separated/never married), relationship to patient (spouse/partner, child, other relative, or friend/neighbor) were abstracted from the ADRC record.

Willingness to participate in each vignette of research studies

While each individual with cognitive impairment was asked to rate their willingness to participate in each trial, care-partner participants were asked to rate the patients’ willingness to participate in each vignette.

An investigator developed tool was designed to measure the possibility of participation using a 4-point Likert Scale that contains choices of “Not likely”, “Somewhat likely”, “Likely”, and “Extremely Likely” (Lingler, Rubin &amp; Saxton, 2010). Due to sparsely populated categories for the willingness to participate for each vignette, categories were collapsed. For this investigation for each vignette, willingness to participate in clinical research was dichotomized as 0 = “Not or somewhat likely” and 1 = “Likely or extremely likely to participate.”

Statistical analyses

All analyses were performed using IBM® SPSS® Statistics (version 25, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) with the level of statistical significance set at .05 for two-sided hypothesis testing. Descriptive and exploratory data analyses were first used to characterize the sample and to screen for any data anomalies (e.g., outliers, missing data, multicollinearity). Data were collected originally from 52 patient and 52 care partner participants; however, data from 2 (3.85%) patient participants were excluded from the analysis because those participants did not complete most of the key variable questionnaires. Thus, data from 50 patient and 50 care partners were used in this analysis. Of those 50 patients, 3 (6.0%) were missing for vignette 1 and 4 (8.0%) were missing for vignette 2 due to noncompletion of questionnaires. Primary reasons for noncompletion of questionnaires included health problems (e.g., feelings of fatigue or tired during the questionnaires) and issues that the participants did not want to answer the questionnaires. Our final sample sizes for predictive modeling were 47 and 46 for vignette 1 and vignette 2, respectively.

For each vignette we first used binary logistic regression with a single predictor variable to investigate the association between each predictor variable with participants’ willingness to participate in dementia research, yielding crude, unadjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. Possible predictor variables were identified based on research evidence and included age, sex, education, global cognitive function, neuropsychological function, capacity of understanding, trust in medical researchers, and hopefulness. In addition to education, predictor variables having bivariate associations with the willingness to participate in dementia research with p-values less than .20 were considered in the final multivariable modeling for each vignette. A less conservative p-value was used when screening for candidate predictors to insure that potential important predictors were not excluded in the modeling process due to nonlinearity or non-additivity. Continuous type predictors were evaluated for linearity in the logit of the probability of being willing to participate in dementia research using the Box-Tidwell approach. If nonlinearity was indicated, continuous type predictors were appropriately transformed. For Vignette 1 non-linearity in the logit was identified for the neuropsychological function measure of Letter F which was transformed using a quadratic polynomial function (with linear and quadratic terms). Two-way interactions between predictors were also considered to assess possible non-additivity from which no significant interactions were identified. The model likelihood ratio test was used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the overall model, and Wald tests were used to assess whether an individual regression coefficient was significantly different from zero. To identify a parsimonious set of predictors for each vignette, backward elimination was employed with a p-value to retain a predictor of p&lt;.10. For the final parsimonious models adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were reported.

Cohen’s kappa coefficient was used to examine the correspondence or agreement within each dyad between the patient’s willingness to participate and the care partner’s rating of the patients’ willingness to participate in each vignette. The agreement of willingness to participate was also examined to assess the consistency of the responses of the willingness to participate across the study vignettes within each dyad.

RESULTS

As reported in Table 1 patient participants (N=50) were on average 74.1 years of age, ranging from 43 to 91 years. About half were male (52.0%) and most were Caucasian (92.0%) and were married or living with a partner (86.0%). Most were well-educated, with 60.0% of patient participants having at least 16 years of education. Caregivers tended to be either the spouse or partner of the patient (84.0%), female (62.0%), Caucasian (92.0%), on average 70.2 years of age, with 52% having less than 16 years of education.

As shown in Table 2, regarding their willingness to participate in dementia research, patients endorsed being likely or extremely likely to participate in drug clinical trials (n=21, 42.1%) more so than participating in a surgical intervention (n=14, 28.6%). Binary logistic regression analysis with single predictor variable of patient’s willingness of being likely or extremely likely to participate in drug clinical trials (Vignette 1) identified lower scores on the Category Fluency Animal Test and UBACC, and higher scores on the TMR as statistically significant predictor variables (p&lt;.05). In addition, older age and lower scores on the BNT and MMSE were identified as screened candidate predictors (p &lt; 0.20) for consideration in multivariable binary logistic regression. For the probability of being likely or extremely likely to participate in a surgical intervention (Vignette 2), as shown in Table 3, female, lower scores on the Category Fluency Animal Test, MMSE, and UBACC were identified as statistically significant (p&lt;.05) and the BNT as an additional screened candidate predictor (p&lt;.20) for multivariable binary logistic regression.

Using binary logistic regression with backward elimination (Table 4) considering the candidate predictors for Vignette 1, we identified higher scores on the TMR (OR=1.136, 95%CI=[1.012, 1.274]) and a trend for lower scores for the Category Fluency Animal Test (OR=0.878, 95%CI=[0.769, 1.002]) as being independently related to the probability of the patient being likely or extremely likely in terms of their willingness to participate in the lower risk drug trial. Specifically, for every 1-point increase in TMR, the odds of being likely or extremely likely to participate in a drug clinical trial is estimated to increase 1.136 times. In contrast, for every 1-point increase in Category Fluency Animal Test, there was a trend for the odds of being not likely or somewhat likely to participate in a drug clinical trial is estimated to increase 1.139 times. For the willingness to participate in surgical trials, only MMSE (OR=0.749, 95%CI=[0.603, 0.930]) was identified as a statistically significant predictor based on a multivariable binary logistics regression with backward elimination. Specifically, for every 1-point increase in MMSE scores, the odds of being not likely or somewhat likely to participate in a surgical trial is estimated to increase 1.335 times.

In general, agreement was poor to fair across the patient’s responses regarding their willingness to participate in drug trials and surgical trials (κ=.380). For the 32 dyads having both patient and care partner responses, agreement within the dyad across the patient and care partner was very poor for both the willingness to participate in drug trials (κ=−0.125) and surgical trials (κ=0.218), suggesting that responses from family members and patients are not similar in their willingness to participating in either type of dementia research trial.

DISCUSSION

In this sample of individuals with cognitive impairment, either neuropsychological or other psychological factors were associated with hypothetical clinical trials for the purpose of further cognitive impairment. Specifically, while participants who had higher levels of trust in medical researchers were more willing to participate in a clinical drug trial, those who had more impaired cognitive function were more willing to participate in a higher risk neurosurgical trial, a neurosurgery to delay or prevent further cognitive changes.

In both Vignettes 1 and 2, participants’ willingness to participate in clinical research depends on the neuropsychological factors (i.e., global cognitive function and language function) and other psychological factors (i.e., trust in medical researchers). There are two possible explanations for the findings related to neuropsychological factors. First, our cognitively impaired participants are insightful as participants with inadequate comprehension of the study were excluded. This suggests that participants with lower cognitive functioning are more willing to enroll in clinical research because they may perceive themselves as more in need of interventions. A further study is needed to confirm this finding as we included a small sample size in this analysis. Trust in medical researchers is another factor that predicts participants’ willingness to enroll in research in this sample. This is consistent with previous study findings in other populations (Bouida et al., 2016b; Brown &amp; Topcu, 2003; Byrne et al., 2014; Liu &amp; Li, 2018). Comparably, another study aimed to determine factors influence older adults’ decision on non-beneficial Alzheimer’s disease research and concluded that trust in health care system was associated with willingness to enroll in research (Karlawish et al., 2009). Results of the current study affirm the pressing need to harness trust in medical researchers in the vulnerable populations with cognitive impairment. However, our finding that persons with ADRD may be vulnerable to more readily agreeing in risky research, suggests that ADRD research teams should take extra care to honor and protect the trust relationships that they develop.

These findings suggest that nurses and other health care providers who work in gerontological settings need to be mindful of the possibility that trust in medical researchers may be influencing enrollment decisions and making participants vulnerable to therapeutic misconception. This possibility is compounded by the fact that ADRD are incurable conditions. According to the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, therapeutic misconception occurs when a research participant believes that the purpose of a clinical trial is to benefit the participant rather than to inquire about knowledge for scientific development (Commission, 2001).To minimize the risk of therapeutic misconception, a balanced presentation about risks and benefits of the study is needed: the purpose of the study and the roles of individual participants and care partners should be made clear by researchers and nurses, and the role of the research team members should be clearly distinguished from that of clinical care providers. While this study did not directly measure therapeutic misconception, our findings of a greater willingness to enroll in research among more impaired individuals suggests that research teams, including nurses, should assess for the phenomenon and be prepared to provide education and clarification where necessary to correct such misconceptions.

Ability to understand the study was not one of the factors related to participants’ willingness to participate in research studies in the final model. A possible explanation is that, as a basic understanding of the concept of perceived research burden was necessary to complete the study procedures, participants who did not show adequate comprehension of the study were excluded from participation (Lingler et al., 2014).

Agreement across patient and care partner dyads’ likelihood to enroll in vignettes 1 and 2 are both low. This is concerning given that care partners are often the same individuals who would be entrusted to act as proxy decision-makers if the person with ADRD progressed to a point where decisional incapacity precluded autonomous decision making about research enrollment. This finding of discrepant ratings suggests that proxy decisions may not always accurately represent patients’ desires/ patients’ willingness of enrolling in a potential research study. Previous studies focused on agreement on medical/clinical decision making between patients and proxy/surrogate have also suggested in an increased rate of decision discrepancy (Cox et al., 2019; Hare et al., 1992). Cox and colleagues investigated decision agreement on clinical trial enrollment decisions and concluded an overall fair agreement between participants and their study partners (k=0.35) (Cox et al., 2019). To reduce this decision discrepancy, especially in ADRD population, communications amongst the medical researcher, the patient and the proxy decision-maker about patient desire and wishes in advance, discussions that address the surrogate’s concerns, as well as information about the patient’s condition, prognosis, and treatment are imperative (Fetherstonhaugh et al., 2017; Vig et al., 2007).

Several limitations exist in the current analysis. Our small, self-selected sample consisted of 92% of Caucasian with high educational attainment who actively sought out treatment or support for their cognitive changes. This may not accurately represent individuals with cognitive impairment in the community. Larger, diverse populations should be included in future research to explore the potential roles of education and race in willingness to participate in clinical trials for cognitive health. Other factors should also be examined, such as health literacy and experience of discrimination and racism as such factors may affect the decision-making process among older adults with cognitive impairment (Han et al., 2020). Second, hypothetical scenarios were presented to participants instead of actual opportunities to enroll in actively recruiting trials, and as a result, real-life decisions of participants might not be captured. In addition, patient participants and care partners have already agreed to participate in the parent study and therefore their ratings of willingness to participate in clinical research may not accurately reflect the “real-life outcome.” In this secondary analysis, data on care partners were insufficient to analyze factors that influence their willingness to enroll their loved ones (patients) in the research study. Although the same factors may be relevant to the care partner involved in this study, future studies should explore clinical research participation from the care partner’s perspective.

Individuals with cognitive impairment are a potentially vulnerable study population. The findings from this study suggest that trust in medical researchers and neuropsychological function are independent predictors of patients’ willingness to participate in a clinical drug trial in our sample, and global cognitive function is an independent factor that predicts patients’ willingness to participate in high-risk research. With awareness of the potential role trust in medical researchers play, principal investigators, research staff, and nurses in gerontological settings should make efforts in building a trusting relationship with participants and preventing therapeutic misconceptions. For staff who are coordinators on protocols, additional attention should be paid to the population with impaired cognitive function and neuropsychological function when decisions regarding making protocols in recruitment for a research study are made. For nurses working in gerontological settings, their roles are important as they are the connection point between patients/care partners and researchers. Their role of clear communications with patients/care partners are extremely important to facilitate trust in health professionals and clear understandings of research studies. Thorough communication with patients and their proxy decision-maker in advance and address future decision-making is recommended for both researchers and nurses to reduce decision discrepancy.
