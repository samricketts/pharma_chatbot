Background/Objective:

It is unknown whether older adults at high risk of falls but without cognitive impairment have higher rates of subsequent cognitive impairment.

Design:

This was an analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal data from NHATS.

Setting:

National Health and Aging Trends Study, secondary analysis of data from 2011-2019

Participants:

Community dwelling adults age 65 and over without cognitive impairment

Measurements:

Participants were classified at baseline in three categories of fall risk (low, moderate, severe) using a modified algorithm from the Center for Disease Control’s STEADI (Stop Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries) and fall risk from data from the longitudinal National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). Impaired global cognition was defined as NHATS-derived impairment in either the Alzheimer’s Disease-8 score, immediate/delayed recall, orientation, clock-drawing test, or date/person recall. The primary outcome was the first incident of cognitive impairment in an 8 year follow-up period. Cox-proportional hazard models ascertained time to onset of cognitive impairment (referent = low modified STEADI incidence).

Results:

Of the 7,146 participants (57.8% female), the median age category was 75-80 years. Prevalence of baseline fall modified STEADI risk categories in participants was low (51.6%), medium (38.5%) and high (9.9%). In our fully adjusted model, the risk of developing cognitive impairment was HR 1.18 [95%CI: 1.08, 1.29] in the moderate risk category, and HR 1.74 [95%CI: 1.53, 1.98] in the high-risk category.

Conclusions:

Older, cognitively intact adults at high fall risk at baseline had nearly twice the risk of cognitive decline at 8 year follow up.

INTRODUCTION

Older adults with cognitive impairment are at a higher risk of falling but it is unclear if baseline fall risk has the ability to predict subsequent cognitive impairment1. Cognitive changes and factors that affect fall risk, such as gait speed, are more related than previously thought involving many similar brain processes and function 5. Motor changes may not only precede the onset of cognitive impairment, but may demonstrate progressive motor deterioration as individuals progress from normal cognition to dementia6, 7. Therefore, it is plausible that the concurrent changes observed with changes in mobility or cognition, may be related to each other, including the risk for future falls. Deterioration in cognition or mobility alone could inherently affect the other8.

To our knowledge, two studies have evaluated the question of whether gait speed in older adults predicts subsequent cognitive impairment. These two studies showed those with impaired gait speed had increased rates of new cognitive impairment at up to 6 year follow-up 13, 14. Another study showed that those with normal cognition and neurologic gait abnormalities (ie. Parkinsonian, spastic, frontal, neuropathic or hemiparetic gait as determined by a neurologist) were more likely to develop dementia, particularly non-Alzheimer’s dementia, within 6 years15. These studies have investigated the relationship between gait speed and gait abnormalities which are indirect measures of an individual’s potential fall risk. Examining an individual’s future fall risk using a fall risk algorithm and correlating it with the development of cognitive impairment to our knowledge, has not been evaluated.

STEADI is a tool developed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) designed to be used by primary care providers as a more coordinated approach fall risk assessment and as a resource for educational material for older adults regarding falls and fall risk4. STEADI includes an adapted evidenced-based gait and balance assessment algorithm that simplifies and streamlines the fall risk assessment. The algorithm uses falls or fall-related injuries, confidence, or a fear of falling, combined with objective physical performance measures of gait and balance. Individuals are then stratified into fall risk categories. We previously demonstrated that risk categories predict future fall risk and frailty16, 17. The aim of the current study was to evaluate if using a modified version of the STEADI algorithm’s ability to predict the risk for future cognitive impairment in older adults without cognitive impairment at baseline using 8 years of survey data.

METHODS

Study Design and Participants

This study was a secondary analysis of existing collected data. We identified participants ≥65 years old that were interviewed and followed over an 8 year period using the National Health and Aging Trend Study (NHATS) (baseline 2011).NHATS is an ongoing longitudinal study that annually interviews a nationally representative cohort of older adults in the United States, funded by the National Institute on Aging and administered by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. It oversamples non-Hispanic blacks and individuals older than 90 years of age to investigate trends in late-life functioning18. For the purposes of this analysis, eight waves of data were used from participants who entered the cohort in 2011 wave. The data collected reflected physical and cognitive health, social, physical environment and actualization of activities of daily living (http://www.nhats.org/sresearcher/nhats/methods-docuementation?id=user_guide). NHATS uses standardized assessments in addition to self-reported data to measure physical function.18. Round 1 data included 8,245 Medicare beneficiaries randomly subsampled from the Medicare enrollment database who were living in contiguous United States. Cognitive and physical assessments were performed in person by trained research staff in the homes of participants 19.

We excluded those with known cognitive impairment and those with unknown cognitive status at baseline (see study variables for definitions). Our study focuses on community-dwelling older adults therefore we also excluded nursing home residents (n=468) some of which had been excluded by other exclusion measures. The final sample size of the baseline cohort was 7146 participants.

The local Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth College and at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill exempted this study from review due to the de-identified nature of the data.

Study Variables

Our primary outcome was the presence of incident cognitive impairment over time. The combined outcome of cognitive impairment by combining the response to Alzheimer’s Disease-8, if available, with scores from each of the three cognitive domains (memory, performance on the clock drawing test, orientation). The AD-8 score was taken into consideration first; a score of ≥2 automatically classified participants into the ‘probably’ dementia category. If participant AD-8 score was unavailable, the individual domains were considered. The CDT was a surrogate for executive function (maximum score 5, cutoff of 1); the memory domain was determine by the combined score of immediate 10-word recall and delayed 10-word recall tests (maximum score 20, cutoff 3); and the orientation domain was calculated by the combined score of the date recall and president/vice-president naming tests (maximum score of 8, cutoff 3). Refusal or an inability to perform the test resulted in a score of zero.

For each of the three classifications, cognitive impairment was defined as 1.5 times the standard deviation below the mean score. Cognitive impairment in none of the domains was classified as ‘no dementia’; one domain as ‘possible dementia’; two or more domains as ‘probably dementia’. These were classified per the NHATS analytical guidelines (www.nhats.org/scripts/sampledesign) and Technical Paper #5. The combined dementia score was dichotomized with ‘possible dementia’ and ‘probable dementia’ into a single class, presence of cognitive impairment.

Fall Risk

Fall risk was assessed using an adapted version of the STEADI algorithm4, 17 based on our available data (Supplementary Figure 3), termed ‘modified’ STEADI algorithm. Participants were labeled as low risk for falls if they answered ‘no’ to all questions: “Have you fallen in the last year” “Are you worried about falling down” or “Do you feel unsafe standing or walking.” If they answered yes to at least one question, participants were further stratified by scores on physical functioning testing. We used the Four Stage Balance Test and Five Time Sit to Stand Test (FTSTS) to evaluate function. According to the Four Stage Balance Test outlined by the CDC, an older adult who is unable to hold a tandem stance for at least 10 seconds is at increased risk of falling 4. The FTSTS evaluates lower extremity strength and is associated with dysfunction in balance and mobility 20. Completion of less than 5 repetitions of sit to stand in 15 seconds is associated with increased risk of falling 21. If the participant completed both the Four Stage Balance and the FTSTS tests, they were stratified as low risk for falls. Alternatively, if they were unable to perform either of these tests participants were further stratified based on their response to the questions: “have you have multiple falls in the last year” or “have you broken a hip since age 50.” If they answered ‘yes’ to either question they were categorized as high risk while an answer of ‘no’ to both questions would categorize them as moderate risk. We considered participants who were ineligible for physical assessments due to pain, recent surgery, or lack of facilities to be missing respective physical measures.

Covariates

Demographic variables included self-reported age, sex, and education. We also assessed smoking status and race/ethnicity. Age was categorized in five-year increments from 65 to 85 and 85+. As age was considered a restricted variable, our approach was guided by previously published NHATS studies22, 23. Participants were classified “current”, “former”, or “never” smokers. We assessed physical activity based on yes or no response to “In the last month did you ever go walking for exercise?” We categorized race/ethnicity as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and Non-Hispanic other. Presence of chronic health conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, arthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes, lung disease, probable dementia, stroke non-skin cancer based were identified using a self-reported questionnaire.

Statistical Analysis

All continuous variables are represented as mean or β-coefficients ± standard errors and categorical variables are represented as counts (percent). We estimated the distribution of demographic and health-related variables in the analytic sample and compared these characteristics across fall risk categories using chi-square tests for categorical variables and ANOVA for continuous variables. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of cognitive impairment, with cognitive outcomes and tests binarized in accordance with established NHATS guidelines. Our referent variable was individuals at low modified-STEADI fall risk. Cox’s proportional hazards model was used to estimate incident cognitive impairment hazard ratios with respect to the fall risk categories. Model 1 was unadjusted; Model 2 was adjusted for sociodemographic factors (age group, race/ethnicity, sex, education); Model 3 included model 2 additionally adjusted for chronic health conditions (heart disease, hypertension, arthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes, lung disease, stroke, cancer). We modeled time-to-event as continuous, though we acknowledge that because NHATS performs data collection on a yearly basis, incident cognitive impairment is best characterized as interval-censored data. However, given the number of follow up years and the inherent imprecision and variability in cognitive assessment, we expect that a standard Cox proportional hazards model serves as an adequate approximation.

We also looked at the association of fall risk with cognitive performance longitudinally using linear mixed effect modeling. Here, we modeled the various cognitive domains and individual cognitive tests as continuous outcomes, with the intercepts for individual respondents as random effects which accounts for the non-independence of the repeated measures in our survey data.

All analyses were done using R version 3.5.2 (www.R-project.org). Data wrangling was conducted using tidyverse (v. 1.2.1) and linear mixed effects modeling with package lme4 (v. 1.1.20) and ImerTest (v. 3.1.0). A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

Of the 7,146 participants, 57.8% were females and median age category was 75-80 years. The majority of the participants were non-Hispanic whites (Table 1). Based on the modified-STEADI criteria 3,685 (51.6%), 2,753 (38.5%), and 708 (9.9%) individuals classified as low, moderate and high fall risk, respectively. Participants with high fall risk were more likely to be females, older, have more comorbidities and decreased physical activity. Smoking was not shown to be affected by modified-STEADI fall risk classification.

The adjusted hazard of an individual in the moderate and high risk categories developing cognitive impairment (Model 3) were 18% and 74% higher than that of an individual identified as being of low fall risk, respectively (HR 1.18 [95% CI: 1.08-1.29] and HR 1.74 [95% CI: 1.53, 1.98]). Full results of all modeling are presented in Table 2.

Table 3 reports the difference in mean categories between the medium and high-risk fall groups and the low risk referent group. This shows the relationship between fall risk categories and cognitive score in both the medium and high-risk groups to be significant in all cognitive subdomains. Additionally, both the medium and high-risk category were significantly associated with the combined cognitive score, results that are in agreement with our time-to-event analyses.

Figure 1 depicts the 1-Kaplan-Meier curve to cognitive impairment stratified by modified-STEADI fall risk categories, showing the higher rates of cognitive impairment in respondents in higher initial fall risk categories using model 3 data. Kaplan Meier curves for model 1 and 2 data can be found in the supplementary figures 1 and 2 respectively.

DISCUSSION

Our results show that older adults with normal baseline cognition who are at high fall risk have a 74% higher risk of developing cognitive impairment as compared to their low fall risk peers over an 8 year period of time.

Motoric cognitive risk syndrome is a recently defined concept suggesting a “pre-dementia syndrome” and consists of the presence of mild cognitive impairment and slower gait speed in older adults24. This geriatric syndrome is highly predictive of future risk of dementia more so than either gait speed or mild cognitive impairment alone; testing this hypothesis has shown that motor decline defined by gait speed accelerates up to 12 years before mild cognitive impairment is even detected25. Lower gait speed is associated with a higher risk of falling26 while gait speed and falling are different, but related constructs, our analysis advances the science by suggesting a relationship with cognitive impairment, evoking the possibility of a bi-directional relationship with a modified fall risk algorithm. Future studies can now examine if the use of a modified STEADI algorithm coupled with a formal and validated cognitive tool such as Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)2 or Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE)27 may improve the predictive capability for future cognitive decline while concurrently evaluating an individual’s fall risk.

Fall risk is linked to multiple organ systems and overall health and function 28 suggesting that multiple factors are likely contributing to the increased rate of cognitive decline in those at higher fall risk. It has been shown that slower gait speed at baseline may be associated with greater cognitive decline with the most effect seen in the subdomain of executive function14. Dual tasking in older adults may have more appreciable issues with gait and balance when asked to walk and perform a secondary task; this suggests a strong component of decline in executive function as a contributing factor29, 30. Executive function involves higher-order cognitive process that control and integrate our cognitive abilities, and when impaired, may lead to increased fall risk due to its effect on judgement and motor planning31, 32. Our findings provide emerging evidence that a modified STEADI algorithm could potentially help identify those at risk for incident cognitive decline.

Our study has a number of strengths including a large sample size and objective measures to define gait speed, balance, mobility and strength in stratifying participants into fall risk categories. We relied on NHATS’ standardized cognitive analysis which implements the Washington Dementia Screening Test (AD8) that has a positive predictive value of &gt;85% and negative predictive value of &gt;70% for identifying cognitively impaired participants 42. The AD8 combined with the Mini-Cog greatly enhances the ability to capture early cognitive change 43. Using the validated STEADI tool and applying it to NHATS in our modified form has been well validated in our previous studies adapting the algorithm to existing survey data requiring some modifications and simplifications however as shown previously still resulting in a strong association between risk categories and falls 16, 17. STEADI suggests Timed Up and Go (TUG) testing in addition to strength and balance testing; however, other than physical assessment measures, all data was otherwise self-reported. STEADI further stratifies patients based on injury, yet NHATS only categorizes injury based on a history of hip fracture therefore other injuries acquired from past falls could have stratified some patients differently among moderate and high fall risk groups.

This study has several limitations. First, as with any survey analysis, we recognized selection bias. Second, our analysis did not adjust for factors that could be mediators rather than cofounders for the future development of cognitive impairment (e.g., mobility restriction, polypharmacy or hospitalization). While such factors may be associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment, our study objective was to determine whether baseline risk predicted future impairment. This was in contrast to ascertaining cognitive trajectories or to ascertain potential mediators, which could be evaluated in future studies. The long follow-up in NHATS provides an opportunity for a future analysis. Third, in addition, NHATS relies on considerable self-report data, and the interval nature may lead to inaccuracies between survey years. Our data also does not adjust for our baseline dependent variable of cognitive function as may reduce some biases, but may introduce other biases that maybe more detrimental to the outcome itself 44. Fourth, elements of social or occupational function may also impact cognitive trajectories and future studies should be considered to evaluate these mediating effects. Last, we relied on the NHATS definitions for cognitive impairment rather than standardized tools such as the MMSE or MOCA.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a relationship between elevated fall risk and incident cognitive impairment in those free of cognitive dysfunction at baseline. While our findings are suggestive, future longitudinal cohort studies are needed to validate such findings to ascertain the ability of STEADI to act as a marker for neurodegenerative or vascular pathologies preceding formal cognitive decline.

┼ Combined Dementia – combination of Alzheimer’s Disease-8 score or Washing University Dementia Screening Test (AD8) + 3 domains (memory, orientation, executive). Each individual domain binarized based on NHATS cutoffs (0 = not impaired, 1 = impaired). If AD8 score not present, individual domain scores summed – dementia defined as impairment in any domain (summed score 1, 2 or 3). Executive function consists of clock drawing test; Memory domain (immediate word recall, delayed word recall). Orientation consists of date recall and president/vice president naming.

Key Points

Older adults with an increased fall risk have a higher risk of developing future cognitive decline.

The STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths and Injuries) fall risk algorithm can possibly predict the risk for future cognitive impairment in older adults in addition to determining fall risk.

Reduced mobility and cognition are geriatric syndromes both associated with increased functional decline, mortality, and hospitalization.

Why does this matter?

There is a relationship between current fall risk and future cognitive decline. This allows future studies to look at how we can use this relationship to improve screening and inevitably patient outcomes with interventions aimed at improving both syndromes.
