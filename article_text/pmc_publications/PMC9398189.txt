Background:

Connected speech-language (CSL) has been a promising measure of assessing cognitive decline in populations at-risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) populations. A common way to obtain CSL is through using picture description tasks such as the most frequently used image Cookie Theft (CT). However, questions have been raised about using CT for diverse communities. Little is known about the CSL produced in response to this task in Black/African American (BAA) adults aged 48–74.

Goals:

The present study’s goals were to characterize CSL in BAA adults by sex and APOE-ε4 status from Milwaukee in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP) study when presented with the CT picture description task and to identify differences in CSL output between BAAs and non-Hispanic Whites (NHW).

Methods and Procedures:

We collected CSL samples from the CT picture from 48 BAA participants and 30 NHW participants from the WRAP participants in Milwaukee, WI group. CSL was analyzed using chi-square tests, T-tests, and ANCOVA. Linear mixed effect regression models were used to determine the association between cognitive status and longitudinal CSL in BAA participants with more than 1 timepoint.

Outcomes and Results:

Declines in CSL of BAA participants were associated with subtle declines in cognition. Among BAA participants, we found no significant differences in speech measures in terms of sex and APOE-ε4 status. Our results showed no significant differences in speech measures between BAA and NHW groups.

Conclusions:

CSL analysis provides an inexpensive way to evaluate preclinical changes in cognitive status that may not be as affected by other factors, such as ethnocultural background. Future studies with larger sample sizes and participants from other geographic locations can clarify these findings.


pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) persist as a critical health burden internationally affecting all races and ethnicities at unprecedented rates. The number of persons with ADRD is projected to triple by 2050 (WHO, 2019). Although research on aging and related conditions increased recently because of significant growth in people living over age 85, significant research gaps exist regarding aging research for minority groups, including ADRD research (Neugroschl et al., 2016; Babulal et al., 2019). Black/African Americans (BAA) have greater risk of developing ADRD than non-Hispanic whites (NHW), and greater exposure to socio-economic disadvantage may increase this risk for developing ADRDs (Gilmore-Bykovskyi et al., 2019; Steenland, et al., 2016). The projected increase in persons with ADRDs, coupled with elevated risk of developing ADRDs among BAA and other underrepresented populations, necessitates accurate and culturally appropriate measurements to assess cognition. Because evidence shows that Alzheimer’s disease pathology begins 15 to 20 years in advance of clinical signs (Sperling et al., 2011), it is imperative to detect cognitive decline as early as possible, when therapies are most likely to be effective. However, studies indicate that BAA perform lower on cognitive measures than NHWs, leading older BAA to be more frequently identified as cognitively impaired than NHW (Morgan et al., 2008). Specifically, studies have shown that BAA perform lower at baseline than NHW on typical standardized tests designed to measure cognitive decline, including tests of naming (Lichtenberg et al., 1994; Ross et al., 1995; Boone et al., 2007), reading (Manly &amp; Jacobs, 2002; Morgan &amp; Marsiske, 2008), and dementia test batteries (Ripich, 1997; Welsh et al., 1995). These differences in cognitive level have been attributed to many factors, such as test-bias, BAA negative attitudes towards cognitive testing stemming from historical trends in research mistreatment, and skewed norming, i.e., neuropsychological tests were not normed on the general population (McKay &amp; Doverspike, 2001; Mehta et al., 2004). Weuve et al. (2018) examined a longitudinal cohort of over 10,000 adults, 60% of whom were black, in order to estimate both cognitive level and rate of cognitive decline in terms of racial differences. The authors found that despite differences in dementia risk between groups (BAA participants’ incident AD risk was twice that of NHWs), rates of cognitive decline were not faster among BAA participants (Weuve et al., 2018). Because the rates of decline were not different between BAAs and NHWs in this study yet the risk of incident AD in BAAs persisted, it is imperative to understand the contribution of test biases as well as to develop new measures that adequately represent cognitive function.

A body of evidence in cognitive aging shows that reading level, a proxy for educational quality, accounts for a sizeable proportion of racial group differences in neuropsychological test performance (Manly et al., 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005). Nonetheless, reading measures such as the reading subtest of the Wide-Range Achievement Test-3 (WRAT-3, Wilkinson et al., 1993) likely do not account for all of the sociocultural contributions to racial group differences in cognitive test performance (Morgan et al., 2008). As a result, test performance differences at baseline may cause misdiagnoses and inappropriate or inadequate intervention for BAAs. Although understanding the factors that may or may not contribute to racial disparities on long-standing neuropsychological tests are important, it is also crucial that culture-fair, performance-based measures are implemented which are individualized and capture within-person changes in cognitive performance (Barnes &amp; Bennett, 2014).

One such potential performance-based measure is connected speech-language (CSL). CSL samples are audio-recordings of casual, conversational language which can be analyzed according to linguistic and acoustic features as a measure of cognitive processes. CSL analysis is a staple in many domains of speech-language pathology assessment and treatment, as it affords a functional assessment of communication in context. CSL is often used in addition to standardized tests of language and cognition in order to present a more complete picture of the patient’s strengths and needs, both as a baseline assessment and as a way of monitoring change. In fact, CSL has been shown to be the most robust representation of declines in spoken language in persons with primary progressive aphasia, a disease in which declines in language are the primary feature (Rogers &amp; Alarcon, 1998).

The advantages of CSL for diverse populations are numerous. First, CSL is a performance-based measure that provides an inexpensive and relatively easy method to evaluate changes in cognition over time. CSL lends itself well to remote collection via phone, smartphones or tablets because of built-in voice recording technology and the ubiquitous personal use of these devices, thus improving reach to underserved populations. Second, because change in CSL over time is likely the most robust way to measure CSL for the purpose of identifying cognitive decline, the individual serves as their own baseline, thereby allowing level and slope to be examined individually. Third, CSL can provide an enhanced representation of language function within discourse (Joanette and Brownell, 1990) as opposed to the typical measures of language used in longitudinal ADRD studies such as single-word naming or verbal fluency tests.

CSL is often elicited by administering a picture description task, where the participant is asked to “tell me everything you see going on in this picture,” through open-ended questions, such as “tell me about the best day of your life (Gayraud et al. 2011),” through describing a procedure (“tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich;” Fromm et al., 2016), or by retelling a familiar story (“tell me all you can remember about the story of Cinderella;” Toledo et al., 2018). Depending upon the population being studied, these tasks often involve minimal time commitment for the participant, yet a multitude of linguistic and non-linguistic measures can be obtained from the recorded CSL. Because language changes are evident even at the earliest stages of cognitive decline, including in the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage, there is growing interest in using CSL as a performance-based measure for assessment, disease monitoring, and as a measure of response to treatment in clinical trials (Snyder et al., 2014)

Although there is a strong body of evidence analyzing CSL in patients with aphasia because of stroke (McCarron et al., 2017; Yorkston &amp; Beukelman, 1980), and in primary progressive aphasia (Wilson et al., 2010; Croot et al., 2015), evidence is more recently accruing regarding CSL as a measure of cognitive decline in persons with or at risk for ADRD. In most existing studies examining CSL in the context of ADRD, picture description tasks are the most commonly utilized method of eliciting CSL, with the largest body of evidence using the Cookie Theft (CT) (Figure 1) picture from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (Goodglass et al., 2001; Boschi et al., 2017; Mueller et al., 2018a). Picture description tasks are often the method of choice in ADRD research, as the visible stimuli during the task can partially remove the confound of episodic memory impairments that are required for open-ended questions. Multiple studies have shown that the features from CSL most often associated with MCI and dementia include those that measure semantic and lexical content (Nicholas et al., 1985; Ahmed et al., 2013; Mueller et al., 2016; Sajjadi et al., 2012) and disruptions to fluency (i.e., filled and unfilled pauses, repetitions, etc.) (Berisha et al., 2015; Kavé &amp; Goral, 2018; Mueller et al., 2018a), while many aspects of syntax are thought to be preserved until later stages of dementia (Kemper et al., 1993; Ahmed et al., 2013). CSL research has also shown that the age of acquisition effect in word production is evident even in the early stages of AD (Forbes-Mckay et al., 2005). More recently, investigations of acoustic features of CSL showed differences in spectral characteristics and articulatory rhythm between participants with MCI and healthy controls (König et al., 2019; Meilán et al., 2020; Themistocleous et al., 2020).

While the body of evidence for CSL as a way of measuring cognitive decline in ADRD continues to grow (Clarke et al., 2020), there is a dearth of literature studying CSL in Black/African American adults or other minority populations in aging or in those with neurogenic communication disorders. Although some normative studies of CSL in aging adults exist, the participants’ ethnicities were either not reported or were homogenous (Forbes-McKay &amp; Venneri, 2005). Forbes-McKay and Venneri (2005) found that, in a sample of adults ages 20 – 90, there were no effects of sex, education or age on phrase length, paraphasias, or error monitoring. Education had a significant effect on measures such as grammatical form, “melodic line (a subjective measure of prosody),” information content, and pictorial themes. Reports on characteristics of BAA adults’ CSL from any region of the US is lacking, and whether or not there are significant sex, age, and literacy/education differences on any of the AD-sensitive CSL measures in BAA adults is unknown. Age, sex, education, and carriage of one or more copies of the APOE-ε4 genotype are significant risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease dementia; however, how these factors affect CSL in at-risk populations is largely unknown, especially in BAA adults.

Studies from our group have shown that, in a cognitively unimpaired cohort of 264 individuals from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP), a group of individuals at increased risk of AD, participants who were classified as declining in cognition showed more rapid declines in CSL over time. These declines were noted specifically in measures of semantic content (pronoun-to-noun ratio, content information units per total words) and speech fluency (filled and unfilled pauses, repetitions, and revisions) (Mueller et al., 2018b). This study was unique in that it was one of the first studies to examine CSL longitudinally, in the context of pre-clinical declines in cognition, before a diagnosis of MCI. One of the major limitations of that study was that the sample was comprised of 96% NHW individuals, thus limiting generalizability of results to other populations. As noted above, a major limitation of most of the studies examining CSL in ADRD is that the samples studied have been comprised of predominantly NHW individuals, with very little examination or representation of BAAs or people from other underrepresented groups (Fleming &amp; Harris, 2017; Kavé &amp; Goral, 2018). Because language use is highly variable and dependent upon multiple personal and environmental influences, including cultural differences (Tillman, 2002), understanding whether CSL findings generalize across languages, regions, and cultures is critically important in determining the utility of CSL as a screening or measure of cognitive decline in populations at increased risk for ADRD. In the present study, we aimed to determine if the findings from Mueller et al. (2018b) (that declines in CSL were associated with preclinical declines in cognition) could be replicated in a sample of BAA adults from the Milwaukee region of Wisconsin.

As mentioned above, the Cookie Theft (CT) is the most commonly studied method of elicitation of CSL in ADRD research. CT is a standardized image that was developed in 1972 as part of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE), which was designed to diagnose aphasias and related disorders (Goodglass et al., 2001). The image portrays a kitchen scene with the mother doing dishes wearing a dress and high-heeled shoes, and a boy and a girl stealing cookies from a cookie jar. Based on the characters’ attire and actions of the people in CT, anecdotal comments from participants include that it appears to take place in the “1950s or 60s” (Figure 1).

There is growing evidence that individual and contextual variables can affect performance on neuropsychological testing. Variables such as stereotype threat (Steele, 1997) and perceived discrimination (Barnes et al., 2012) of the examiner toward the examinee have demonstrated effects on neural processes (Krendl et al., 2008; Masten et al., 2011). Furthermore, research on examiner-examinee racial discordance has shown that perceived discrimination mediated the effects of racial discordance, resulting in worse performance on memory tests (Thames et al., 2013). However, very few studies have examined whether this same effect exists when the race/ethnicity of people depicted in test stimuli are discordant from the race/ethnicity of the test-taker. In one of the few studies to compare racial differences in speech production, Olness et al. (2002) compared speech production between 33 BAA adults with aphasia, 30 BAA adult non-injured controls, 29 NHW adults with aphasia, and 32 NHW non-injured controls when presented with a picture description task. They found no differences in the number of words spoken between the two populations when presented with picture description tasks. BAAs and NHWs similarly produced more speech when presented with picture sequence tasks in comparison to a single image (CT). The authors suggested that the reasons for similar performance between groups were because the pictures, such as CT, were of universal scenes with which participants were familiar. These results could indicate that the amount of speech production when presented with a picture description task does not differ between BAA and NHW participants, thereby supporting the use of picture description tasks as a less biased way to evaluate language (Olness et al., 2002). However, the results from this previous study are not generalizable to the general population because of the small sample size and the fact that these participants were persons living with aphasia. Given these research gaps, the characteristics of CSL from BAA adults in middle age and older, in response to CT, is largely unknown. In the present study we were interested in determining if the race/ethnicity of people depicted in test stimuli are discordant from the race/ethnicity of the test-taker and if the findings from Olness et al. (2002) could be replicated for a late-middle aged sample of BAA at risk for ADRD; specifically, whether or not the number of total words spoken in response to CT differed between BAA and NHW.

Study Goals.

The goals of the present study were threefold: 1) characterize connected speech-language (CSL) from late-middle-aged BAA participants enriched for risk of Alzheimer’s disease, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally; 2) compare CSL change between BAA participants who are cognitively stable with BAA participants who show subtle cognitive decline; and 3) compare the total number of words spoken between BAA and NHW participants in response to the Cookie Theft picture. To achieve the first goal, we planned a detailed characterization of the connected speech and language metrics from CT descriptions that are typically applied in ADRD studies from a sample of late-middle-aged BAA participants. We examined measures of semantic content, speech fluency (including filled and unfilled pauses, revisions and repetitions), and lexical diversity (the ratio of unique words to total words), measures which have been shown to differentiate normal aging from early cognitive decline, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and dementia (Ahmed et al., 2013; Forbes-McKay &amp; Venneri, 2005; Mueller et al., 2018b; Mueller et al., 2016). Because age, sex, education, and having at least one copy of the APOE-ε4 allele are significant risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (Tyas et al., 2001), we sought to characterize CSL measures while considering the impact of these risk factors. The CSL measures of interest were those that have been shown to be affected in MCI and AD dementia, including total words (Drummond et al., 2015), propositional density (Kim et al., 2019), unique words (Berisha et al., 2015), mean length of utterance (Mueller et al., 2018a), content information units (Croisile et al., 1996), and measures of speech fluency (Mueller et al., 2018a). A definition of CSL variables can be found in Table 1.

Based on Forbes-McKay &amp; Venneri (2005), we hypothesized that there would be no effects of age or sex on any of the variables, but that literacy would be associated with measures of information content. Because research from our group has not shown direct associations between cognition and APOE-ε4 in late midlife (Johnson et al., 2018), we hypothesized that measures would not differ between carriers and non-carriers of the APOE-ε4 risk gene. Second, CSL is highly variable between individuals because of a variety of factors, including personal style, regional dialect, and mood (Bell et al., 2003; Cowie &amp; Cornelius, 2003; Huang et al., 2001); therefore, a related study goal was to characterize longitudinal, within-person change in CSL from BAA individuals by cognitive status (Study Goal 2). Our study goals allow us to see if there are similarities within groups, as well as to show preliminary results as to whether CSL continues to represent declines in cognition while considering the variability of CSL between individuals. We hypothesized that the BAA participants would exhibit a similar relationship between cognitive decline and semantic content and/or speech fluency measures as previously shown in the literature with predominantly NHW participants (Mueller et al., 2018b).

As discussed above, studies have shown that there are specific speech measures that differentiate normal aging from cognitive decline. However, these studies have been on groups that are predominantly NHW. We sought to explore the possibility that use of a picture description task may obviate or reduce potential biases present in other cognitive measures in a cognitively unimpaired sample of late-middle-age BAA participants. Since the goal of a picture description task is to elicit as much language as possible within a specified context, we sought to determine if BAA participants produced the same amount of speech-language output as NHW participants in response to CT. (Study Goal 3). We hypothesized that BAA participants would have the same number of total words as NHW in response to CT as shown in Olness et al. (2002).

Methods

Participants

Participant data for this secondary analysis were drawn from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP), a longitudinal, observational study of persons enriched for parental history of Alzheimer’s disease (Johnson et al., 2018). In order to have a reasonable balance between racial groups of participants, participant data were drawn from the Milwaukee, Wisconsin site of the WRAP study. Given the substantial proportion of BAA residents in Milwaukee, the WRAP research team established a recruitment site for WRAP in 2006 in deliberate efforts to increase BAA participation in ADRD research (Green-Harris et al., 2019). Participants self-identified as “Black/African American” or, “non-Hispanic White/Caucasian,” completed at least one speech sample using the Cookie Theft picture description task and reported no previous clinical diagnoses of neurological disorders including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, dementia, and stroke. Participants with English as a Second Language were excluded from these analyses. All study procedures were approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s (UW-Madison) Institutional Review Board, and procedures were done in accord with the ethical standards of the UW-Madison Human Research Protection Program of the UW-Madison and the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.

Neuropsychological testing and speech sample collection

Participation in WRAP consisted of 1 baseline study visit and follow-up visits every 2 years thereafter. Participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological testing battery described elsewhere (Johnson et al., 2018). Briefly, for this investigation, the following neuropsychological measures were considered: Boston Naming Test from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination including the CT image (Goodglass et al., 2001); Wide Range Achievement Test – 3rd Edition (Reading Subtest) (WRAT-3 Reading) (Wilkinson, 1993); Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975); Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) (Schmidt, 1996); Logical Memory Delayed (Weschler, 1987); Animal Fluency (Goodglass et al., 2001); Phonemic fluency (Benton, 1978); and the Centres for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) (Eaton et al., 2004; Radloff, 1977). This study considered these assessments because outcomes from these examinations have been shown to be sensitive to AD-related cognitive changes (Koscik, Norton, et al., 2019).

Participants first consented to have their speech audio-recorded. When examiners presented the CT image from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (Goodglass et al., 2001), they instructed participants “Tell me everything you see going on in this picture.” The test administrators were instructed to provide minimal feedback, such as asking “anything else?”, if responses were abnormally brief (i.e. only mentioning one to two elements of the picture).

All responses were recorded using an Olympus VN-6200PC digital audio recorder, which was placed flat on the table, approximately 6 inches in front of the participants.

Speech Sample Transcription and Analysis

Language samples from “Cookie Theft” transcripts were transcribed by two trained graduate students, using Codes for Human Analysis of Transcripts (CHAT) (MacWhinney, 2000). Transcripts were coded for automatic analyses by the Computer Language Analysis (CLAN) program (MacWhinney et al., 2011), including codes for filled and unfilled pauses, repetitions, revisions, errors (semantic, phonological, lexical), and non-verbal behaviors (e.g., coughing, laughing). Content Information Units (CIU) were coded as 23 possible objects, people, actions or ideas from CT as described by Croisile et al. (1996). CIUs, parts of speech, total utterances, and other quantifiers were then automatically extracted by the CLAN program using the MOR and MEGRASP programs (Croisile et al., 1996; MacWhinney, 2000).

Reliability was calculated using the RELY program (MacWhinney, 2000) within CLAN. If reliability was 90% or higher for both total utterances and total tokens as categorized by CLAN, either transcriber 1 or transcriber 2 transcript was randomly selected and used as the main transcript. If reliability was below 90%, a third transcriber matched differences in the two transcripts and this third transcript was used as the evaluated transcript.

Cognitive Status Determination

Cognitive status in the WRAP study was determined through a consensus conference review, made up of a team of clinicians, including neuropsychologists, physicians and nurse practitioners from the study team. Data from each participant’s visit was first analyzed through algorithmic criteria that is designed to overidentify cases that go to the consensus review. The consensus review panel reviewed the cognitive performance of the participants at all visits, as well as the participant’s medical history, subjective complaints, and informant reports of activities of daily living. Cases not flagged for consensus review were classified as cognitively normal (Koscik, Berman, et al., 2016). “Cognitively unimpaired-declining” participants were those who performed 1.5 standard deviations below expected on one or more neuropsychological tests and were also determined by the team to be declining outside the range of expectations for their age, reading ability, and baseline performance.

Statistical Analyses

We compared demographic, clinical and connected speech characteristics from the BAA male and female participants using t-tests and chi-square tests. The outcomes of interest for the longitudinal analyses included “Pronoun index” (measure of pronouns divided by nouns plus pronouns), “Content information unit density” (number of CIUs divided by total words), “Disfluency index” (the number of filled and unfilled pauses, revisions and repetitions divided by total number of words), and “Words per minute,” as these measures were shown to differ across cognitive statuses in WRAP (Mueller et al., 2018b). For the descriptive analyses, we used the raw scores of CSL measures. We also examined these same connected speech characteristics stratified by age tertiles and by WRAT-3 reading tertiles. Other variables examined included age, sex, the presence of one or more APOE-ε4 allele, and WRAT-3 test performance. We chose to use the WRAT-3 Reading subtest, instead of years of education, as a proxy for quality of education. A measure of quantity for education may not be reliable because of achievement gaps and overall quality of the education (Manly et al., 2002).

To examine whether longitudinal CSL varied by cognitive status, we used linear mixed-effects models in BAA participants with &gt;1-timepoint (n=30). Linear mixed effects models allowed the examination of CSL as a group (fixed effects), while accounting for individual differences via random effects (Laird &amp; Ware, 1982). We operationalized “time” as age centered at the mean of 62, and the variable of interest was the interaction between centered age and cognitive status. For the longitudinal within-person analyses, we converted the CSL outcomes of interest to z-scores for ease of interpretation across measures. To interpret effect sizes, we calculated the conditional R2, which is the proportion of variance explained by both the fixed effects and random effects (Nakagawa &amp; Schielzeth, 2013).

Comparison of total words between BAA and NHW participants included analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for age, sex, and literacy. Outliers were identified and Winsor adjustments were applied to these values. Analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.2 (R Core Team, 2019) and SPSS version 26.

Results

Sample Characteristics.

Table 2 provides the sample characteristics of BAA participants stratified by sex at the baseline speech collection. This study consisted of 78 WRAP participants: 48 BAA participants and 30 NHW participants. Of the 48 participants, 38 (79%) were women, with a mean age of 60.7 (SD=6.7) years. Almost half (48%) of individuals were carriers of at least one copy of the APOE-ε4 allele, and most (77%) had a parental history of Alzheimer’s disease. Females had a marginally higher percentage of parental history of AD than males (p=.06). There were no sex differences in age, WRAT-3 Reading, depressive symptoms, and most standardized neuropsychological testing scores. Males scored higher than females in category fluency (animals; p &lt;.001), while females scored marginally higher than males on the Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT; p=.06).

Connected Speech-Language Characteristics.

Tables 3, 4 and 5 display connected speech and language characteristics by sex, APOE status, age tertiles, and WRAT-3 Reading subtest tertiles. On average, BAA participants produced a mean (±SD) of 89 (±50) total words, 51 (±21) unique words, and a unique-to-total word ratio (“type-token ratio”) of .61 (±.09). The mean length of utterance (including morphemes) was 9.8 (±2.2), and participants produced an average of 12.5 out of the 23 content information units described by Croisile et al. (1996). Rate of speech was calculated as “words per minute,” and on average participants produced 112.9 (±24) words per minute. None of the measures differed significantly by sex (Table 3) or age tertile (Table 4), but younger participants tended to produce more total words, unique words, and content information units. Significant differences were found by WRAT-3 Reading tertiles (Table 5) in the amount of closed class words and unique words produced; participants with higher closed class words and higher unique words tended to have higher WRAT-3 Reading standard scores (adjusted for age)

Longitudinal Analysis.

Results of the longitudinal analysis showing associations between change in speech measures and cognitive status in BAA participants are presented in Table 6. 30 BAA participants had more than one speech sample (n=29 had 2; n=1 had 3) and were included for the longitudinal analysis. Participants included were either cognitively unimpaired-stable (n=16) or cognitively unimpaired-declining (n=14). Although there were no significant main effects for cognitive status, some other findings emerged. Participants who were cognitively unimpaired-declining showed an increase in the use of pronouns over time (β=.43, p&lt;.05), a decrease in CIU density (β=−.39, p&lt;.05), and an increase in words per minute (β=.41, p&lt;.05). The variance explained by both the fixed and random effects (“conditional R2”) was .42 for pronoun index, .57 for CIU density, and .60 for words per minute, indicating substantial effect sizes for the three models (Falk &amp; Miller, 1992). The interaction between age and cognitive status was not significant for speech fluency (Disfluency Index).

Comparison of total words between BAA adults and NHW.

Sample characteristics of BAA participants (n=48) and NHW participants (n=30) are presented in Table 7. The two groups did not differ by age, sex, parental history of AD, or APOE status. BAA participants had a higher percentage of participants classified as “cognitively unimpaired-declining,” lower WRAT-3 Reading standard scores, and higher scores on depressive symptoms. After controlling for age, sex and WRAT-3 reading level we found no significant difference in total words between the group with BAA average words at 101.5 words and NHW average words at 89.6 words.

Discussion

In one of the first studies to characterize prospective connected speech and language from an ADRD-risk-enriched sample of BAA adults, we found no sex, age or APOE differences in CSL measures that have been shown to be sensitive to ADRD-related cognitive decline. There was some variance between levels of WRAT-3 Reading and production of unique words and closed-class words, such that higher scores on WRAT-3 Reading were associated with higher unique words and more closed-class words. CSL change among cognitively declining BAA participants was similar to that seen previously in a NHW sample (Mueller et al., 2018b), such that participants who were categorized as “cognitively unimpaired-declining” via consensus case conference review were more likely to show an increase in pronoun usage and a decrease in content information units per total words over time. Contrary to our previous work (Mueller et al., 2016), we did not see a change in speech fluency over time in the cognitively declining participants. We did not observe a difference between BAA and NHW participants on in the amount of talking in response to CT.

Regarding sex differences in CSL measures in an aging population, the limited existing literature yields mixed results for comparing our findings. Our negative findings, i.e., observation of no significant CSL differences between BAA male and female adults, contrasted with previous research that found significant gender differences in narrative productions within BAA participants. A recent study of 76 BAA adults aged 45–87 with no history of a language disorder or learning disability found that female participants were more talkative (Wainwright, 2019), which we did not see in the duration of the speech samples, nor in production of total words. There is limited research in general regarding the effects of sex differences on these measures of CSL in any population of aging adults, particularly those at risk for ADRD. One of the only normative studies of CSL for aging individuals and those with dementia showed there were no sex differences in any of the CSL measures (Forbes-McKay &amp; Venneri, 2005); however, this sample was based in a University setting in Scotland, and the race/ethnicity of participants was not mentioned; therefore, the results cannot be generalized. In another study characterizing the discourse of healthy Korean elders, Choi et al. (2012) found that the total number of syllables and syllables per sentence were greater in females than in males (Choi, 2012). These findings may partially stem from the limitations of narrative production possibilities when presented with the CT task.

Aging differences in CSL have been documented particularly for an increased use of indefinite terms, slowed word retrieval, decreased error repairs, and decreased grammatical complexity (Forbes-McKay &amp; Venneri, 2005), however whether or not these differences exist in BAA adults is unknown. We did not aim to characterize measures of grammatical relations and complexity for two reasons: 1) multiple studies, including research from our team, indicated that measures of syntax do not appear to be differentially affected in very early cognitive decline versus typical aging (Kavé &amp; Dassa, 2018; Kemper et al., 1993; Mueller et al., 2018b); and 2) heterogeneity of English dialects of the BAA participants in Milwaukee may exist based on region of origin, where participants grew up, and other socio-ethnic factors that play into dialectal differences which we could not evaluate for this study. Although it is generally accepted that African American English (AAE) is a dialect spoken by many Black Americans of historical African descent (Holt, 2018), AAE is not monolithic and inter-individual dialectal differences exist in syntax and phonology (Green &amp; Sistrunk, 2015; Holt, 2018). Given that the influence of regional differentiation is often misunderstood and subsequently misrepresented in linguistic research (Wolfram, 2015), regional differentiation is important to consider for further examination on AAE and potential dialectal differences affecting characterization of longitudinal change in connected speech and language for BAA adults. Our future research goals will be to characterize and understand how dialect differences may affect measures sensitive to cognitive decline, based on region of origin and current residential neighborhood patterns.

Some of the CSL measures varied by WRAT-3 Reading standard scores. Those in the highest WRAT-3 tertile responded with more unique words and more closed-class words. However, many of the measures specifically related to ADRD research, including measures of content, did not differ by WRAT-3 tertile, particularly content information units and CIU density (measures of production of relevant semantic content and the efficiency with which this content is expressed, respectively). We showed that CSL change among BAA participants who were classified as cognitively unimpaired-declining was similar to that seen previously in an NHW sample, signifying that CSL may be a less-biased measure that can provide information on subtle declines in cognition. To our knowledge, this study is among the first studies to examine CSL in BAA participants who are showing subtle cognitive declines.

Our results showed no differences in CSL between those with the APOE-ε4 gene and those without the APOE-ε4 gene. This finding may be supported by research that suggests the presence of APOE-ε4 may not be as significant of a risk factor for AD dementia in a BAA population, that the mechanisms underlying APOE-ε4 and AD are not well understood (Rajan et al., 2019), or that our WRAP sample is too young to show APOE-ε4 effects on cognition and CSL (Johnson et al., 2018).

The absence of a significant difference in total words between BAA and NHW participants is consistent with the findings from Olness et al., 2002. This finding can be explained by a few factors. First, the two groups were similar in age (mean [SD] age for BAA participants was 61±7 and 62.5±6 respectively), and the image depicts a situation that may resemble social and environmental circumstances to which many participants, regardless of cultural differences, were exposed in childhood. Anecdotally, when introduced to the image, participants often mention that the picture appears to be a scene “from the 1950s.” This observation supports the notion that the image may need updates for future generations of patients and participants who will be assessed using picture description tasks. These results, along with predominantly weak associations between CSL measures and Wide Range Achievement Test Reading (WRAT-3), may suggest that CSL may reflect a cognitive activity that is less biased by sociocultural factors.

Despite our findings that the amount of speech does not differ across BAA and NHW participants in response to CT, this study provides preliminary data, and this is not an impetus to continue using a picture stimulus that is unrepresentative of the demographics of the general population. When the speech sample collection began in 2013, the CT image was chosen because, as discussed in the introduction, it was the standardized image most frequently used among researchers and clinicians investigating ADRD. CT use has continued since 2013, in that this has allowed for evaluation of performance across time points (Boschi et al., 2017; Mueller et al., 2018a), but our future work will investigate alternative ways of eliciting CSL samples from WRAP participants.

Important work toward creating new picture stimuli is underway. For example, Berube and colleagues evaluated narrative language using an updated image of CT in speakers with and without aphasia (Berube et al., 2019). Similar to the original CT, the scene is a kitchen scene, with children stealing cookies and someone washing dishes. However, a male is washing the dishes, while a female mows the lawn outside. This study team developed two images, one consisting of an NHW family and one of a mixed ethnicity family. The strengths of this study included the involvement of input from individuals with aphasia, stroke neurologists, and speech language pathologists. Although this study found no significant differences in any speech measures when presented with the new mixed-race image, the sample size was limited to 6 healthy controls and there is little information about their ethnicity. Additionally, the image continues to depict a domestic kitchen scene. As CSL becomes more frequently used as a measure to evaluate cognitive status, the development of multiple stimuli, and alternatives for a clinician or researcher to choose from, will be beneficial. The two images developed contrast the original CT photo in that they are both in color. The researchers discussed putting more color on the left side of the second image in order to more evenly distribute attention in response to speech-language pathologists. To build on Berube et al.’s (2019) finding and other previous studies, the present study supports the idea that development of a more culturally appropriate assessment measure for CSL outside of CT is prudent. Contrasting previous studies, our goal is to create new black and white image stimuli in order to limit the additional visual factor that adding color includes. Through using community-based research techniques and partnering with diverse community members, researchers and clinicians can consider revising practices and protocols for facilitating the development of culturally-sensitive assessments and assessment stimuli. Using community-engagement approaches resulted in recruitment success for increasing BAA participants into WRAP (Green-Harris et al., 2019), and similar strategies could benefit future exploratory research and development of culturally-sensitive assessment tools for future BAA clients. The next steps for our team include development of new scenes, as well as including the community in the development of the image prior to assessing the reliability of the image.

The limitations of the present study included the small sample size and that all participants were from one location: Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Because of restrictions to the WRAP study protocols we could not include additional questions related to social determinants of health, such as where one grew up, which may impact speech patterns, and expansion of the race/ethnicity question in WRAP. Limitations of the study design of WRAP also included that it was a self-selected sample of participants who are enriched for family history of Alzheimer’s disease and not a full community-based sample, therefore not representative of the BAA population in the US. Furthermore, the cognitive status of participants is determined in large part by performance on standardized neuropsychological tests, particularly those that have been shown to misrepresent the cognitive abilities of BAA individuals. Although the consensus diagnosis is reliant upon a change model (i.e., change in scores relative to one’s own baseline) which is recommended as a way of more accurately studying participants from diverse backgrounds (Barnes &amp; Bennett, 2014), the use of these measures may still skew the consensus diagnosis and overidentify participants as “declining” in cognition. Because the longitudinal study design depends upon consistency of measures, alternative ways of mitigating these confounds are required, including considering social determinants of health other than literacy level, such as (but not limited to): neighborhood disadvantage metrics (Kind &amp; Buckingham, 2018), stress and stressful life events (Zuelsdorff et al., 2020), socioeconomic status (Weuve et al., 2018), and vascular risk factors (Clark et al., 2018). Our future work will incorporate these social determinants for a more complete assessment of change in CSL. This study did not examine tester race/ethnicity and how that may impact the speech production of minority participants. WRAP continues to accrue more CSL from BAA, and also more BAA testing visits in Milwaukee are being conducted by examiners who identify as either BAA or NHW. In the near future we will be able to investigate examiner-examinee discordance in measures from CSL and other cognitive tests. Still, results may be impacted by a consistent pattern of underrepresented and historically disenfranchised groups not participating in medical research or seeking professional health help as often as NHWs (Barnes &amp; Bennett, 2014) which could result in limitations in the diversity of the backgrounds of participants regardless of race or ethnicity.

The strengths of this study include the fact that CSL has not been characterized in a BAA participant sample of this size, particularly those in late-middle-age and at risk for cognitive decline attributed to ADRD. Future directions include developing an ethnoculturally relevant stimulus picture and further evaluation of gender differences with larger sample sizes, additional time points, and additional AD biomarkers.

In conclusion, the results from the present study provide preliminary support of the use of CSL as an important, inexpensive, and low-burden measure of cognition (Snyder et al., 2014). CSL is a promising measure for early identification of AD through analysis of subtle components of speech including acoustic, semantic, and syntactic features. Although research has been predominantly within English-speaking participants, early research also shows similar patterns in other languages, increasing the potential benefits of CSL analysis (Slegers et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). Because CSL has the potential to be collected remotely via telephone or internet, this methodology has the potential to widen its reach to underrepresented and historically disenfranchised groups. Although the CT image appears appropriate for obtaining accurate CSL samples, further consideration of developing culturally-sensitive assessment tools is imperative (ASHA, 2017). Given the baseline hesitation of historically disenfranchised groups to participate in research and the dearth of available culturally sensitive assessment tools (Hayles Jr, 1991; Qualls, 2002), using non-representative materials may diminish researchers’ goals of recruitment and retention of participants from historically disenfranchised groups. CT may also diminish the goal of clinicians to provide culturally sensitive care in both assessment and treatment. The reliability of CSL is crucially dependent upon appropriate images for obtaining the most representative sample of spontaneous speech. Using community-engaged research techniques, our future work will include a qualitative analysis of community members’ response to the CT image along with other newly developed images and implementation of a new image to obtain CSL.
