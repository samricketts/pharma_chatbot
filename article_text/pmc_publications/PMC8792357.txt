Pyramidal neurons in the neocortex that express nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (NPNFs) are especially vulnerable to degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease. Since the basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala (BNC) and cortical nuclear complex of the amygdala (CNC) are cortex-like structures, containing both pyramidal (PNs) and nonpyramidal neurons (NPNs), it is of interest to determine which cell types in the primate BNC and CNC are NPNF+. We also studied NPNF expression in the non-cortex-like nuclei of the amygdala (central and medial nuclei). Digitized images of sections through fetal, newborn, infant, and adult macaque brains stained for NPNFs, obtained from the Macaque Brain Resource (MacBrainResource, MBR), were analyzed. The pattern of NPNF immunoreactivity (NPNF-ir) in the BNC, CNC, and medial nucleus was essentially identical in all three age groups, but there were some age-dependent differences in the central nucleus. All BNC and CNC nuclei contained a moderate density of NPNF+ NPNs. Both the somata and the entire dendritic arborizations of these NPNs were stained. PNs with robust NPNF-ir in their somata and proximal dendrites were only seen in the basal magnocellular nucleus, where it appeared that virtually every PN was NPNF+. This pattern of NPNF expression is distinct from that seen in the mammalian neocortex, where NPNF+ neurons are almost entirely PNs, but is very similar to that seen in a recent study of the rat BNC. These findings, in conjunction with the cortical data, suggest the possibility that NPNF+ neuronal subpopulations in the BNC and CNC might be especially vulnerable in Alzheimer’s disease.

pmc1. Introduction

Neurofilaments (NFs) are a critical component of the neuronal cytoskeleton and also play a role in synaptic function (Yuan et al., 2017). They are among the most highly phosphorylated proteins in the brain; post-translational phosphorylation stabilizes NFs and increases their interaction with each other and with other cytoskeletal proteins (Matus 1988; Julien and Mushynski, 1982; Bott and Winckler, 2020). NF phosphorylation is usually confined to axons; little or no phosphorylated NFs are observed in most neuronal somata, except in neurological diseases or in axotomized neurons (Sternberger et al., 1885, Klosen et al., 1990; Yuan et al., 2017). Most NFs in somata and dendrites are nonphosphorylated, with phosphorylation occurring during transport of NFs down the axon (Sternberger and Sternberger, 1983). However nonphosphorylated NFs (NPNFs) are only expressed in the somata and dendrites of specific neuronal subpopulations. For example, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that NPNF+ pyramidal neurons in human and monkey neocortices were located in particular layers in different areas, and that these neurons were particularly vulnerable in Alzheimer’s disease (Campbell and Morrison, 1989; Hof et al., 1990).

The amygdala in mammals, including primates, consists of over a dozen nuclei that exhibit distinctive connections (Amaral et al., 1992; Pitkänen, 2000). These nuclei can be divided into two groups on the basis of neuronal morphology and transmitter neurochemistry: (1) the corticobasolateral nuclear group (CBL), and (2) the centromedial nuclear group (CeM) (McDonald, 2003). The CBL consists of the basolateral nuclear complex (BNC) and the superficially-adjacent cortical nuclear complex (CNC). The BNC consists of three main nuclei, the lateral nucleus, basal nucleus, and accessory basal nucleus, each of which have several subdivisions. The main nuclei of the CNC are the anterior cortical nucleus (Coa), posterior cortical nucleus (Cop), and the periamygdaloid cortex (PAC). The CeM consists of the medial nucleus and the central nucleus, including its medial and lateral subdivisions.

The nuclei of the CBL are cortex-like structures with two main types of neurons: (1) spiny glutamatergic pyramidal projection neurons (PNs), and (2) spine-sparse or spine-free GABAergic nonpyramidal neurons (NPNs) (Vásquez et al., 2018; McDonald, 2020; McDonald and Augustine, 2020). PNs greatly outnumber NPNs in every nucleus of the CBL. The morphology, synaptology, electrophysiology, neurochemistry, and developmental origins of PN and NPN neurons of the CBL are remarkably similar to their counterparts in the cortex (Carlsen and Heimer, 1988; Puelles et al., 2000; Sah et al., 2003; Muller et al., 2005, 2006, 2007; Fishell and Rudy, 2011; McDonald 2020). Since the CBL is a cortex-like structure, it is of interest to determine if the laminar and areal specificity of NPNF expression in PNs of the cortex is mirrored by similar specificity of NPNF expression in PNs in discrete nuclear subdivisions of the CBL. Surprisingly, a recent study of the rat BNC demonstrated that NPNFs were mainly expressed in NPNs (McDonald and Mascagni, 2021). In contrast the CeM group does not contain many glutamatergic neurons; most of the neurons in these nuclei are GABAergic, and some closely resemble the GABAergic medium spiny neurons of the striatum (McDonald, 1992a; 2003). The aims of the present study were to determine if the expression of NPNFs in the primate BNC was similar to that seen in the rat (McDonald and Mascagni, 2021), and to examine for the first time the expression of NPNFs in neurons of the cortical, central and medial nuclei.

2. Results

2.1 General observations

We analyzed digitized images of coronal sections through fetal, newborn, infant, and adult macaque brains stained for NPNFs using an immunoperoxidase technique with DAB as the chromogen. The overall pattern of staining in all 11 brains used for this study was very similar. Most regions in the forebrain, diencephalon, brainstem, and cerebellum contained some neurons that expressed NPNFs in somata and dendrites, but only specific neuronal subpopulations in these regions were NPNF+ (e.g., in the cerebellar cortex only Purkinji cells, but not granule cells or interneurons, were NPNF+). One major exception was the striatum, which contained no NPNF+ somata.

2.2 NPNF expression in the BNC

Seven of the 11 brains were from infant macaques that were 2.5–6.0 months old (Brains 61, 63, 65, 66, 80–82; Table 1). NPNF staining in the amygdala, including the BNC, was similar in all seven brains; there was no obvious difference in the staining seen in males versus females, although no detailed quantitative studies were performed. In all BNC nuclei there was a moderate density of NPNF+ NPNs (Fig. 1). These neurons had somata of various shapes that were 15–20 μm in diameter and gave rise to 3–4 primary dendrites that branched sparingly (Figs. 1C–F, 4A). It appeared that the entire dendritic arborization of each of these NPNF+ NPNs was stained. Both the morphology and density of these neurons indicates that they are NPNs (see Experimental Procedures). In a previous study in the rat, it was found that the great majority of NPNF+ NPNs in the BNC expressed parvalbumin (PV), but none corresponded to the much smaller NPNs that express vasoactive intestinal peptide or calretinin (CR) (McDonald and Mascagni, 2021). Comparisons of the morphology of NPNF+ NPNs in the BNC with PV+ and CR+ neurons in the same brains revealed that the morphology of NPNF+ neurons closely resembled that of PV+ neurons, but not CR+ neurons (Fig. 4). In contrast, the Bmg, but not the parvicellular basal nucleus (Bpc) or other BNC nuclei, contained a very high density of NPNF+ neurons with pyramidal or piriform somata that averaged 20 μm in diameter (Figs. 1B, 5). Only the somata and proximal dendrites of these neurons were stained. Their morphology and density indicate that they are PNs (see Experimental Procedures). In addition, like the other nuclei of the BNC, there was a moderate density of NPNs with extensive dendritic staining in the Bmg (Fig. 5). The staining of PNs was only seen in the caudal half of the Bmg, where the dorsal portion of the Bmg forms a “dogleg” that turns laterally (Fig. 1). In the anterior and most ventral portions of the Bmg (termed the intermediate subdivision of the basal nucleus by Amaral et al., 1992) only NPNs were NPNF+.

Amygdalar NPNF staining in a newborn macaque brain (Brain 64; Table 1) appeared to be identical to that seen in infants: mainly PN staining in the Bmg, and NPN staining in the other nuclei of the BNC (Fig. 2). Likewise, the staining in the late fetal macaque brain (Brain 78; Table 1) was identical to that seen in infants and newborns. Staining in two adult macaques (Brains 72 and 79; Table 1) was also very similar to that seen in infants (Fig. 3), but a few lightly stained PN-like neurons were observed in the Bpc and the magnocellular basal accessory nucleus (ABmg) (Fig. 3C, D).

2.3 NPNF expression in the cortical amygdalar nuclei

There are three main cortical nuclei in the macaque amygdala: (1) anterior cortical nucleus (Coa); (2) periamygdaloid cortex (PAC); and (3) posterior cortical nucleus (Cop). Like the BNC, PNs in the cortical nuclei greatly outnumber NPNs (Vásquez et al., 2018). However, only NPNs expressed NPNFs in all three nuclei (Figs. 6 and 7). The density and morphology of these NPNF+ NPNs was similar to that of NPNF+ NPNs in the BNC. As in the BNC, the morphology of NPNF+ neurons closely resembled that of PV+ neurons in the same brains, but not CR+ neurons (data not shown). No difference was seen in NPNF staining in the cortical nuclei in the four different age groups (fetal, newborn, infant, and adult).

2.4 NPNF expression in the medial and central amygdalar nuclei

Very few NPNF+ neurons were seen in the medial nucleus (M) in all four age groups (Fig. 7). There was a low to moderate density of NPNF+ neurons in the medial subdivision of the central nucleus (CM) in all age groups (Fig. 8). However, NPNF staining differed in the lateral subdivision of the central nucleus (CL) depending on age. Virtually no NPNF+ neurons were seen in CL in fetal, newborn and infant macaques (Fig. 8A), but a low to moderate density of NPNF+ neurons was seen in the two adult brains (Fig. 8B). The morphology of NPNF+ neurons in the medial and central nuclei closely resembled that of NPNs in the BNC and cortical nuclei; they had 3–4 primary dendrites that branched sparingly.

3. Discussion

3.1 Comparison of NPNF expression in the monkey versus the rat BNC

NPNF expression in the monkey BNC was very similar at all four ages examined (fetal, newborn, infant, and adult): the vast majority of NPNF+ neurons in the Bmg were PNs, whereas in the other BNC nuclei virtually all NPNF+ neurons were NPNs. This staining pattern is very similar to that seen in a recent study of the rat BNC (McDonald and Mascagni, 2021). The similarity of expression of NPNFs in rat and monkey, two mammals that are phylogenetically distant, suggests that similar patterns of NPNF expression are probably found in all mammals, including humans.

Like the cortex, several distinct NPN subpopulations can be identified in the rodent and primate BNC on the basis of their expression of neuropeptides and calcium-binding proteins, including: (1) parvalbumin+/calbindin+ (PV+/CB+) neurons, (2) somatostatin+/calbindin+ (SOM+/CB+) neurons, (3) large multipolar cholecystokinin+ (CCK+) neurons that are often CB+, and (4) small bipolar and bitufted interneurons that exhibit extensive colocalization of calretinin (CR), CCK, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (Spampanato et al., 2011; Capogna 2014; McDonald, 2020, 2021). Dual-labeling experiments in the rat indicated that the majority of NPNF+ NPNs in the BNC were PV+, although in the lateral nucleus both PV+ and SOM+ NPNs were NPNF+ (McDonald and Mascagni, 2021). In addition to these NPNs there is a distinct NPNF+ NPN subpopulation in the rat basolateral and basomedial nuclei that projects to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD; McDonald and Mascagni, 2021). Although no dual-labeling studies of NPNF+ neurons have been done in the monkey, the morphology of NPNF+ NPNs in the BNC in the present study is consistent with that of PV+ NPNs (Pitkänen and Amaral, 1993; Fig. 4 of the present study), SOM+ NPNs (Amaral et al., 1989; McDonald et al., 1995), and MD-projecting NPNs (Russchen et al., 1987) in primates. In the rat BNC none of the small neurons that express CR and/or VIP were NPNF+. Likewise, none of the NPNF+ NPNs in the monkey BNC had the morphological characteristics of CR+ NPNs (i.e., small bipolar or bitufted neurons; Fig. 4 of the present study; McDonald, 1994, 2021).

In regard to NPNF+ PNs, one difference between rat and monkey is that in the rat NPNF+ PNs were seen in both the anterior subdivision of the basolateral nucleus (BLa; homolog of the primate Bmg, Price et al., 1987) and the posterior subdivision of the basolateral nucleus (BLp; homolog of the primate Bpc, Price et al., 1987), whereas in monkey NPNF+ PNs were only seen in portions of the Bmg. Another peculiar difference between rat and monkey is that NPNF+ PNs in both the BLa and BLp of the rat BNC are only obvious in sections whose antibody diluents did not contain Triton X-100 (McDonald and Mascagni, 2021), whereas PNs exhibited robust staining in the present study where Triton was added to antibody diluents. Since Triton normally just increases antibody penetration, rather than changing neuronal staining, these findings in the rat are currently inexplicable. It is not clear if this difference in PN staining in rat versus monkey is due to a species difference, or to the use of two different monoclonal NPNF antibodies in the two studies (Biolegend antibody to nonphosphorylated high molecular weight neurofilaments [NF-H] for monkey, and Sternberger-Meyer Immunocytochemicals SMI-32 antibody to nonphosphorylated high and middle molecular weight neurofilaments [NF-M and NF-H] for rat).

3.2 Comparison of NPNF expression in the monkey BNC versus monkey neocortex: possible implications for Alzheimer’s disease

In all mammals, including non-human and human primates, PNs are the main neuronal population in the neocortex that expresses NPNFs (Vickers and Costa, 1992; Hof et al., 1990, 1996; Hof and Morrison, 1990; Budinger et al., 2000; Kirkcaldie et al., 2002; Boire et al., 2005; Baldauf et al., 2005; Ouda et al., 2012). In human neocortex NPNFs+ PNs are more common in association areas than in other neocortical regions (Morrison et al., 1987; Hof et al., 1990; Hof and Morrison, 1990), and retrograde tract-tracing studies in monkeys indicate that it is mainly PNs that have long intracortical projections that are NPNF+ (Campbell et al., 1989). These NPNF+ corticocortically projecting PNs are particularly vulnerable to the formation of degenerative neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Morrison et al., 1987; Hof et al., 1990). The increase in NFTs, but not amyloid plaques, is correlated with the extent of dementia in AD (Wilcock and Esiri, 1982). In contrast cortical PV+, CB+, and most CR+ NPNs are relatively resistant to degeneration in AD, and this resistance appears to be associated with the absence of NPNFs in these cortical neuronal subpopulations (Hof et al., 1991a, 1991b, 1993; Fonseca and Soriano, 1995; Sampson et al., 1997). Although most cortical CR+ NPNs do not express NPNFs, a distinct subpopulation of CR+ NPNs in layer I exhibit immunoreactivity for NPNF, and these CR+ NPNs did contain NFTs in AD (Sampson et al., 1997). These data, therefore, suggest that the expression of NPNFs in some cortical NPNs is linked to their vulnerability to the pathological processes underlying AD.

Since the neurons of the BNC are very similar to those of the cortex, these studies associating the expression of NPNFs with NFTs in cortical neurons suggest the possibility that NPNFs+ neurons in the BNC may be vulnerable to degeneration in AD. There is a very significant loss of neurons and overall nuclear volumes in the amygdala in AD (Herzog and Kemper, 1980; Scott et al., 1991, 1992). This atrophy and degeneration is associated with high densities of NFTs and amyloid plaques (Van Hoesen et al., 1986; Brashear et al., 1987; Brady and Mufson, 1990; Kromer-Vogt et al., 1990; Price et al., 1991).

The results of the present study suggest that most, if not all, PNs in the monkey caudal Bmg are NPNF+. Since the Bmg has robust projections to prefrontal, insular, cingulate, and temporal cortices in the monkey (Amaral and Price, 1984; Barbas and DeOlmos, 1990; Carmichael and Price, 1995; Gashghaei and Barbas, 2002), its PNs exhibit both characteristics of cortical PNs that are vulnerable in AD: (1) NPNF immunoreactivity and (2) extensive long projections to the cortex. The Bmg and the other BNC nuclei in the monkey had a moderate density of NPNF+ NPNs. This is in stark contrast to the monkey neocortex where only CR+ NPNs in layer 1 were NPNF+. The finding in the cortex that these CR+ NPNs, but not NPNs that were NPNF-negative, exhibited degenerative NFTs suggest the possibility that NPNF+ NPNs in the BNC may be especially vulnerable in AD. In future studies it would be of interest to examine human AD brains stained with antibodies to NPNFs to definitively determine if these NPNF+ PNs and NPNs do indeed contain NFTs.

In advanced stages of AD all amygdalar nuclei exhibit a high density of NFTs and significant neuronal degeneration (Herzog and Kemper, 1980; Van Hoesen et al., 1986; Kromer Vogt et al., 1990; Price et al., 1991; Scott et al., 1991, 1992), indicating that presumptive NPNF+ neurons were not the only neuronal subpopulation affected. However, if NPNF+ neurons in the amygdala are more vulnerable to AD pathology than other neurons, they might be among the first neurons to develop degenerative NFTs. In fact, NFTs are first seen in the BNC at the earliest stages of AD (Braak et al., 1996), and this pathology correlates with the extent of neuropsychiatric symptomatology in patients with mild AD (Poulin et al., 2011).

3.3 NPNF+ neurons in the cortical, medial, and central nuclei

This investigation is the first to study the expression of NPNFs in neurons of the cortical, medial, and central amygdalar nuclei of any species. Since the cortical nuclei are cortex-like, with PNs and NPNs that closely resemble those of the neocortex, the discussion of possible vulnerability of its NPNs in AD discussed above for the BNC is also relevant for the cortical nuclei as well. In fact, the density of NFTs in the cortical nuclei is similar to that in the accessory basal nuclei, and greater than that of the lateral and basal nuclei (Kromer Vogt et al., 1990).

The medial and central amygdalar nuclei do not contain pyramidal cells, and are not cortex-like (Hall, 1972; McDonald, 1992a). In fact, the principal neurons in the lateral portions of the central nucleus closely resemble the medium spiny neurons in the adjacent striatum (McDonald, 1982, 1992a). There were only a few scattered NPNF+ neurons in the medial nucleus of macaques in the present study. In contrast, the medial subdivision of the central nucleus (CM) exhibited a low to moderate density of NPNF+ neurons at all of the four ages studied in this investigation, and the lateral subdivision of the central nucleus (CL) contained NPNF+ neurons in adults, but not in non-adult monkeys.

Both portions of the central nucleus have two main morphological types of neurons: (1) spiny principal neurons, which constitute the most numerous cell type in both CL and CM, and (2) a small number of spine-sparse neurons (McDonald 1982, 1992a). The low density of NPNF+ neurons in both the CM and CL suggests that they may correspond to the latter. Since both the CM and CL have neuronal subpopulations that contain different neuropeptides (Cassell and Gray, 1989; Beyeler and Dabrowska, 2020), it would be of interest to establish which subpopulations express NPNFs. The functional significance of NPNFs in these non-cortex-like nuclei remains to be determined.

4. Experimental Procedures:

Animals were not sacrificed for the present study. Instead, brain tissue from 11 rhesus macaques already stained for NPNFs, digitized and publicly available in MacBrainResource Collection 6 (MBR, https://medicine.yale.edu/neuroscience/macbrain/) was analyzed. Also available for analysis were images from Nissl-stained sections from these brains at the same levels as the NPNF-stained sections; these were useful for determining the location and boundaries of different amygdalar nuclei. The following is a summarized account of protocols followed at the time brains were obtained.

4.1 Animals and perfusions

All procedures involving animals were carried out according to guidelines described in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). ID number, gender, and other details are listed in Table 1.

In short, all animals were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine/atropine (10 mg/0.01mg per kg BW) followed by IV catheterization and induction of a deep anesthetic state with sodium pentobarbital (25–50 mg/kg). The same was done for the fetal macaque upon caesarean delivery. Fetal, newborn, and infant macaques, and one adult macaque, were transcardially perfused with 500 mls of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 0.9% NaCl in 0.1 M phosphate buffer) followed by 1200–2000 mls of 4% paraformaldehyde (PF) in PBS. In one adult (B72), the fixative (3000 mls of 4% PF in PBS) contained 0.05% glutaraldehyde as well. All brains were removed and postfixed overnight at 4°C in 4% PF in PBS. The hemispheres were separated at the midsagittal plane and immersed in 20% sucrose (in PBS) until they sank.

4.2 Immunohistochemisty

Tissue processing was done either in-house as previously described (Duque et al., 2007, 2013) or by FD NeuroTechnologies, Inc. (Columbia, MD) as per our specifications. All processing steps, independent of processing site, were identical. In the latter case, after sucrose cryoprotection, one brain hemisphere was wrapped in gauze (non-woven 4” × 4” sponges) and sealed in a 250 ml Nalgene jar filled with cold 20–30% sucrose (in PBS), and then sent to FD NeuroTechnologies via overnight priority shipping at room temperature (RT). Brain hemispheres were cut in the coronal plane at 50 μm on a freezing microtome and sections stored in freezing solution (25% glycerol and 30% ethylene glycol by volume in phosphate buffer) until further processing. One hemisphere from each brain was sectioned in its entirety, producing 68–77 equally-spaced sections stained for NPNFs (Table 1). Other brain series from each brain (68–77 sections each) were stained for Nissl or other neurochemicals including the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and calretinin (CR).

All rinsing and incubations were done free floating in 0.1 M PBS. Stored and cryo-protected sections were thoroughly rinsed to remove the cryoprotectant solution and subsequently immersed in 0.2–0.5% hydrogen peroxidase (5–10 minutes) to inactivate endogenous peroxides. Sections were incubated, with gentle agitation, for 48–72 hours in a solution containing 0.3% Triton-X 100 and the primary antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody to NPNFs; clone SMI-32, BioLegend, San Diego CA; dilution: 1:1,000). After rinsing, sections were incubated in biotinylated horse anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector labs, Burlingame CA) (1:200, 1 h at RT) with 2–5% normal horse serum. Then, sections were incubated in avidinbiotin peroxidase complex (Vectastain elite ABC kit, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA; at RT, 4 hrs). The label was visualized using 0.05% 3’,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as a chromogen, precipitated by 0.01% hydrogen peroxide. After thorough washes, all sections were mounted on glass microscope slides, dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with Permount® (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA). The PV and CR stained sections were processed using the same ABC immunoperoxidase technique used for NPNFs. The antibodies were mouse anti-PV monoclonal antibody (1:2,500, cat. # P3088; MilliporeSigma, Burlington MA) and rabbit anti-CR polyclonal antibody (1:20,000, cat. #AB5054; MilliporeSigma).

4.3 Microscopy, scanning and posting

Sections were scanned with a 20x objective, using an Aperio CS2 HR scanner (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Digitized images were loaded and organized into Leica’s Aperio eSlide Manager. Galleries of zoomable and downloadable images were made for series of sections corresponding to the same brain and same label and loaded into MBR collection 6 following MBR established protocols.

4.4 Analysis

Images of six to seven NPNF-stained sections through the amygdala in each of the 11 brains were examined (Table 1). We also examined selected sections from these brains that were stained for Nissl, parvalbumin (PV), or calretinin (CR). Zooming produced high-resolution images of individual neurons (e.g., see Figs. 4A and 5). In the BNC (and cortical nuclei) it was easy to determine if NPNF+ neurons were PNs or NPNs on the basis of neuronal morphology and density. PNs constitute about 80–85% of the neurons in each BNC nucleus (McDonald, 1992b). They vary in somatic size depending on the nucleus in question (17–20 μm in diameter), and have fairly uniform pyramidal or piriform somata. In immunohistochemical studies they typically all stain the same; separate subpopulations are not observed using antibodies to most neuronal markers (McDonald et al., 2002). As a result, when PNs are stained in a nucleus the immunostained neurons are found in high density. Thus, in the present study NPNF+ PNs were identified in the Bmg on the basis of having fairly large pyramidal or piriform somata, and exhibiting a high density. In the monkey in the present study, as in the rat (McDonald and Mascagni, 2021), only their somata and proximal dendrites were stained for NPNFs.

In contrast, immunostained NPN subpopulations are always seen at much lower densities than PNs, and their somata typically exhibit considerably wide variation in shape and size. In the present study their NPNF staining was distinct from that of PNs in that their entire dendritic arborization appeared to be stained. They exhibited 2–4 primary dendrites that branched sparingly. This is the dendritic morphology that characterizes NPNs in Golgi preparations (McDonald and Augustine, 2020). In a previous study of NPNFs in the rat (McDonald and Mascagni, 2021) their identity as NPNs was confirmed by double-labeling with selective NPN markers (PV and SOM).

4.5 Primary antibody specificity

The mouse monoclonal antibody to NPNFs (Cat# 801701, clone SMI-32, BioLegend, San Diego CA; RRID AB_2564642) specifically recognizes nonphosphorylated high molecular weight neurofilament proteins (NF-H; ca. 200 kDa) in Western blots performed by the manufacturer. The antibody was purified by affinity chromatography.

The rabbit polyclonal antibody to calretinin (Cat# AB5054, RRID AB_2068506 MilliporeSigma, Burlington MA) recognizes a single 29 kDa band in Western Blots performed by the manufacturer, and binds to both calcium-bound and calcium-unbound forms of calretinin.

The specificity of the mouse monoclonal to parvalbumin (Cat# P3088, clone PARV-19, RRID AB_477329) has been determined through Western blot analysis of whole-brain homogenates, which yields a single band at the molecular weight of parvalbumin. Controls processed with preimmune sera or with preadsorbed antisera produced no staining (Celio and Heizmann, 1981).

Highlights

Nonphosphorylated neurofilament (NPNF) expression was studied in macaque amygdalas

All nuclei in the corticobasolateral amygdalar complex (CBL) contained NPNF neurons

A subpopulation of nonpyramidal neurons was NPNF+ in all CBL nuclei

In the magnocellular basal nucleus pyramidal neurons were also NPNF+

NPNF+ neurons were also seen the medial and central amygdalar nuclei
