Adults with Down syndrome (DS) are at risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Despite sharing trisomy 21, however, there is variability in the age of disease onset. This variability may mean that other factors, such as lifestyle, influence cognitive aging and disease timing. The present study assessed the association between everyday life physical activity using an actigraph accelerometer and cognitive functioning and early Alzheimer’s disease pathology via positron emission tomography amyloid-β and tau and diffusion tension imaging measures of white matter integrity in 61 non-demented adults with DS. Percent time in sedentary behavior and in moderate-to-vigorous activity were associated (negatively and positively, respectively) with cognitive functioning (r = −.472 to .572, p &lt;.05). Neither sedentary behavior nor moderate-to-vigorous activity were associated with amyloid-β or tau, but both were associated with white matter integrity in the superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (Fractional Anisotropy: r = −.397 to −.419, p &lt; .05; Mean Diffusivity: r = .400, p &lt; .05). Longitudinal studies are needed to determine if physical activity promotes healthy aging in DS.

pmc1. Introduction

Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder estimated to occur in 1 in 691 live births in the U.S. and is caused by the full or partial trisomy of chromosome 21 (Hobson-rohrer &amp; Samson-fang, 2006). Individuals with DS evidence an early onset and increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) relative to the general population. Virtually all adults with DS develop AD pathology by their 40s (Zigman et al., 2008) and 88% have clinical AD by age 65 years (Mccarron et al., 2014; Rubenstein et al., 2019). The near universal presence of AD pathology in middle-aged adults with DS underscores the genetic effect of trisomy 21 for AD. The three copies of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene associated with the trisomic chromosome 21 condition is posited to lead to an overproduction of the fragment of APP known as amyloid-β (Aβ) (Wiseman et al., 2015). Extracellular aggregation of Aβ is an early hallmark feature of AD that is followed by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of tau and then neurodegeneration (Jack et al., 2013; Trevisan et al., 2019). Micro-structural degeneration of white matter (WM), including loss of myelin sheaths, axons, and oligodendroglial cells, has also been posited to be part of AD pathology and found to occur prior to dementia onset in non-DS populations (Mayo et al., 2019; Nowrangi et al., 2015; O’Dwyer et al., 2011) and in non-demented adult withs DS (Patrick et al., 2020).

Despite shared trisomy 21, there is marked variability in the age of onset of AD pathology (Lao et al., 2016) and dementia in the DS population (Wilcock &amp; Griffin, 2013). In positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies using the biomarker [C-11] Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB), a subset of adults with DS evidenced Aβ accumulation in the striatum and/or neocortical regions in their 30s, whereas another subset did not until their late 40s or early 50s (Lao et al., 2017). In addition, approximately 10-15% of adults with DS are diagnosed with clinical AD in their late 40s or early 50s, whereas others remain cognitively stable into their 70s (Rubenstein et al., 2019; Wilcock &amp; Griffin, 2013). This variability may mean that non-genetic factors, including lifestyle, shape the timing of AD in DS and could be targeted in interventions to delay and/or prevent AD. Indeed, there has been a call by DS researchers to identify modifiable lifestyle factors to inform AD prevention efforts (Livingston et al., 2017). Research on non-DS populations has found that physical activity is a lifestyle factor that enhances physiological processes that mitigate aging-related cognitive decline and may reduce risk for AD (Dougherty et al., 2017; Franklin &amp; Tate, 2009; Stillman et al., 2016). Recent studies have reported that physical activity interventions (e.g., 30 minutes of exercise twice a week) are associated with improvements in cognition including executive functioning (Chen et al., 2014), processing speed, and memory in small samples of young adults with DS (Chen et al., 2014; Chen &amp; Ringenbach, 2016; Ptomey et al., 2018). However, to-date, no published research has examined potential associations between physical activity in everyday life and AD-related cognitive decline or biomarkers of early AD pathology in middle-aged adults with DS.

The specific mechanisms driving the beneficial effect of physical activity on age-related cognitive decline and risk of AD are not fully understood, but hypothesized to involve improving blood circulation to maximize nutrient and oxygen delivery to the brain, production of mitochondria that increase nutrients to the brain, and enhanced neurogenesis resulting from elevations in heart rate (Hoang et al., 2016). In cross-sectional studies, older adults without DS who engaged in higher levels of physical activity, have been found to perform better on cognitive measures of memory and executive functioning, relative to those who engage in less physical activity (Chang et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2017). In descriptive studies of non-DS older adults, those who engage in higher levels of physical activity have also been found to have a lower level of biomarkers of early AD pathology such as PET or CSF Aβ, higher glucose metabolism, and higher hippocampal volume (Dougherty et al., 2017; Okonkwo et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2014). Moreover, physical activity interventions have been associated with less progression in these AD biomarkers across time and better performance on cognitive measures of memory and visuospatial ability relative to physical inactive comparison groups (Okonkwo et al., 2014). There is also evidence that physical activity may have protective effects on neural substrates including stable or improved WM integrity in general population samples of older adults (e.g., Burzynska et al., 2017; Tian et al., 2015). For example, Tian and collegues (2015) found that older adults (aged ≥ 80 years) with less (versus more) sedentary lifestyles evidenced higher WM integrity as indexed by fracional ansiotropy in the frontal and temporal regions. Across these previous studies, time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and/or time spent in sedentary behavior have most frequently been used to assess physical activity, and both indices have been found to have important associations with cognitive functioning and risk for AD (Blodgett et al., 2015; Koster et al., 2012).

Physical activity may be particularly salient for protecting against age-related cognitive declines and delaying the onset of AD in DS. Relative to their typically developing peers, adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities engage in low levels of physical activity (Hilgenkamp et al., 2012; Izquierdo-Gomez et al., 2014; Wouters et al., 2019), and this includes adults with DS (Cowley et al., 2010; Mendonca et al., 2010). Moreover, DS specifically, is associated with health conditions that contribute to low physical activity, including chronotropic incompetence, impaired autonomic function, low muscular strength, and muscle hypotonia (Phillips &amp; Holland, 2011). In a review of studies on physical activity in adults with intellectual disability, researchers concluded that physical activity could be one of the most effective ways to improve aging and overall health in this population (Robertson et al., 2000). Physical activity interventions also have the advantage of being low cost, and may have a broader reach within the DS population relative to AD pharmaceutical interventions due to adverse drug side effects and/or pharmacokinetic interactions given the comorbid medical conditions of middle-aged adults with DS (Livingston et al., 2017).

The goal of the present study was to assess the association between physical activity and cognitive performance and AD biomarkers including PET Aβ, tau PET and WM integrity in non-demented adults with DS (aged 25 to 55 years). Analyses focused on the cognitive domains of memory, executive functioning, and visuospatial processing, motor planning and coordination, as well as dementia symptoms as these domains have been most consistently reported to show early decline associated with AD in DS (Hartley et al., 2017; Hithersay et al., 2017). Percent of time per week spent in sedentary behavior and in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were used to assess physical activity. In line with findings from non-DS populations, we hypothesized that adults with DS who engaged in less moderate-to-vigorous activity and more sedentary behavior would evidence more early AD pathology (biomarkers of Aβ, tau, and worse WM integrity) and worse cognitive performance. Understanding the association between physical activity and AD in DS has important implications for informing lifestyle interventions that could potentially delay and/or prevent AD in this genetically high-risk population.

2. Methods

2.1 Participants

Sixty-six non-demented adults with DS who were part of the Alzheimer’s Biomarker Consortium on Down Syndrome (ABC-DS; https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/abc-ds) participated in the study. These participants came from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and University of Pittsburgh ABC-DS sites. Inclusion criteria included being 25 years or older and having a mental age of ≥ 30 months, genetic testing confirming DS, no conditions contraindicative for brain imaging scans (e.g., pregnant or breastfeeding, metal in the body, or a history of claustrophobia or other behavioral concerns), and no evidence of clinical AD dementia (although they could have mild cognitive impairment [MCI], determined via a consensus process, 2.3.2) or medical or mental health conditions that impacted cognitive functioning. Internal Review Boards at sites reviewed and approved the study. Consent and/or assent was obtained from all participants. Table 1 provides sample socio-demographics.

2.2 Procedure

Adults with DS completed a two-day study visit. One day involved a battery of directly-administered cognitive measures that assessed memory, executive functioning, motor processing and control, and visuospatial processing, as well as dementia symptoms. On the second day, participants completed MRI and PET scans to assess Aβ and tau. In addition, MRI-based diffusion tensor imaging was added to the larger study protocol mid-way through data collection; thus, WM integrity was only assessed in 31 participants. Following these visits, adults with DS were sent home with a GT9X Actigraph accelerometer and instructed to wear it on their non-dominant wrist for 7 consecutive days. Adults with DS (with assistance from caregivers) jointly completed a physical activity daily record during the 7 days, and this was used to validate the actigraph data.

2.3 Measures

2.3.1 Socio-demographics.

Chronological age was calculated in years using date of birth and date of study visit. Body-Mass-Index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Biological sex was reported on by caregivers and was coded. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test- Fourth Edition (Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007) mental age administered at entry into the study, and when all participants were deemed to be cognitively stable, was used to assess premorbid level of intellectual disability. This measure is reliable and valid in adults with DS and highly correlated with IQ (Phillips, Loveall, Channell, &amp; Conners, 2014). The following mental age equivalents were used to determine intellectual disability level: mild: ≥ 9 years and moderate: 3 to 8 years.

2.3.2 Clinical AD Status.

Clinical AD status was based on a case consensus process involving a licensed psychologist, physician and staff who were blind to imaging and physical activity data. This process involved review of caregiver-reported and directly-administered measures of dementia, cognitive functioning, adaptive behavior, consideration of premorbid intellectual disability level, psychiatric and medical conditions and recent major life events. A detailed description of this process has been previously described (Handen et al., 2020). Clinical AD status categories were: a) cognitively stable; b) Mild Cognitive Impairment-DS (MCI-DS), indicating mild declines limited in scope; c) dementia, indicating marked cognitive decline and decreases in daily functioning; and d) unable to determine.

2.3.3 Episodic Memory.

The Cued Recall Test (Zimmerli &amp; Devenny, 1995) assesses episodic memory. The Free Recall and Cued Recall (number of objects correctly recalled in free recall and cued recall trials) and Cued Recall Intrusion (number of incorrect responses in the cued recall trials) scores have been found to be sensitive to dementia in DS (Zimmerli &amp; Devenny, 1995). This measure was also shown to be sensitive to Aβ prior to onset of clinical AD in adults with DS (Hartley et al., 2014, 2017).

2.3.4 Executive functioning.

The Stroop Dog and Cat Task (Nash &amp; Snowling, 2008) is a modified Stroop task for executive functioning shown to identify memory changes in DS. The Cat Dog Switch Error score is the number of errors made in the switch trail. The Stroop Dog and Cat Task has been established as valid and reliable in previous studies of adults with DS (Ball et al., 2008; Devenny et al., 2005).

2.3.5 Visuospatial ability.

The WISC-IV (Wechsler, 2004) Block Design and Haxby extension (Haxby, 1989) assesses visuospatial ability by having individuals attempt to replicate patterns using a series of red and white blocks. These tasks have been shown to be sensitive to dementia in DS (Schapiro et al., 1992). The Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration, 5th Edition (VMI; Beery et al., 2004) assess visual motor skills and has been shown to detect dementia symptoms in adults with DS (Krinsky-McHale et al., 2020; Temple et al., 2001).

2.3.6 Motor Planning and control.

The Purdue Pegboard (Vega, 1969) assesses motor processing and planning by having individuals first place pegs into holes using their dominant and then non-dominant, and then both hands together as quickly as they can. The Both hands score was used in current analyses. The single hand scores have been shown to be negatively associated with Aβ accumulation in non-demented adults with DS (Hartley et al., 2017) and the both hands score has been found to be associated with measures of motor coordination and executive functioning in adults with intellectual disabilities (Burt et al., 2005).

2.3.7 Dementia Symptoms.

The Down Syndrome Mental Status Examination (DSME; Haxby, 1989) assesses dementia symptoms broadly, including recall of personal information, orientation to season and day, immediate and delayed memory, language, and visuospatial function and praxis. The Dementia Questionnaire for People with Learning Disabilities (DLD; Evenhuis, 2018) assesses early dementia symptoms in adults with intellectual disability. The Sum of Cognitive Scores assesses short- and long- term memory and orientation. The Sum of Social Scores assess speech, practical skills, mood, activity and interest, and behavioral disturbance. The DLD has been found to be valid in DS (Elliott-King et al., 2016).

2.4 Imaging

2.4.1 Aβ and tau Magnetic resonance imaging.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted on 3.0T MRI scanners; specifically, a GE SIGNA 750 with an 8-channel head coil (University of Wisconsin-Madison site) and Siemens Magnetom Prisma scanner with a 64-channel head coil (University of Pittsburgh site). MRI data were used for PET-MRI registration, region definition, and magnetic resonance-guided correction of PET Aβ and tau data. At Wisconsin, T1-weighted MRI brain images were acquired in the sagital plane with a high resolution volumetric-spoiled gradient sequence (inversion time/echo time/repetition time = 400/3.0/7.4 ms, flip angle = 11°, slice thickness = 1.2 mm no gap, and matrix size = 256 × 256 × 196). At Pittsburgh, T1-weighted MRI brain images were acquired in the sagittal plane with a Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo sequence (inversion time/echo time/repetition time = 900/2.95/2300 ms, flip angle = 9.0°, slice thickness = 1.2 mm, and matrix size = 240 x 256 x 176).

2.4.2 WM Magnetic resonance imaging.

MRI data was also used for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which examines microstructural differences in water diffusion properties of tissue (Pierpaoli &amp; Basser, 1996). DTI was focused on mean diffusivity (MD) (assesses directionally averaged diffusivity to capture density of microstructural features) and fractional anisotropy (FA) (assesses directional variance of diffusivities). The DTI protocol involved 4 (University of Pittsburgh) or 6 (University of Wisconsin-Madison) non-diffusion weighted (b0) images and diffusion weighted images with a b-value of 1000s/mm2 in 48 non-collinear directions, matrix size: 128 x 128 with 56 slices, field of view: 24 x 24 x 14 cm3, and 2.5mm slice thickness. An in-house processing pipeline was used to draw on tools from FSL (Tournier et al., 2019) and the DiPy toolbox (Garyfallidis et al., 2014). Diffusion-weighted data were corrected for Gibbs’ ringing artifacts and eddy current distortions and head motion with outlier replacement. Diffusion tensors were estimated with robust estimator method, RESTORE (Chang et al., 2005). DTI was focused on MD and FA along the major association tracts including superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, and thalamo-cortical.

2.4.3 PET image acquisition:

PET measured Aβ and tau was assessed using nominal injections of 15 [11C] PiB (15 mCi) and [18F] AV-1451 (10 mCi), administered as 20 −30 s bolus injections followed by a saline flush. Data were reconstructed using iterative methods and corrected for deadtime, normalization, attenuation, scatter and radioactive decay. The PET data images were corrected on a frame-by-frame basis for motion. Summed images were created by integrating over 50-70 minutes post injection for [11C] PiB and 80-100 minutes post injection for [18F] AV-1451. [11C] PiB and 18F] AV-1451 indices of Aβ and tau were expressed as standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) using the cerebellar gray matter as the reference region. MR images were manually reoriented along the anterior-posterior commissure. PET images were then registered to the reoriented MR using PMOD software via maximization of normalized mutual information,

2.4.4 Aβ and tau Image Processing.

For Aβ, the global PiB score represented the average of nine signature brain regions, including the superior frontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, parietal cortex, precuneus, lateral temporal cortex, insula, and the striatum. Each region, was identified using the standard FreeSurfer 5.3 pipeline and Desikan-Killiany atlas and Clinical Imaging Center (CIC) atlas and a DS template (see Tudorascu et al., 2020) For the tau index, six image-based Braak regions corresponding to the six Braak stages (Braak et al., 2006) were used for the quantitation of [18F]AV-1451. The Braak stages show the progression of the neurofibrillary changes related to AD. Stages I shows lesions developing in the transentorhinal region. Stage II displays lesions extending into the entorhinal region. Stages III and IV show the disease progression into the neocortex. Stage V evidences the neocortical pathology extending to the frontal, superolateral, and occipital directions. Lastly, Stage VI shows the pathology reaching the secondary and primary neocortical areas and into the striatum. The Braak region SUVRs were determined from a volume weighted average of SUVRs in sets of FreeSurfer regions described in Schöll et al. (2016) except that the striatum was not included in Braak region 5.

2.5 Physical Activity

Each participant wore a GT9X Actigraph accelerometer (Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, FL) on the wrist for a consecutive 7 days to measure habitual physical activity in free-living condition. All actigraph data was collected at a sampling frequency of 30 Hz with a 60-s epoch to capture intermittent movement. The accelerometer has been previously demonstrated to be reliable and valid (Hwang et al., 2018). Participants were instructed to wear the monitor at all times, except during water-based activities (e.g., swimming)—which were recorded in the daily records. Each accelerometer file was manually cleaned to only include data collected between wake time and bed time and then assessed for nonwear time using ActiLife software (version 6.13.4) and Troiano (2008) algorithms. Only days with ≥10 hours of valid wear time were included in analyses. The Freedson Adult (1998) cut points were selected, a uniaxial algorithm. Data was reduced into physical activity intensity categories based on counts per minute: sedentary (&lt;99), light physical activity (100-1951), moderate physical activity (1952-5724), vigorous physical activity (5725-9498), very vigorous physical activity (&gt;9499).

2.6 Data Analysis Plan

Descriptive statistics, histograms, and boxplots were used to examine the distribution of study variables and identify any outliers. The socio-demographics of the participants with versus without DTI data was compared using independent sample t-tests. Pearson correlations were first conducted to identify socio-demographics (age, BMI, biological sex, data collection site, and premorbid level of intellectual disability) related to our main study variables – physical activity, cognitive functioning, and AD biomarkers – to allow us to control for these variables in primary analyses. Partial correlations were then used to examine the association between percent of time spent in sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous activity and cognitive functioning and the AD biomarkers of Aβ, tau, and WM after adjusting for relevant socio-demographic variables (i.e., those significantly associated with main study variables). Mean (i.e., average across the seven days) valid actigraph wear time was also included in all partial correlations. Finally, we re-ran the above partial correlations after excluding participants with MCI in order to determine if the overall pattern of findings was driven by this subset of participants who were exhibiting early and subtle cognitive signs of transitioning into clinical AD. Findings of p ≤ .05 (two-tailed) were considered significant.

3. Results

3.1 Socio-Demographic Analyses

Percent of time spent in sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous activity had a normal distribution without skew (kurtosis: 0.83 and 0.77, respectively). Of the 66 participants, 5 (8%) were excluded from analyses for not having at least 4 days (3 weekdays, 1 weekend) of actigraph data with 10 hours/day of valid wear time. The average wear time of the remaining 61 participants was 828.77 min/day (SD = 85.35), with a mean percent time in sedentary behavior of 42.98 (SD = 10.51) and in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity of 11.16 (SD =7.07) when treating sleep as non-wear time. Five participants did not have PET imaging data due to excessive motion (n = 4) or because they elected to not participate in that portion of the study (n = 1). Table 1 presents sample socio-demographics and the mean, standard deviation, and range for physical activity, cognitive, and AD biomarker variables. Participants ranged in biological age from 25 to 55 years, with a mean of 37.47 years (SD = 7.86), the majority were white (98%) and lived with family (59%), and about half were female (n = 33, 52%). At entry into the study, 19 (31%) participants had mild intellectual disability and 42 (69%) had moderate intellectual disability. The mean BMI of participants was 32.72 (SD = 7.89), with 42% (n = 26) of participants having obesity (i.e., BMI ≤ 30). Of the 61 participants, 55 were determined to be cognitively stable and 6 had MCI-DS based on the case consensus process (described in 2.3.2). Independent t-tests and chi-square statistics indicated no significant differences between the 31 participants with DTI data versus the 30 without DTI data in biological sex (X2=0.157, p = .692). However, the participants with DTI data were older (t(60) = 2.176, p = .034) and more likely to have mild (rather than moderate) intellectual disability (X2=8.74, p = .003) than those without DTI data. There were no differences in percent of time in sedentary behavior (t(60) = −.429, p = .670) or in moderate-to-vigorous activity (t(60) = −.777, p = .440) between those with versus without DTI data.

Table 2 presents the associations between socio-demographics (age, BMI, biological sex, data collection site, and premorbid level of intellectual disability) and main study variables. Chronological age was significantly negatively associated with time spent in sedentary behavior (r = −.270 to p = .036) and in moderate-to-vigorous activity (r = −.266, p = .038). Chronological age was significantly positively associated with PET Aβ (r = .630, p = .000), PET tau in all regions (r = .401 to .535, p &gt;.010), WM integrity mean diffusivity across all regions and inferior longitudinal fasciculus right fractional anisotropy (r = −.364 to 561, p &gt;.050) and Cued Recall Intrusions (r = .283, p =.027). BMI was significantly positively correlated to Free and Cued Recall (r = .304, p =.043). Biological sex was significantly associated with the DSMSE (r = .289, p =.024), with females scoring higher than males. Data collection site was significantly associated with PET Aβ (r = .262, p = .047), but no other main study variables. Level of intellectual disability was associated with cognitive measures (Free + Cued Recall, Cued Recall intrusions, VMI, Block Design, DSMSE, and DLD Cognitive) (r = −.542 - .328, p &lt;.050), with adults with mild intellectual disability performing better across measures than those with moderate intellectual disability. Socio-demographics significantly associated with primary study variables, as well as mean wear time, were controlled for in the following analyses.

3.2 Physical Activity and Cognitive Functioning

Table 3 presents Pearson correlations and partial correlations (adjusting for chronological age, biological sex, BMI, and level of intellectual disability and wear time) between percentage of time in sedentary behavior and in moderate-to-vigorous activity and cognitive performance. Percent of time in sedentary behavior was significantly correlated with Cat and Dog Stroop Errors (r = .305, p = .017), Block Design (r = −.276, p = .032), DSMSE (r = −.317, p =.013), and with caregiver-reported DLD Social (r = .377, p = .003), and Cognitive (r = .471, p =&lt;.001) Percent of time in sedentary behavior was significantly negatively correlated with VMI (r = −.404, p = .009), after adjusting for socio-demographics and wear time. In all cases, greater time spent in sedentary behavior was associated with worse cognitive performance and more dementia symptoms. Percent of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity was significantly correlated with Cat and Dog Stroop Errors (r = −.360, p = .016), VMI (r = .456, p = .003), Block Design (r = .464, p = .002), DSMSE (r = .337, p = .034), and caregiver-reported DLD Social (r = −.346, p = .020) and Cognitive scores (r = −.363, p =.018), after adjusting for relevant socio-demographics and mean wear time. In all cases, greater time spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity was associated with better cognitive performance and fewer dementia symptoms.

3.3 Physical Activity and Imaging AD Biomarkers

Pearson correlations followed by partial correlations adjusting for relevant socio-demographics were used to examine the association between physical activity and Aβ, tau, and WM integrity (Tables 4, 5, and 6). There were no significant associations between percent of time spent in sedentary behavior or in moderate-to-vigorous activity and PET PiB SUVr globally. Similarly, there were no significant associations between percent of time spent in sedentary behavior or in moderate-to-vigorous activity and in tau PET across the six Braak regions. In contrast, there were significant associations between physical activity and WM integrity. After controlling for relevant socio-demographics (i.e., chronological age and site) and wear time, percent of time spent in sedentary behavior was significantly negatively associated with the superior longitudinal fasciculus right (r = −..387, p = .045) and inferior longitudinal fasciculus left (r = −.387, p = .067) and right (r = −.419, p = .041) Fractional Anisotropy and positively associated with superior longitudinal fasciculus right Mean Diffusivity (r = .400, p = .039) but no associations with other WM indices. Percent of time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was significantly associated with integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus left (r = .407, p = .023), inferior longitudinal fasciculus left (r = .385, p = .032) and right (r = .356, p = .050) Fractional Anisotropy. There were no other significant associations between percent of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity and WM integrity. In all significant associations, greater time spent in sedentary behavior and less time spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity was associated with lower WM integrity.

The above partial correlations examining the association between percent of time in sedentary behavior and in moderate-to-vigorous activity and cognitive functioning and AD biomarkers were re-run after excluding participants with MCI (n = 6). These follow-up analyses were conducted to determine if findings were driven by the subset of participants with MCI. Percent of time in sedentary activity continued to be significantly associated with Cat and Dog Stroop Errors (r = .584, p &lt; .001), Cued Recall Intrusions (r = .415, p = .012), VMI (r = .390, p = .019), Block Design (r = −.478, p = .003), DSMSE (r = −.429, p = .009), DLD Social (r = −.384, p = .021), and DLD Social (r =−.441, p = .007) in the same directions as was true for the full sample. Percent of time in moderate-to-vigorous activity continued to be significantly associated with Cat and Dog Stroop Errors (r = −.418, p = .011), VMI (r = .383, p = .021), Block Design (r = .413, p = .012), DSMSE (r = −.416, p = .012), DLD Cognitive (r = .636, p &lt; .001), and DLD Social (r = .448, p =.006), and was now also significantly associated with Free + Cued Recall (r = .398, p = .016), and Cued Recall Intrusions (r = −.334, p = .047).

There were no significant associations between percent of time in sedentary behavior or in moderate-to-vigorous activity and PET amyloid-β (r = −.010 to .080, p &gt;.05) or tau across Braak regions (r =.067 to .201, p &gt;.050), as was true for the full sample. Percent of time in sedentary behavior continued to be significantly associated with WM integrity in the superior (r = −.424, p = .031) and inferior (r = −.396, p = .045) longitudinal fasciculus right tracts using fractional anisotropy, and with WM integrity in the superior longitudinal fasciculus right tract using mean diffusivity (r = .411, p = .037). There were no significant associations between percent of time in moderate-to-vigorous activity and WM integrity, in line with findings on the full sample.

4. Discussion

We found extensive associations between physical activity in everyday life and cognitive functioning in adults with DS in models adjusting for socio-demographics and wear time. These findings build on previous research reporting beneficial effects of physical activity for cognitive performance in young adults with DS (Chen et al., 2014; Chen &amp; Ringenbach, 2016; Pape et al., 2021; Ptomey et al., 2018), by showing that physically active lifestyles may continue to have beneficial effects on cognitive functioning in middle-adulthood. Specifically, young and middle-aged adults with DS who spent more time in moderate-to-vigorous activity and/or less time in sedentary behavior in their everyday life demonstrated higher executive functioning, episodic memory, and visuospatial construction ability and fewer symptoms of dementia than did adults with DS with less physically active lifestyles. The robust associations between physical activity and cognitive functioning remained after excluding the subset of adults with DS who had MCI (n = 6). Thus, engaging in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior appear to have important associations with cognitive performance prior to clinical signs of early AD-related cognitive decline in DS. It is important to note that the current study cannot address the direction of effects between physical activity and cognitive functioning. It is possible that lower cognitive functioning and/or negative mood lead to physical inactivity or that both physical activity and cognitive functioning are shaped by a third mechanism.

The current study did not find associations between time spent in sedentary behavior nor time spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity and PET imaging biomarkers of Aβ and tau in our sample of young and middle-aged adults with DS who did not yet have clinical AD dementia. This was true in analyses on the full sample, as well as, the follow-up analyses excluding adults with DS deemed to have MCI. These findings may mean that the genetic effect of trisomy 21 strongly shapes the emergence of Aβ and tau AD pathology as adults with DS age, such that any additional effects of physical activity are overshadowed in small-sized samples and/or may not add to differences in the timing of these early AD pathological processes. Alternatively, physical activity may not shift the age at which Aβ and tau pathology develop in DS, however, it is still possible that physical activity mitigates the effect of these changes on cognition, as has been shown in non-DS populations (Fenesi et al., 2017; Sanders et al., 2020). Future longitudinal research should test the potential moderating role of physical activity in the association between increases in Aβ and tau and declines in cognition across time in DS.

In contrast to our findings for biomarkers of Aβ and tau, time spent in sedentary behavior, but not time spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity, was associated with MRI-based biomarkers of WM integrity, after adjusting for age, site, and wear time. Specifically, greater time spent in sedentary behavior was associated with lower WM integrity in the superior longitudinal fasciculus right tract, and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus left and right tracts using fractional anisotropy. Greater time spent in sedentary behavior was also associated with lower WM integrity in the superior longitudinal right tract using mean diffusivity. These associations remained even after excluding adults with DS with MCI. The superior longitudinal fasciculus is the dominant lateral WM tract that connects the frontal cortex to the parietal, occipital and temporal lobes (Kamali et al., 2014). Decreases in WM integrity in this tract is thought to cause impairments in a range of cognitive domains including speech and language, attention, visuospatial understanding, and motor control and processing (Gold et al., 2010; Madden et al., 2007; Stufflebeam et al., 2008). The inferior longitudinal fasciculus is also a long-range WM tract and connects the occipital and temporal-occipital areas of the brain to the anterior temporal areas (Herbet et al., 2018). Impairments in WM have been reported to occur in AD in adults without DS (Bosch et al., 2012; Mito et al., 2018). Thus, our findings may mean that reducing sedentary behavior could protect against impairments in WM integrity in adults with DS. The beneficial effect of physical activity on WM integrity, however, may operate through cardiovascular disease or other pathophysiological processes that are not directly tied to AD, given the lack of an association between physical activity and PET Aβ and tau in the current sample. Cardiovascular disease, which is related to low physical activity, is associated with WM impairment in non-DS populations (e.g., Moroni et al., 2018). It is possible that WM impairments may go on to exacerbate the effects of early AD pathology. In other words, adults with DS with less intact WM may be less able to compensate for early AD pathological insults. It is also possible that impairments in WM lead to declines in physical activity in adults with DS. Future longitudinal studies are needed to assess time-ordered pathways and test these hypotheses.

This study should be interpreted in light of its strengths and limitations. In terms of strengths, the study drew on observable measures including directly administered measures of cognitive functioning, PET and MRI-imaging biomarkers of AD, and actigraph accelerometer measurement of physical activity. In terms of limitations, while actigraph accelerometers have been shown to be reliable and valid for assessing physical activity, algorithms and thresholds specific for the DS population have not been established. Research on non-DS populations have used waist-worn algorithms and thresholds to interpret wrist-worn data (Mannini et al., 2013); however, wrist-worn data underestimates some forms of physical activity (e.g., stationary bicycling) and overestimates others (Pedišić &amp; Bauman, 2015). The Freedson (1998) is among the most common uniaxial algorithms used in research, but may overestimate light physical activity relative to sedentary behavior and underestimate vigorous physical activity (Lyden et al., 2011). As a result, our study focused on the relative differences within our DS sample to understand if more versus less time engaged in sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous activity was associated with AD-related cognitive and pathology. Future research should determine if traditional actigraph algorithms and thresholds need to be altered for DS and to identify specific thresholds of physical activity (e.g., at least 100 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous activity) associated with optimal aging in DS. The current study is also limited in race/ethnicity and only included adults with a mental age level of ≥ 3 years; thus, findings may not generalize to the broader DS population and there is an important need to diverse DS samples.

Findings have implications for social policies and interventions aimed at promoting healthy cognitive aging and delaying and/or preventing AD in DS. While cross-sectional, our study suggests that there are important connections between physical activity and cognitive functioning and WM integrity. If these associations are confirmed in future longitudinal studies, then creating social policies and interventions that increase physical activity may offer a pathway to preserve cognitive functioning for more years in adults with DS.
