Background:

Purposeful social interactions are important for healthy aging. We conducted a pilot trial of SPEAK! (Seniors Promoting English Acquisition and Knowledge), an intervention providing older volunteers with a safe, accessible opportunity to converse via webcam with English-language learners (ELLs).

Methods:

A neurologically-mixed sample of older adults was randomized to eight weekly, webcam conversations with ELLs or a waitlist control. Outcomes included the Cognitive Change Index (CCI) and surveys of program satisfaction. Here, we report on session completion, intervention satisfaction, and follow-up CCI scores. Exploratory analyses of CCI intervention effects controlled for baseline CCI scores and the interaction between group and baseline CCI.

Results:

Participants (N=38) were on average 70.8 years of age, 28/38 were White, and 16/38 demonstrated possible cognitive impairment on the RBANS. Pairs completed 115/136 sessions (85%) and all volunteers said they would recommend the program. Controlling for the interaction between baseline CCI and randomization group, SPEAK! volunteers had better follow-up CCI scores than controls (p=.018). Improvements in CCI were greater among participants with fewer baseline memory problems.

Conclusions:

SPEAK! was feasible and appreciated by older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Larger studies should confirm benefits for memory and other determinants of quality of life.

Lack of social engagement and purpose, often labeled as the “epidemic of loneliness,” are increasingly common risk factors for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and social withdrawal is a commonly recognized feature of the condition.1 Rates of loneliness have doubled since the 1980s, and as more older adults live alone, strategies are greatly needed to increase meaningful social engagement in order to preserve cognitive functioning and enhance quality of life.2 Some older adults with cognitive deficits avoid social interactions that might feel challenging, and the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the urgency of supporting meaningful interactions for older adults at risk for MCI while allowing them to minimize their exposure to infection. Given the expected doubling of the over-65 population by 2060, as many as 15 million Americans are projected to have MCI that year.3

Volunteering improves wellbeing and other health outcomes for older adults.4,5 Helping others increases the life expectancy of the volunteer whether the help they provide is instrumental or emotional.6 Volunteering can protect against cognitive decline through both neurological and psychological mechanisms.4,5,7 Volunteering reduces depressive symptoms,8,9 improves physical functioning,4 increases positive health behaviors, and reduces hospitalization rates. Volunteerism and the cultivation of a sense of “mattering”10,11 are especially important for older adults, because purpose is one of the dimensions of wellbeing that decreases the most with age.12 People with a greater sense of purpose have better health behaviors;13,14 as well as a lower risk of stroke,15 poor diabetes control,16 sleep disturbance, and early death.17 Community-dwelling older adults with greater purpose in life have a substantially decreased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.18

We developed an intervention designed to increase meaningful social interactions among older adults including those with normal cognition or subjective reports of cognitive decline. The SPEAK! program (Seniors Promoting English Acquisition and Knowledge) connects older adults via webcam for the purpose of enabling semi-structured conversations between them and adults who speak English as a second language and want to improve their English fluency, i.e., English language learners (ELLs). Because older adults at risk for cognitive decline can serve as SPEAK! volunteers from their home and at times they find convenient, the intervention has potentially much broader reach and flexibility than in-person volunteering opportunities. A nationally-representative study demonstrated that videoconferencing is the only communication technology shown to prevent depression among older adults.19 Two pilot studies have shown that people with MCI actively engage in web-enabled conversational interactions and that such conversations may improve their depressive symptoms and cognition.20,21

SPEAK! incorporates fundamental principles of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) and Cognitive Training that improve outcomes for people across the spectrum of cognitive decline.22,23 CST may preserve or even improve neuroplasticity and hippocampal neurogenesis.24 In the SPEAK! program, volunteers are challenged to hear vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar in unstandardized ways and to think of creative solutions such as alternative phraseologies or examples when misunderstandings occur.25

In Phase 1 of the SPEAK! evaluation, 10 pairs of older adult volunteers and ELLs had hour-long webcam conversation sessions over six weeks.26 Pairs completed 78% of scheduled sessions, and only 7% of sessions were missed because the volunteer cancelled or failed to appear. Qualitative interviews at follow-up suggested that participants felt comfortable and engaged. No negative experiences were observed by staff during sessions or reported by participants in follow-up interviews.

As reported in the study protocol (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04717479) the primary aim for Phase 2 of the study was to demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting and consenting a minimum of 35 older adults with subjective cognitive decline within six months, and randomizing participants into a pilot trial in which SPEAK! outcomes would be compared to outcomes in a waitlist control group. Our primary recruitment-based goal was met: 36 volunteers were consented within six months of initiating recruitment. Here, we report secondary, exploratory analyses of outcomes from the pilot randomized trial in which we examined post-intervention differences in Cognitive Change Index (CCI) scores between SPEAK! participants and waitlist controls.27

Methods

Eligibility and screening of older adult volunteers and their ELL partners

Our primary source of recruitment for older adults was a registry maintained by the University of Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC; NIH-NIA P30 AG072931). The registry includes information about individuals willing to be contacted regarding studies, with some participants having undergone detailed neuropsychologic evaluations and receiving a consensus conference diagnosis of MCI. Additional candidate participants were identified via the university’s research recruitment portal and advertisements in social media. All potential volunteers were screened prior to enrollment by a trained research assistant and were eligible for further evaluation if they had a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 12 or higher.28 Eligible older adult participants had to be: 55+ years of age, fluent speakers of English, and able to participate in a videoconference via a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. We used a modified version of the University of California, San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC) and “teach-back” during the consent process to ensure that participants understood study procedures including potential risks and benefits.29,30 All older adult participants provided informed consent and their verbal agreement was audio-recorded.

Most ELLs were identified via social media campaigns that ran via Facebook and Instagram between July 2021 and April 2022. Additional ELLs were identified via the University of Michigan English Language Institute, which serves non-native English-speaking students and staff on campus. To be eligible, ELLs had to be 18+ years of age and able to participate in a videoconference via a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. ELLs were expected to have a basic ability to understand and speak English. Study staff evaluated their language competence at enrollment during a 10-minute conversation in which ELLs were scored using a standardized rubric on dimensions of fluency, pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, and ability to speak on specific topics.

Randomization

After completing baseline assessments, participants were randomized to the SPEAK! intervention or a waitlist control group. Allocation was concealed using sequentially-numbered electronic documents containing computer-generated treatment assignments.

The SPEAK! Intervention

The SPEAK! study team developed an online platform for video calls similar in functionality to Zoom or GoToMeeting, but with a simplified user interface and additional features unique to the program. The platform allowed users to access information and communicate with others via: the program’s videoconferencing website, asynchronous messaging between sessions, and live in-session text chat. Platform design included input from specialists in user-centered design31 with a focus on icon-based content and a menu of functions to facilitate familiarity and reduce language barriers. The platform allowed for access by three user types: administrators (sysops), staff, and participants. Administrative and staff level accounts facilitated the enrollment and pairing of participants, including a scheduling feature to indicate the session date, time, and frequency of recurrence. Both email and text message reminders were available to participants to promote session attendance, including an email reminder 24 hours prior to a scheduled session and a text message reminder one hour prior to the scheduled session. Written materials designed to facilitate conversations and language practice were available via the website. The platform facilitated recordings of the sessions, and retained secure logs of system use, including logons, logoffs, and system engagement (e.g., chat, asynchronous messaging, material review, session schedule modifications).

Both volunteers and ELLs participated separately in a one-hour orientation with staff conducted via videoconferencing. Program orientation for older volunteers emphasized strategies to ensure that they: could hear and understand during the video conversations, were comfortable communicating using the webcam and software, and understood strategies for handling possible difficulties understanding their partner, including the use of platform tools such as live chat. For ELLs, orientation emphasized strategies they could use to be more effectively understood, and how to manage instances where the volunteer might get nervous or frustrated. Users were alerted that staff would attend each session and be available to help redirect conversations if needed. We reviewed strategies for giving positive feedback, provided concrete strategies that ELLs could use to communicate their appreciation so that the older adult felt effective and engaged, and suggested alternative ways of phrasing in the event of a miscommunication. All orientations included a discussion of topics that both parties should avoid, such as financial problems or potentially contentious political or religious differences. Participants were instructed regarding the types of information that they should never share, such as financial data, and we emphasized the importance of being available at scheduled times and communicating in advance if availability changed.

Pairs were assigned based on their scheduling availability during the week. Once assigned and after completing orientation, pairs participated in up to eight, weekly hour-long conversation sessions. Prior meta-analyses of factors determining the impact of volunteering indicate that effects are not sensitive to the number or duration of sessions.12 All videoconference sessions were attended by study staff who introduced the session, ensured that both parties were comfortable and able to use the technology, and assisted with any technical problems with the video, sound, or chat feature. Volunteers were provided with a suggested session outline. More detailed information about potential session topics was provided via PDF documents available via the website, including potential ice-breaker questions, common English idioms, and conversation starters.

Data Collection

For volunteers, we collected basic sociodemographic data and cognitive functioning assessment information at enrollment, including the person’s gender, race/ethnicity, age, level of education, and MoCA score. We performed neuropsychological tests after acquiring informed consent in order to ensure that there was no clinical conversion or reversion in the time between participant identification and study enrollment. Measures included the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS)32,33 and the Cognitive Change Index (CCI).27 CCI scores correlate significantly with objective tests of global cognition including the Mini-Mental Status Examination, tests of delayed recall, and tests of language functioning.27 Here, we report on potential intervention effects on CCI scores. For ELLs, we collected basic sociodemographic descriptors as well as the person’s primary language.

Staff maintained detailed records regarding completed sessions and those that were missed. Staff took notes during each session using a structured form to assess factors such as the extent to which participants used materials, the topics discussed, and the proportion of time in which each party was listening versus speaking. As part of the follow-up survey, volunteers completed a structured questionnaire of their satisfaction with the program.

Baseline characteristics of volunteers were examined for the sample overall and separately by randomization group. Differences between groups in CCI scores at follow-up controlling for baseline scores were examined using Poisson regression to account for the limited possible range of scores. Similar findings were observed in analyses using negative binomial regression. The initial model predicted CCI scores only as a function of participants’ baseline CCI score and randomization group. Exploratory analyses suggested that intervention effects were strongly influenced by CCI baseline score, and a second model was fit including as an additional predictor an intervention-by-baseline CCI interaction term. To illustrate potential intervention effects, we used this interactive model to predict the expected follow-up CCI score for each randomization group, assuming that baseline scores were at the 33rd and 66th percentile of the baseline distribution.

Results

Participant Characteristics

A total of 143 potential older adult volunteers were identified, of which 62 were assessed for eligibility, 49 were consented, and 44 were randomized (Figure 1 CONSORT diagram). A total of 38 older adults (86%, 38/44) completed follow-up surveys at eight weeks including 17 randomized to the SPEAK! intervention and 21 randomized to the waitlist control group.

On average, older volunteers were 70.8 years (range 55-92 years; Table 1). Volunteers were somewhat more likely to be women than men (60.5%, 23/38) and the majority were White (73.7%, 28/38) and married/partnered (63.2%, 24/38). Most reported at baseline that their overall health was good or very good (84.2%, 32/38), and half reported that their memory at baseline was good or very good (50.0%, 19/38). Neuropsychologic review of baseline RBANS scores suggested possible memory impairment in 16/38 (42%) participants, with 6 additional participants demonstrating possible visuospatial deficits.32,33 The average MoCA score of enrollees was 22.8 out of 30 (SD: 4.4). Scores of 26 and above are considered within the normal range. One participant in each randomization group had a score of &lt; 15. The average baseline CCI score for the sample was 43.8 (SD: 17.1).

ELLs were originally from a variety of countries outside of the United States, including Mexico (6), other Latin American countries (5), Asia (4), Belarus (1), and Madagascar (1). Thirteen of the ELLs were women and the remaining 4 were men. Two ELLs had some college education, and the remainder had either a four-year college education (n=7) or more advanced training (n=8).

Session Completion and Session Satisfaction

Session completion rates were high, with no indication that session attendance declined over successive weeks in the program. Overall, pairs completed 115 out of 136 sessions (85%). There was no correlation between the number of sessions completed and either intervention participants’ baseline CCI score (r = .04, P = .88) or their baseline delayed memory score from the RBANS (r = .01, P = .91). At follow-up, satisfaction with participation in SPEAK! was high for older adult volunteers (Table 2). All 17 volunteers reported that they “enjoyed their conversations with their partner,” none reported that they felt uncomfortable because of “differences between [them] and their partner,” and 100% reported that they would recommend the program to other people “like [them].” The majority of volunteers (13/17) reported that they had plans to keep in contact with their partner after the program ended. Interestingly, although the program provided a general agenda for conversation sessions, 10/17 volunteers reported that they did not follow that agenda, and only 2/17 reported that they “ran out of things to talk about.”

Intervention Effects on CCI Scores

In the initial regression model predicting follow-up CCI score as a function of baseline score and intervention group (Table 3, Model A), we observed no difference in predicted follow-up CCI scores between groups. However, when the potential interaction between randomization group and baseline CCI score was included in the model, there was a significant difference between groups, as measured by the main effect of the intervention (P=.018) and the interaction term (P=.004). To illustrate these relationships, we calculated the predicted endpoint CCI score among intervention and control participants for cutoffs in baseline CCI scores representing the lowest and highest tertile of the distribution (scores of 32 and 43, respectively; Figure 2). The predicted mean endpoint CCI score for participants with baseline CCI scores less than 32 (i.e., better scores) was significantly lower among older adults randomized to SPEAK! (mean: 27.1; 95% CI: 25.2, 29.1) than controls (mean 35.9; 95% CI: 34.7, 37.1). While the model also predicted a relative improvement in CCI scores among participants with baseline scores &gt; 43, the between group difference was smaller. Specifically, in this group, the predicted mean endpoint CCI score was 56.0 for participants randomized to SPEAK! (95% CI: 45.0, 66.9) and 59.8 for participants randomized to the control group (95% CI: 51.6, 67.9).

Discussion

In this pilot trial, we found that the SPEAK! intervention was well-received by this neurologically-mixed sample of older adults, and session completion rates were high. Even though pairs were matched only based on their scheduling availability (i.e., rather than based on mutual interests or other personal characteristics), older adult volunteers found the interactions gratifying and most reported an interest in maintaining contact with their partner after the end of the intervention. Most participants reported that they never ran out of things to talk about – despite the fact that the majority chose a free-flowing conversation rather than an interaction driven by our suggested agenda.

These findings are important because a recent narrative review points out that very few intervention studies have targeted social engagement among older adults at risk for cognitive decline, despite research demonstrating the important role that loneliness and isolation play as risk factors for physical, emotional, and cognitive deficits.31 Social isolation and loneliness are growing public health concerns among older adults. The proportion of people who live alone increases with age, and most women over age 85 live by themselves. As many as one in seven individuals with cognitive impairment live alone, which increases their risk for under-treatment of psychiatric issues, self-neglect, and numerous other problems.34 These trends pre-date COVID-19, but have been substantially exacerbated during the pandemic.35

It is important to note that the SPEAK! model is potentially impactful for older adults at risk for cognitive decline in part because it represents an opportunity to talk about positive relationships and events in their lives, focus on activities that make life worth living, and feel useful again. Purposeful altruistic activities, positive social interactions, and a sense of mastery and achievement are core tenets of Positive Psychology and reflected in SPEAK! volunteers’ role as language “Coach.” Evidence shows that interventions focused on positive aspects of well-being instead of focusing exclusively on deficits can improve depression and anxiety,36 as well as a broad range of other physical and mental health outcomes.5,8,37 Feedback from participants in this pilot study suggest that this role as a coach in SPEAK! resonates with them precisely because it takes advantage of their decades of real-world experience and training to address the widely-recognized need for integrating immigrants into the broader economy and society.38

In a broader implementation program, SPEAK! volunteers would have ample opportunities to interact with English language learners (ELLs) in part because of the large unmet need for English language practice in the United States. The foreign-born population in the United States increased from 14 million in 1980 to 40 million in 2010. In 2012, 85% of these residents reported speaking a language other than English in their home, and roughly 11.7 million spoke English either “not well” or “not at all.”39 SPEAK! provides a unique, 1-on-1 opportunity for ELLs to converse with a fluent English-speaker (in this case an older adult volunteer), improving the ELL’s confidence, and potentially expanding their employment opportunities.

It is important to emphasize that examination of intervention effects on CCI scores was a secondary, exploratory analysis for this pilot trial designed mainly to establish the feasibility of recruiting and retaining older adults at risk for dementia and their ELL partners. However, these data suggest that SPEAK! and similar interventions may improve perceived cognitive change in the short-term. Given the limited size and scope of this study, a number of questions remain. These include whether the current results could be replicated in a larger randomized trial with longer term outcomes, and whether participants’ perceptions of their cognitive functioning reflect improvements in clinician-administered tests of cognitive decline. Improvements in socialization and purpose may improve older adults’ mood, and outcomes such as dimensions of psychological wellbeing and depression are also important to consider in future analyses of this limited sample, as well as in larger studies.
