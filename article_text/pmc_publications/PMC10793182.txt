Background:

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are altered many years before the onset of clinical symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Incorporating clinical symptom onset time into biomarker modeling may enhance our understanding of changes preceding MCI.

Objective:

Using a new analytical approach, we examined patterns of biomarker change prior to MCI symptom onset among individuals who progressed from normal cognition to MCI, stratified based on the age of symptom onset. We also analyzed biomarker patterns of change among participants who remained cognitively normal, and examined potential modifiers of biomarker trajectories, including demographics and apolipoprotein E (APOE) status.

Methods:

Analyses included 93 participants who progressed from normal cognition to MCI and 186 participants who remained cognitively normal, over an average follow-up period of 16.2 years. CSF biomarkers, including Aβ42, Aβ40, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), were measured using the fully automated Lumipulse assays.

Results:

Among participants who progressed to MCI, Aβ42/Aβ40 decreased, and t-tau and p-tau181 increased. For participants who did not progress to MCI, CSF biomarkers showed relatively stable patterns. In both progressors and non-progressors, APOE4 carriers showed lower Aβ42/Aβ40 levels (compared to non-carriers) at each point of the mean curves. Among non-progressors, APOE4 carriers had higher levels of p-tau181, p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40), and t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40). Additionally, among those who did not progress, female sex was associated with higher levels of t-tau, p-tau181, t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40), and p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40).

Conclusions:

These findings suggest that this analytic approach may provide additional insights into biomarker changes during early phases of AD.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein and tau reflect the primary pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1]. These biomarkers are hypothesized to undergo accelerated changes years-to-decades before the onset of clinical symptoms, during the preclinical phase of AD [2, 3]. Several studies have shown that these CSF measures are altered many years before the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [4–7].

There remain a number of unanswered questions regarding the patterns of CSF changes prior to MCI symptom onset, particularly in relation to the age of clinical symptom onset. For example, it remains unclear whether changes in biomarkers prior to MCI symptom onset are the same among individuals who develop symptoms of MCI at a younger age (i.e., 60 to 70) compared to older age (i.e., 70 to 80). Similarly, little is known about the patterns of biomarker changes among those of similar age who do not progress to MCI over time. The current work addresses this gap by applying a novel longitudinal model that characterizes the biomarker patterns of change prior to the onset of symptoms, leveraging data from the BIOCARD Study. The study began collecting CSF specimens in largely middle-aged cognitively normal individuals in 1995 and has followed the majority of participants to the present time. It thus provides a unique dataset for longitudinal modeling of CSF biomarker changes, particularly in the early phase of AD.

Recent longitudinal analyses of CSF biomarkers using the BIOCARD data suggest that cognitively normal individuals who progress to MCI have more abnormal CSF Aβ (Aβ42/Aβ40), phosphorylated tau (p-tau181), and total tau (t-tau) levels at baseline, as well as greater increases in CSF p-tau181 and t-tau prior to symptom onset [8]. Despite these findings, there has been limited exploration on how these patterns of CSF change may differ among individuals with varying ages of clinical symptom onset, and whether individuals with different characteristics, such as APOE4 status, exhibit distinct patterns of change before MCI symptom onset, or before reaching an age when they have not developed clinical symptoms of MCI.

This study’s aim was to implement a new analytic approach that can characterize longitudinal CSF biomarker changes prior to clinical symptom onset among those who progressed to MCI and explore potential variations in biomarker patterns related to the age of MCI onset. We also examined the CSF biomarker patterns among individuals who have remained cognitively normal over the duration of follow-up. Three CSF AD biomarkers were examined, including: Aβ42/Aβ40, t-tau, and p-tau181, as well as the ratios of tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40). In addition, we explored several variables that might impact biomarker patterns of change, including age, sex, years of education, and APOE4 genotype.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design and participant selection

The BIOCARD study was designed to recruit and follow a cohort of cognitively normal individuals in order to examine the neurobiological features of the earliest phases of AD. At baseline, 349 primarily middle-aged participants were enrolled. On an annual basis, clinical and cognitive assessments were conducted. MRI scans, CSF, and blood were obtained approximately every two years. The study was initiated at the NIH in 1995 and was stopped in 2005 for administrative reasons. In 2009, are search team at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) School of Medicine reestablished the cohort, continued the annual clinical and cognitive assessments, and initiated annual blood collections. The collection of CSF and MRI scans was reinitiated bi-annually in 2015. Amyloid imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) was begun in 2015, and tau PET imaging was begun in 2020.

One or more CSF specimens were obtained from 317 cognitively normal participants. Our analyses included 279 of those 317 participants with normal cognition at their first CSF draw. Participants were excluded if they withdrew from the study or had not yet re-enrolled in the study at JHU (n=25), or if they had an estimated age of MCI clinical symptom onset at, or prior to, their first CSF collection (n=13).

Clinical diagnostic procedures

Since the study began, the annual clinical and cognitive assessments have included: physical and neurological examinations, record of medication use, behavioral and mood assessments, family history of dementia, a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) based on a semi-structured interview of the participant and a collateral source [9, 10].

Participants have received a consensus diagnosis at each study visit by the staff of the BIOCARD Clinical Core at JHU (prospectively for subjects evaluated starting in 2009 and retrospectively for subjects evaluated at the NIH), as previously described [11]. A syndromic diagnosis (e.g., normal, MCI, dementia) was established by review of: 1) clinical data pertaining to the medical, neurologic, and psychiatric status, 2) reports of changes in cognition by the subject and by a collateral source, and 3) decline in cognitive performance, based on longitudinal cognitive testing from multiple domains (and by comparison with published norms).

If a subject was deemed to be impaired, the decision about the likely etiology of the syndrome was based on the medical, neurologic, and psychiatric information collected at each visit, as well as medical records obtained from the subject, where necessary. More than one etiology could be endorsed for each subject (e.g., AD and vascular disease). Consensus diagnosis procedures followed the diagnostic recommendations incorporated in the National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) workgroup reports for the diagnosis of MCI [12] and dementia due to AD [13]. Consensus diagnoses were blinded to participants’ biomarker measures and APOE status.

For those who progressed from normal cognition to MCI or dementia, the age of onset of symptoms of MCI was established separately, based primarily on information from the CDR interview, and is confirmed on subsequent visits so that each participant with MCI or dementia has a single age of symptom onset that represents the consensus of the clinical team. The few participants (n=3) whose diagnosis reverted from MCI to normal were considered normal in these analyses, if that was the diagnosis at their most recent visit. The same diagnostic process was retrospectively applied to participants who developed cognitive impairment while the study was at the NIH. For many of the analyses presented here, the primary ‘endpoint’ was the age of onset of symptoms of MCI.

CSF assessment

CSF samples used in these analyses were collected over time while the study was at the NIH (1995–2005) and at JHU (since 2015). CSF was collected via lumbar puncture after an overnight fast. Samples were aliquoted into polypropylene cryotubes that were kept on dry ice and immediately transferred to a −80°C freezer for long-term storage. The primary differences between the protocols at the NIH and JHU were in the size of the needles that were used for the lumbar punctures. Between 1995 and 2000, a 20 or 22 G needle was used, and between 2000 and 2005 a 24 G needle was used; at JHU, a 25 G atraumatic needle was used. Additionally, when CSF was collected at JHU, the CSF was centrifuged for 15 min at 2500 g prior to aliquoting into 0.5 cryovials, where as the CSF specimens collected at the NIH were not centrifuged and were aliquoted into 5 ml cryovials. Samples were thawed for the first time since collection to measure Aβ40, Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau181 using fully automated electrochemiluminescence assays on the Lumipulse G1200 platform (Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.).

Recent reports indicate that the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio is more informative than either measure alone [14]. We therefore examined the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40, rather than each Aβ value individually. The Supplementary Materials include results pertaining to two additional ratios: ptau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40) and t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40).

APOE genotype

APOE genotypes were determined by restriction endonuclease digestion of polymerase chain reaction amplified genomic DNA (performed by Athena Diagnostics, Worcester, MA). Genotypes were coded dichotomously (APOE4 non-carriers = 0, carriers = 1).

Statistical analysis

In these analyses, ‘baseline’ was defined as the first available CSF measurement. For those who progressed to clinical symptoms of MCI, the primary endpoint was age of onset of MCI clinical symptoms. To assess the reliability of the findings, we examined a secondary endpoint, defined as the first time that the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) score fell below the 18th age-adjusted percentile. The DSST was selected because prior analyses have shown that it is one of the strongest predictors of time to onset of MCI clinical symptoms [11], and the scores have a substantial range during the preclinical phase of AD. The 18th percentile was selected as the threshold value because it resulted in a comparable number of participants experiencing the secondary endpoint compared to the primary endpoint of progression to MCI.

The statistical analyses were designed to evaluate CSF biomarker patterns preceding the endpoint, focusing specifically on their mean functions. The mean functions are defined on the age scale, and stratified based on the age at the endpoint. For individuals who experienced the endpoint at age t, we assume the biomarker Y at age a follows the following multiplicative mean model, (1) E{Y(a)∣T=t,X=x}=μ1(a,t)expβ1′x,a≤t,

where T, X, and β1 are the age at the endpoint, covariates, and regression parameters, respectively, and μ1(a,t) is the mean value of the biomarker at age a when age at the endpoint is t and all of the covariates are equal to zero. The covariates in our models include sex (female versus male), APOE4 carrier status (carriers versus non-carriers), and years of education (centered and scaled). In a set of supplementary analyses, we additionally adjusted for site of CSF collection (i.e., NIH versus JHU).

The function μ1(⋅,t) describes the pattern of change over chronological age up to age t for individuals who had their endpoint at age t, with binary covariates fixed at the reference level (male sex and APOE4 non-carriers) and years of education set at the mean value. Following existing hypothetical models [3, 15], we assume the shape of μ1(⋅,t) is characterized by a sigmoid function. The midpoint and magnitude of the sigmoid function are allowed to depend on the age at endpoint t. The mathematical form of μ1(a,t) and details on model estimation are given in Supplementary Material 1.

An important feature of Model (1) (above) is its flexibility in accounting for the dependency of biomarker change patterns on t (age at the endpoint). This flexibility allows the model to identify differences in patterns attributed to t through the function μ1(a,t), rather than relying on regression coefficients. To investigate the impact of t on the patterns of change, the figures presented here plot the mean curves μ1(⋅,t) over chronological age for various t values, ranging from 60 to 80. Note that since the time scale of the model is age (instead of time from study baseline), the model does not additionally quantify the effect of age on the curves.

In addition, the multiplicative mean model was applied to estimate the patterns of change for individuals who were free of MCI symptoms until age t, with time of the endpoint set as age t. In this case, we can estimate the model E{Y(a)∣T&gt;t,X=x}=μ2(a,t)exp(β2′x), a≤t, where μ1(⋅,t) is a sigmoid-shape function and β2 represents the regression parameters. The function μ1(⋅,t)exp(β2′x) represents the mean function for symptom-free individuals at age t with covariate x. Note that for the secondary analysis, with DSST used to determine the endpoint, this model was applied to estimate patterns of change for participants whose DSST has not fallen below the threshold at different ages.

In our models, we use an incident/dynamic definition for progressors and non-progressors, providing a more accurate depiction of the progression process than a simple binary categorization. For each t, individuals who develop MCI at age t(T=t) are defined as progressors, while those have not progressed at that age (T&gt;t) are defined as non-progressors. We evaluate progressors and non-progressors in separate models due to our stratification in Model (1) by the age of MCI onset, automatically excluding non-progressors at age t from this model. Additionally, under this definition, the non-progressor group is dynamic, changing as t increases. An individual classified as a non-progressor at time t could transition to the progressor group at later ages.

Given that our models are conditioned on the age at MCI onset, interpretation of the covariate effects need to be made with consideration to this specific context. The parameters β1 and β2 are not designed to assess the association between risk factors and biomarkers. For instance, a zero covariate effect in Model (1) does not necessarily imply an absence of a relationship between the covariate and the biomarker in progressors. The covariate might still influence the age at MCI onset, causing a change in the likelihood of the occurrence of the curves. It instead implies that, for a given onset age, the covariate does not alter the biomarker pattern prior to progression. Therefore, the covariate effects account for diverse patterns among individuals with different characteristics, providing a descriptive framework for each individual’s pattern of biomarker change.

To compare the mean curves for those who progress versus those who remain normal (with binary covariates fixed at the reference level and years of education set at the mean value), we performed a Wald-type test for the integrated difference between μ1(a,t) and μ2(a,t). The integrated difference was defined as the integral of the difference between the two functions over the age range of interest, ∫τ1τ2∫τ1tμ1(a,t)−μ2(a,t)dadt, where τ1 and τ2 represent the limits of the range being compared. In this case, we focus on the mean curves of individuals whose endpoint falls within the age interval τ1,τ2 and compare the curves from age τ1 to the endpoint. For each CSF biomarker, we calculated the p-value of this test over the age intervals 60–70 and 70–80. Further details of the test are included in Supplementary Material 1. We selected these relatively broad age strata to guarantee a sufficient number of participants within each stratum, thereby ensuring the reliability of our analysis.

The descriptive statistics for participant characteristics at baseline are presented as proportions (for dichotomous variables) or as means with standard deviations (for continuous variables). Group differences of participant characteristics were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis tests or chi-square tests, as appropriate.

RESULTS

Participants characteristics at baseline are presented in Table 1 for the total sample (n=279) and separately for those who remained cognitively normal throughout the entire follow-up period (n=186) and those who developed symptoms of MCI or dementia during the follow-up period (n=93). There were no baseline differences in sex, race, education, and APOE4 carrier status between diagnostic groups (all p&gt;0.17). However, those who progressed during the follow-up period were significantly older and had lower levels of Aβ42/Aβ40 and higher levels of p-tau181 and t-tau at baseline compared to non-progressors (all p&lt;0.001). In both the progressed and not progressed groups, there were no significant differences between men and women regarding their APOE4 carrier status (p=0.935 for those who progressed; p=0.596 for those who remained cognitively normal) or baseline age (p=0.347 for those who progressed; p=0.161 for those who remained cognitively normal). In the secondary analysis that defined the endpoint based on pre-defined decline in the DSST score, 106 out of 279 reached this endpoint. Of note, all 93 participants who reached the primary endpoint of progression to MCI were included in this group of 106.

Figure 1 shows the estimated mean curves of the CSF AD biomarkers prior to the endpoints, separately for those who progressed to MCI versus remained cognitively normal (in males who are APOE4 non-carriers, with years of education fixed at the mean value). The estimated mean curves for the ratios of t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40) and p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40) are presented in Supplementary Figure 1. Among individuals who progressed to MCI, t-tau, p-tau181, t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40), and p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40) increased and Aβ42/Aβ40 decreased prior to the onset of MCI. In contrast, those who remained symptom-free showed relatively little change in CSF biomarkers over time.

Note that, through the functions μ1(a,t) and μ2(a,t) for progressors and non-progressors, the model allows the value and rate of change of the biomarkers to flexibly depend on both current age a and age at the endpoint t. To offer an overall summary of the rate of change for each set of curves presented in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figure 1, we report an average rate of change. For each individual curve corresponding to a specific endpoint age, we compute its rates of change over a grid of equally spaced age points (0.5 years apart). We then compute the average of these rates over all the grid points and across the entire range of endpoint ages. Compared to those who remained symptom-free at the same age, participants who developed MCI had greater estimated average rates of increase of t-tau, p-tau181, t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40), and p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40). Among progressors, the average rates of increase for t-tau and p-tau 181 were 22.1 (95% CI, [11.6,32.7]) units/year and 2.9 (95% CI, [1.4,4.3]) units/year, respectively; by comparison, among non-progressors, average rates of increases were 5.3 (95% CI, [2.4,8.1]) units/year and 0.7 (95% CI, [0.4,1.0]) units/year, respectively. Those who developed MCI also had larger estimated rates of decline compared to those who remained symptom-free at the same age. The average rate of decrease in Aβ42/Aβ40 was 0.002 (95% CI, [0.0008,0.004]) units/year among progressors, compared to 0.0003 (95% CI, [0.0002,0.0004]) units/year among non-progressors. The average rates of increase for t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40) and p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40) among progressors were 572.0 (95% CI, [289.9,854.2]) units/year and 82.0 (95% CI, [34.6, 129.5]) units/year, respectively, and among non-progressors were 105.2 (95% CI, [68.1,142.3]) units/year and 14.0 (95% CI, [8.1,19.9]) units/year, respectively.

We also conducted hypothesis testing for the integrated difference in mean curves over the age intervals from 60–70 and 70–80 between MCI progressors and non-progressors. For the 60–70 age interval, only Aβ42/Aβ40 showed a significant difference between progressors and non-progressors (p=0.006), while the differences in other biomarkers were not significant (all p&gt;0.21). For the 70–80 age interval, there were significant differences between progressors and non-progressors in all the biomarkers measured, including: 1) Aβ42/Aβ40 (p=0.013), 2) t-tau (p=0.021), 3) p-tau181 (p=0.037), 4) t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40) (p=0.003), and 5) p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40) (p=0.014). In our comparisons of patterns between progressors and non-progressors, we accounted for both chronological age and age at the endpoint. Therefore, age differences between the groups that progressed and did not progress during the follow-up period at the baseline of the study do not influence our comparison of the patterns.

The effects of model covariates on biomarkers are reported in Table 2. In this model, the exponential of the coefficient (i.e., exp(β)) quantifies the ratio of the mean curves for each one-unit increase in the covariate. For example, exponentiating the coefficient of APOE4 yields the ratio of the mean curves between APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. A positive coefficient indicates the ratio is greater than one, implying that the mean curves of APOE4 carriers are higher than those of non-carriers. Similarly, a negative coefficient implies that the mean curves of APOE4 carriers are lower than those of non-carriers.

In those who developed symptoms of MCI, the presence of the APOE4 allele -was associated with a decrease of 19.1% at each point of the mean curves for Aβ42/Aβ40 (β=-0.212, p=0.002), relative to APOE4 non-carriers. No significant difference was found between APOE4 carriers and non-carriers in terms of tau, p-tau181, tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40), or p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40) among those who developed MCI.

For participants who had not progressed to MCI, APOE4 carriers (compared to APOE4 non-carriers) were found to have significant differences at each point of the curves for most of the examined biomarkers, including: 1) a decrease of 19.5% in Aβ42/Aβ40 (β=-0.217, p&lt;0.001), 2) an increase of 23.4% in p-tau181 (β=0.210, p=0.003), 3) an increase of 59.0% in t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40) (β=0.464, p&lt;0.001), and 4) an increase of 70.4% in p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40) (β=0.533, p&lt;0.001). The mean CSF curves by APOE4 carrier status are shown in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figure 2. Among those who did not develop MCI, APOE4 carriers generally had lower values of Aβ42/Aβ40 and higher values of p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40) and t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40) at each point of the curves.

Among participants who had not progressed, females had significantly higher values at each point of the curves for tau-related biomarkers, as shown graphically in Supplementary Figure 3. This included: 1) a 18.2% increase in t-tau (β=0.167, p=0.021), 2) a 20.1% increase in p-tau181 (β=0.183, p=0.011), 3) a 38.7 % increase in t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40) (β=0.327, p=0.001), and 4) a 41.8% increase in p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40) (β=0.349, p=0.002). In all models, the effects of years of education on CSF biomarkers curves were not significant.

Similar trends were observed for CSF biomarker patterns in the secondary analysis, in which the endpoint was defined based on the DSST score (see Supplementary Figures 4–7). The regression analysis for this secondary analysis is reported in Table 2. For participants reached the 18th age-adjusted percentile, APOE4 was associated with a decrease of 20.4% in Aβ42/Aβ40 (β=-0.228, p&lt;0.001) at each point of the curves relative to APOE4 non-carriers, but was unrelated to t-tau and p-tau181.

For participants who had not reached the 18th age-adjusted percentile, APOE4 carrier status (versus APOE4 non-carrier status) was associated with a decrease of 19.3% in Aβ42/Aβ40 (β=-0.215, p&lt;0.001), an increase of 26.7% in ptau181 (β=0.237, p=0.002), an increase of 56.9% in t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40) (β=0.451, p&lt;0.001), and an increase of 74.9% in p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40) (β=0.559, p&lt;0.001), at each point of the curves on intervals up to the age at the end of the follow-up period.

Among non-progressors, female sex was associated with a 17.0% increase in t-tau (β=0.157, p=0.025), a 19.5% increase in p-tau181 (β=0.178, p=0.013), a 36.6% increase in t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40) (β=0.312, p=0.002), and a 40.3% increase in p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40) (β=0.339, p=0.002), at each point of the curves.

When site (NIH versus JHU) was included as an additional model covariate, the results remained consistent with the primary findings described above (data not shown).

Additionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to determine if the findings differed when using lower age-adjusted thresholds for the DSST (i.e., the 5th percentile and the 16th percentile). The findings from these analyses align with the results described above (see Supplementary Material 4 for details).

We used published biomarker thresholds for the Lumipulse assay [16] to determine the number of progressors who reached pathological biomarker thresholds for AD dementia. Of the 93 progressors, 24 met the threshold for both amyloid and tau (using the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 and p-tau181). Examining these thresholds separately, 31 met the threshold for Aβ42/Aβ40 and 28 met the threshold for p-tau181. Note that these thresholds were designed to differentiate controls from cases of AD dementia, and in this study the primary endpoint was onset of symptoms of MCI.

DISCUSSION

This study investigated CSF biomarker patterns of change in a cohort of individuals who were cognitively normal and largely middle-aged at baseline. We focused on patterns prior to MCI symptom onset in order to further clarify biomarker changes during the preclinical phase of AD and compared the patterns of change among participants who progressed to MCI versus participants who remained cognitively normal at different ages. We also examined the impact of several variables on patterns of change, including age at the onset of MCI, sex, years of education, and APOE status. Importantly, instead of depicting an overall mean curve, we applied novel methods to explore biomarker patterns of change, incorporating both the forward time (age) and the time of the endpoint (age of onset of MCI for those who developed clinical impairment). This method allowed us to illustrate biomarker dynamics during the preclinical phase of AD in relation to the age at the onset of MCI.

There were several notable findings. First, participants who progressed from normal cognition to MCI at a particular age showed significant changes in CSF AD biomarkers many years prior to the onset of MCI, which was in contrast to the slow and modest changes for those who did not progress to MCI at the same age. This is consistent with hypothetical models of AD biomarkers, which propose that AD biomarkers undergo an initial period of acceleration prior to the onset of clinical symptoms of MCI [3, 15]. The results also show that biomarker changes begin as early as midlife, consistent with findings from neuropathology studies [17, 18]. Interestingly, for individuals who progressed between the ages of 60 and 70, significant differences were only observed in Aβ42/Aβ40 (compared to non-progressors). However, for those who progressed between the ages of 70 and 80, there were significant differences for all of the biomarkers (compared to non-progressors). This may suggest that additional factors impact the extent to which clinical symptoms emerge in the presence of different levels of biomarker change, and therefore the age at which clinical symptoms of MCI emerge. For example, in many older individuals with AD as their primary pathology, there is often a presence of mixed pathologies, such as vascular disease.

Second, the findings related to the effects of APOE4 carrier status within each of the groups of progressors and non-progressors exhibit variations. Among progressors, APOE4 genotype was associated with lower values of Aβ42/Aβ40 at each point of the curves. This may indicate that APOE4 carriers who progressed to MCI are more likely to have cognitive impairment due to underlying AD pathology (as indicated by lower Aβ42/Aβ40), whereas APOE4 non-carriers are more likely to have other pathologies contributing to their cognitive impairment.

For non-progressors, APOE4 carrier status was associated with differences in the values of almost all CSF measures examined at each point of the curves (compared to APOE4 non-carriers), including: 1) lower Aβ42/Aβ40, 2) higher p-tau181, 3) higher t-tau/(Aβ42/Aβ40), and 4) higher p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40). These findings in non-progressors suggest that some of the APOE4 carriers are able to remain MCI-free until very old ages even with abnormal CSF biomarker levels, though they might have greater risk of progression to MCI in the future.

Third, among non-progressors (but not progressors), female sex was associated with higher values at each point of the curves for tau-related biomarkers. These findings suggest that some females with elevated tau-related biomarkers are able to remain MCI-free until very old ages, though there might be an increased future risk of progressing to MCI. It could also indicate that females are able to tolerate greater levels of tau pathology during the preclinical phase of AD and maintain normal cognition for longer than males.

Although a number of studies have demonstrated lower CSF Aβ42 and higher t-tau and p-tau181 among individuals who progressed from normal cognition to MCI [7, 19, 20], few prior studies have examined biomarker patterns prior to clinical symptom onset [8, 21]. Our approach may represent an improvement over the prior work because it accounts for individual differences in age of MCI symptom onset and compares biomarker patterns between progressors and non-progressors of a similar age. This differs from approaches using linear mixed models or generalized estimating equations which have typically compared progressors and non-progressors without examining differences in the pattern and magnitude of biomarker changes based on age. Note that if the mean curves of biomarkers are not affected by the age of MCI onset, we would anticipate substantial overlap in the curves, with changes in mean values over time primarily attributed to chronological age. However, the mean curves of biomarkers for progressors exhibited variations across different ages of MCI onset.

Studies using PET data [22, 23] have identified diverse age-based biomarker trajectory groups, where the heterogeneity can be explained by the age of amyloid onset. In addition, steady changes in amyloid levels following the age at amyloid onset have been observed based on PET data [24]. These studies collectively indicate that biomarker change is closely related to the age at amyloid onset. While our approach utilizes a different endpoint, the age at the onset of MCI, it similarly demonstrates that biomarker change patterns preceding the onset of MCI depend on the age at onset of MCI. Despite this, our modeling approach differs fundamentally from these previous studies. The aforementioned studies estimate the age of amyloid onset using longitudinal amyloid trajectory models with a forward time scale, often chronological age. The estimated age of amyloid onset is then set as the time origin, and the estimated biomarker trajectories are shifted accordingly. In contrast, our study determines the age of MCI symptom onset based on clinical diagnostic procedures instead of biomarker models. This allows us to incorporate two time scales, chronological age and age at onset of MCI, into our longitudinal model. As a result, our model automatically realigns the biomarker curves starting from the age at onset of MCI, and allows stratification by the MCI onset age. Furthermore, our semiparametric model allows for flexible dependence of the curves’ magnitude on the age at onset of MCI. This distinguishes our approach from studies where amyloid measure reaches a fixed, pre-specified threshold level at the time of amyloid onset. Instead of using regression parameters in longitudinal models to estimate the association between biomarkers and the age at onset of MCI, we employ a bivariate function to capture the intricate relationship between biomarker changes and the age at onset of MCI. Our approach offers flexibility in characterizing the interaction between chronological age and the age at onset of MCI.

Our findings regarding the effects of APOE, sex, and education in the nonprogressors are similar to those reported by Therneau et al. [25], where APOE4 and female sex were found to be associated with accelerated change points in amyloid and tau trajectories, and education has little effect. The covariate effects in progressors are not entirely consistent. However, it is important to recognize that our longitudinal models estimate the patterns of biomarker changes conditioning on the timing or status of MCI onset. This aspect distinguishes the interpretation of our covariate effects from those of earlier studies that evaluated the covariate effects without conditioning on MCI onset time. For instance, within the group of progressors, our results suggest no significant difference in the mean curves for tau between individuals who are carriers of the APOE4 allele and those who are non-carriers, assuming they progress to MCI at the same age. However, this does not suggest that APOE4 status has no influence on tau in progressors. In the BIOCARD study [11], APOE4 status is significantly associated with a shorter time to MCI onset. As a result, APOE4 carriers tend to exhibit curves that align with an earlier age of MCI onset, which is comparable to the leftward shift of curves observed by Therneau et al.

This study has limitations. The sample size is modest, and the generalizability is limited given participants are highly selected, consisting primarily of white individuals with high levels of education and enriched for a family history of AD dementia. Since our semiparametric model and method are new, we have not yet established a specific diagnostic procedure to evaluate its performance and validity, which is an important direction for future research. Additionally, the endpoint in our secondary analysis is defined based on the DSST score, a tool that, despite its sensitivity to early changes among cognitively normal individuals who will ultimately progress to MCI, is relatively non-specific due to the fact that it reflects changes in several cognitive domains, including visual search, set shifting, and incidental memory. Moreover, the CSF biomarkers we examined focused on AD pathological markers (i.e., amyloid and tau); future studies that incorporate a broader range of biomarkers would yield a more comprehensive understanding of the pattern of changes of other underlying pathologies prior to the onset of MCI. These limitations are offset by some strengths. Though the sample size is not large, it includes a significant sample of individuals who were cognitively normal at baseline and followed longitudinally for many years (mean = 16.2 years, max = 25.4 years), yielding a substantial number of individuals who have progressed from normal cognition to MCI or dementia. Additionally, the longitudinal collection of CSF acquired over more than two decades provides a unique opportunity to apply novel statistical methods to address important questions on the relationships between longitudinal CSF biomarkers and MCI symptoms onset.

In summary, the methods presented here provide a valuable perspective on the relationship between patterns of biomarker change and MCI onset by personalizing the patterns based on the MCI onset age, which has not been explored previously by traditional longitudinal models. Additionally, this analytic approach takes into account the age at the endpoint, when comparing patterns of change between those who did and did not progress to MCI. Finally, our analysis provides separate characterizations of patterns for MCI progressors and non-progressors, allowing for the evaluation of potentially different impacts of variables, such as APOE genotype and sex, on each set of curves.
