INTRODUCTION:

There has been considerable progress in identifying early cognitive and biomarker predictors of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in AD and appear to predict progression after the onset of mild cognitive impairment or dementia.

OBJECTIVES:

The objective of the study is to examine the relationship between NPS in clinically normal older adults and subsequent cognitive decline in a population-based sample.

METHODS:

The Cache County Study on Memory in Aging consists of a population-based sample of 5,092 older adults. We identified 470 clinically normal adults who were followed for an average period of 5.73 years. NPS were evaluated at the baseline clinical assessment using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). NPI domains scores were quantified as the product of frequency X severity in individual NPI domains, and then summed for the NPI-Total. Neuropsychological measures were collected at baseline and at each subsequent follow-up wave. Linear mixed effects models assessed the association of NPI-Total, NPI-Depression, and NPI-Anxiety scores (obtained at baseline) on longitudinal change in neuropsychological performance, controlling for age, sex, and education.

RESULTS:

Baseline Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)-Total score was associated with a more rapid rate of decline in word list memory, praxis recall, and animal fluency. Baseline NPI-Depression was not associated with later decline on any of the cognitive tests, while baseline NPI-Anxiety was associated with decline in Symbol Digit Modality.

CONCLUSION:

In conclusion, among clinically normal older adults derived from this population-based study, total burden of NPS was associated with longitudinal cognitive decline. These results add to the evidence that NPS are risk factors for or clinical indicators of preclinical dementia syndrome. Our study was an exploratory study and we did not control for multiple comparisons.

OBJECTIVES

With the aging of the U.S. population, the public health burden of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasing. The overall prevalence of dementia doubles with every 5 additional years of age over 60 from approximately 1% in persons aged 60–65 years to 45% in persons aged 90–95 years, with comparable effects on AD incidence1. Thus, there is a public health need to prevent AD. To do so requires that we identify “healthy” persons with “preclinical disease” at risk for AD incidence2. There has been considerable progress in identifying early cognitive3 and biomarker predictors of AD incidence, with increasing evidence that neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) might be indicators of preclinical AD. NPS include depression, apathy, irritability, anxiety, agitation, aberrant motor behavior, disinhibition and other behaviors. In many individuals, the first symptoms of AD may be NPS rather than cognitive in nature, and thus NPS might identify cognitively healthy persons at risk of AD for prevention trials. The evidence has pointed particularly to depression and anxiety as risk factors4-6, but there is also evidence that NPS in general are a risk factor for progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia 7 or from mild to more severe dementia8,9.

The Cache County Study on Memory in Aging (CCSMA) is a longitudinal population-based study of incidence and prevalence of dementia in relation to genetic and environmental risk factors. CCSMA followed the residents of Cache County, Utah who were 65 or older at initiation. Multistage dementia screening and assessment identified individuals with dementia and other cognitive disorders over four triennial waves. Here we examine the association of NPS with cognitive decline in older adults who were clinically normal. We hypothesized that baseline NPS, particularly depression10,11 and anxiety, would increase risk of longitudinal cognitive decline.

METHODS

Sampling, Screening, and Procedure

The Institutional Review Boards of Utah State University, Johns Hopkins University, and Duke University approved procedures; all participants or their next of kin signed informed consent for each stage of the study. Detailed data collection methods and demographics of the CCSMA have been detailed elsewhere12-15. In brief, all permanent residents of Cache County, Utah, who were 65 years of age or older in 1995 were recruited with 5092 (90% of the eligible population) completing enrollment into the study. Enrollment included completion of a revised version of the modified Mini-Mental State Exam (3MS) 16 or the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline17 administered to a knowledgeable informant.

With intent to undertake a nested case-control study, iterative sampling without replacement was used to construct a stratified subsample of enrollees (n=960 out of 5092 at Wave 1)13. Each member of the subsample was asked to undergo clinical assessment and diagnostic review. Clinical assessment, carried out by a research nurse and psychometrist, included a narrative history of cognitive symptoms, family and medical history, and current medications. As detailed below, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory18, Mini Mental State Examination19, and a one-hour battery of neuropsychological tests were administered. The nurse completed a physical examination using a brief protocol. A seven-minute videotape of mental status and neurological examination was collected.

During the diagnostic process, results of the clinical assessment were reviewed by a geropsychiatrist and neuropsychologist who, along with members of the examination team, assigned preliminary diagnoses of cognitive disorder if applicable. Those with a diagnosis of prodromal AD or dementia (all cause) were invited to complete a brain MRI scan, standard laboratory tests for dementia, and a full physician examination. The cumulative results were taken to a second expert panel consisting of geropsychiatrists, neurologists, neuropsychologists, and a cognitive neuroscientist who assigned final diagnoses. Criteria for all cause dementia followed the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual III-R20 while specific criteria for dementia type followed existing standard research criteria at the time. For example, criteria for AD followed NINCDS-ADRDA 21and for vascular dementia, NINDS-AIREN22.

Of the 960 members of the subsample, 838 (87.3%) completed all phases of investigation. Of completers, 507 (60.5%) were clinically normal (i.e., did not receive a cognitive disorder diagnosis). Of these 507, 470 (92.7%) had at least one follow-up visit in one or more of the subsequent three assessment waves. Following Wave 1, subsequent waves were conducted approximately 3 to 4 years apart.

Assessment of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (NPS):

NPS were evaluated at the baseline clinical assessment using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)18. The research nurse interviewed a knowledgeable informant about the presence of 10 specific domains: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression, anxiety, elation, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, and aberrant motor behavior. The frequency, severity, and degree of associated caregiver distress were noted for individual NPS. NPI domains scores were quantified as the product of frequency X severity in individual NPI domains, and then summed for the NPI-Total.

Neuropsychological Outcome Measures

These measures were collected at baseline and at each subsequent follow-up wave. The one-hour battery used has been described23 and adopted by a number of studies of aging and dementia18,24-29. The majority were taken from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERD)30. Cognitive domains analyzed here include global cognition (MMSE), verbal memory (Word List Memory and Recall, Wechsler logical memory subtest – Immediate and Delayed), constructional praxis and visual memory (Constructional Praxis, Delayed Praxis Recall and Recognition, Benton Visual Retention Test), verbal fluency (Animal Fluency), and executive functioning (Symbol Digits Modalities Test):

Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)19: A brief assessment of global cognitive function with assessments of orientation, recall, attention, language, and visuospatial skills. Maximal score of 30.

Word List Memory31: Derived from the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale and uses the 10 words (the same each time) presented in a new random order over three trials with immediate recall for the three trials giving a best total score of 30.

Word List Recall30: As suggested by CERAD, the same 10 words from above are recalled later for a best score of 10.

Wechsler Immediate and Delayed32: Using the logical memory subtests from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised assesses immediate verbal recall and delayed verbal memory after a 30-minute interval for two narrative passages read aloud to the participant. Maximum possible score for immediate and delayed is 25 points per narrative for a total score out of 50.

Constructional Praxis30: Suggested by CERAD and assesses visuospatial and motor integrative functions. Participants are presented with four individual geometric figures of increasing complexity (circle, parallelogram, overlapping rectangles, and a cube) and are required to copy the figure.

Delayed Praxis Recall and Recognition33: This is a visual memory measure added to the CERAD battery since its original development. The procedure is a delayed free recall of the constructional praxis figures described above.

Benton Visual Retention Test34: A test of immediate visual memory for geometric figures presented on stimulus cards. Each card is presented for 10 seconds, at the end of which the participant is required to reproduce the item from memory. Maximum total score correct is 10.

Animal Fluency30: A test of verbal production, semantic memory, language fluency, and executive function. Participants are asked to name as many animals as possible in one minute. The score is the total number of different animals named.

Symbol Digit Modalities Test35: A measure of executive function. Participants are presented with a “key” of matching symbols and numbers. After a brief practice, they write the numbers that correspond to the symbols as rapidly as possible over 90 seconds. The score is the total number of correctly completed items.

Data Analyses

Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) were calculated for each of the cognitive measures at each time point. Linear mixed effects models assessed the association of NPI-Total, NPI-Depression, and NPI-Anxiety scores (obtained at baseline) on longitudinal change in neuropsychological performance, controlling for age, sex, and education. We used random intercept and time was used as continuous variable (for the sake of parsimony). A p-value of &lt;0.05 was used as the threshold for statistical significance. This study is an exploratory study and we did not adjust for multiple comparisons.

RESULTS

The mean age of the 470 clinically normal participants was 78.9 (standard deviation (SD)=7.8), 58% were female, mean years of education was 13.3 (SD=3.0), mean length of follow-up was 5.73 years (SD=3.74 years). Baseline (Wave 1) frequency x severity mean scores on the NPI were (SD): delusions 0.02 (0.29), hallucinations 0 (0), aggression 0.04 (0.43), depression 0.09 (0.57), elation 0.01 (0.14), anxiety 06 (0.4), disinhibition 0.01 (0.15), irritability 0.04 (0.26), aberrant motor 0 (0), apathy 0.04 (0.51); mean NPI total score was 0.29 (1.3).

Table 1 shows the mean neuropsychological test scores at baseline (wave 1) and follow-up (waves 2-4). Table 2 presents mixed-effects models of the association between baseline NPI-Total, depression, and anxiety on change in neuropsychological test scores. Higher baseline NPI-Total was associated with more rapid rate of decline on Word List Memory, Word List Recall, Delayed Praxis Recall, and Animal Fluency. Baseline NPI-Depression was not associated with decline on any outcome measure. Higher baseline NPI-anxiety was associated with more rapid decline on Symbol Digit Modalities Test. As a visual example, Figure 1 illustrates the mixed effect model of the effect of NPI-Total on the longitudinal change in Word List Memory across time.

DISCUSSION

We present associations of baseline NPS with longitudinal change in cognitive test performance in a population-based sample of clinically normal older adults followed for a mean of 5.73 years. Baseline NPI-Total was associated with more rapid decline in word list memory, praxis recall, and animal fluency. NPI-Anxiety was associated with more rapid rate of decline on Symbol Digit Modality. Our findings differed for the NPI total score vs. the individual domain scores (e.g., NPI depression, NPI anxiety) likely due to the low severity of baseline scores, our speculation is that this low severity at baseline may lead to a lack of statistical power to detect meaningful effects on the anxiety domain, and this may be worthy of exploration in large or more symptomatic cohorts. Note however, that anxiety was associated with more rapid decline on a measure assessing psychomotor speed. NPI-Depression was not associated with longitudinal decline on any of the tests. While the modeled effect sizes with Baseline NPI-Total scores are quite small for the various tests, the clinical significance of the results is bolstered when considering that the effects were found amongst cognitively normal adults where little-to-no decline is expected. In fact, repeated testing with the same measures is associated with improved scores and evidence of practice effects36. Minimal to no practice effects on repeat testing either within session or over a one week interval have predicted worse cognitive outcomes in a sample of patients referred for a dementia evaluation 36 and in a sample of persons with MCI 36,37 . Furthermore, the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in older adults without cognitive impairment is quite low. In the Cache County Study sample, one-month prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms was 15% among cognitively normal older adults; prevalence doubled in those with Cognitive Impairment No Dementia (CIND) at 31%, and quadrupled in those with dementia at 60% 38. Additionally, we previously reported that neuropsychiatric symptoms predicted conversion to dementia among those with CIND in the Cache County Study39. Taken together, our results suggest that the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in older, cognitively normal adults may warrant closer clinical monitoring for incident cognitive decline.

These results both overlap and differ with prior reports. In the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study, Banks et al40 reported that neuropsychiatric symptoms were associated with a more rapid conversion from normal to MCI or dementia40 in 644 participants followed for 4 years. Similar to our findings, even relatively low NPS severity was associated with accelerated decline. In 1764 cognitively-normal adults followed for mean 7.8 years in two cohorts at Rush University, depressive symptoms were associated with more rapid conversion from normal to MCI or dementia41. While the Rush cohort had low depressive symptom severity at baseline it was greater than in our cohort, which may account for the lack of association of NPI-Depression with cognitive decline we observed. In the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, 1587 cognitively normal persons were followed for a median 5 years. Agitation, apathy, anxiety and irritability were associated with more rapid conversion from normal to MCI4. In 4517 cognitively normal older adults in the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center database, 4 latent classes of NPI domains including irritable, depressed, and complex (depression, apathy, irritability and nighttime behaviors) were associated with more rapid rate of progression to MCI42. Thus, prior literature has consistently linked NPS in “normals” with accelerated cognitive decline but variously reported depression, irritability, and total NPS as risk factors for progression8.

The study has several important strengths including a: (1) population-based sample with high participation rates (90% at baseline) and long duration of follow up; (2) thorough systematic multidisciplinary evaluation to identify participants with no sign of cognitive/functional decline. This process was designed to screen out persons with very subtle evidence of decline, resulting in greater confidence of the clinically normal designation; (3) battery of neuropsychological tests assessing multiple cognitive domains. Limitations include: (1) limited assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI only) (2) multiple comparisons were not controlled for in the study (3) limited information about participant’s past psychiatric history and psychotropic medications; and (4) low baseline NPI severity. However, the latter may reflect the associations observable in this particularly “clean” clinically normal cohort. A cohort with greater severity might have allowed greater statistical power to detect associations of individual NPI domains with cognitive change.

To summarize, in a population-based sample of 470 cognitively normal adults followed for a mean of 5.73 years, baseline NPI-Total was associated with more rapid declines in verbal memory, verbal fluency, and constructional praxis. These findings add to the growing literature suggesting that NPS are early symptoms of preclinical dementia syndrome and AD and that screening for NPS in older people may be a useful way to identify those at risk of future MCI or dementia43 as well as to enrich populations for trials of novel interventions to prevent AD.
