Introduction:

Although there is some evidence that different symptoms of depression have differential effects on cognition in older adults, these relationships remain understudied in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Method:

Older adults (&gt;50 years old) were classified as having MCI by Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs). Exploratory factor analyses and factor mixture modeling were used to determine depression symptom classes. Classes were then compared across different domains of cognition (i.e., memory, attention, language, executive function) and informant-rated everyday function.

Results:

Analyses revealed six, distinct symptom classes (i.e. somatic symptoms, severely depressed, anhedonic symptoms, cognitive symptoms, minimally depressed, and low life satisfaction symptoms). Classes significantly varied on all measures of cognition and everyday function. In particular, the anhedonic class often showed the most substantial decline (on par with the severely depressed class) while the low life satisfaction class often showed the least (on par with the minimally depressed class).

Conclusions:

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between depression symptom profiles and cognitive and everyday function in those with MCI. Our findings show that depression symptoms greatly differ in their associations with cognitive and everyday function. It may be beneficial for clinicians to specifically note if patients with MCI are reporting anhedonic and somatic symptoms of depression specifically.

pmcIntroduction

The field of cognitive aging has placed a growing emphasis on detecting modifiable risk factors associated with cognitive decline, as the earliest stages of cognitive decline likely represent a period when interventions may be most effective at slowing down or potentially reversing further decline (Roberts &amp; Knopman, 2013). Among numerous modifiable risk factors (e.g. diet, Lourida et al., 2013; physical activity level, Sofi et al., 2011, social engagement, Penninklampi, Casey, Singh, &amp; Brodaty, 2018) that have been identified as being associated with cognitive decline, one factor that has been consistently identified is depression (Bennett &amp; Thomas, 2014; Byers &amp; Yaffe, 2011; Jorm, 2001). Early detection and treatment of late-life depression may be particularly important, given evidence that treatment may lead to some improvement in cognition (Butters et al., 2000). Of note, though there is some inconsistency in the literature, both early life and lifetime depression, as well as late-life depression (i.e. depression occurring for the first time in old age) have been shown to be risk factors for the development of dementia (Byers &amp; Yaffe, 2011). Late-life depression can be so pervasive in older adults with cognitive decline, that some have even theorized that late-life depression may serve as the earliest stage of the continuum of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (Panza et al., 2010). Alternatively, depression symptoms, amongst other neuropsychiatric and personality changes, have also been proposed as the earliest possible manifestation of neurocognitive changes in older adults (Panza et al., 2010). Depression as a prodromal phase of dementia has found support in twin-based research (Brommelhoff et. al., 2009), showing that twins with recent onset of depression were 3.9 times more likely to develop dementia than their non-depressed twin. While it is clear that depression is associated with declines in cognition (e.g. episodic memory, Zahodne, Stern, &amp; Manly, 2014; executive function, Snyder, 2013; processing speed, Sexton et al., 2012) and everyday function (Mehta, Yaffe, &amp; Covinsky, 2002), depression is often examined as a unitary construct in this literature, and less attention has been paid to associations of cognition with specific types of symptoms.

The treatment of depression as a unitary construct is problematic given its noted heterogeneity with a variety of different possible symptoms (Hybels, Blazer, Landerman, &amp; Steffens, 2011). Consistent with this, common measures of geriatric depression assess a broad range of symptoms (e.g., affective symptoms such as sadness, anhedonic or withdrawn symptoms such as losing pleasure in hobbies, and symptoms related to somatic issues such as low energy; Mitchell, Mathews, &amp; Yesavage, 1993). Related, but distinct factors of depression symptoms (e.g., depressed affect, low life satisfaction, withdrawal/anheodnia) have been identified based on analyses of commonly used older adult depression measures such as the Geriatric Depression Scale (Mitchell et al., 1993). Depression is also unique in that its presentation can change throughout the lifespan, with increased endorsement of somatic symptoms and decreased endorsement of affective symptoms being common in older adults compared to younger adults (Hegeman, De Waal, Comijs, Kok, &amp; Van der Mast, 2015). Cluster analyses of late-life depression have even found groups varying in the types of symptoms endorsed within older adults (e.g., groups varying in the degree to which they report somatic symptoms; Hybels, Blazer, Pieper, Landerman, &amp; Steffens, 2009). There is evidence that different symptoms of depression vary in their neuroanatomical correlates. For example, Dotson and colleagues (2021) found differential patterns of asymmetry in cortical thickness in right orbitofrontal and left posterior cingulate areas were predicted by anhedonic and somatic symptoms, respectively. Given this evidence, it is also reasonable to assume these symptoms may also have different associations with cognition.

Different depression symptoms have been linked to poorer cognition in older adults without dementia. In terms of specific cognitive abilities, dysphoria/affective symptoms of depression have been associated with poorer working memory, processing speed, attention and motor functioning (Baune, Suslow, Arolt, &amp; Berger, 2007; Korten et al., 2014). Additionally, prospective associations between cognition and affective symptoms, such as poorer delayed recall predicting increases in affective symptoms over time, has also been noted (Brailean et al., 2017). Outside of associations with cognition, affective symptoms of depression in particular have also been associated with conversion from MCI to dementia (Houde, Bergman, Whitehead, &amp; Chertkow, 2008). Notably, anhedonia, another common symptom in depression, has also been linked to declines in cognition in older adults, specifically in global cognition, executive function, episodic memory, and processing speed (Korten et al., 2014; Soleimani et al., 2021; Turner, Capuano, Wilson &amp; Barnes, 2015). When being directly compared to one another, affective and anhedonic symptoms of depression show variability across studies. Notably some studies find that both symptoms are associated with worse, though differing cognitive functions (i.e., affective symptoms and worse working memory, anhedonic symptoms and worse episodic memory; Korten et al., 2014). However, other studies find that depression symptoms related dysphoria, low life satisfaction, and subjective cognitive impairment are similarly associated with cognition, but that symptoms related to anhedonia are less significantly associated with cognition (O’Bryant et al., 2011).

Although less often studied. research has found that age differences in memory are most significant in older adults endorsing somatic symptoms of depression (Dotson et al., 2014). Other studies have found links between somatic symptoms and poorer processing speed, attention, and motor functioning (Baune et al., 2007; Brailean et al., 2017). Further, it has been noted that fatigue, a core somatic symptom of depression, has been linked to functional limitations, cognitive decline, and poorer quality of life in older adults specifically (Avlund, Rantanen, &amp; Schroll, 2007). Of note, despite evidence of their importance, it is possible that these symptoms may be ignored by caregivers and healthcare workers of older adults, as well as older adults themselves, instead viewed as a normative part of aging (Sarkisian, Hays, &amp; Mangione, 2002).

While there is literature on the association of different depression symptoms with cognition in healthy older adults, this work has largely not been extended to older adults with MCI. The literature has shown that those MCI and depression have lower scores in several domains of cognition compared to those with just MCI (Johnson et al., 2013), though it remains unclear if different depression symptoms are differentially associated with cognition in those with MCI. If depression symptoms are found to have differential impacts on cognition, more impactful symptoms may serve as particularly important and modifiable treatment targets. This area of research, to our knowledge, has also not examined the impact of different symptoms of depression on everyday functioning. This is of high importance given the noted relationship between depression and everyday function (Mehtma et al., 2002), the commonality of everyday functioning problems in those with MCI (Farias et al., 2013; Gold, 2012), and the association between functional decline and increased caregiver burden in this population (Etters, Goodall, &amp; Harrison, 2008).

Current Study

The present study aimed to examine the heterogeneity of depression symptoms in older adults and if different symptoms of depression differentially associated with cognitive and everyday functional decline in those with MCI. To examine heterogeneity of depression symptoms, an exploratory factor analysis of the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 item (Sheikh &amp; Yesavage, 1986) and subsequent factor mixture model were conducted. Following this, we examined class differences across measures of cognition and everyday function using a BCH approach. We hypothesized that symptoms classes would significantly vary in terms of cognition and everyday function. Specifically, we hypothesized we would have distinct classes primarily endorsing affective symptoms, anhedonic symptoms, and/or somatic symptoms of depression, and that they would vary in terms of cognition and everyday function.

Methods

Participants

Data for the present study was obtained from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), a longitudinal aging and cognition study (Weintraub et al., 2009). NACC was founded in 1999 and collects data across approximately 30 Alzheimer Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) in which participants are evaluated on an annual basis in both physical and cognitive domains to track long term changes that assists in a better understanding of changes across the aging process (Weintraub et al., 2009). Participant data was requested and received before the June 2021 data freeze with a total sample size of 9,154. All participants were classified as MCI at their baseline visit and at least 50 years old (m age = 73.12; SD = 8.84).

Measures

Cognitive Assessment

Cognition was measured using the NACC Uniform Data Set (UDS) battery (Weintraub et al., 2018). The neuropsychological battery consists of brief measures of attention, processing speed, executive function, memory, and language specifically designed to be sensitive to cognitive changes in an older population (Weintraub et al., 2018). Composite scores of the UDS tests which have previously been validated in older adults (Bernstein, Calamia, &amp; Keller, 2018, Hayden et al., 2011) were created. Composites included memory (Logical Memory immediate and delayed), attention (WMS-R Digit Span forward total, forward longest span, backward total, and backward longest span), executive functioning (Digit Symbol, TMT-A and TMT-B), and language (Boston Naming Test, animal fluency, and vegetable fluency). Composite scores were calculated by standardizing the scores, summing scores in each domain, and dividing that sum by the number of measures in each domain.

Depressive Symptom Assessment

To evaluate depressive symptoms, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)-Short Form was used (Sheikh &amp; Yesavage, 1986). The 15 item self-report questionnaire measures depressive symptoms with a larger score indicating more depressive symptoms present. Individual items following standard scoring procedures (i.e., yes/no endorsement of symptoms) were utilized in the present analyses.

Everyday Functioning Assessment

To measure everyday functional abilities, the Function Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) was utilized (Pfeffer, 1982). The 10-item informant-report measure asks an informant with an established relationship to the participant on their ability to complete daily tasks, with a larger score representing the more functional impairment.

Analytical Plan

All data were prescreened to check for outliers and missing data. Descriptive analyses were conducted in SPSS prior to exporting the data to Mplus (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2017). Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted with the 15-item GDS. Goodness of fit was determined using indices for Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Standardized Root Mean Square Residual, and Chi-square. The following cutoffs were used to evaluate the fit of the models: non-significant χ2 value, TLI&gt;0.95, SRMR&lt;.08 (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999), CFI&gt;.90 (Bentler, 1990), RMSEA&lt;.08 (MacCallum, Browne, &amp; Sugawara, 1996). In large sample sizes χ2 values are often significant (Floyd &amp; Wideman, 1995). FMM with the best fitting FA solution was then conducted to identify subgroups or classes of depressed individuals using the GDS. FMM allows the specification of a multidimensional factor model for each class. In FMM, individuals are stratified into discrete classes. However, within each class continuous latent factors account for potential differences in the indicator variables. This approach was chosen as it would allow for the identification of specific groups differing in their pattern of depressive symptoms and would allow flexibility in permitting heterogeneity within those groups. Model fit was evaluated using established goodness-of-fit criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), with lower values of AIC and BIC indicating a better model fit to the data (Lubke &amp; Muthén, 2007). Lastly, classes based on the best fitting model were then compared on several outcome variables: attention, memory, executive functioning, language, and everyday functioning using a BCH approach, which allows for variables to be both a part of the model and serve as distal outcomes (Bakk &amp; Vermunt, 2016). Similar to previous investigations utilizing factor mixture modeling (e.g., Tillman et al., 2020), effect sizes (ES) were calculated by subtracting mean differences between two groups divided by the pooled standard deviation of all groups combined. ES were qualitatively described as 0.2–0.3 = small, 0.4–0.5 = medium, ES &gt; 0.8 = large (Mun, von Eye, Bates, &amp; Vaschillo, 2008). Given the high number of comparisons and the increased risk of committing type 1 error, a correction for multiple comparisons was employed utilizing the False Discovery Rate (Benjamini &amp; Hocheberg, 1995).

Results

Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)

EFA with geomin rotation revealed a two [χ2(76)=826.470, p&lt;.001, TLI=.973, CFI= .981, RMSEA=.033, SRMR=.064] and three-factor [χ2(63)=528.630, p&lt;.001, TLI=.980, CFI= .988, RMSEA=.028, SRMR=.036] solution were the best fitting models for the data. The three-factor solution was selected for subsequent FMM analysis given that no items had large cross-loadings, it was conceptually interpretable, and because of its consistency with established results of previous factor-analytic studies (e.g., Mitchell et al., 1993). Factor 1 was composed of items reflecting general life satisfaction (e.g., “Are you basically satisfied with your life?”), factor 2 comprised items reflecting general depressive affect (e.g., “Do you feel happy most of the time?”) and factor 3 comprised items reflecting withdrawal/anhedonia (e.g., “Do you prefer to stay at home, rather than going out and doing things?”). See Table 1 for factor loadings.

Factor Mixture Modeling

A comparison of all models demonstrated that the six class/three-factor FFM was superior to competing models based on goodness-of fit criteria (AIC, BIC; See Table 2). Although the seven class and eight class three-factor solutions yielded lower AIC and BIC values the additional classes were redundant. Table 3 presents a breakdown of proportions of endorsement for items on the GDS for the six groups. Note that, for a class to be counted as significantly endorsing an item of the GDS, the item had to be significantly endorsed by at least 50% of the class. It should also be noted that all classes significantly endorsing symptoms reported somatic symptoms, such as difficulties with their memory or low energy. Given this pattern, classes were designated based on the other kinds of symptoms they were reporting. Class 1 (i.e., somatic) was primarily characterized by endorsement of items related to low energy and memory problems. Class 2 (i.e., severe depression) was characterized by high endorsement of all items of the GDS. Class 3 (i.e., anhedonic) primarily endorsed items relating to anhedonia (i.e. dropping activities, preferring to stay at home). Class 4 (i.e., memory) had high endorsement of items related to memory problems only. Class 5 (i.e., minimal depression) had relatively low endorsement of all items. Class 6 (i.e., low life satisfaction) had high endorsement of items corresponding to low life satisfaction (i.e. not being in good spirits, being unsatisfied with life).

Cognitive and Everyday Functioning Variables

The memory class had the worst memory functioning and had significantly lower scores than the minimal depression class, somatic class, and low life satisfaction class (adjusted p = &lt;.0001 - .031). Interestingly, the low life satisfaction/ class had the highest scores on memory, scoring significantly higher than all classes (adjusted p = &lt;.0001 - .018) with the exception of the somatic class (adjusted p = .095). Further, the anhedonic class scored significantly lower scores on memory than the low life satisfaction, somatic class, and the minimal depression class (adjusted p = .010 - .015).

With regard to attention, the low life satisfaction class had the highest scores, scoring significantly higher than all classes (adjusted p = &lt;.0001 - .005) with the exception of the minimal depression class. The anhedonic class had significantly worse attention than the somatic, low life satisfaction, and severe depression classes (adjusted p = &lt;.0001 - .025).

With regard to language, the low life satisfaction and the minimal depression classes had the highest scores for language, scoring significantly higher than all other classes (adjusted p = &lt;.0001 - .013). The anhedonic class scores significantly worse than the somatic class (adjusted p = .001).

With regard to executive functioning, the minimal depression class performed significantly better than the somatic, anhedonic, and severe depression classes (adjusted p = &lt;.0001 - .045). The anhedonic class performed significantly worse than the low life satisfaction (adjusted p = .002).

Regarding everyday functioning, the minimal depression class had the least reported difficulty, scoring significantly better than all classes (adjusted p = &lt;.0001 - .004) with the exception of the memory class (adjusted p = .347). The anhedonic class had the most reported difficulties, scoring significantly worse than all classes (adjusted p’s = &lt;.0001) with the exception of the severe depression class (adjusted p = .738). The severe depression class also had worse reported functioning than the memory, somatic, and minimal depression classes (adjusted p = &lt;.0001 - .001).

In terms of ES, all significant differences across all domains of cognition across classes fell in the small range (ES = .06-.39). However, in terms of everyday functioning, there were a mix of ESs that fell in the small range, and some the approached the medium range, namely the anhedonic (ES = .44) and severely depressed (ES =.41) classes compared to the minimally depressed class.

Discussion

Depression is associated with impaired cognition and everyday functioning in older adults (Weisenbach et al., 2012). Moreover, research suggests it is also a risk factor for, or early prodrome of, MCI and dementia (Byers &amp; Yaffe, 2011; Panza et al., 2010). Research has found different symptoms of depression to be differentially associated with asymmetry in cortical thickness (Dotson, Taiwo, Minto, Bogoian, &amp; Gradone, 2021) and differences in cognition (Korten et al., 2014). However, it remains understudied whether depression symptoms are differentially associated with domains of cognitive functioning and everyday functioning in older adults with MCI. The current study sought to address this gap in the literature by using factor mixture modeling to investigate the heterogeneity of depression symptoms in a large sample of older adults with MCI. As such, FMM-derived classes of depression symptoms were compared across multiple domains of cognition and informant-rated everyday function.

Our exploratory factor analysis yielded a three-factor structure identical to prior research (Mitchell, Matthews, &amp; Yesavage, 1993). Consistent with EFA-derived factors and symptom clusters identified in prior research, FMM in the current study yielded classes that including somatic complaints and anhedonia (classes 1 &amp; 3) (Mitchell, Matthews, &amp; Yesavage, 1993; Hybels et al., 2009). Symptoms in the 6th class, which included low life satisfaction, were consistent with prior research findings that identified a factor regarding “appraisal of the meaning of one’s life” (Hall et al., 2014). The 4th class (memory complaints) was consistent with prior research identifying a cognitive impairment factor (Hall et al., 2014). Moreover, FMM in the current study yielded classes of depression symptoms related to symptom severity (classes 2 &amp; 5), which has also been found to be differentially related to domains of cognitive functioning (Köhler et al., 2010). It should be noted that somatic symptoms, specifically subjective memory problems and low energy, were common across almost all classes endorsing symptoms. This is consistent with prior research on depression symptom endorsement in older adults with MCI showing that endorsement of somatic symptoms increases in old age (Gallo, Anthony, &amp; Muthén, 1994). While some have proposed that endorsement of somatic symptoms may complicate the diagnosis of late-life depression given comorbid late-life medical conditions, there is some research showing that some somatic symptoms may be better at others at predicting late-life depression (Nguyen &amp; Zonderman, 2006). Our finding of high endorsement of memory problems is of particular importance, as past research has shown that this GDS item is sensitive to follow-up conversion from MCI to dementia (Mackin et al., 2012). It is possible that the common endorsement of memory problems may reflect evidence that those within the early stages of impairment may have some preserved insight on their subjective cognitive status (Martyr, Nelis, &amp; Clare, 2014). A large proportion of the sample was classified as amnestic MCI specifically, further supporting the notion that those within the early stages of impairment may have preserved insight given the GDS item specifically asks about memory.

Overall, our findings support evidence that depression is associated with worse cognitive and everyday functioning in older adults with MCI (Johnson et al., 2013). Our findings also add to the literature suggesting that older adults experience differing depression symptoms profiles (Weisenbach et al., 2012), and their unique associations with cognitive functioning (Korten et al., 2014). Particularly, our results suggest that those with anhedonia symptoms had comparably worse function compared to most other symptom presentations, and often performed similarly to our severely depressed class. Notably, we observed the largest difference in terms of effect size when examining class differences in everyday functioning. This is of particular importance given that substantial impairment in everyday functioning is core criteria for differentiating MCI from dementia. A possible mechanism of the association of anhedonia with worse cognition is a decrease in cognitively stimulating leisure activities (Sharifian et al., 2020). Based on findings from Sharifian and colleagues (2020), it is also possible that anhedonia may decrease completion of activities more generally as well, though future research is needed. Excess activation of the immunoinflammatory system is also a proposed, shared mechanism between anhedonia and cognitive impairment in adults with major depressive disorder (McIntyre et al., 2016).

Given the differential associations observed between depression symptom profiles and cognitive functioning, our findings suggest that depression’s association with cognition should not be viewed form a unitary lens, instead focusing on a symptom specific contribution. While our results do show that severity of depression (via our severely depressed class), does predict increased cognitive and functional difficulties, our anhedonic class often showed a similar pattern. In contrast, our low life satisfaction class, had a similar cognitive and everyday functional pattern to our minimally depressed class despite reporting more symptoms on average. While our results provide promising evidence of which symptoms of depression may be of particular importance for clinicians to track in those with MCI, future, longitudinal work in this area is highly needed. Late-life depression is both unique and challenging in that it has been identified as a risk factor for current and future cognitive decline, as a prodrome to neurodegenerative conditions, and/or as a resulting consequence related to awareness of declines in cognition (Brailean et al., 2017). Recent review articles have agreed that there are likely multiple, non-exclusive pathways through which late-life depression is associated with cognitive decline and neurodegenerative conditions (Butters et al., 2022; Invernizzi, Loureiro, Arachchige, &amp; Lefebvre, 2021). Future work aimed at identifying which late-life depression pathway(s) individuals are on is of high importance.

Given our results, treatment of depression for individuals with MCI may benefit from targeting anhedonic and somatic symptoms of depression, given that they may add variance in predicting cognitive decline beyond MCI itself and in their commonalty in this population respectively. This symptom specific approach aligns with theory from the Research Domain Criteria (RDOC) (Cuthbert &amp; Insel, 2013; Woody &amp; Gibb, 2015). Recent research on motivation interventions for those with late-life depression has shown improvement in cognitive functioning (Dehn, Driessen, &amp; Beblo, 2020), though future work is needed to examine tolerability of this treatment in this population. Similarly, exercise training for depression in older adults has found to be effective in decreasing somatic symptoms like low energy (Barour &amp; Blumenthal, 2005). Our results also demonstrate that different depression symptoms have differential impacts on everyday functioning in older adults with MCI. Given everyday functioning begins to show decline in MCI (Farias et al., 2013), and that this decline is associated with a number of negative outcomes (i.e. increased caregiver burden and medical spending), identifying those with modifiable risk factors for functional decline is of high importance (Etters, Goodall, &amp; Harrison, 2008; Wimo et al., 2017). Additionally, future work examining late-life depression as a prodrome for dementia may benefit from a symptom specific approaches, particularly focusing on the role of anhedonic and somatic symptoms.

While the present study boasts a number of strengths (e.g. large sample size, rigorous statistical approach [factor mixture modeling], utilization of a robust sample size), it is important to note limitations of the current study. Our study included mostly Caucasian (79.1%) with high levels of education (m = 15.18; SD = 3.46), which limit the generalizability of our findings. Our sample in general reported low levels of depression (m = 2.6; SD = 2.75), so it remains unclear how depression symptom profiles may impact cognition in highly depressed samples, particularly in terms of effect size. However, it should be noted that 18.5% of the current sample (n =1674) endorsed a clinically elevated amount of depression symptoms. Additionally, our study utilized the GDS-15, which may not fully capture the full range of symptoms of depression an older adult may experience. Future work in this area would benefit from using larger, more extensive measures of depression symptoms. Finally, the results of the study are cross-sectional. Future work would benefit from examining longitudinal patterns of depression symptom profiles in cognition in older adults.

Taken together, our findings demonstrate the importance of examining the association of depression symptom profiles, rather than total scores, with cognition and everyday function in older adults with MCI. In particular, our findings revealed that anhedonic and somatic symptoms of depression may be particularly common and more highly associated with cognition and everyday functioning in this population, reflecting important targets for both assessment and intervention. Future, longitudinal work examining the association and timeline of depression symptom profiles, cognition, and everyday function in MCI is needed.
