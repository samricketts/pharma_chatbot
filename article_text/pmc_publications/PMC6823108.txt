Objective:

Although researchers have documented the influence of cultural factors on neuropsychological test performance, few studies have examined the distribution of test scores among neurologically healthy older adults from different ethnic groups. The objective of this study was to determine if there are group differences in neuropsychological test score distributions with ethnicity specific norms for non-Hispanic White and Black / African American older adults.

Method:

Participants from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center were selected if they were not diagnosed with dementia within 5 years (mean/SD: age = 75.26/6.98; education = 15.70/2.91). Groups were formed based on self-identified ethnicity of White (n= 5311) or Black/African American (n=1098). All participants completed neuropsychological testing including: Mini Mental State Exam, Logical Memory Immediate and Delayed, Digit Span Forward and Backward, Trail Making Test A &amp; B, Animal Naming, Vegetable Naming, Digit Symbol, and Boston Naming Test.

Results:

Based on combined ethnicity norms, the scores of Black participants were overrepresented in the below average and low-average clinical ranges and the scores of White participants were overrepresented in the high-average and superior clinical ranges for all 11 neuropsychological measures. When group specific norms were used, the unbalanced pattern of score categorization was no longer present for any of the neuropsychological measures.

Conclusions:

These findings emphasize the importance of developing and using ethnically and culturally appropriate neuropsychological test norms, as well as the risk of interpreting some Black individual’s scores as below average when they likely are not.

normal neuropsychological performance

Ethnic group differences in neuropsychological test performance have long been documented in research literature. For example, Campbell et al. (2002) researched the false positive rate among neurologically healthy African American adults who scored below normal performance cut offs according to published manuals. False positive rates were 21 to 46 percent higher among the African American participants than the normative population. Similarly, to evaluate the need for ethnicity corrections in their normative equation, two studies calculated false positive error rates for impairment on neuropsychological measures (Gladsjo et al., 1999; Norman et al., 2011). In both studies, false positive error rates were essentially reduced by half on all measures when applying ethnicity corrections. In a clinical group, White patients scored significantly higher than Black patients on many neuropsychological measures, even though the groups had similar diagnoses and age and education were controlled for (Boone, Victor, Wen, Razani, and Ponton, 2007). Differences in both clinical and healthy populations highlight the importance of cultural influences on neuropsychological test performance.

In a series of studies with older adults entitled Mayo’s Older African Americans Normative Studies (MOAANS), Lucas and colleagues (Lucas et al., 2005a, 2005b, 2005c, 2005; Pedraza et al., 2005; Rilling et al., 2005) developed neuropsychological norms for African Americans based on performance of about 300 cognitively normal older adults who lived near Jacksonville, Florida. While MOAANS is one of the largest normative sets for older African Americans, the sample was limited to adults who were primarily educated in southern segregated schools, which could greatly impact the generalization of their findings to African Americans outside that geographic region. One aim of MOAANS was to determine via factor structure if their assessment battery measured the same constructs in older African Americans and Whites (Pedraza et al., 2005). They found that a five-factor model including verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, attention/concentration, learning and retention was “nearly identical” to a model previously established with White participants. Two other groups similarly found that the factor structure for cognitive measures in African American older adults was similar to 5 factor theories that have been validated in studies using samples of predominately White participants (Whitfield, Allaire, Gamaldo, &amp; Bichsel, 2010, Barnes et al. 2016).

Although neuropsychological tests measure the same cognitive constructs in different ethnic groups, ethnic based norms lead to more accurate clinical classification. African American participants in MOAANS scored two to four scale score points lower on the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 when using standard norms compared to MOAANS (Rilling et al., 2005). When these lower scores were corrected with ethnicity adjusted norms, participants often crossed the threshold from an impaired classification to within normal limits (Rilling et al., 2005). Pedraza et al. (2009) found that White participants correctly named all but one item on the Boston Naming Test more frequently than Black participants. Pedraza et al. (2012) found that White cognitively normal research participants scored statistically significantly higher than Black participants on the MMSE despite adjusting for age and education level. However, when adjusting for age and quality of education as measured by Wide Range Achievement Test-3 (WRAT-3), the difference in scores was no longer statistically significant.

Many studies have replicated these results in other geographic regions of the United States and across additional cognitive domains (Manly et al., 1998; Manly et al., 2002; Mehta et al., 2004; Morgan, Marsiske, &amp; Whitfield, 2008; Schwartz et al., 2004; Spering et al., 2012; Strickland, Longobardi, Alperson, &amp; Andre, 2005). Each study found significantly lower scores among African American participants compared to White participants. Consistently, discrepancies persisted after controlling for socioeconomic variables such as education, occupation, and medical history. Accounting for quality of education, often measured with a standardized literacy measure such as WRAT-3, was best at attenuating discrepancies in neuropsychological performance across domains, but did not eliminate these differences.

Furthermore, theories of life course epidemiology have been suggested as explanations for ethnic differences in neuropsychological test performance. These theories explain that early life experiences, epigenetic influences such as childhood socioeconomic status, and social integration, are related to healthy cognitive aging and expression of neurodegenerative diseases (Glymour &amp; Manly, 2008; Melrose et al., 2015). For example, hypertension is considered an expression of epigenetic influences that can impact cognition (Carvalho et al., 2014; Lezak et al., 2012; Mozaffarian et al., 2016; Schneider et al., 2015). There is an association between differential life experiences, such as socioeconomic status, and rates of hypertension beyond what is explained by genetic differences between ethnic groups (Manly &amp; Echemendia, 2007). Rates of hypertension in African Americans are among the highest in the world, with a two to three fold higher risk for stroke compared to White Americans (Mozaffarian et al., 2016).

Manly et al. (1998) found that measures of acculturation were statistically related to lower scores on the Information subtest of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), Boston Naming Test, Trail Making Test B, and Story Memory Test. They concluded that lack of exposure to stimuli related to Information and Boston Naming Test likely explained lower performance among participants preferring African American culture because there were no differences in overall intellectual ability between those preferring African American culture more and those preferring it less. In another component of their study, Manly et al. (1998) matched Black and White participants on demographic variables and found that measures of acculturation accounted for ethnic group differences on Figure learning, WAIS-R Block Design, and Category Test, indicating that differences in performance on memory, construction and problem-solving tests are also culturally related.

In sum, although factor analysis of neuropsychological tests indicates they measure similar constructs in different ethnic groups, for adults of all ages in the United States, research consistently shows Black participants score lower than White participants on neuropsychological measures across cognitive domains. Health status and environmental variables such as education, literacy, and financial status explain some of the differences in scores, but differences often persist even when controlling for these variables. This is of particular importance for older African-Americans for whom use of culturally inappropriate norms increases the risk of misdiagnoses of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Few studies have examined differences in ethnic group performance utilizing a nationwide sample of neurologically healthy older adults. The objectives of this study are to: 1) determine if there are ethnic group differences in the distribution of neuropsychological test scores across five clinical ranges for a sample of older healthy older adults from 33 sites across the United States; 2) determine if ethnicity specific norms alter the distribution of scores across clinical ranges; and 3) identify the percentage of scores that change clinical range based on the norms applied.

Method

National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC)

The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS) consists of longitudinal data collected from 33 past and present Alzheimer’s disease Centers (ADC). The aim is to develop a uniform database across ADCs in order to characterize mild Alzheimer’s disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) based on common clinical observations such as neuropsychological assessment, neurological exam, and assessment of activities of daily living. (Morris et al., 2006). Data for this study were collected from September 2005 through May 2015.

Sample

Participants were recruited from each of the 33 past and present ADCs utilizing various recruitment strategies, depending on the ADC. Participants for this study were 6409 volunteers from ADCs (gender: 36% male; mean/SD: age = 75.26/6.98; education = 15.70/2.91) who were not diagnosed with dementia within five years and had no history of stroke, Parkinson’s Disease, imaging evidence of cerebrovascular disease, Huntington’s Disease, or traumatic brain injury with enduring cognitive deficits. Diagnoses of neurocognitive and mood status were based on trained clinician diagnosis or consensus of two or more clinicians. Clinicians were researchers and practitioners in psychiatry, psychology, or neurology. Participants whose primary language was not English were excluded. Written informed consents were obtained from participants at each ADC and approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) of each ADC. Research using the NACC database was approved by the University of Washington IRB.

Descriptive statistics for the sample are presented in Table 1. Participants were divided into two groups of self-identified race or ethnicity, non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black / African American, as defined by the NACC database. For brevity, the groups will be referred to as “White” for the non-Hispanic White group and “Black” for the non-Hispanic Black / African American group. There were 5311 White participants (gender: 39.3% male; mean/SD: age = 75.50/7.10; education = 16.00/2.74), 1098 Black participants (gender: 20.5% male; mean/SD: age = 74.09/6.26; education = 14.24/3.24). The groups’ age and education scores were compared using t tests. Chi-square was used to compare gender. The two racial groups were statistically significantly different on all demographic factors. However, examination of the data in Table 1 indicates that, while statistically significant, the only demographic differences that are clinically significant is the percentage of males and possibly level of education.

Assessment Procedures

Data for analyses were collected on the initial visit at an ADC. Follow up visits confirmed no change in neuropsychological status over 5 years. A complete description of neuropsychological measures was published by Weintraub et al. (2009). Neuropsychological Measures included Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) (Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975), Boston Naming Test (BNT, 30 odd-numbered items), Digit Symbol of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) (Wechsler, 1987), Trail Making Test-A &amp; B (Reitan &amp; Wolfson, 1993), Digit Span Forward and Digit Span Backward of the WMS-R (Wechsler, 1987), Animal Naming, Vegetable Naming, Logical Memory immediate (LM I), and delayed (LM II) of the WMS-R (Wechsler, 1987).

Data Analysis

All neuropsychological test scores were coded as z-scores based on UDS normative data which was established using normal control participants and accounting for age, gender, and education (Weintraub et al., 2009). The mean score for each group was compared using independent samples t-tests, presented in Table 2.

The first aim was to determine if the groups’ scores were distributed proportionally across clinical performance ranges: below average, low-average, average, high-average, and superior. Chi-square analyses were used to determine if the proportion of scores falling in performance ranges was dependent on ethnicity using UDS norms. Clinical ranges were defined by the following percentile score parameters: 0–9 = below average; 10–24 = low-average; 25–74 = average; 75–90 = high-average; 91–100 = superior.

The second aim of the study was to determine if ethnicity specific norms altered the distribution of scores across clinical ranges. Regression based normative equations were calculated for Black and White participants separately using age, gender, and education. All demographic variables were entered in one step for each group. Utilizing the same approach as Shirk et al. (2011) for the NACC UDS online normative calculator, z-score estimates were calculated by subtracting the predicted population mean (Y’) score from the individual raw score (Y) and dividing by the root square mean of the regression equation (RMSE) (Figure 1). Statistics for neuropsychological measures based on ethnicity specific norms are presented in Table 2. Finally, percentage of neuropsychological test scores that moved above or below the below average classification cutoff was calculated when using UDS combined ethnic norms compared to ethnic specific norms developed from participants in this study.

Results

For the first aim, each analysis produced a significant χ2 value (χ2 (4) = 22.84–837.53, p&lt;.001), indicating the proportion of scores across clinical performance ranges depended on ethnicity. Summary of Chi-square Statistics using UDS Norms are presented in Table 3 and histograms of proportion of scores across clinical performance ranges are presented in Figure 2. For all 11 neuropsychological measures, the Black participants’ scores were overrepresented in the below average and low-average categories and the White participants’ scores were overrepresented in the high-average and superior categories.

For the second aim of the study, a series of linear multiple regressions were conducted to establish regression based norms for each ethnic group separately and to determine the impact of age, gender, and education on neuropsychological measures in the two groups. Standardized regression coefficients are displayed in Table 4 and coefficients for regression based norms are presented in Tables 5 and 6. In both ethnic groups, age and education were statistically significant predictors on all measures; gender was a statistically significant predictor for Digit Symbol and measures of memory and language. Examination of regression equations reveals potential structural differences in the equations, indicating a difference in the relationship between the predictor variables and performance on neuropsychological measures in the two groups. For example, education was a stronger predictor and accounted for more variance on all measures among the Black participants compared to the White participants. Age was also a stronger predictor and accounted for more variance on measures of memory and language, with the exception of semantic fluency, for the Black participants. However, age was a stronger predictor and accounted for more variance on all attention and working memory measures except Digit Span Forward for the White participants. Among the White participants, age was a stronger predictor of performance on measures with a speeded component and education was a stronger predictor of performance on tasks without a speeded component. Education had the largest influence on performance across all measures for the Black participants, both with and without a speed component.

As expected, there were no group differences in average z-score using ethnicity specific norms. Summary of chi-square statistics using ethnicity specific norms are presented in Table 7 and histograms of proportion of scores across clinical performance ranges are presented in Figure 3. When considering the spread of performance in the two groups using ethnicity specific norms, the results from chi-square analyses were varied. Digit Symbol, Digit Span Backwards - total trials, Animal Fluency, Vegetable Fluency, Logical Memory-Immediate recall, and Logical Memory- Delayed recall no longer produced a significant χ2 value, indicating that the proportion of scores across performance ranges was not dependent on ethnicity. Chi-square analyses for MMSE, Boston Naming Test, Trails A, Trails B, Digit Span Forward - total trials and length of longest span, and Digit Span Backward - length of longest span produced a significant χ2 value (χ2(4) = 14.29–258.47, p&lt;.001-.006), indicating the proportion of scores across clinical performance ranges continued to depend on ethnicity. Although a statistical difference is detected in the distribution of the scores across the 5 performance categories, the pattern of the Black participants’ scores being overrepresented in the below average and low-average categories and the White participants’ scores being overrepresented in the high-average and superior categories is no longer present with the use of ethnicity specific norms. Rather, there are small percentage differences in the spread of scores across clinical range classifications. For some neuropsychological tests, there is a higher percentage of the Black participants’ scores in above average clinical ranges. For other tests there is a higher percentage of the Black participants’ scores in below average clinical ranges. For yet other tests, while the total percentage of the Black and White participants’ scores was comparable for the two lowest clinical ranges combined (i.e. below average and low-average ranges combined), a significant Chi-square value resulted from the percentage of one group’s scores being greater in the low-average category and the percentage of the other group’s scores greater in the below average category.

From 28–74 percent of scores for the Black participants that originally fell in the below average range (less than 10th percentile) were no longer classified in the below average range when using ethnicity specific norms. From 0.76–7 percent of scores for the White participants were lowered from the average to below average performance category when using ethnicity specific norms. Percentage of scores that improved to above the 10th percentile for each measure among the Black participants and scores that declined to below the 10th percentile among the White participants are presented in Table 8. Conversely, there was also movement of the scores in the opposite direction of interest for this study, scores that declined to below the 10th percentile among the Black participants and scores that improved to above the 10th percentile among the White participants. From 0–8 percent of scores for the Black participants were downgraded from the average to below average performance category when using ethnicity specific norms. From 0–81 percent of scores for the White participants that originally fell in the below average range were no longer classified below average when using ethnicity specific norms.

Discussion

The Black participants scored significantly lower than the White participants on 10 of 11 neuropsychological tests. Chi-square analysis indicated these group differences were associated with different distributions of scores across clinical performance ranges that depended on ethnicity. For all 11 neuropsychological measures, the Black participants’ scores were overrepresented in the below average and low-average categories and the White participants’ scores were overrepresented in the high-average and superior categories. As expected, when using ethnicity specific regression based norms, there were no significant differences between the two groups average standardized test scores (i.e. z-scores). Chi-square analyses indicate that when these ethnicity specific norms were applied, the Black participants’ scores were no longer overrepresented in the below average and low-average ranges and the White participants’ scores were no longer overrepresented in the high-average and superior ranges. The distribution of scores across performance ranges was quite similar for the two groups. These results are consistent with previous research demonstrating Black participants score lower than White participants on neuropsychological tests (Campbell et al., 2002; Manly et al., 1998; Manly et al., 2002; Mehta et al., 2004; Morgan et al., 2008; Pedraza et al., 2009; Pedraza et al., 2012; Rilling et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2004; Spering et al., 2012; Strickland et al., 2005) and with previous research showing a substantial reduction in false positive rates among African American participants with ethnicity corrections (Gladsjo et al., 1999; Norman et al., 2011).

Rates of scores that declined performance ranges for the Black participants and, for the most part, rates of scores that improved performance ranges for the White participants were low using ethnicity specific norms. The exceptions are around 20% of scores that improved above the 10th percentile for the White participants for three attention and memory tests, and 80% of scores that improved above the 10th percentile for the White participants for the Boston Naming test. Some participants in the present study were included in the Weintraub et al. (2009) normative data used for this study. It is not clear to what extent this overlap or methodological differences between our study and Weintraub et al’s (2009) may account for the higher than expected percent of scores that improved above the 10th percentile for the White participants on four measures. In any case, these somewhat anomalous findings for the White participants do not impact the main findings related to score improvement rates among the Black participants.

Age and education were statistically significant predictors on all neuropsychological measures in both racial groups. In both racial groups, gender was a statistically significant predictor only for measures of memory, language, and the processing speed measure Digit Symbol. Examination of regression equations reveals potential structural differences in the equations, indicating a difference in the relationship between the predictor variables and test performance in the two groups. For example, in general, education was a stronger predictor of test scores in Blacks and age was a stronger predictor in Whites. It is widely known that level of education can greatly impact performance on neuropsychological tests (Lezak, Howieson, Bigler, &amp; Tranel, 2012), and research has shown that there is more to the story than years of education alone (Manly, Jacobs, Touradji, Small, &amp; Stern, 2002; O’Bryant et al., 2007; O’Bryant, Schrimsher, &amp; O’Jile, 2005). Multiple studies have found that discrepancies between reported years of education and measured reading level are larger among African American participants compared to White participants (Manly et al., 2002; O’Bryant, Schrimsher, &amp; O’Jile, 2005; O’Bryant et al., 2007). These differences can most likely be attributed to differences in quality of educational experience as evidenced by disparities in average money spent on each student per year, teacher salary, number of books per student, and length of school day (Lucas et al., 2005). Manly (2005) concluded that disparities in educational experience likely lead to differences in knowledge, familiarity, and problem-solving strategies, which can impact performance on neuropsychological tests across cognitive domains and may account for potential structural differences in the equations for each group.

Strengths and Limitations of the Present Study.

A primary strength of this study is the utilization of a large national sample from many regions of the United States. To our knowledge, previous similar studies utilized geographically localized samples with the next most inclusive study utilizing six sites from Midwest and East Coast (Morgan et al., 2008). This study adds to the depth of the literature by replicating results in a sample from geographically diverse regions of the United States. However, because various recruitment strategies are utilized across the different NACC sites, participant equality cannot be assumed between the sites. Similarly, the normative equations utilized in the current study may not be appropriate for clinical use because of the various recruitment strategies utilized by different sites.

The current study also adds to the depth of the literature by including only participants with 5 years of follow up to confirm no diagnosis of dementia. To our knowledge, previous studies have not utilized a longitudinal approach to ensure that baseline assessments were not impacted by subthreshold cognitive decline. This helps to establish higher confidence that this sample was cognitively healthy. However, the participants are highly educated across both ethnic groups and may not be representative of the general population in this regard.

A primary benefit of studying ethnicity specific norms is better sensitivity and specificity for neuropsychological tests with the goal of improved diagnostic accuracy (Gasquoine, 2009; Manly, 2005; Manly &amp; Echemendia, 2007). Ethnicity specific norms may lead to development of new measures that are more culturally valid for minority individuals. The percentage of minority individuals is predicted to continue to increase and without research to support clinical decisions, the field will be left without means for appropriate assessment.

It is important, however, to consider the limitations of ethnic classifications. Ethnic group categories are socially defined, amenable to change, and not rooted in science or genetics (Gasquoine, 2009; Manly, 2005). Furthermore, racial classifications imply an overarching assumption that phenotypic traits consistently correlate with genetic and cultural similarities (Gasquoine, 2009; Manly, 2005). In neuropsychological research and practice, however, race or ethnicity often serve as a proxy for variables that are known to impact cognitive functioning such as educational experiences and socioeconomic status (Manly &amp; Echemendia, 2007). The current study adds to existing literature by demonstrating a change in performance range classification when education is weighted based for a single ethnic group.

A potential drawback to research examining ethnic differences in neuropsychological test performance is the possibility for harmful misinterpretation of results (Gasquoine, 2009; Manly, 2005). There are numerous examples throughout history of the utilization of cognitive tests to promote preferential treatment and views of inferiority for lower scoring groups or superiority for higher scoring groups. There is a significant social risk for over-attribution of discrepancies between races to biological or genetic causes and under-emphasizing cultural bias of tasks and questions. Misinterpretation could also lead to an increase in false negative errors, which could impede documentation of need for services or resources if an impairment is incorrectly considered intact (Gasquoine, 2009; Manly, 2005). Conversely, the current study only provides data for older adults and could be used to address the social risk of some Black older adults potentially losing autonomy because they are deemed as impaired or cognitively declining when they likely are not based on the results from this study and previous literature documenting lower baseline performance levels.

A limitation of the study design is inability to consider social interactions that impact cognitive test performance, considering ethnicity based norms cannot completely account for these variables. For instance, cognitive testing is conducted in a social situation involving many assumptions that are culturally dependent (Ardila, 2005; Sternberg, 2004). Examiners ask examinees to provide their “best performance” to obtain valid results. However, some research has shown that African Americans are more likely to believe that creative or expansive answers are rewarded more than obvious ones, and therefore, may select nonobvious answers in an effort to provide the best response. Also, it is assumed that the person who is being tested is culturally similar to the normative group that the test was originally validated on in several facets including the conceptualization of speed, the utilization of testing strategies, the impact of being in a one-to-one interaction, the impact of being in an isolated environment, and the assumed authority of the examiner administering tests.

Similarly, perceived discrimination by an examiner of a different race has been associated with poorer performance on memory tasks in a non-clinical sample of African Americans (Thames et al., 2013). African American participants exposed to stereotype threat had poorer neuropsychological performance across cognitive domains compared to individuals who were not exposed to stereotype threat (Thames et al., 2013). Functional imaging shows that when exposed to stereotype threat prior to the administration of a math working memory task, parts of the brain associated with social and emotional processing are more activated and areas of the brain more associated with math are less activated compared to individuals not exposed (Krendl, Richeson, Kelley, &amp; Heatherton, 2008). Other studies have shown that test anxiety among African American individuals is more likely to be negatively correlated with performance on neuropsychological measures compared to European Americans (Thames et al., 2015). Concern about how poor performance would be perceived by others and self-image were the primary sources on anxiety for African Americans in the study, where European Americans in the study experienced anxiety related to not being well prepared for the test (Thames et al., 2015). Even outside of the testing situation, higher levels of perceived discrimination related chronic stress are associated with lower performance on tests of episodic memory and perceptual speed, even after controlling for vascular risk factors, age, sex, and education (Barnes et al., 2012).

Direction for Future Research.

Future studies could build on the current findings by comparing the long term, predictive power of ethnic combined versus ethnic specific norms: for example, predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s dementia. Additional analyses could be conducted to confirm demographic structural equation differences between the two groups as well. Follow up or replication studies could add to the power of these findings by adjusting the procedures to match groups on demographic variables, control for variance accounted for by site of participation, and control for health status differences, such as cerebrovascular disease load.

To our knowledge, few studies use the approach of creating two separate ethnic group normative equations rather than including ethnic group as a variable in a normative equation. Additional research is needed to validate the practice of using ethnic specific equations compared to including ethnicity as a variable a single equation. It would also be interesting to see if these results are replicated across education level or age cohorts. More importantly, it will likely be beneficial to deconstruct the concept of race and investigate variables that racial group classification serves as a proxy for in the practice of neuropsychology. In particular, studies could assess and describe the relationship between neuropsychological performance and quality of education, acculturation, socioeconomic status, health status, and examiner-examinee impact, such as perceived discrimination. Future studies should include additional ethnic groups as results from the two groups included in this study should not be generalized to other groups who may differ culturally.

Conclusions.

Neuropsychological tests and testing procedures are inherently culturally biased. The results of this study emphasize the importance of considering ethnicity and different life experiences related to ethnicity and culture when developing, norming, and interpreting neuropsychological tests in order to reduce the risk of interpreting some Black individual’s scores as impaired when they likely are not.

Public Significant Statement:

The current study utilized a sample of healthy older adults to demonstrate the potential for over-pathologizing Black patients’ neuropsychological performance compared to similar White older adults. The proportion of Black participant scores categorized as below average decreased when ethnicity specific norms were used. The results of this study emphasize the importance of considering ethnicity and culture when developing, norming, and interpreting neuropsychological tests in order to reduce the risk of interpreting some Black individual’s scores as impaired when they likely are not.
