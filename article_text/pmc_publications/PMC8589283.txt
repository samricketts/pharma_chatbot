Donepezil (DNPZ) is one of the few FDA-approved widely used medication in the clinical care of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. To investigate the effect of geometry and to find the significance of an enol form if any in DNPZ on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, we changed the tetrahedral geometry of DNPZ to planar trigonal pyramidal geometry by replacing the α-carbon atom next to ketone functionality with a nitrogen atom. To mimic 1-indanone in DNPZ, we selected 1-isoindolinone framework to synthesize 25 new DNPZ derivatives and characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and ESI-MS spectroscopy methods. Drug likeliness profile for each compound was predicted using Molinspiration online software following Lipinski’s rule. Commercially available assay kits were used to measure AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitory effects. NIH/3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line was used to measure cytotoxic and proliferation effects using LDH and MTT assay, respectively. Compound #20 was selected for comparative computational docking, modelling and physicochemical studies. Our results show that DNPZ with tetrahedral geometry has 3-fold higher AChE inhibition as compared to compound #20 with planar trigonal pyramidal geometry. Our approach may be useful as a novel indirect method to study the significance of the enol form in DNPZ (or similar compounds), since constant interconversion between the keto and enol forms does not permit a direct determination of the effect of the enol form of DNPZ in vivo. Overall, we conclude that the tetrahedral is a better fit and any change in geometry significantly drives down the cholinesterase inhibitory effect of DNPZ.

pmc1. Introduction

Donepezil (DNPZ), a 1-indanone derivative, is clinically used as an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to treat dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The loss of cholinergic neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) correlate with the severity of cognitive impairment. DNPZ binds and reversibly inactivates the acetylcholinesterase enzyme preventing the hydrolysis of acetylcholine resulting in increased acetylcholine concentrations at cholinergic synapses ameliorating some symptoms by improved cognition. Currently used DNPZ (IC50 = 5.9 nM) is orally administered as a safe racemic mixture of R and S isomers wherein peak plasma concentration of S-DNPZ is 2.6-fold higher than R-DNPZ.1 Some reports also mention R-DNPZ 2.2-fold higher potent inhibitor of AChE compared to S-DNPZ.2–3 Further work on the keto-enol tautomerism, geometry of the molecule and its LogP characteristics will provide better understanding to develop new compounds with greater efficacy.

In DNPZ, geometry of the α-carbon atom next to ketone functionality is tetrahedral in keto form and planar trigonal pyramidal in enol form. Crystallography evidence shows DNPZ in keto form complexed with human AChE.4 The effect of change in geometry of the α-carbon atom next to ketone functionality is not clear due to constant interconvertible nature of the molecule via a keto-enol intermediate with a half-life of 77.7h at 37°C and due to the lack of a direct method to study these changes.5 With existence of both keto and enol forms at equilibrium it is challenging to maintain keto form exclusively in-vivo when easily enolizable proton is available. Literature search revealed a Fluoro-Donepezil (F-DNPZ) with non-enolizable keto functionality with increased AChE inhibitiory (IC50 = 1.3 nM) activity.1, 6–7 Therefore, we planned to explore the significance of change in geometry of α-carbon atom next to ketone functionality (without disturbing its ketone functionality) by incorporating nitrogen atom in place of carbon and comparing the resulting keto structure of compound #20 (a close mimic) with DNPZ structure.

Donepezil is a five membered cyclic ketone derived from 1-indanone scaffold (C9H8O). 1-Isoindolinone (C8H7NO) is a close structural match to 1-indanone and it contains a nitrogen at α- position in place of trisubstituted carbon present in 1-indanone. Both, 1-isoindolinone and 1-indanone are chemically neutral. 1-Isoindolinone moiety is found in a wide range of naturally occurring compounds with impressive biological properties8–33 and in several synthetic and substituted substances with therapeutic potential for various diseases. 1-isoindolinones or phthalimidines (Figure 1) framework have been of interest to synthetic and medicinal chemists for several decades.

Review of literature indicated a paucity of studies comparing the 1-isoindolinone and 1-indanone frameworks.34–35 Comparison of Ondansetron (a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist) and its piperidone analog (1-N-methylindolo[2,3-e]piperidone) (Figure 2)36–45 also with serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist activity, provides a parallel example. These two compounds differ at the ring C without disturbing the other functional groups of the molecule (Figure 2).

Therefore, we designed a simple synthetic approach to generate a library of compounds with a goal to obtain 1-isoindolinone derivative with non-enolizable stable keto form as a close mimic for a direct comparison with the keto form of 1-indanone in DNPZ. We used molecular modeling, docking score and interaction energy (MMGBSA dG Bind) of various forms of donepezil and selected analogs to analyze the impact of simple molecular geometry difference (tetrahedral versus trigonal) on enolizable α-methylene proton and its effects on cytotoxicity and inhibitory effects on cholinesterase enzymes in vitro. Basically, being part of a ring tightens the intra-ring bond angle for the donepezil compounds, nitrogen atom making a little larger angle for compound #20. Compound #20 displays an intermediate geometry between the tetrahedral and planar. Results presented here show that unique geometry and functional groups are required for AChE inhibition as none of the synthesized compounds using 1-isoindolinone caused significant inhibition of AChE.

2. Results and Discussion

2.1. Synthesis of compounds:

A total of 25 compounds were synthesized in two groups (Scheme 1). Group I contained compounds 4–18 and Group II contained compounds 19–28. Starting material, 1 (methyl 2-(bromomethyl)-4,5-dimethoxybenzoate) was prepared following published methods with appropriate modifications as needed.46

For synthesizing compounds in Group-I, N-alkylated 1-isoindolinone BOC intermediates (2 &amp; 3) and the other compounds (4-16) were prepared via N-alkylation of all primary amines with 1 followed by intramolecular cyclization with methyl ester in basic protic condition at elevated temperature to give N-alkylated 1-isoindolinones, as Group-I products. Compounds 2 &amp; 3 were deBOC in methanolic HCl condition to give compound 17 &amp; 18 in quantitative yields as hydrochloride salts.

To obtain compounds in Group-II, compound 18 was further N-alkylated in DMF using potassium carbonate followed by simultaneously deBOC in methanolic HCl solution to give compound 19 as hydrochloride salt in quantitative yield. Next, compound 18 was also N-alkylated in DMF using potassium carbonate with appropriate alkyl halides to give compounds 20–28.

Structures of the newly synthesized compounds were elucidated using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and ESI-MS spectroscopic methods (see characterization details for all compounds in the experimental section and related graphical data in supplementary materials).

2.2. In silico physicochemical properties of synthesized compounds:

In silico physicochemical properties for all 25 compounds are presented in Table 1. All synthesized compounds followed Lipinski’s rule with no violation. These properties of synthesized compounds ranged within the limits of Lipinski’s rule of 5. Thus, M.Wt.(284.31 – 411.50), LogP (0.68 – 2.79), tPSA (42.02 – 73.80), nON (2 – 7), nOHNH (0 – 2), vol (256.92 – 385.24) and nrotb (4 – 7) were noted. For better understanding, all physicochemical property values in Table 1 are for free bases. Some of the compounds were transformed into their hydrochloride salts for better solubility and screening using in vitro methods for cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Salt form would have better physicochemical properties than a free base form. Compound #20 being the molecule of interest, we provided LogP values both in free base as well as salt forms.

A comparison of the physicochemical properties of compound #20 with standard DNPZ showed that (#20 vs DNPZ) LogP was much lower 2.79 vs 4.10, tPSA was slightly higher 42.02 vs 38.78, and nON was higher 5.0 vs 4.0. Lower LogP of compound #20 suggests greater hydrophilicity thus improved aqueous solubility for better distribution, slightly higher tPSA value suggests similar or better absorption including intestinal absorption, bioavailability, Caco-2 permeability and blood-brain barrier penetration, and higher number of hydrogen receptor value (nON) implies better binding availability to hydrogen donors to influence activity. Thus, a slightly better pharmacokinetic profile of compound #20 than DNPZ enhances its potential biological significance.

Early data on absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) and toxicity (T) of newly synthesized chemicals provide guidance for evaluating pharmacokinetic profiles during early stages of drug discovery process. Good pharmacokinetic profiles facilitate selection of key molecule(s) for further in-vitro testing and synthetic modifications as needed for optimization. We used the online virtual screening Molinspiration property program to determine drug likeliness properties following Lipinski’s rule47–52 and to determine the required optimization. The criteria for this program include search of PubChem (&gt;33 million compounds), conversion from SDfile format to SMILES, normalization, and calculation of the physicochemical properties. As a rule, for an orally active drug no more than one violation of Lipinski’s rule be present in the given molecule.49 All synthesized compounds were found acceptable based on these multiple criteria.

2.3. Molecular modeling and docking studies:

Molecular modeling was performed by docking various stereoisomer and tautomerization states of donepezil along with analogs with slightly changed planar trigonal pyramidal geometry into the structure acetylcholinesterase bound to R-donepezil (PDB ID 4EY7) 3 and then performing a full-atom minimization of the protein and ligand at the interface. Cheung et al.4 described several key interactions involving ring stacking between the aromatic groups on each end of donepezil with W86 and W286, as well as water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen in the piperidine ring as well as the methoxy groups. Because the piperidine nitrogen is likely protonated, there are also likely cation-pi interactions with F337, F338, and W86. Finally, the carbonyl of donepezil makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone amine of F295.

As expected, the native, and more active, R enantiomer of donepezil was modeled with all of the interactions observed in the solved structure, and the lowest docking score and interaction energy following minimization. The S enantiomer and the enolized form were modeled with similar docking scores, but after minimization, the S enantiomer had the highest interaction energy, while the interaction energy of the enolized form was between (Table 2).

To assess whether a compound with geometry similar to the enolized form could have activity, modeling was performed with proposed analogs. Analogs #20 and 28 both had higher docking scores than even the S enantiomer, however following minimization, both analogs were modeled with lower interaction energies than both the enolized form of donepezil and the S enantiomer, though not as low as the more active R enantiomer. Because the modeling (and especially the refinement) was done without explicit waters, it is unclear how that change would be tolerated. Specifically, in the crystal structure of R-donepezil, the piperidine nitrogen makes interactions with ordered waters. It is unknown if the rotated piperidine would be able to interact with waters in a similar way, or if such a pose would have less activity due to solvation. Furthermore, without waters, it is unknown whether the nitrogen in the terminal ring of 28 would enhance or deteriorate the activity. Despite those questions, these results do capture the reduced activity observed with #20 and 28.

Compound #20 is modeled to make many of the key interactions that R-donepezil makes including the ring stacking, pi-cation, and the hydrogen bond involving the carbonyl (Figure 3A). Compared to the enolized form of donepezil, even though compound #20 has an almost planar geometry similar to the enolized form of donepezil, it is modeled to fill the pocket differently (Figure 3B). Indeed, it is modeled with greater similarly to the more active R enantiomer of donepezil, although there are some slight differences that are not large enough to lose the pi-pi interaction between the fused ring and W286 as well as the pi-pi interaction between the phenyl group and W86 (Figure 3C).

Like compound #20, compound 28 is modeled to fit well in the binding site and make the same key interactions, including the ring stacking, pi-cation, and hydrogen bond (Figure 3D). Indeed, both #20 and 28 modeled almost identically, with the piperidines aligned perfectly (Figure 3E). The slight differences in the interaction energy can be explained by the slight differences between the rings at the ends of the molecules (Figure 3E). Interestingly, these differences bring the docked pose of 28 closer to that of R-donepezil than #20, particularly the ring at the opening of the binding pocket (Figure 3F). Interestingly, 28 has higher inhibitory activity than #20.

Unlike the planar analogs #20 and 28, the enolized form is modeled to lose the interaction between the terminal phenyl group and W86 (Figure 3G) due to the changes in the location of the phenyl ring relative to R donepezil (Figure 3H).

2.4. Cytotoxicity, cell proliferation and enzyme inhibitory effects of synthesized compounds.

Results of in vitro effects of synthesized compounds on cell viability, cell proliferation and enzyme activity (AChE and BuChE) are summarized in Table 3. Cytotoxicity assessment measuring release of LDH using commercially available kit showed that none of the synthesized compounds was cytotoxic. Likewise, detection of MTT using a commercially available kit showed none of the compounds affected cell proliferation compared to untreated controls.

Table 3 also includes results of the effect of synthesized compounds (1μM) on in vitro activities of AChE and BuChE using modified Ellman’s spectrophotometric method53 DNPZ was used as a positive control for AChE activity and Tacrine for BuChE activity for comparison. None of the compounds (4–28) caused remarkable inhibition of either ChE enzyme (Table 3). Compound 28 caused ~25% inhibition of AChE activity and was the most effective among all compounds. Analog #20 showed only 20.4% AChE inhibitory activity vs. that caused by DNPZ (91.33%). Result showed that DNPZ as more potent AChE inhibitor than all of our 25 compounds. Similar results were obtained for the inhibitory effect of synthesized compounds on BuChE activity. Compounds 7, 11, 24 caused 10–20% inhibition of BuChE activity while compounds 4, 10, 14, 16, 23, 26, 27 and 28 showed minimal BuChE inhibitory activity. Others have also reported relatively small inhibitory effect of synthsized compounds vis-a -vis Donepezil. In a previously published report, 15 compounds were synthesized by modifying ring “C” of the DNPZ molecule. Only one compound caused 19% AChE inhibition. Of the remaining compounds, eight compounds caused 0.13–5.12% inhibition whereas 6 compounds showed no AChE inhibitory activity.54

As evidenced by the results presented above, structure and geometry of the ligand played an important role for the optimum interaction and inhibition of an enzyme. Thus, the structure and geometry of the ligand should be best fit and/or closely match to the known standard ligand for target activation/inhibition. Presently, we compared the inhibitory activity of 25 synthesized compound using DNPZ and Tacrine as reference ligands for AChE and BuChE, respectively. Only 3 compounds showed moderate 18–25% AChE inhibitory and other 3 compounds showed ~13–19% BuChE inhibitory activity at 1μM concentration. Compound #20 with only 20.4% inhibitory effect at 1μM compared to 91.34% inhibition by Donepezil (1 μM) differed from DNPZ with regard to functionality. DNPZ contains cyclic ketone with enolizable proton and compound #20 contains cyclic N-alkylated amide group without enolizable proton.

A change in the geometry of DNPZ molecule in the present work was achieved by switching the α- carbon bearing the enolizable proton with nitrogen atom. The α- carbon atom of compound #20 is slight planar trigonal pyramidal in shape with a measured angle of 118.9° (C-N-C) due to a nitrogen while that in DNPZ is tetrahedral with a dihedral angle of 111.4° (C-C-C). Due to absence of a non-enolizable proton, compound #20 can be considered and compared as a close mimic with the keto form of DNPZ. On the other hand, for enolized DNPZ measured angle was found to be 127.2° (C-C-C) which is slightly larger than a simple bite angle of 120° in a plane. Overall, a ring structure tightens the intra-ring bond angle for donepezil compounds, nitrogen atom making the angle slightly larger for compound #20. This geometry is an intermediate between the tetrahedral and planar geometry with an angle difference of 7.5° between compound #20 and keto DNPZ. Similarly, a 7.2° angle difference was found between the enolized DNPZ and a simple planar bite angle. This switch from C to N changed the tetrahedral geometry of the α- carbon to slight planar trigonal pyramidal in the resulting amide i.e. compound #20. This change in geometry appears unfavorable for binding of the molecule #20 in the AChE pocket as compared to tetrahedral geometry of the DNPZ. It is notable that the change of α- carbon to nitrogen resulted in (i) compound #20 with lower LogP value of 2.79 due to more hydrophilic nature of amide compared to 4.10 of ketone in standard DNPZ (Table 1), (ii) no change in pH as both functionalities are chemically neutral, and (iii) good molecular interactions between compound #20 and AChE than standard DNPZ in the absence of waters in docking studies. A poor activity of compound #20 may be the result of unavoidable presence of water molecules during activity assays in vitro. Further, the measured angle for #20 (118.9° between C-N-C) is closer to the planar enol form (127.2° between C-C-C) which is close to a simple bite angle of 120° in a plane. But, for higher enzyme inhibition activity tetrahedral nature of carbon is a key requirement as evident by previously reported higher AChE inhibition for Fluoro-Donepezil (IC50 = 1.3 nM)1, 6–7 which is 100% keto form. The existence of DNPZ as a mixture of keto and enol forms lowers its AChE inhibitory effect due to constant change in tetrahedral and planar geometries.

Results on the BuChE inhibitory effect of 25 molecules showed compounds 4, 10, 14, 17, 18, 23, 26, 27 and 28 with negligible effect on BuChE activity while compounds 7, 11, 24 showed only 10–20% inhibitory activity compared to Tacrine. These results highlight the significance of even slight changes in geometry of the ligand while undertaking synthesis of potent inhibitors of cholinesterase or other enzymes.

2.5. SAR Summary

These enzyme activity inhibitions and docking studies on the structure activity relationships of the synthesized compounds show that-

▪ Tetrahedral keto form of DNPZ is largely responsible for its inhibitory effect on AChE compared to its planar trigonal enol form and slightly changed geometry to planar trigonal pyramidal in #20.

▪ Based on the comparison between the F-DNPZ and DNPZ, enolized DNPZ form may be responsible for the decrease in activity due to change in transient molecular geometry of DNPZ and partial racemization.

▪ Trigonal pyramidal keto geometry at the α -position (&gt;N-) of compound #20 did not contribute to inhibitory activity due to change in geometry.

▪ In compounds #20 and 28, substitution of benzyl with substituted benzyl and methyl pyridines causes a dramatic loss of activity compared with DNPZ that carries only benzyl at the same position.

▪ Side chains as in benzyl or substituted benzenes or pyridines or methyl pyridine did not increase the activity significant.

▪ Presence of lower LogP value due to amide functional group in compound #20 and α- position with a nitrogen atom to keep ketone functionality 100% intact did not improve the AChE inhibitory activity as compared to DNPZ.

▪ Overall, tetrahedral keto geometry of DNPZ is preferred over a planar trigonal pyramidal geometry of an amide (#20) for higher ChE inhibitory activity.

3.0 Conclusions

We conclude that Donepezil’s higher AChE inhibitory activity is due to the tetrahedral α- carbon atom providing keto form for a right fit geometry at the binding site of the enzyme compared with a planar trigonal enol form of DNPZ or a close mimic #20 of keto form of Donepezil. Finally, a change in geometry at the α- carbon atom in DNPZ is the main cause of disrupting the AChE activity. Tetrahedral geometry of DNPZ is mainly responsible for better AChE inhibitory activity than its slightly changed close mimic analog #20 with planar trigonal pyramidal geometry.

4.0 Experimental

4.1. Chemistry

All reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification. The TLC was performed on silica gel 60 F254 (Merck) layer using dichloromethane: methanol (95:5 v/v) as eluents. 1H NMR and 13C NMR (1D and JC,F coupled) spectra were recorded on a Bruker, UltraShield 400 and 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker, USA) using CDCl3, DMSO-d6, CD3OD and D2O. Chemical shifts (d) were expressed in parts per million (ppm) and tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as an internal standard. Mass spectra (ESI-MS) were recorded and analyzed on an LTQ linear Ion trap (Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA) with a nanospray source (Proxeon, Waltham, MA) with a picotip emitter (New Objective, Woburn, MA) on all synthesized compounds in the UMKC Mass Spectrometry Core Facility in the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences.

4.2. General procedures used for chemical synthesis

4.2.1. Synthesis of compounds 2–16:

To a solution of 2-(bromomethyl)benzoate (1 mmol) in 10 mL of THF was added primary amine (1.05 mmol) and DIPEA (2.1 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 60 h and THF was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was diluted with 0.25N HCl (50mL) and extracted with DCM (3 × 50 mL). The combined extracts were washed with saturated NaHCO3 (50mL) solution, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified either by recrystallization or column chromatography. The obtained solid was washed with pentane (3 × 5 mL) and dried under high vacuum to provide isoindolin-1-one derivatives in 20–89% yield.

4.3. Methods for crystal structure preparation for docking studies:

The crystal structure of human acetylcholinesterase bound to donepezil (PDB ID 4EY7)3 was prepared using the Schrodinger Small Molecule Drug Discovery Suite to add hydrogens, assign protonation states, optimize hydrogen bonds, and minimize the complex.55 Two receptor grids, including and excluding the ordered waters around the donepezil molecule, were generated. R-donepezil, S-donepezil, enolized donepezil, and several prospective analogs were prepared with LigPrep to enumerate possible ionization and tautomerization states. The ligands were docked using Glide with XP (extended) precision55–58 and minimized using Prime. 58, 59–60

4.4. Effects of synthesized compounds on cell viability and proliferation

4.4.1. Cell culture:

NIH/3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines (ATCC CRL1658) were grown in 96 well tissue culture plates. Medium consisted of phenol red-free DMEM(Thermo-Fisher) with 4.5% glucose, L-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity in the atmosphere. Cells grown to 80% confluence in medium and used on second day.

4.4.2. Cytotoxicity assay using Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) release:

Potential necrosis (plasma membrane damage or rupture) in cells caused by synthesized compounds was assessed using LDH cytotoxicity assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates as described. Cells were treated for 2h with each compound in the range from 0.5 to 50 μM in the medium. Aliquots of medium (50 μL) were collected and LDH assay performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cytotoxicity was determined from the absorbance at 490 nm using a Synergy H1 plate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA) using five replicates for each concentration. Results shown here are only for 1 μM concentration of each compound.

4.4.3. Cell proliferation assessment using MTT assay:

Cell proliferation was measured using [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)] (MTT) assay (MTT Cell Proliferation Assay ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in 96-well plates for 24h as described and treated with synthetic compounds from 0.5 to 50 μM medium followed by incubation with MTT (0.1 mg/well) in phenol red-free DMEM for 4 h at 37°C followed by addition of detergent reagent (10 μL) and incubation at room temperature. Isopropanol (100 μL) was added to each well to dissolve the blue formazon product. Optical density (OD) was measured at 570 nM using a Synergy H1 plate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). Assay performed using five replicates at each concentration of each compound. Number of active cells was determined from optical density values for comparison between control and treated groups. Results shown here are only for 1 μM concentration of each compound.

4.4.4. Cholinesterase inhibition assay methods:

Acetylcholinesterase inhibition:

Effect of synthesized compounds on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was assessed using a kit following the vendors protocol (QuantiChrom™ Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Screening Kit, BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA). The assay, a modified Ellman method, involves measurement of thiocholine produced by the action of acetylcholinesterase. Percentage concentration of thiocholine is measured directly by comparing the intensity of a yellow-colored by-product anion, 2-mercapto-6-nitrobenzoic acid formed during the thiocholine exchange with 5, 5’-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid). Thiocholine reacts with 5, 5’-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) forming a colorless thiocholine adduct namely, 2-((2-carboxy-3-nitrophenyl)disulfaneyl)-N,N,N-trimethylethan-1-aminium chloride and a yellow colored by-product anion 2-mercapto-6-nitrobenzoic acid. The intensity of this anion, measured at 412 nm, is proportional to the enzyme activity in the sample.

Recombinant AchE (Sigma-Aldrich/MilliporeSigma #3389) was suspended in the assay buffer at 400 U/mL and 45 μL was transferred to each well for final concentration of 100u/L under assay conditions. Assay buffer (45 μL) without enzyme was used as the No Enzyme Control (100% inhibition). One of the wells with enzyme served as No Inhibitor Control (0% inhibition). Test compounds (5μL) were added to wells containing AchE and plates were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Donepezil (10pM-100μM) was used as positive control for enzyme inhibition. Final working solutions of test compounds in contained 0.5% v/v DMSO. Equivalent volume of DMSO was added to control wells and Donepezil wells.

Working Reagent was prepared by mixing the vendor-supplied Assay Buffer (154 μL/well) with Substrate (1 μL/well) and DTNB (0.5 μL/well) and added to (150 μL) each well. Contents of wells were mixed by gentle tapping. Optical Density (OD, Absorbance) at 412nm was measured at 0 min and at 10 min using Biotek Synergy H1 plate reader (Winooski, VT, USA). Difference in OD at 0 and 10min (ΔOD) was obtained and used for calculating percent inhibition (Percent Inhibition = 1 - ΔOD Test compound / ΔOD No Inhibitor x 100%).

Butrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibition assay:

BuChE from equines serum (BChE, cat. no. C5712), S-Butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTC, Sigma-Aldrich, #20820) and 5,5’-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman’s reagent, Sigma-Aldrich # D8130) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. BChE (1000U/ml in deionized water), BTC (20mM in 37.2mM MgCl2 &amp; 100mM NaCl) and DTNB (10mM in 100mM PBS, pH7.0) were stored in aliquots at −20°C and after thawing were used only once. All solutions used in assays were prewarmed to 25°C prior to use, unless indicated otherwise. Tacrine (1nM-100nM) was used as positive control for BChE inhibition.

Final working solutions of test compounds in contained 0.5% v/v DMSO. Equivalent volume of DMSO was added to control wells and Tacrine wells. Assay procedure and calculations were performed as described for AChE.

Figure 1. 1-Indanone and 1-isoindolinone are valuable scaffolds for synthesizing new compounds (A). Donepezil contains 1-indanone scaffold in its core structure (B). 1-Isoindolinone may be a suitable substitute to study the effects of molecular geometry and functional groups SAR. 1-Isoindolinone differs from 1-indolinone in that it contains a nitrogen in place of carbon at α-position. We used 1-isoindolinone to obtain a compound with non-enolizable ketone carbon and altered geometry to determine its significance in AChE inhibitory activity and to determine if the enol form of Donepezil has any inhibitory effect on AChE. We also provide previously reported example F-DNPZ with 100% non-enolizable keto form (C)1, 6–7. Our approach yielded a compound (#20) with the postulated structure (D).

Figure 2. Framework comparison between Ondansetron and piperidone analog.

A piperidone analog (1-N-methylindolo[2,3-e]piperidone) of Ondansetron (Left) differs from the latter at the basic ring C. The piperidine derivative (Right) mimics the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist activity of Ondansetron. This example shows that replacing carbon with nitrogen did not alter the receptor antagonist effect in piperidone analog.36–45

B: Compound #20 is modeled to have a different pose than the enolized form of donepezil. The docked and refined model of #20 (green) is shown with the docked and refined model of enolized donepezil (orange). C: Compound #20 is modeled to have a pose similar to the R enantiomer of donepezil. The docked and refined model of #20 (green) is shown with the docked and refined model of Rdonepezil (blue). D: Docked model of analog 28 with human AChE. Compound 28 (yellow) makes similar ring stacking (blue dashes), cation-pi (green dashes) and hydrogen bonding (yellow dashes) as previously described with donepezil. E: Analog 28 is modeled to have an almost identical pose to analog #20. The docked and refined model of 28 (yellow) is shown with the docked and refined model of compound #20 (green). F: Compounds #20 and 28 are modeled to have a very similar pose to R-donepezil. The docked and refined model of #20 (green) and 28 (yellow) are shown with the docked and refined model of R-donepezil (blue). G: Docked model of the enolized form of donepezil. The enolized form of donepezil is modeled to form many of the same interactions as donepezil and compounds #20 and 28, except for the loss of a pi-pi interaction with W86. H: The enolized form of donepezil is modeled to have a pose somewhat similar to the R enantiomer of donepezil. The docked model of enolized donepezil (orange) is shown with the docked and refined model of R-donepezil (blue)

Highlights

Donepezil and compound #20 along with other 24 compounds were evaluated on physicochemical characteristics, cytotoxicity, cell proliferation effect, BuChE and AChE inhibitory activity.

Donepezil and rationally designed 1-isoindolinone scaffold-based compound #20 were evaluated for the effect of change in Donepezil geometry by comparing cholinesterase inhibitory activity.

Ligand docking studies were performed to compare various forms of Donepezil and compounds #20 and 28.

Compound #20 with changed geometry caused only 20.4% inhibition of AChE activity compared to 91.3% inhibition caused by Donepezil.

A tetrahedral geometry at the α-carbon atom next to ketone functionality in Donepezil is a key requirement for its superior AChE inhibition activity over its close mimic keto analog #20 (an amide) with slightly changed planar geometry.
