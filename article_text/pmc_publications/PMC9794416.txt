Many cancer survivors experience cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), which is characterized by problems of attention, working memory, and executive function following chemotherapy and/or hormonal treatment. APOE4, the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), is also a risk factor for CRCI, especially among survivors exposed to chemotherapy. We explored whether the effects of APOE genotype to chemotherapy were associated with an increase in AD pathological processes, using a mouse model of amyloid (5XFAD) along with the E3 or E4 alleles of human APOE (E3FAD and E4FAD). Six-month-old female E3FAD mice (control n = 5, treated n = 5) and E4FAD (control n = 6, treated n = 6) were treated with two doses of doxorubicin (total 10 mg/kg) or DMSO vehicle. After six weeks, mice were euthanized and brains were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and biochemical assays. Doxorubicin-treated mice had the same level of Aβ in the brain as control mice, as measured by 6E10 immunohistochemistry, Aβ40 and Aβ42 ELISAs, and plaque morphologies. Doxorubicin significantly increased the level of the astrocytic response to Aβ deposits, which was independent of APOE genotype; no effects of doxorubicin were observed on the microglial responses. These data are consistent with a model in which the effects of doxorubicin on risk of CRCI are unrelated amyloid accumulation, but possibly related to glial responses to damage.

pmc1. Introduction

Cancer chemotherapy patients often experience troubling cognitive problems post-treatment, lasting from a few months to years (Eide and Feng, 2020). Preclinical and clinical studies of this cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) suggest dysfunction occurs primarily in cognitive domains of memory, processing speed, and executive function (Jansen et al., 2005; Ahles et al., 2010). The brain alterations associated with chemotherapy and/or hormonal treatment involve biomarkers of aging and neurodegenerative processes (Mounier et al., 2020; Ahles et al., 2012; Sanoff et al., 2014). Interestingly, the E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Ward et al., 2012; Raber et al., 2004), is also the most reproducible genetic risk factor for CRCI (Mandelblatt et al., 2018; Buskbjerg et al., 2019; Ahles et al., 2003; Fernandez et al., 2020). APOE genotype also affects normal brain function with aging, including the domains observed in CRCI (Raber et al., 2004; Flowers and Rebeck, 2020).

There are three common APOE alleles: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. APOE4 is found in about 25% of the US population and increases AD risk by 3–4 fold with a single allele and ~ 15 fold with two alleles, while APOE3, the most common allele, is defined as average risk (Liu et al., 2013). Female APOE4 carriers are associated with an increased risk at younger ages compared to men (Neu et al., 2017). The hallmarks of AD neuropathology are characterized by extracellular amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and gliosis (Vinters, 2015). APOE genotype affects AD pathogenesis, including Aβ plaque load and glial activation (Bu, 2009; Ungar et al., 2014). In mouse models of amyloid, APOE4 is associated with increased Aβ levels and earlier deposition when compared with APOE3 (Tai et al., 2013; Tai et al., 2017; Youmans et al., 2012a). APOE isoforms also modulate glial activation in response to several types of damage, including amyloid, lipopolysaccharide, and acute brain injuries (Rodriguez et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2012; Kloske and Wilcock, 2020; Ben-Moshe et al., 2020).

The success of many types of cancer treatments has allowed cancer survivorship to rise, increasing the number of individuals experiencing CRCI. Many cancer treatments induce neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, impaired neurogenesis, and peripheral damage affecting the integrity of the blood brain barrier (Fernandez et al., 2020). These CNS damages post cancer therapy share common pathways of aging and neurodegeneration (Mandelblatt et al., 2013), such as neuroinflammation, oxidative DNA damage, and decreased brain volumes (Ramassamy et al., 2000; Ahles and Saykin, 2007; McDonald et al., 2010). The shared risk of APOE4 individuals to CRCI and AD has led us to postulate that CRCI shares a causative mechanism with AD, or that cancer and its therapies are unmasking an underlying neurodegenerative process.

Both doxorubicin and APOE4 have been correlated with proinflammatory responses, such as elevated levels of cytokines and increased astrogliosis (Kloske and Wilcock, 2020; Cardoso et al., 2020; Overmyer et al., 1999). Previously, our group used a human APOE knock-in mouse model (APOE-TR mice) to investigate behavioral impairment post-chemotherapy in female mice and to expand on the CRCI clinical research in breast cancer patients (Mandelblatt et al., 2018; Jim et al., 2012; Bc et al., 2022). These studies demonstrated behavioral impairments after doxorubicin treatment that recapitulate key aspects of human CRCI, including deficiencies in spatial learning and alterations in brain cortical volumes, with greater effects in APOE4 mice than in APOE3 mice (Demby et al., 2020; Speidell et al., 2019).

The APOE-TR mice do not develop the main pathological changes associated with AD, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Thus, we examined here the effects of chemotherapy in an established AD mouse model: EFAD mice are a cross of transgenic mice expressing five FAD mutations (5xFAD) with the APOE-TR lines. The EFAD mice demonstrate APOE-modulated phenotypes similar to human AD patients, with behavioral deficits, gliosis, Aβ accumulation, and synaptic protein deficits greater in E4FAD compared to E3FAD (Tai et al., 2017; Youmans et al., 2012a; Rodriguez et al., 2014; Shan et al., 2015; Balu et al., 2019). Furthermore, these mice have shown genotype specific responses to therapeutic treatments, such as RXR agonists (Tai et al., 2014) and estrogen therapy (Tai et al., 2017; Kunzler et al., 2014). Thus, EFAD mice are a good model for testing the effects of chemotherapy and other cancer therapies on AD pathological processes, incorporating the effects of APOE genotype.

In this study, we use female E4FAD and E3FAD mice to explore whether the APOE genotype-associated risk of CRCI functions through pathways of amyloid, focusing on Aβ aggregation and glia reactivity to plaques. We concentrated on the CRCI effects associated with chemotherapy only, absent of tumors and additional cancer-related treatments. The results are intended to contribute to identification of shared bio-logical pathways of CRCI and AD and identification of treatments and preventative approaches to improve cancer survivors’ quality-of-life post-treatment.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. EFAD mice

This study was conducted in accordance with ethical standards of the Georgetown University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. E3FAD and E4FAD mouse lines (5xFAD+/−;APOE+/+) were established and generously supplied by Mary Jo LaDu at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 5xFAD+/− mice, a model hemizygous for 5 familial AD trans-genes (APP K670N/M671L + I716V + V717I and PS1 M146L + L286V) of C57BL/6J/B6xSJL background (Youmans et al., 2012a), were bred with APOE-TR+/+ mice of C57BL/6N background. The resulting APOE-TR+/− / 5xFAD+/− mice have been backcrossed with APOE-TR+/+ mice to generate the AD mouse model, hemizygous for 5xFAD and homozygous for APOE4 (E4FAD) or APOE3 (E3FAD). These mice have reproducibly demonstrated effects of APOE genotype on AD pathological and behavioral processes (Tai et al., 2017; Balu et al., 2019; M et al., 2021; Stephen et al., 2019).

Four groups of EFAD mice were used: E3FAD DMSO control (n = 5), E3FAD treated (n = 5), E4FAD DMSO control (n = 6), and E4FAD treated (n = 6). Treated mice received doxorubicin, a common chemotherapy drug. Six month old mice received two intraperitoneal injections, one week apart, of 470 μl of sterile Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) with either doxorubicin hydrochloride (Sigma) at 5 mg/kg, resulting in a total dose of 10 mg/kg (“treated”), or 30 μl of DMSO vehicle (“control”), as described (Demby et al., 2020). Six weeks after the last injection, mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and perfused with PBS for 5 to 7 min and brains were collected. One hemisphere was dissected into cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum then snap frozen for biochemical analyses. The other hemisphere was fixed in 4% Formalin/ 4% sucrose and transitioned through a sucrose gradient and flash frozen. The fixed hemibrains were coronally sliced at 30 μm for immunohistochemistry.

2.2. ELISAs

Aβ42, Aβ40, APOE.

Snap frozen hippocampal tissue from dissected brains was homogenized in Tris Buffered Saline, pH 7.4 (TBS) then centrifuged (100,000 X g for 1 h at 4 °C). The soluble TBS fraction was collected and the pellet was resuspended in TBS with 1% Triton-X (TBS-X) and centrifuged. The TBS-X soluble fraction was then collected. The remaining pellet was resuspended in 70% Formic Acid (FA) and incubated overnight, rotating at 4 °C, and the samples centrifuged. The FA-soluble fraction was neutralized with 20 volumes of 1 M Tris base. Total protein concentrations in TBS and TBS-X fractions were measured with the Pierce BCA protein assay. Levels in TBS, TBS-X, and FA were determined using Invitrogen Human Aβ42 ELISA Kit, Invitrogen Human Aβ40 ELISA Kit, and Abcam Human APOE ELISA kit, per manufacturer’s instructions. For Aβ42, 1 μg of TBS and TBS-X samples were analyzed; FA samples were diluted at 1:1000. For Aβ40, 9 μg of TBS and 7 μg of TBS-X samples were analyzed; FA samples were diluted to 1:500. For APOE, 20 μg of TBS and TBS-X samples were analyzed; FA samples were diluted to 1:2. A two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison test was used to assess outcomes of measures from genotype and doxorubicin treatment.

2.3. Immunohistochemistry

6E10, Moab2, IBA1, GFAP.

The 6E10 antibody against Aβ/APP was used for our initial analysis of Aβ accumulation. Brain sections were blocked with TBS-0.25% Triton X (TBS-X) with 5% normal goat serum (NGS) blocking solution for 1.5 h. Sections were then incubated with 6E10 at a 1:1000 dilution in TBS-X with 1% NGS overnight at 4 °C. Sections were incubated with secondary antibody AlexaFluor 488 at a 1:1000 dilution in TBS-X with 1% NGS for 1 h, then incubated with DAPI at a 1:10,000 dilution.

2.4. Moab2/Iba1/GFAP

The Moab2 antibody was used as an immunostain for Aβ deposits (Youmans et al., 2012b). Antigen retrieval with heated citrate buffer (approximately 95 °C) was performed on sections for 3 min. Although under some conditions the Moab2 antigen is heat sensitive (Koss et al., 2016), we found antigen retrieval necessary for immunohistochemical staining. Sections were permeabilized in PBS-0.5% Triton X for 30 min and then blocked in PBS with 10% NGS and 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. Sections were co-stained in PBS-0.1% Tween with 1% NGS and 1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C for Aβ (1:1000) and either GFAP (1:2000), an astrocyte marker, or Iba1 (1:1000), a microglia marker. Slices were incubated with secondary antibodies AlexaFluor 488 at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h and AlexaFluor 594 at 1:500 for 2 h in PBS with 1% NGS.

2.5. Imaging and analysis

For 6E10 stained sections, images were captured with Zeiss Axioskop at 10× magnification. Blinded analysis with ImageJ of 6E10-positive area was performed. Images were converted to 8-bit gray scale and ROIs were drawn to outline the respective areas of CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4 from the hippocampus and cortex layers 1, 2/3, 4, 5, 6a, and 6b. After thresholding to highlight plaques, percent area covered by 6E10 immunostain was measured.

For Moab2 stained sections, Z-stack images of the isocortex were captured using Thor Imaging Systems Division resonance laser scanning confocal microscope mounted on a Nikon Instruments upright Eclipse FN1 microscope at 60× water immersion magnification. Z-stacked images (386.55 μm × 386.55 μm, 0.5 μm per stack) were converted into 2 dimensional composite images in a blinded manner using ImageJ; the number of Z-planes compressed was determined by the range in which the individual amyloid plaque appeared, which averaged 18 Z-planes.

Aβ plaques and Iba1 co-immunostaining was analyzed using individual fluorescent channels, red for plaques and green for microglia. Pixels were converted to microns using the following conversion scale: distance to pixels = 1, known distance = 0.337, pixel aspect ratio = 1. On the plaque channel, circular ROIs were drawn to obtain the plaque area. All non-overlapping plaques with areas completely within the composite image were selected for analysis. Plaques were subsequently categorized into three morphologies: dense core, compact, and diffuse; these classifications were determined based on categories previously described (Rodriguez et al., 2014). Dense core plaques had bright Moab2 staining with a dense center and were the largest plaques, typically with an area over 1000 μm2. Diffuse plaques were characterized by weaker Moab2 with wispy fibrils and no clear center. Compact plaques had bright Moab2 staining with no surrounding fibrils and were the smallest plaques with areas under 750 μm2. ROIs were then superimposed onto the microglial (Iba1+) channel. As a marker of microglial cell membrane, the Iba1 staining covered much of each type of plaque and demonstrated intensity differences across individual microglia. Microglia mean intensity was recorded, compensating for background intensity by subtracting the average of three background intensity recordings.

For analysis of the astrocyte-plaque interactions, Aβ plaques and GFAP-positive astrocytes were again visualized using individual fluorescent channels. Pixels were again converted to microns using the following conversion scale: distance to pixels = 1, known distance = 0.337, pixel aspect ratio = 1. On the Aβ channel, circular ROIs were drawn to obtain the plaque area, and plaque morphology was recorded. The ROIs were then superimposed on the astrocyte channel, which was then converted to 16-bit and a threshold was performed to determine the percent area coverage of the GFAP immunostaining in the plaque ROI. In contrast to intensity measurements used for Iba1 assessment, percent area coverage was used because GFAP marks only some cytoskeletal elements, without obvious differences to intensity across structures. Area was assessed within each treatment group and sorted according to the three plaque morphologies. Total plaque quantity per treatment group and percent of plaques in each morphologic group were again evaluated.

All statistical analysis was performed with GraphPadPrism 9. For all immunostaining, 2–3 images were captured within 2–3 slices per each brain. Two-way ANOVAs with Sidak’s multiple comparison test were used to assess outcome measures from genotype and doxorubicin treatment of the 11 treated and 11 untreated mice, which were split between E3FAD (n = 10) and E4FAD (n = 12).

3. Results

Female E3FAD and E4FAD mice were treated at six months of age with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin or vehicle. At eight months of age, the mice were euthanized and brain tissue collected. As expected for this model of amyloid (Youmans et al., 2012a), 6E10-positive plaques of various morphologies were abundantly present in the subiculum, various hippocampal subfields, and layers of the cerebral cortex (Fig. 1A).

3.1. Doxorubicin did not affect plaque accumulation

To assess the effects of chemotherapy on plaque accumulation, we measured the percent of area covered by 6E10 immunostaining in the E3FAD and E4FAD mice treated with either doxorubicin or DMSO control. No differences in plaque area were detected between doxorubicin treated and control brains in either the E3FAD or the E4FAD mice (Fig. 1B–C). We compared all E3FAD mice (treated and control) with all E4FAD mice (treated and control) in order to examine genotype differences in plaque coverage. As expected (Youmans et al., 2012a), E4FAD mice showed a higher level of plaque accumulation in the cortex than E3FAD mice (Fig. 1C, *p = 0.039, **p = 0.0022).

3.2. Hippocampal Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels were not affected by doxorubicin treatment

Hippocampal extraction fractions (TBS, TBS-X, and FA) were analyzed for Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels by ELISA (Fig. 2). Aβ42 and Aβ40 species were observed in each type of brain extract fraction. Consistent with Aβ immunostaining (Fig. 1), no significant effects of doxorubicin treatment were observed for Aβ42 levels in either E3FAD or E4FAD brains in any of the three brain fractions (Fig. 2A–C).

Aβ40 measures demonstrated similar results to those for Aβ42. No significant effects of doxorubicin treatment were observed across the three hippocampal extraction fractions (Fig. 2D–F). E4FAD mouse brains showed higher Aβ40 levels in the TBS and TBS-X fractions when compared to E3FAD mouse brains (Fig. 2D, E, *p = 0.038, **p = 0.0064). In addition, no differences in levels of apoE protein were observed in any fraction across APOE genotypes or treatments (data not shown).

3.3. Doxorubicin did not affect plaque morphology or quantity in the isocortex

To examine whether doxorubicin affected specific plaque types, we used the anti-Aβ antibody Moab2, and analyzed the types of over 1000 amyloid plaques present in the isocortex (Fig. 3). There were no significant effects of doxorubicin in either the E3FAD or E4FAD mice. Overall, E4FADs (treated and control) showed more plaque deposition compared to E3FADs (Fig. 3D, *p = 0.016), consistent with the results of the 6E10 percent area coverage analysis. Then we defined individual amyloid plaques as diffuse (Fig. 3A), dense core (Fig. 3B), or compact (Fig. 3C), and calculated each plaque morphology as a percent of the total plaque numbers (Fig. 3E–K). Doxorubicin showed no impact on plaques of different morphology types. E4FAD controls had more of the diffuse plaques when compared with E3FAD controls (Fig. 3E, #p = 0.041), while the percentage of compact plaques was lower (Fig. 3G, ##p = 0.0009). E4FADs (treated and control) showed higher levels of dense core plaques and a lower number of compact plaques compared to E3FADs (Fig. 3F&amp;G, **p = 0.0023, ***p = 0.0004). Thus, there are distribution differences of plaque types by APOE genotype, but without an effect of doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 3H–K).

3.4. Doxorubicin did not impact microglial reactivity to plaques

To test whether chemotherapy affected the microglial response to Aβ plaques, we assessed microglial activation within the area of over 500 individual plaques using co-immunofluorescence of Moab2 and Iba1 in the isocortex (Fig. 4A). We drew circular ROIs to establish the areas affected by individual plaques (Fig. 4B), then separated the fluorescent channels in order to measure the fluorescence intensity of the Iba1 positive cells within the ROIs (Fig. 4C). This approach allowed us to determine whether there were differences in microglial responses to individual plaques as compared to whether the brain as a whole had more microglia. Through quantification of microglia intensity per plaque area, we saw no effects of doxorubicin on microglia reactivity in either E3FAD or E4FAD brains (Fig. 4D). Next, we assessed whether microglia responded differently to plaques of the various morphologies (Fig. 4E–G). No effects of doxorubicin were seen around dense core, diffuse, or compact plaques. Microglial intensity around diffuse plaques was significantly higher in control brains of E4FAD mice compared to E3FAD mice (#p = 0.04).

3.5. Doxorubicin increased astrocytic reactivity to dense core and compact plaques

We next investigated the astrocytic response to Aβ plaques after doxorubicin exposure. Using isocortex tissue double stained with Moab2 and GFAP (Fig. 5A), we measured the percent area of over 500 individual plaques occupied by GFAP immunostaining. No impact of doxorubicin treatment was seen in E3FAD or E4FAD mice toward plaques overall (Fig. 5D). However, doxorubicin treatment significantly increased the astrocytic response to both dense core and compact plaques, controlling for APOE genotype ($p = 0.036, $$p = 0.016, respectively). Individually, doxorubicin in E3FAD mice induced significantly greater astrocyte coverage of dense core plaques compared to control conditions (##p = 0.0081), but there were no significant effects in E4FAD mice. In control brains, there was a significantly stronger astrocytic response to both dense core and diffuse plaques in E4FAD mice compared to E3FAD mice (###p = 0.0025, #p = 0.013). Finally, there was a stronger astrocytic response to diffuse plaques of E4FAD mice compared to E3FAD mice across treatment conditions (*p = 0.0009).

4. Discussion

Clinical research suggests that cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) has many parallels with accelerated processes of aging and with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk factors, including the genetic factor APOE4 (Ahles et al., 2003; Fernandez et al., 2020; Mandelblatt et al., 2013; Mandelblatt et al., 2014). We previously found that, consistent with human studies, exposure to the chemotherapy doxorubicin had greater behavioral effects on APOE4 mice compared to APOE3 mice (Demby et al., 2020; Speidell et al., 2019). In the current study, we tested whether doxorubicin treatment could directly impact AD pathology, using an amyloid mouse model that incorporates the human APOE alleles (EFAD). We found that doxorubicin treatment did not increase Aβ accumulation, as measured by several immunohistochemical and biochemical assays. Doxorubicin did significantly increase the astrocytic response to the two more mature types of Aβ deposits, dense core plaques and compact plaques. Although we were testing how chemotherapy affected AD pathogenesis related to APOE genotype, this observed effect was independent of APOE genotype. These results could suggest that the APOE4 risk for CRCI is related to CNS alterations, but that effects may not involve amyloid pathways.

Amyloid accumulation is the earliest known biomarker of AD pathological changes (Zetterberg and Bendlin, 2021). It is observed through PET scans or changes to CSF Aβ42 levels up to two decades before the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles or the overt clinical symptoms of dementia (Sanchez et al., 2021). We used a mouse model of Aβ accumulation because we reasoned that effects of chemotherapy would be on individuals with early amyloid accumulation but without the clinical signs of AD. The preclinical model of EFAD mice allows detection of early Aβ accumulation between two to six months of age across APOE genotypes (Youmans et al., 2012a); this level continues to increase to at least 18 months of age (Balu et al., 2019). We exposed EFAD mice to doxorubicin at six months of age and examined their brains at eight months of age. Since this mouse model allows Aβ accumulations over a long period of time, these experiments tested whether doxorubicin promoted growth of existing deposits and the development of new deposits.

Abnormal levels and ratios of amyloid beta peptides is a common hallmark of AD, with amyloid plaques consisting mostly of Aβ42 (Qiu et al., 2015). Using immunostains for total Aβ or Aβ42 and ELISAs for Aβ40 and Aβ42, we saw no effects of doxorubicin chemotherapy on Aβ levels. One limitation of this work is that we analyzed mice at a single stage of Aβ accumulation. Additional experiments in models of slower amyloid accumulation could test whether doxorubicin influences initial accumulation of amyloid, or has effects if administered over longer periods of time. However, if our current mouse work is replicated, it would imply that individuals being treated with doxorubicin for cancer might not be at greater risk of AD-associated amyloid.

In addition to CRCI, APOE4 genotype is associated with the progression of other CNS conditions that do not include Aβ accumulation. APOE4 is associated with an increased the risk of Lewy Body Dementia (Chia et al., 2021), greater α-synuclein accumulation (Zhao et al., 2020), and a decreased age of onset of this disease (Schaffert et al., 2020). APOE4 is also associated with increased brain atrophy and behavioral impairment in Frontotemporal Dementia (Agosta et al., 2009; Engelborghs et al., 2006). In addition to neurodegenerative conditions, APOE4 may predispose to CNS phenotypes after infection with covid-19 (Kuo et al., 2022) or chronic CNS HIV infection (Yang et al., 2021). These CNS phenotypes of viral infections induce brain dysfunction with somewhat variable and poorly defined cognitive problems that may share other APOE-driven susceptibilities with CRCI. Together, these studies support the hypothesis that APOE4 could affect cognitive impairment in many conditions via a mechanism that does not involve Aβ accumulation.

One pathological process that is common to these APOE4-related impairments is chronic inflammation. Neuroinflammation is associated with both causing and exacerbating cognitive impairment during neurodegenerative diseases and brain injury (Lyman et al., 2014), regulated by astrocytic and microglial proliferation in order to repair damage and phagocytose debris (Guzman-Martinez et al., 2019). APOE is mainly produced by glial cells, with APOE4 associated with fostering pro-inflammatory environments including increased activation of microglia and astrocytes (Kloske and Wilcock, 2020; Rebeck, 2017). Our current study generally validated our earlier findings that mice expressing APOE4 had significantly greater glial responses to individual plaques than mice expressing APOE3 (Rodriguez et al., 2014); this effect was found for the microglial response to diffuse plaques and the astrocytic response to dense core and diffuse plaques. Previous work showed that APOE4 had a different effect on microglial response toward Thioflavin S-positive compact plaques (Stephen et al., 2019), perhaps relating to plaque maturity. The effect of APOE genotype on inflammation has fostered several therapies, including mimetic peptides and APOE-related molecules to promote cholesterol efflux (Lanfranco et al., 2020).

Cancer chemotherapy promotes peripheral inflammation as well as signs of CNS inflammation (Fernandez et al., 2020). For example, rodent studies show that chemotherapy treatments increase brain TNFα and IL-6 levels and astrogliosis (Cardoso et al., 2020; Tangpong et al., 2006). Many chemotherapeutic agents, including doxorubicin, do not cross the blood brain barrier, but may trigger peripheral inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, that can penetrate the blood brain barrier and promote proliferation of glial cells within the brain (Fernandez et al., 2020; Ren, and St. Clair DK, Butterfield DA., 2017). Controlling for APOE genotype, we found that doxorubicin increased astrocytic reactivity to dense core and compact plaques (but not diffuse plaques). Glial activation is one of the original defining aspects of the AD pathological changes (Alzheimer et al., 1995). Recent AD genetics (Podlésny-Drabiniok et al., 2020) and detailed neuropathological analyses (Perez-Nievas et al., 2013; Haage and De Jager, 2022) support the hypothesis that inflammation may contribute to risk of the onset of AD and to the progression to cognitive impairment. There may be CNS astrocytic pathways promoted by chemotherapy in response to the denser Aβ accumulations.

The observed effects of doxorubicin on astrocytic activation (GFAP immunostaining) represent one aspect of the inflammatory cascades. Although GFAP is a commonly used cytoskeletal marker and considered a hallmark of reactive astrocytes, it only labels a mature subpopulation of astrocytes where intermediate filament protein is present (Preston et al., 2019). Multiple signaling pathways activate and modulate pro-inflammatory astrocytes, including the JAK-STAT3 pathway that initiates reactive astrocytes and the NF-κB pathway (Kwon and Koh, 2020; Giovannoni and Quintana, 2020; Linnerbauer et al., 2020); the effects of doxorubicin on these pathways should be investigated. Given the heterogenous nature of inflammatory processes, broad approaches into mechanisms independent of Aβ would be important to test hypotheses related to doxorubicin exposure and neuroinflammation.

There are several limitations to be considered before determining the impact of our conclusions, including small sample numbers (11 untreated and 11 treated mice, split between the two APOE genotypes). We used only female mice because, as a model of breast cancer treatment, our previous work on mouse behavior was limited to female mice; it will be important to include sex as a variable in future studies, because sex affects behavior, pathology (Tai et al., 2017) and microglial responses to amyloid (Stephen et al., 2019; Amidi et al., 2017). We also focused on the effects of a single chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin, in tumor-naïve mice; it will be important in future experiments to investigate the impacts of additional treatments and of the cancer itself.

Finally, these mice were susceptible to amyloid pathology only. We did not look at mice absent of AD pathology nor mice susceptible to other major neuropathological hallmarks of AD, such as neurofibrillary tangles. APOE expression predisposed to tau spreading in human brains as correlated in tau PET analysis and transcriptome measures (Montal et al., 2022). There are appropriate mouse models to test whether chemotherapy increases tau accumulation with overexpression of mutant tau in the presence of APOE3 or APOE4. These models show adverse effects of APOE4 on tau phosphorylation and misfolding (Jablonski et al., 2021), on tau propagation (Williams et al., 2022), and on brain atrophy and neurodegeneration (Shi et al., 2017). Analyses of these models could test whether chemotherapy affected tau accumulation in an APOE-dependent manner, as we have done here for Aβ.

The cognitive impairment seen associated with cancer and its treatments has driven studies into whether cancer increases the risk of AD. A meta-analysis of published cohort studies and case-controls studies found that cancer was associated with lower chance of AD (Ospina-Romero et al., 2020). Cancer was also associated with lower levels of AD pathological changes related to tau accumulation (Yarchoan et al., 2017; Karanth et al., 2022), further supporting some protective aspect of cancer toward AD. However, these studies did leave open the possibility that treatments for cancer might increase risk of AD (Okereke and Meadows, 2019), a hypothesis that we have only begun to examine in preclinical models here.

5. Conclusions

Our current work showed no evidence that the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin promoted early markers of AD pathogenesis in a mouse model of amyloidogenesis: it did not increase levels of soluble or insoluble forms of Aβ, nor did it affect the distribution of types of Aβ deposits. However, doxorubicin did increase the astrocytic response to the dense core and compact forms of Aβ deposits. These findings suggest future investigation of susceptibility to CRCI requires exploration in aspects of cognitive dysfunction beyond amyloid accumulation and the importance of continuing the investigation of other aspects of the inflammatory cascade.

Fig. 1. Coronal sections from E3FAD and E4FAD mice treated with control (Ctrl) or doxorubicin (Doxo) were stained with 6E10 antibodies, against Aβ/APP. Images were captured at 10× magnification in ~3 slices per brain; (A) representative image at 2.5× of areas analyzed for 6E10 immunostain (green) and DAPI stain (blue). (B–C) bar graphs represent the mean ± SEM, n = 5–6 animals per group, analysis of percent area coverage of positive plaques within 1, 2/3, 4, 5, 6a, and 6b layers of the cortex and CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4 of the hippocampus. A two-way ANOVA Sidak’s multiple comparison test was used to assess outcome measures from genotype and treatment (*p = 0.039, **p = 0.0022).

Fig. 2. Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS), Tris-Buffered Saline with 1% Triton-X (TBS-X), and Formic Acid (FA) sequential fractions of hippocampal tissue from E3FAD and E4FAD mice, treated with control (Ctrl) or doxorubicin (Doxo), were obtained as described in material and methods. Lysates were assessed by Aβ42 (A-C) or Aβ40 (D–F) ELISA. Aβ levels in TBS and TBS-X were calculated per total protein, while Aβ levels in FA were calculated per total tissue weight. Bar graphs represent the mean ± SEM, n = 5–6 animals per group. A two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison test was used to assess outcomes of measures from genotype and treatment (*p = 0.038, **p = 0.0064).

Fig. 3. Coronal sections from E3FAD and E4FAD mice treated with control (Ctrl) or doxorubicin (Doxo) were stained with Moab2 antibodies against Aβ. Z-stack images of amyloid plaques in the isocortex were captured at 60× water immersion magnification using confocal microscopy, ~3 images per ~3 slices from each brain. Plaques were categorized into three morphologies: diffuse (A), dense core (B), and compact (C). Total number of Moab2 positive (Moab2+ #) plaques (D) and percent of the total (% of total) plaques per morphology (E-G) within groups were assessed; (H–K) pie charts of mean percentage of plaque morphology per treatment group. Two-way ANOVAs were used to assess outcome measures of genotype and doxorubicin. Bar graphs represent the mean ± SEM, n = 5–6 animals per group, * represents significant difference of genotype overall (combined treated and control), while # represents significant difference between control groups only (*p = 0.016, **p = 0.0023, ***p = 0.0004, #p = 0.041, ##p = 0.0009).

Fig. 4. Coronal sections from E3FAD and E4FAD mice treated with control (Ctrl) or doxorubicin (Doxo) were co-stained with Moab2 antibodies for Aβ and Iba1 antibodies for activated microglia. Z-stack images of amyloid plaques in the isocortex were captured at 60× water immersion magnification using confocal microscopy, ~3 images per ~3 slices from each brain. (A) representative 2-dimensional composite images microglia (green) and amyloid plaques (red), (B) circular ROI domains used assess plaque area, (C) and associated microglia activation within the plaque area. Microglia mean intensity per plaque area was assessed per treatment group (D) then evaluated within the plaque types (E-G). Two-way ANOVAs were used to assess outcome measures from genotype and doxorubicin treatment. Bar graphs represent the mean ± SEM, n = 5–6 animals per group, # represents significant difference in microglia response to diffuse plaques between control groups (#p = 0.040).
