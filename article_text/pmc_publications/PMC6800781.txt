This paper is motivated by combining serial neurocognitive assessments and other clinical variables for monitoring the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We propose a novel framework for the use of multiple longitudinal neurocognitive markers to predict the progression of AD. The conventional joint modeling longitudinal and survival data approach is not applicable when there is a large number of longitudinal outcomes. We introduce various approaches based on functional principal component (FPC) for dimension reduction and feature extraction from multiple longitudinal outcomes. We use these features to extrapolate the health outcome trajectories and use scores on these features as predictors in a Cox proportional hazards model to conduct predictions over time. We propose a personalized dynamic prediction framework that can be updated as new observations collected to reflect the patient’s latest prognosis, and thus intervention could be initiated in a timely manner. Simulation studies and application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate the robustness of the method for the prediction of future health outcomes and risks of target events under various scenarios.

1 ∣ INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die and is the most common cause of dementia among older adults1. Symptoms of AD include memory loss and cognitive decline. Since mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered as a transitional stage to AD, MCI patients are usually enrolled as the target population for early prognosis and evaluating interventions2. In the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu), researchers collect a multitude of longitudinal outcomes including neurocognitive tests, neuroimaging (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, MRI), genetic, and other clinical variables to measure the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Given the lack of disease-modifying treatments for AD, the growing public threat of AD has raised the urgency to utilize these multi-modal (neurocognitive tests, MRI, and genetic) data to develop robust prediction models of AD conversion, which help in the early diagnosis and timely intervention of this condition3. This article is motivated by the joint analysis of the rich multi-modal data from 355 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients in the ADNI study. We are particularly interested in addressing two questions: 1) propose an effective way to model the association between multiple longitudinal health outcomes and the time to event of interest such as AD conversion; and 2) develop a personalized dynamic prediction framework for the AD conversion from MCI that best utilizes the subject-specific longitudinal profiles.

Joint modeling (JM) of longitudinal and survival data is usually a popular framework to appropriately analyze datasets with repeated measurements and time-to-event outcomes4,5. Li et al.6 adopted a JM approach to investigate the utility of each longitudinal outcome independently in determining the risk of AD conversion. In this study, they discovered that longitudinal Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 13 items (ADAS-Cog 13) and longitudinal hippocampal volume (HV) are two of the strongest predictors of AD conversion from MCI among neurocognitive and neuroimaging markers. A practical use of joint models is to obtain dynamic personalized prediction of future longitudinal outcome trajectories and risks of survival event. For example, Li and Luo7 proposed a functional joint model (FJM) that incorporate baseline surface-based hippocampus imaging as a functional covariate in the joint model framework. They demonstrated that such surface-based morphology measure contains more information and has higher predictive power than volume-based measure8. However, these JM approach, as well as the dynamic prediction framework only investigated the association between a single longitudinal outcome and a time-to-event outcome. One challenge of extending the JM for multivariate longitudinal outcomes is the difficulty of identifying a satisfactory parametric family to model the multiple longitudinal trajectories. Moreover, as most extensions to multiple longitudinal outcomes are mainly based on the shared random effects approach and the Bayesian framework9-11, the JM approaches are computationally prohibitive when the number of longitudinal outcomes is large. Proust-Lima et al.12 proposed a joint model for multiple longitudinal outcomes and multiple time-to-events based on a latent class approach. However, the model must be repeatedly estimated with different numbers of classes and different initial values so that it is more computationally intensive and hard to implement. Thus, multivariate JM approaches have not yet been well implemented in available software13.

An alternative statistical framework that is flexible and well suited to model sparsely sampled longitudinal data and time-to-event outcome was provided by the work on functional data analysis14-16. Yao15 considered the longitudinal outcome as functional data and explored the effect of longitudinal data on survival time. Holte et al.17 extended the model and proposed a two-stage approach where the association between the longitudinal process and the survival endpoint was built upon the latent functional principal component (FPC) scores derived in a separate step. They revealed that it is often the changing patterns of the longitudinal outcome, rather than the actual value at the moment of event, that affects a patient’s survival risk. In the following studies, the model was further extended for partial follow-up studies18, interval-censored time19, and prediction20,21. However, these models focus on a single longitudinal outcome and are not applicable to the studies of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, which collect multiple longitudinal measures with more complexity. For example, Figure 1 provides the longitudinal trajectories of ADAS-Cog 13 (panel a) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ; panel b) for 50 randomly selected MCI patients in the ADNI study. Some of the important characteristics of the data are: 1) there are multiple neurocognitive markers that are correlated because they measure different perspectives of the cognitive impairment on the same patient; 2) data are observed longitudinally across patients and trajectories are highly heterogeneous both within and between patients; 3) these longitudinal outcomes are associated with the time-to-event outcome, which is AD conversion from MCI in our motivating study, e.g., participants 285 and 406 had AD diagnosis at month 48 and 36, respectively, as in panel a; 4) entire visits are missing (in panel a, participant 406 had a missed visit at month 12). To our knowledge, no prior study has leveraged multiple longitudinal outcomes and time-to-event information jointly under this framework to predict the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

To answer questions 1) and 2) and address some of the challenges discussed above, we develop a two-stage approach with multivariate FPCA (MFPCA)22 and Cox regression (referred to as MFPCCox) framework. In the first stage, we consider the health outcome trajectories as stochastic functions over the longitudinal visit times, and use MFPCA to extract the changing patterns (features) of multiple health outcome trajectories. In the second stage, we use scores (representing the variations of subject-specific health outcome trajectories) on these features as predictors in a Cox regression model to characterize the relationships between survival and multiple longitudinal outcomes. We propose a novel dynamic prediction framework to extrapolate the health outcome trajectories and predict the future event risk for a specific subject. Compared with the existing literature, we make several major contributions as follows: 1) MFPCCox provides a comprehensive and robust framework for integrating a large number of longitudinal scalar outcomes in survival analysis. 2) We use the feature information extracted from multiple longitudinal outcomes to make personalized dynamic predictions. We appropriately account for the correlation among outcomes and allow the prediction to be dynamically updated as new outcome measurements are obtained. 3) We evaluate the predictive performance of MFPCCox by using both simulation studies and the application to the ADNI study data. Although two-stage model may yield parameter estimates that are somewhat biased5, our numerical results suggest that the MFPCCox performs just as well, if not better, than the parametric multivariate joint model approach in terms of prediction. The MFPCCox is more robust than parametric multivariate JM model if the longitudinal sub-models are misspecified. 4) The implementation of the proposed MFPCCox framework and dynamic prediction can be achieved via existing software, which is much less computationally intensive than the multivariate JM approach, such as the model in9.

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the modeling framework of MFPCCox. We describe the method to extract features from multiple longitudinal outcomes and then propose a Cox regression model that uses extracted features as predictors. A dynamic prediction framework is also developed to assess the subject-specific health outcomes and disease risk. In Section 3, we apply the proposed MFPCCox to the ADNI study. In Section 4, simulation studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed methods. Concluding remarks and discussion are presented in Section 5.

2 ∣ METHODS

In this section, we describe the data structure and then introduce the approaches to extract features from longitudinal outcomes. We use the features to predict future health outcomes and risk of disease progression.

2.1 ∣ Data Structure

We consider a study that recruits I subjects. Each subject i (i = 1, . . . , I) is followed up from the study onset until observed event time Ti∗=min{Ti,Ci}, where Ti is the true event time of interest, Ci is the independent censoring time, and δi=I(Ti∗≤Ci) is the censoring indicator. In addition to a set of P baseline or time invariant clinical covariates, denoted by vector Zi = {Zip}p=1,⋯P, the study also repeatedly collects multiple health outcomes to measure the disease progression. For each subject i at visit j (j = 1, . . . , Ji), we observe data {Yijq}q=1,...,Q, where Yijq is the q-th health outcome observed at time tij(tij≤Ti∗) and Q is the total number of outcomes. For notational convenience, we let Yijq = Yiq(tij) and use these two notations interchangeably. To model the continuous longitudinal outcomes, we assume that the observed data Yijq is a noisy measurement of the latent outcome process Xiq(t), where time t∈T=[0,τ] and τ=max{Ti∗:i=1,…,I}. It gives Yijq = Xiq(tij) + εijq, where εijq are independent measurement errors with mean zero and variance σεq2.

2.2 ∣ Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) for multivariate longitudinal outcomes

Let Xi(t) = {Xiq(t)}q=1,⋯,Q be the multivariate longitudinal processes of the i-th subject. We illustrate how to model Xi(t) via multivariate functional principal component analysis (MFPCA), which is formulated as a two-step procedure. In Step 1, we let μq(t) be the unknown smoothed mean function of Xiq(t) and Σq(t, t′) = cov{Xiq(t), Xiq(t′)} be the covariance function that models the correlation of outcome q’s trajectory between time points t and t′. The spectral decomposition of the covariance function is given by ∑q(t,t′)=∑l=1∞λqlϕql(t)ϕql(t′), where {λql}l=1,...,∞ are nonincreasing eigenvalues and {φql(t)}l=1,...,∞ are the corresponding orthonormal eigenfunctions. The Karhunen-Loéve expansion of Xiq(t) is given by (1) Xiq(t)=μq(t)+∑l=1∞ξiqlϕql(t),

where the functional principal component (FPC) scores {ξiql}l=1,...,∞ are uncorrelated random variables with mean zero and variance λql. We can view φql(t) as a changing pattern of the longitudinal process, and ξiql describe how strongly the data from subject i follow this pattern. We assume that the longitudinal process can be adequately approximated by the first Lq eigenfunctions, and adopt a truncated version of the individual trajectory represented as Xiq(t)≈μq(t)+∑l=1Lqξiqlϕql(t). The number of components Lq can be determined based on pre-specified percentage of variance explained (PVE). Specifically, Lq may be chosen as the minimum integer such that ∑l=1Lqλql∕∑l=1∞λql≥PVE, e.g., PVE = 80%, 90%, or 95%.

In practice, observed outcomes Yijq are available only at discrete random times tij and missing for t&gt;Ti∗. The FPCA is conducted via principal analysis by conditional estimation (PACE) algorithm23, which has been shown to be versatile and powerful when applied to sparse and irregularly measured longitudinal data contaminated with measurement errors. The PACE algorithm is applied to the entire set of observed data for the q-th outcome, generating estimated mean function μ^q(t), error variance σ^εq, covariance function Σ^q(t,t′), eigenvalues λ^ql, and eigenfunctions ϕ^ql(t). The estimated FPC scores of subject i is given by (2) ξ^iql=λ^ql(ϕ^iql)⊤Σ^Yiq−1(Yiq−μ^iq),

where vectors Yiq={Yijq}j=1,⋯,Ji, μ^iq={μ^q(tij)}j=1,⋯,Ji, ϕ^iql={ϕ^ql(tij)}j=1,⋯,Ji, and Σ^Yiq is a Ji × Ji matrix with the (j, j′) entry (Σ^Yiq)j,j′=Σ^q(tij,tij′)+σ^εq2δjj′,δjj′=1 if j = j′ and 0 if j ≠ j′. We apply the PACE algorithm on all Q longitudinal outcomes and estimate the eigenfunctions ϕ^q(t)={ϕ^ql(t)}l=1,⋯,Lq and the FPC scores ξ^iq={ξ^iql}l=1,⋯,Lq, with a suitably chosen truncation Lq for the q-th outcome. The subject i’s vector of estimated FPC scores across all outcomes is denoted by ξ^i={ξ^iq}q=1,⋯,Q, which is of length L+=∑q=1QLq.

Because each longitudinal outcome is associated with the disease progression, there may exist non-negligible correlation among the FPC scores derived from multiple longitudinal outcomes. In Step 2, MFPCA indirectly models the correlations among outcomes via the correlations among the FPC scores. Specifically, let Θ be an I × L+ matrix, whose i-th row is ξ^i⊤. A matrix eigen analysis is performed on the L+ × L+ matrix H = (n − 1)−1Θ⊤Θ resulting into estimated eigenvalues {V^k}k=1,…,L+ and orthonormal eigenvectors {c^k}k=1,…,L+. Estimates for the multivariate eigenfunctions for the q-th outcome are given by Ψ^qk(t)=∑l=1Lq[c^k]l(q)ϕ^ql(t), where [c^k](q) denoted the q-th block of the orthonormal eigenvector c^k. The set of multivariate eigenfunctions ψ^k={Ψ^qk(t)}k=1,⋯,L+ characterizes the kth changing pattern of the multivariate longitudinal processes Xi(t). Estimates for the MFPC scores of subject i can be calculated via (3) ρ^ik=∑q=1Q∑l=1Lq[c^k]l(q)ξ^iql.

An optimal number D ≤ L+ of multivariate functional principal component can be chosen based on PVE, or some information criterion such as Akaike information criterion (AIC). Then the first D MFPC scores ρ^i={ρ^ik}k=1,⋯,D, which quantify the essential features extracted from the multivariate trajectories, are used as the predictors in a Cox model. The underlying trajectories of the q-th outcome can be approximated by (4) E(Yiq(t))=X^iq(t)≈μ^q(t)+∑k=1Dρ^ikψ^qk(t).

2.3 ∣ Survival analysis

The primary aim of our work is to fit the survival model using all follow-up data in the cohort and subsequently to make risk predictions at any given landmark time s for individuals still at risk (i.e., Ti∗&gt;s). Therefore, the estimated MFPC scores ρ^i, which is computed using all the follow-up data, can be used as predictors in modeling the relations between the survival time and the patterns of longitudinal outcomes. With preparation in Section 2.2, for each subject i, we use a Cox proportional hazards model that specifies the hazard function for Ti as (5) hi(t)=h0(t)exp{Zi⊺γ+ρ^i⊺β},

where h0(t) is an unspecified baseline hazard function that can be approximated by a piecewise-constant function or spline functions, γ = {γp}p=1,⋯,P is the vector of regression coefficients for the time-independent covariates Zi, and β = {βk}k=1,⋯,D is the vector of regression coefficients for the multivariate longitudinal predictors through the D estimated MFPC scores. This framework combines MFPCA and Cox model and we refer to it as MFPCCox.

2.4 ∣ Personalized dynamic predictions

To apply the above framework for dynamic prediction, we fit the model in the training dataset and use the estimated parameters to provide dynamic prediction for a new subject. We first obtain estimated parameters in functional data analysis and scores ρ^i using all the longitudinal measurements from the training dataset. Then we estimate γ^, β^, and h^0(t) by fitting model (5) using the estimated MFPC scores, time-independent covariates, and survival information of subjects in training dataset. Given a new subject N who is event-free till a landmark time s, the observations for the scalar outcomes are YNq = {YNq(tNj)}j=1,⋯,j′ at time points tN1, . . . , tNj′ ≤ s ≤ τ. We compute the FPC scores of the q-th outcome, based on the observations up to time s, for this subject using model (2) ξ^Nql=λ^ql(ϕ^Nql)⊺(Σ^YNq)−1(YNq−μ^Nq),l=1,…,Lq, where ϕ^Nql, Σ^YNq and μ^Nq are constructed similarly as ϕ^iql, Σ^Yiq and μ^iq estimated in the training dataset. Based on the estimated FPC scores derived from Q longitudinal outcomes, we calculate the MFPC score ρ^N using model (3).

Based on the estimated MFPC scores ρ^N from the subject-specific profiles of multiple health outcomes, we predict the future outcome trajectories at a future time point s′=(s+Δt)∈T for subject N, where Δt denotes a fixed window of prediction whereas the varying landmark time s denotes the time at which prediction are made given the subject-specific history. The latent longitudinal process of the q-th outcome for subject N can be reconstructed by model (4) such that X^Nq(s′)=μ^q(s′)+∑k=1Dρ^NkΨ^qk(s′), which utilizes correlations across multiple outcomes. The latent longitudinal processes X^Nq(s′) can be used either to predict the future health outcome at time s′ or to impute missing values occurred before time s for this new subject (e.g., the missed visit from subject 406 as illustrated in Figure 1).

To predict the risk of an event not occurring within a prediction window (s, s′], we use the conditional probability of event-free at any time s′ after the landmark time s given by π^N(s′∣s)=p(TN∗≥s′∣TN∗&gt;s,ZN,ρ^N)={S^0(s′)S^0(s)}exp{ZN⊺γ^+ρ^N⊺β^},

where S^0(s)=exp{−∫0sh^0(t)dt} is the baseline survival function. These risk predictions can be updated when further measurements are taken, leading to dynamic risk predictions that change over time as more data accumulate. For example, suppose that subject N has not experienced the event of interest by time s′ and has a new set of Q observations {YNq(tN(j′+1))}q=1,...,Q at time point tN(j′+1). Following the procedures in Section 2.2, we first update the estimated MFPC scores ρ^N by taking into account the new observations. Since MFPC scores quantify how strongly the longitudinal outcomes of subject N follow patterns ψ^k, the scores are updated to reflect the trends that are updated by the new observations. With the updated MFPC scores, the new predictions of longitudinal process and event-free probability can be calculated.

The predictive performance of the model are assessed in terms of discrimination (how well the models discriminate between subjects who had the event from those who did not) and calibration (the agreement between the predicted and true risks). We use time-dependent area under the curve (AUC)24 as a discrimination measure, which has been shown to be a more proper scoring rule, compared with C-index, to evaluate t-year predicted risks25. In addition, we use dynamic expected Brier score26,27 as calibration measure to assess the accuracy of individual risk prediction. The comparison of dynamic predictive accuracy of multiple models is conducted using the method proposed by27. This method derives the confidence regions of AUCs and Brier scores. It also enables the significance tests of the differences of AUCs or Brier scores obtained from two candidate models. In general, higher AUC and lower Brier score indicate better discrimination and calibration, respectively.

Deriving the analytical expression of the sampling variability of the predictions X^Nq(s′) and π^N(s′∣s) in the current context is challenging. Instead, we implement a bootstrap procedure to examine the uncertainty in both the model and FPC decomposition objects. Specifically, if B bootstrap iterations are to be performed, for b = 1, . . . , B, we resample subjects from the index set I* = {1, . . . , I} with replacement. Let Db be the b-th bootstrap dataset that includes re-sampled subjects, we obtain the model inference using Db and calculate the b-th predictions for subject N. The process is repeated B times and B samples of model parameters and predictions are obtained. The pointwise confidence intervals for the estimated trajectories X^Nq(s) are constructed using a corrected confidence bands methods for sparsely observed curves proposed by28. The confidence interval for π^N(s′∣s) is constructed from the quantile of the bootstrap samples. To facilitate easy reading and implementation of the proposed MFPCCox model, a sample R code with simulated data are provided on https://github.com/kan-li/MFPCCox.

3 ∣ APPLICATION TO THE ADNI STUDY

The primary goal of the ADNI study is to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers, and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of AD. Because MCI is commonly considered as a transitional stage between normal cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, numerous recent studies assess various clinical markers and neuroimaging techniques to predict AD diagnosis among MCI patients29,30. To this end, our analysis focuses on 355 MCI patients in the ADNI-1 study, and we consider AD diagnosis among MCI patients to be the survival event of interest. In the ADNI-1 study, the 355 MCI patients were reassessed at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months, and additional follow-ups were conducted annually as part of ADNI-2. The average follow-up period is 3.2 years (SD 2.6; range 0.4-9.3) before AD diagnosis or censoring. The mean number of visits is 5.4 times (SD, 2.5; range 2-11) and the overall non-monotone missing rate of longitudinal neurocognitive outcomes is 11.6%. Among them, 180 patients were diagnosed with AD (survival event) and 175 had stable MCI over a mean follow-up period of 2.3 years and 4.2 years, respectively.

We apply the proposed MFPCCox method to the motivating ADNI-1 study to investigate whether the combination of multivariate longitudinal outcomes improves the predictive performance of the risk of AD conversion. We focus on the five neurocognitive markers that have strong predictive value and are commonly measured in AD studies6: Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 13 items (ADAS-Cog 13); Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Tests (RAVLT immediate score and RAVLT learning score); Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ); Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). We also include other relevant demographic and genetic variables, i.e., baseline age (bAge), gender, years of education (Edu), and presence of at least one apolipoprotein E allele (APOE-ε4), given their potential effects on AD progression31-33.

Two candidate Cox regression models are specified. Model 1 incorporates the baseline information of the five selected neurocognitive markers as predictors, and Model 2 incorporates the longitudinal information of the five neurocognitive markers by including the MFPC scores derived from the longitudinal observations. Along with other covariates, Model 1 is hi(t)=h0(t)exp{γ1genderi+γ2bAgei+γ3Edui+γ4APOE−ε4i+γ4ADAS−Cogi+γ5RAVLT_immedi+γ6RAVLT_learni+γ7FAQi+γ8MMSEi},

and Model 2 is hi(t)=h0(t)exp{γ1genderi+γ2bAgei+γ3Edui+γ4APOE−ε4i+ρ^i⊺β},

where ρ^i are MFPC scores of five neurocognitive tests. We select 7 scores which account for 98% total variation of the longitudinal outcomes in Model 2. Web Figure 1 displays the first three multivariate eigenfunctions Ψ^q1(t), Ψ^q2(t), and Ψ^q3(t) for the five selected neurocognitive markers, respectively. Almost 70% the variability in the data is explained by the first functional principal component, which can be considered as the degree of cognitive impairment. The first functional principal components show the general trends relative to means during follow-up, while the second and the third functional principal components may display the trends of changing acceleration. The proportional hazards assumption is evaluated by examining the plots of Schoenfeld residuals for each baseline covariate in each candidate model. The residual plots do not show extreme nonlinearity or other irregularities, suggesting that the proportional hazards assumption is reasonable.

We compare the two candidate models by assessing their predictive performance, in terms of the time-dependent AUC and dynamic expected Brier score (BS), at different time points over the follow-up period. To avoid overestimation of the prediction, we conduct a 10-fold cross validation. Parameters of the models are estimated from the training dataset and applied to the validation dataset. The conditional event-free probability corresponding to the time frame (s, s + Δt] is predicted for each patient in the validation datasets as describe in Section 2.4. Because the ADNI patients were reassessed approximately every half year, we select landmark time s at 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 years, and let predicted window Δt be 0.5 and 1 year. The time-dependent AUC, AUC(s, Δt), and dynamic expected Brier scores, BS(s, Δt), are calculated based on the predicted probabilities of all patients.

Figures 2 and 3 display the curves of the estimated AUC(s, Δt), BS(s, Δt), difference in AUCs, ΔAUC(s, Δt), and difference in Brier scores, ΔBS(s, Δt), between Model 1 and Model 2 for different predicted windows Δt. For a Δt = 0.5 year prediction (Figure 2), Model 2 has relative larger AUC(s, Δt) than Model 1 for all the combinations of s and Δt. The 95% pointwise confidence intervals of the differences in AUC(s, Δt do not cover the zero line at landmark time s = {1, 1.5}, indicating that the null hypotheses ΔAUC(s, Δt) = 0 are rejected with a significance level of a = 5%. Model 2 has significantly improved predictive performance in terms of discrimination in this interval. Although not significant, Brier score for predictions from the longitudinal health outcomes are also estimated to be lower than those from the baseline information. For a Δt = 1 year prediction (Figure 3), the 95% pointwise confidence intervals of the differences in AUC(s, Δt), as well as the confidence intervals of the differences in BS(s, Δt), do not cover the zero lines at landmark time s = {0.5, 1, 1.5}. It suggests that Model 2 has significantly improved predictive performance in terms of both discrimination and calibration in these intervals. Including longitudinal information of health outcomes in the Cox model improves the capability of the model in predicting risk of AD diagnosis. The wide confidence regions may be caused by the small sample size of the study (I = 355)27. We have also investigated another model (Model 3) to incorporate the neuroimaging information, i.e., longitudinal hippocampal volume, in MFPCA. The predictive performance of Model 3 has no significant improvement compared to Model 2, and it needs additional efforts to collect neuroimaging data in clinical practice. Please refer to Web Supplement for details.

Web Table 1 displays the values of time-dependent AUC and dynamic expected Brier score from the two candidate models for each landmark time s and predicted window Δt. Both models have acceptable AUCs (range from 0.71 to 0.88) and small Brier scores (less than 0.15) indicating a good prediction performance in terms of discrimination and calibration. We select Model 2 as the final model because it has better predictive performance than Model 1. Note that Model 2 does not necessarily display an increase in AUC(s, Δt) curve for an increasing of s. Although the models utilize more information as s increases and thus provide more accurate prediction, the decrease in discrimination is realistic and reasonable. It is probably the consequence of a selection process that makes the at-risk population more and more homogeneous as s increases.

To illustrate the personalized dynamic predictions, we set aside two target patients as validation data, and predict their future health outcomes and event-free probability based on Model 2 estimates using the remaining data as training set. Patient A has a baseline age of 78, male, no APOE-ε4, as compared with a more severe Patient B, 61 years old at baseline, female, and with APOE-ε4. The cubic spline smoothed trajectory functions of the five neurocognitive makers are plotted in Figures 4 and 5, which demonstrate how the predictions of the longitudinal outcomes are updated over time for these two patients. From the left to the right in these two figures, by using more follow-up data, predictions are closer to the true observed values and the smoothed 95% pointwise confidence intervals are narrower. It also suggests that Patient A has more stable and better predicted neurocognitive scores (better cognitive function) than patient B. Figure 6 displays the predicted probability of being free of AD diagnosis, and survival curves are estimated using cubic splines to provide smooth curves over the follow-up period. For Patient A (upper panels), the event-free probability curve does not show large changes because Patient A’s predicted neurocognitive scores indicate a relatively better and stable AD status. In comparison, Patient B (lower panels) has a worse cognitive function, and thus has considerably drop in the event-free probability, suggesting that Patient B has a higher risk of AD diagnosis and should be monitored frequently.

4 ∣ SIMULATION STUDY

We evaluate the performance of our method by using simulations studies in which the simulated data mimic the motivating application. In the simulation, we compare our proposed MFPCCox to multivariate joint modeling (MJM) approach with parametric models for longitudinal outcomes. The simulation study is designed to evaluate predictive performance of the MJM and the proposed MFPCCox in four scenarios: 1) linear longitudinal outcomes without missing observations; 2) nonlinear longitudinal outcomes without missing observations; 3) linear longitudinal outcomes with random missing observations (missing completely at random); 4) nonlinear longitudinal outcomes with random missing observations. Each scenario is based on 100 datasets with sample size I = 300 subjects and each subject has three longitudinal outcomes, with observations at time points 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 (Ji=7).

In Scenarios 1 and 3, the linear longitudinal measurements {Yiq(tij)q=1,2,3 are simulated from the longitudinal submodels Yiq(tij)=Xiq(tij)+ϵijq,

Xiq(tij)=β0q+βtqtij+β1qwi+biq.

We let [β01, β02, β03] = [1.5, 2, 0.5], [βt1, βt2, βt3] = [1.5, −1, 0.6], and [β11, β12, β13] = [2, −1, 1]. We generate scalar predictors using wi1 ~ N(3, 1), with 1 being the variance. The subject-specific random effects [bi1, bi2, bi3] are generated from multivariate normal distribution with zero-mean and covariance matrix Σ=[σ12,η12σ1σ2,η13σ1σ3σ22,η23σ2σ3σ32],

where [σ12,σ22,σ32]=[1,1.5,2], η12 = −0.2, η13 = 0.1 and η13 = −0.3, respectively. The measurement error ϵijq is simulated from N(0, 1) for q = 1, 2, 3. In Scenarios 2 and 4 with non-linear longitudinal outcomes, the longitudinal submodels are defined as Yiq(tij)=Xiq(tij)+ϵijq,

Xiq(tij)=β0q+βtq∑r=13cr(tij−κr)++β1qxi+biq,

where the spline coefficients [c1, c2, c3] = [1.2, 0.7, 0.5], knots [κ1, κ2, κ3] = [0, 6, 13], and the truncated basis functions of time are (t − κr)+ = t − κr if t &gt; κr and 0 otherwise.

In all four scenarios, we choose a constant baseline hazard function h0(t) = exp(−7) and the survival submodel is hi(t)=h0(t)exp{ziγ1+∑q=13αqXiq(t)},

where zi is sampled from Bernoulli distribution with event probability being 0.5, γ1 = −2.5, and [α1, α2, α3] = [0.1, −0.1, 0.2]. We randomly generate survival probability Si(Ti) from standard uniform distribution and then solve for event times Ti from the survival function Si(Ti)=exp{−∫0Tihi(t)dt} using the uniroot() and integrate() functions in R. Censoring time is independently simulated from an uniform distribution to achieve a censoring rate about 30%. Due to censoring, each subject has four longitudinal measurements, on average. To introduce missing data, we randomly select 10% of the measurements and delete them. This level of missingness is similar to the ADNI-1 dataset.

For each of the 100 simulated datasets of size 300, we randomly select 200 subjects as the training dataset and set aside the remaining 100 subjects for prediction. In each scenario, the model inference is first conducted based on all observations in a training dataset using two frameworks: multivariate joint modeling (MJM) framework with linear longitudinal submodels and our proposed MFPCCox framework combing MFPCA and Cox model. After fitting the model, the dynamic predictions are made for subjects n, n = 1, . . . , 100, in the validation datasets using methods corresponding to each framework. We use the longitudinal data until the landmark time s to reconstruct the longitudinal process X^nq(t) and predict the subject-specific survival probability π^n(s′∣s) at a future time point s′. The predicted AUCs are calculated based on the predicted risks of all subjects in the validation dataset. The true conditional survival probabilities π^n(s′∣s) and the true time-dependent AUCs are computed using the pre-specified parameter values and the generated random effects. We use the dynamic expected Brier score to assess the bias between the predicted and true risks. The ability to reconstruct the true longitudinal process is assessed by the mean squared error (MSE) as MSE=∑q=13∫0Ti[X^nq(t)−Xnq(t)]2du, where the integral is approximated by summation. To fit the multivariate joint model and make dynamic prediction, we use the latest R package JMbayes that is available on github through the package’s author13. The JMbayes adopts the Bayesian approach and speeds up the code via calling functions written in C++. The proposed MFPCCox method is implemented using available R package MFPCA34 for the MFPC analysis and package survival35 for survival model.

Table 1 presents the time-dependent AUCs, dynamic expected BS, and MSE by averaging the results from 100 simulated validation datasets. In all scenarios, the predicted AUCs from both MJM and MFPCCox are only slightly smaller than the true AUCs. It suggests a good prediction performance of the MFPCCox, compared to the MJM, in terms of discrimination. The small values of BS also indicate a comparable calibration performance of the MFPCCox in all scenarios. In Scenarios 1 and 3 with linear longitudinal outcomes, the MJM model provides slightly larger AUCs, smaller BSs, and smaller MSEs as it is the true model. However, in Scenarios 2 and 4 with non-linear outcomes, although both MJM and MFPCCox have comparable performance in predicting the event probability, MFPCCox outperforms MJM in robustness of reconstructing the longitudinal processes with much smaller MSEs when the MJM misspecifies the parametric form. The simulation results in Scenarios 3 and 4 with missing values suggest that a small percentage of missing in observed data has a limited effect on the prediction performance of both methods. Overall, our proposed method has a robust predictive performance in terms of both calibration and discrimination. Although the proposed MFPCCox, whose model inference is conducted using a two-stage approach, ignores the informative censoring on the longitudinal outcomes due to drop-out process36, the simulation results show limited effect of informative censoring issue on the prediction performance of the model. The two methods are further compared under scenario with more complex correlation structure of longitudinal outcomes, i.e., including the random slops in the longitudinal submodels. MJM and MFPCCox still have comparable predict performance (Web Table 2). However, with the number of parameters in the covariance matrix Σ increases, the complexity and the computational burden for the model inference of MJM approach also increase. Please refer to the Web Supplement for details.

The proposed MFPCCox method can be implemented using available software with much less computational burden. Using a personal computer (RAM 8G, CPU 3.30GHz) for the first simulation scenario, it takes about 6.25 hours for fitting a Bayesian MJM using JMbayes, while it takes about 80 seconds for a frequentist-based MFPCCox. As the number of longitudinal outcomes increases, the computational time for MJM would increase exponentially. Additional simulation studies are conducted to assess the capabilities of MJM and MFPCCox to incorporate a large number of longitudinal outcomes relying on existing software. The simulation study is designed to extend the Scenario 1 in this section with total number of longitudinal outcomes Q increases from 4 to 10. Although MJM is theoretically implementable, the JMbayes package fails to fit a MJM model on a simulated dataset including 6 or more longitudinal outcomes in a reasonable time frame and has an error message reported. However, the proposed MFPCCox method can be easily implemented on the same dataset and provide accurate predictions on a validation dataset (Web Table 3). The attempt to fit a multivariate joint model (with five longitudinal neurocognitive markers as Section 3) on the ADNI dataset also failed when using JMbayes package. It suggests that MFPCCox is more robust and reliable in terms of implementation. To further demonstrate the scalability of MFPCCox approach, additional simulation studies on the comparison of the computing times for varying sample sizes and number of outcomes are available in the Web Supplement.

5 ∣ DISCUSSION

We have developed a MFPCCox framework to use the trajectory patterns of multiple longitudinal health outcomes to conduct real-time dynamic prediction of future outcome trajectories and risks of target events. The multivariate functional components analysis (MFPCA) effectively deals with measurement errors and captures the temporal correlation in the outcomes as well as correlations among outcomes. It does not require a prespecified parametric functional form for the longitudinal trajectory and it allows missingness and irregularities of the data. In the real data analysis, our results suggest that including the history of multivariate longitudinal neurocognitive markers, in addition to baseline variables greatly improve predictive performance for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression. In the simulation studies, our proposed method has a good dynamic predictive accuracy and discrimination. It is more robust against misspecification of the models for longitudinal outcomes, and thus well-suited for characterizing the features of multiple longitudinal trajectories than the parametric multivariate joint models (MJM). Moreover, the proposed MFPCCox model is capable to incorporate a large number of longitudinal outcomes. In contrast, the MJM would quickly become intractable as the number of outcomes and the size of their covariance matrix increase. The MFPCCox models can be implemented in available software and are computationally attractive. Such a framework is applicable to many medical conditions with similar multi-modal data structure (e.g., Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative study37 and TRACK-HD study of Huntington’s disease38).

To facilitate the personalized dynamic predictions in clinical setting, we develop a web-based calculator available at https://kanli.shinyapps.io/AD_prediction/. A screenshot of the user interface is presented in Web Figure 4. The calculator requires as input the patient’s baseline characteristics and his/her longitudinal outcome values up to the present time. The online calculator will then produce time-dependent predictions of future health outcome trajectories and the risk of AD progression, in addition to the 95% confidence intervals. Moreover, additional data generated from more follow-up visits can be input to obtain updated predictions. The calculator is a user friendly and easily accessible tool to provide clinicians with dynamically-updated patient-specific predictions. The practical impact of these dynamic prediction tools can be profound for the neurodegenerative diseases because they provide unique insight and valuable guidance for clinical decision making on patient prognosis, treatment initiation, and counseling to facilitate a targeted treatment.

One limitation of the proposed two-stage approach could be the unignorable informative censoring on the longitudinal model due to drop-out process. Many studies have compared the two-stage modeling and joint modeling approaches in the context of a single longitudinal outcome and suggested that unignorable censoring leads to parameter bias36. However, the informative censoring has limited effect on prediction performance as shown in our simulation study that mimics the real data. Moreover, there are less than 10% of the MCI population in our analyses that discontinued because of death before progression to AD. Death is treated as a noninformative right-censoring event in our analyses. Cox proportional hazard model may produce biased parameter estimates of the predictor effects when failing to account for the competing risk of death in elder population. The competing risk approaches12,39 could be adopted to improve our method. Further improvement of the model could be made by considering AD conversion as an interval-censoring problem, as AD diagnosis is available only at visit times. In addition, the proposed model only applies to continuous multivariate longitudinal outcomes. However, the types of outcomes could also be binary and ordinal. In the future work, we will extend the proposed model to a generalized MFPC and Cox modeling framework to accommodate other types of longitudinal outcomes. The effect of correlation strength of the longitudinal outcomes on MFPCA will also be investigated in the future work.
