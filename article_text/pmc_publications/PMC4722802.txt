To identify common variants contributing to normal variation in two specific domains of cognitive functioning, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of executive functioning and information processing speed in non-demented older adults from the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium. Neuropsychological testing was available for 5429–32 070 subjects of European ancestry aged 45 years or older, free of dementia and clinical stroke at the time of cognitive testing from 20 cohorts in the discovery phase. We analyzed performance on the Trail Making Test parts A and B, the Letter Digit Substitution Test (LDST), the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), semantic and phonemic fluency tests, and the Stroop Color and Word Test. Replication was sought in 1311-21860 subjects from 20 independent cohorts. A significant association was observed in the discovery cohorts for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17518584 (discovery P-value = 3.12 × 10−8) and in the joint discovery and replication meta-analysis (P-value = 3.28 × 10−9 after adjustment for age, gender and education) in an intron of the gene cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2) for performance on the LDST/DSST. Rs17518584 is located about 170 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the major transcript for the CADM2 gene, but is within an intron of a variant transcript that includes an alternative first exon. The variant is associated with expression of CADM2 in the cingulate cortex (P-value = 4 × 10−4). The protein encoded by CADM2 is involved in glutamate signaling (P-value = 7.22 × 10−15), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transport (P-value = 1.36 × 10−11) and neuron cell-cell adhesion (P-value = 1.48 × 10−13). Our findings suggest that genetic variation in the CADM2 gene is associated with individual differences in information processing speed.


INTRODUCTION

Cognitive function broadly refers to multiple dissociable, but inter-correlated cognitive domains, including memory, language, executive function, processing speed and visuospatial ability. Unimpaired cognitive abilities are an important determinant of quality of life. Impairment of cognitive abilities is seen with dementia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.1–3 Among the cognitive domains, processing speed is considered a fundamental process, reflecting the speed at which cognitive operations are performed.4,5 Executive function reflects higher-order cognitive capabilities, presumably mediated by the frontal lobes, including response inhibition, attention, cognitive flexibility and planning.6

In addition to domain-specific variance, processing speed and executive function are also, in part, explained by an individual's general cognitive ability. The same holds true for the genetic variance of performance on individual cognitive tests.7 The estimated heritability of general cognitive ability from twin studies of intelligence ranges from approximately 50 to 80%, and appears to increase with age.8 The general intelligence construct g has a heritability of around 29%, for example, observed in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) based on the GCTA procedure.9,10 Heritability of performance on tests within individual cognitive domains has been estimated from 12 to 68%11–14 for processing speed and 16–63%13,15,16 for executive function.

Of note, there is also considerable covariation between cognitive domains.17,18 There is, for example, debate as to whether processing speed is merely one of the cognitive domains, or whether processing speed has a more unique role as a fundamental process underlying variation in more complex cognitive traits as well as in cognitive aging.19,20

Identifying variants that influence quantitative variation in processing speed and executive function may provide insight into the normal variation in these important cognitive functions, and may ultimately increase our understanding of diseases that disrupt these cognitive domains.

Although various genes have been identified as potential candidates affecting different dimensions of cognitive function, prior studies have yielded inconsistent results.21 Candidate gene meta-analyses have shown associations of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene22 and the DTNBP1 (dystrobrevin binding protein 1) gene23 to general cognitive ability, although these findings do not meet the current standard of genome-wide significance (P-value between 0.01 and 0.05 for APOE, P-value = 0.003 for DTNBP1). Linkage analyses of executive function tasks have identified regions on chromosomes 2q, 5q, 11q, 13q and 14q.24–26 To our knowledge, there are currently five published GWAS on processing speed and executive traits in adults.5,27–30 Processing speed was suggestively associated with several loci, of which the TRIB3 (tribbles homolog 3) gene was the strongest and biologically most interesting.5 For executive function, one study30 identified a genome-wide significant association (P-value = 4.32 × 10−8) of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the WDR72 gene (chromosome 15) for a cognitive test similar to the Stroop interference test. The WDR72 gene has also been associated with kidney function.31 Prior studies of executive function and processing speed have been limited by small sample sizes (700 and 4000 subjects), resulting in limited power, and by application of lenient significance thresholds. Replication of prior findings has been lacking both across and within cognitive domains.

In this study, we performed a large-scale meta-analysis to identify genetic variants associated with executive function and information processing speed combining GWAS from multiple cohorts of non-demented middle-aged and older adults from the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium.32

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study populations

The discovery phase included 20 cohorts contributing to one or more test (N per test = 5429–32 070) (Supplementary Table 1). The number of discovery cohorts and subjects varied based on the availability of each test. Each cohort had extensive phenotypic data on one or more traits, and genome-wide SNP data available. Details for each cohort are given in Supplementary Table 1. Subjects aged 45 and older who were free of stroke and dementia and of European ancestry were eligible for the study.

Twenty replication cohorts (total N = 1311–21 860) (Supplementary Table 1) were selected based upon comparability of the study populations to the discovery cohorts, and availability of genotype data, and these cohorts were invited to share data from a GWAS run according to the same protocols. Applying the same inclusion criteria for age (≥45 years) and the absence of stroke or dementia, we also included cohorts of African-American ancestry (N = 1004–3164 depending on the trait) in the replication phase, partly to evaluate whether our findings could be extrapolated to persons of other ethnicities. Data from the discovery and replication studies were further meta-analyzed. Additional details are provided in the Supplementary Material. Each participant provided informed consent and all studies were approved by their local Institutional Review Boards.

Executive function and processing speed tests

Each cohort included some tests of executive function and/or processing speed. Test batteries differed across cohorts. Tests of executive function included the Trail Making Test part B (Trail B), Stroop card 3 (color word card) and tests of phonemic (letters, see Supplementary Material) and semantic (animals) fluency. Tests of processing speed included Trail Making Test part A (Trail A), Stroop card 2 (color card), the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Letter-Digit Substitution Task (LDST), the Letter Digit Coding Test (LDCT) and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). All tests were administered in a standardized manner by an investigator unaware of any genetic information on the subjects. Details for the test administration and raw scores are given in Supplementary Table 1 and in the Supplementary Methods. Because the nature of the task and procedures for DSST, LDST, LDCT and SDMT were so similar, these measures were combined (that is, treated as the same test; referred to hereafter as DSST/LDST) in analysis. To assess the validity of combining these measures into a single meta-analysis, we conducted a substudy to determine the correlation between these measures in 102 volunteers not included in the meta-analysis cohorts. Details of the substudy are provided in the Supplementary Material, section 6 and Supplementary Table 5.

Genotyping and imputation

Genotyping was independently performed by each cohort using commercially available arrays ranging from the Illumina 300 and 610 k to the Affymetrix GeneChip SNP Array 6.0 (Supplementary Table 2). Each cohort applied standard quality control filtering before genetic imputations. These filters included a SNP call rate of at least 90%, sample call rate of at least 92%, minor allele frequency of at least 0.01, and Hardy–Weinberg deviation P-value of at most 10−3 (Supplementary Table 3). Genetic data imputations were performed in each cohort using HapMap II CEPH (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe) as the reference panel, with the exceptions of ARIC and GENOA African-American cohorts that imputed their genetic data using both HapMap II CEPH and YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan) populations as a reference.33 Details on genotyping and imputations are provided in Supplementary Tables 2–4.

Genome-wide association analysis

Each cohort performed a linear regression model of test scores against the dosage of coded alleles for each SNP testing an additive effect of the genetic variants. Skewness and kurtosis were evaluated before the analyses. A detailed description of the screening for latent population substructure in each cohort is given in part 5 of the Supplementary Material and Supplementary Table 3. Where appropriate, principal components or family-specific methods such as mixed model score were applied to correct for familial relationships (Supplementary Material, part 5).

We used two models of association analysis; with and without education level as a covariate in addition to age, gender and other study specific confounders, for example, study site, familial relations or population substructure. This is because there is a dynamic, two-way relationship between cognitive function and level of education. The ability to score high on cognitive tests is influenced by background familiarity with, for example, the numbers and alphabet (Trails tests) or a large vocabulary (fluency tests), which are typically acquired during one's formal education. Estimates are that, even in the Netherlands (10%) and the USA (22%), functional illiteracy is common among adults aged 16–65.34,35 Conversely, there is a genetic correlation between education and cognitive ability.36

Meta-analysis

The meta-analysis was performed in METAL.37 For all tests except the Stroop test and LDST/DSST, meta-analysis was performed using the inverse variance method. For the Stroop test and LDST/DSST, a sample size weighted meta-analysis was performed because of the differences in the test methodology and measurement units that impeded the pooling of the beta coefficients. The z-statistic was weighted by the effective sample size (sample size × (observed dosage variance/expected dosage variance)) for each SNP. Genomic control was applied within each cohort before meta-analysis. The meta-analyses were restricted to autosomal SNPs common to all studies for each neurocognitive test.

Additional analyses

Expression quantitative trait locus analyses

All variants with a discovery P-value &lt; 5 × 10−6 were analyzed further to test whether they were associated with RNA expression. For this, we used the Genotype Tissue expression portal (GTex, Broad Institute, Boston, MA, USA; http://www.gtexportal.org/home/) to assess the variants for their influence on expression of their closest genes in brain tissue.38 We also performed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) experiments in 138 human hippocampal cell lines obtained in vivo from patients undergoing surgery for treatment-resistant epilepsy. Details on the methods of this functional follow-up study are given in the Supplementary Material. Cognitive tests are never completely limited to a single cognitive domain. Even in executive function and processing speed tests, working memory (and other capabilities) may have a role. For example, one needs to remember the assignment and which words were already used in fluency tasks, and those who are better able to passively learn the key in the LDST or DSST should likewise produce a higher (better) score. Thus, some hippocampal involvement might be expected along with the predominant frontal processes of executive function and processing speed. Hence we used the hippocampal cell lines to identify associations between whole-genome SNP (Illumina Human 660 W array) and RNA expression data (Illumina HumanHT-12v3). The Bonferroni corrected level of eQTL significance for a given SNP can be assumed to be 0.05/n of genes for a given SNP and a given test, leading to a P-value of 0.05/20 000 = 2.5 × 10−6 for the hypothesis-free, genome-wide search for eQTL associations.

Gene network and functional prediction analysis

A gene network analysis was performed using the Gene Network database (http://www.genenetwork.nl/genenetwork, by Groningen University, The Netherlands) (Fehr-mann et al., manuscript in preparation), which incorporates gene expression data from 77 840 human, mouse and rat Affymetrix microarrays from the Gene Expression Omnibus.39,40 Using principal components analysis on the probeset correlation matrices, so-called transcriptional components were identified that describe major biological pathways. We combined these data into a multi-species gene network with 19 997 unique human genes. Predictions of gene function were made using biological databases such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, www.genome.jp/kegg),41 Gene Ontology (GO, www.geneontology.org) Database42 and Reactome pathway database (www.reactome.org).43 Additionally, we consulted the GTex website for tissue expression data on the genes of interest. More detailed information on the gene network approach is given in the Supplementary Material.

RESULTS

Phenotypes

Analyses in an independent group of 102 volunteers showed correlations between LDST, DSST and SDMT above 0.8 (P-value &lt; 0.01). After partialling out age, correlations remained above 0.7 (P-value &lt; 0.01). (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Figure 1). We therefore deemed it appropriate to combine these three tests into one sample size-weighted meta-analysis.

GWAS and eQTL analysis

Baseline characteristics of the study populations and mean test results for each trait are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Supplementary Figure 2 shows the quantile-quantile plots for the discovery-phase GWAS meta-analysis of each trait. No inflation due to hidden substructure or cryptic relatedness was observed for any cohort.

In the meta-analysis for processing speed (LDST/DSST tests), only one genome-wide significant association was observed at an intronic variant (rs17518584, P-value = 3.12 × 10−8 in the model adjusted for age, sex and education and P-value = 6.25 × 10−7 in the model adjusted for age and sex) in the gene encoding cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2) on chromosome 3 (Supplementary Figure 3 and Table 1). This gene is also known as SYNCAM2 (synaptic cell adhesion molecule 2). This variant explains 0.05% (age, sex and education-adjusted model) of the variance in scores on the LDST/DSST in the Rotterdam Study, one of the largest population-based cohorts.

Additional information was sought for all SNPs with a discovery P-value of below 5 × 10−6 and a minor allele frequency of &gt;0.05. At this phase, 7 SNPs were analyzed for LDST/DSST, 15 SNPs for the Stroop test, 12 SNPs for Trail A, 17 SNPs for Trail B, 9 SNPs for letter fluency and 34 SNPs for semantic fluency. Of all the loci tested in the independent cohorts, including both subjects of European and African-American ancestries, a nominally significant association in the same direction as in the discovery analyses was observed only for the CADM2 variant rs17518584 with LDST/DSST (nominal P-value = 0.03 for meta-analyses of results in the additional cohorts, adjusting for age and sex, and nominal P-value = 0.05 for meta-analysis of results after adjusting for age, sex and education). Meta-analysis of discovery and replication cohorts yielded genome-wide significant evidence for association of rs17518584 in CADM2 with scores for the LDST/DSST processing speed tests, in the fully-adjusted model that included age, sex and education (P-value = 3.28 × 10−9) (Table 1). The findings of the individual studies (both discovery and replication) are shown in Table 2.

When examining association signals for loci previously identi-fied in genetic analyses of cognitive function, rs7412 and rs429358 used to genotype the APOE ε4 allele associated with general cognition22 were not present in the analyzed SNP sets. However, a single SNP proxy for APOE ε4 (rs4420638)44 was associated with the LDST/DSST (P-value = 2.11 × 10−4) in the fully adjusted model. We found no effect of additional adjustments for rs4420638 on the association of rs17518584 with the LDST/DSST in the Rotterdam study cohorts. There was no evidence for association of SNPs in any of the other tested candidate genes that have previously been associated with executive and processing speed functions. (DTNBP1: lowest P-value = 0.019 for rs2619522 for the Stroop test, TRIB3: lowest P-value = 0.155 for phonemic fluency, WDR72 lowest P-value = 0.157 for LDST/DSST in our GWAS meta-analysis for the fully adjusted model). Also, regions for which linkage was reported (2q, 5q, 11q, 13q and 14q) were not genome-wide significant. The strongest association was seen in the 11q.25 region in which we found a SNP rs2734839 to be suggestively associated with performance on the LDST/DSST (P-value = 4.39 × 10−7 for the age- and sex-adjusted model and 3.08 × 10−6 for the model adjusted for age, sex and education). Rs2734839 is an intronic SNP in the DRD2 gene encoding the D2 subtype of the dopamine receptor.

Bioinformatics analysis

The GTex tissue expression data (www.broadinstitute.org/gtex) show that CADM2 is expressed more abundantly in different areas of the brain than in any other tissue, and most specifically in the frontal and anterior cingulate cortex (Supplementary Figure 4). In the GTex eQTL analysis, the top hit from the LDST/DSST GWAS, rs17518584, showed association with RNA expression levels of CADM2 in the cingulate cortex (P-value = 4 × 10−4), general hemispheral cortex (P-value = 0.004), substantia nigra (P-value = 0.007), frontal cortex (P-value = 0.02) and cerebellum (P-value = 0.03). No significant cis or trans associations were identified in the ex-vivo hippocampal data. Gene network analysis shows that CADM2 is significantly expressed in human brain (P-value for expression in cerebral cortex = 2.47 × 10−171, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.99; P-value for expression in the prefrontal cortex specifically = 1.29 × 10−31, AUC = 1.0; P-value for expression in the hippocampus = 8.2 × 10−36, AUC = 0.99). The gene network analyses suggest that CADM2 is likely involved in biological processes that include the glutamate signaling pathway (P-value = 7.22 × 10−15), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transport (P-value = 1.36 × 10−11) and neuron cell-cell adhesion (P-value = 1.48 × 10−13). CADM2 shows strong positive co-expression with several genes involved in the GABA and other glutamate neurosignaling pathways, such as GABA A receptor alpha 1 and beta 2 (GABRA1, GABRB2) and glutamate receptor metabotropic 5 (GRM5). Further, there is strong positive co-expression with many members of the voltage-gated potassium channel group including KCNJ9, KCNJ10, KCNB2 and KCNC, and with the OPCML (opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule-like) gene and EPHA5 (EPH receptor A5) (Figure 1). Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Figure 4 provide the expression data in neuronal tissues. As expected, Gene Network and GTex show that DRD2 is predominantly expressed in the pituitary (GTex reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) = 50), putamen (gene network AUC = 1, P-value = 5 × 10−12, GTex RPKM = 40), substantia nigra (gene network AUC = 0.98, P-value = 4 × 10−15, GTex RPKM = 4) and nucleus accumbens (GTex RPKM = 28). However, the intronic variant rs2734839 is not associated with expression at nominal significance in any region reported (cingulate, frontal or general cortex, amygdala, caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, putamen, substantia nigra, cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, pituitary or spinal cord).

DISCUSSION

The discovery phase of our study yielded genome-wide significance for an association of processing speed (LDST/DSST) with rs17518584. In silico replication in additional independent cohorts yielded nominally significant support for association. In the combined discovery-replication analysis, the model adjusted for age, sex and education resulted in genome-wide significant association between rs17518584 and LDST/DSST performance. The variant is associated with CADM2 expression, at least at nominal significance.

Rs17518584 is located about 170 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the major transcript for the CADM2 gene, but is within an intron of a variant transcript that includes an alternative first exon. Variants in the CADM2 gene have been previously associated with body mass index,37 but not with cognitive function. The gene has been studied as a candidate for autism spectrum disorders,45 and showed a suggestive association with scores on the persistence items on a personality scale.46 The protein is likely involved in long-term signal depression and potentiation and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/), and is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The gene encodes a neuronal adhesion molecule that has been shown to be widely expressed in the developing and adult brain in laboratory mice,47 as well as in human and rat brain tissue, with highest expression AUCs for the prefrontal cortex. In the GTex analyses, rs17518584 significantly influenced CADM2 expression levels in the brain, most specifically in the cingulate cortex. This finding is of interest in the background of diffusion tensor imaging experiments that have shown an association between fractional anisotropy in the cingulum and performance on executive and processing speed tasks.48,49 The co-expression data from gene network analysis also revealed some interesting links to Alzheimer's disease (Figure 1). OPCML has been associated with a variety of cognitive domains in a follow-up of linkage regions for Alzheimer's disease.50 EPHA5 is a member of the same family of ephrin receptors as the EPHA1 gene, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease.51,52

No significant cis or trans associations with gene expression were identified in the experiments using ex-vivo hippocampal tissue from epilepsy patients. However, both GTex and Gene Network bioinformatics sources show that CADM2 is expressed in normal hippocampal tissue (obtained postmortem).

We identified only one genome-wide significant variant explaining a small part of the variance in performance on the LDST/DSST (R2 = 0.005). These findings should be interpreted in light of the sample size studied. The number of persons analyzed varied considerably between outcomes, with 5555–32 900 subjects per individual test. This variability is a consequence of the nature of the CHARGE consortium, which uses the data previously collected in the individual cohorts, long before the GWAS era. As a consequence, there were differences in the test batteries administered in each cohort, and some tests were available in a larger number of cohorts than others. Limitations in sample size may have prevented us from finding variants (false negatives) associated with some outcomes. To minimize the detection of false positives, we sought replication in independent studies.

This may also explain, in part, why rs17518584 was identified only in LDST/DSST, which had the largest discovery sample. The strongest association for this SNP in other traits was in letter fluency, with a P-value of 0.076 in the discovery meta-analysis, with all studies showing a positive effect of the T allele (as in LDST/DSST). This may reflect the influence of processing speed on fluency performance previously described in the literature.18 Our analyses lacked power to address genes with small effects affecting tests for which we had only a limited sample size. The lack of test-specific power should also be taken into account when interpreting the lack of association with candidate genes beyond APOE (DTNBP1, TRIB3 and WDR72). There was only one other intronic variant (rs2734839) in the DRD2 gene, encoding the D2 subtype of the dopamine receptor, that approached genome-wide significance. The bioinformatic analyses did not support a functional effect of the expression of the gene in the substantia nigra. This variant therefore remains to be replicated. A further limitation is that the cognitive phenotypes were based on single assessments and thus we were unable to determine genetic effects on age-related cognitive decline. Despite some limitations, this is the first study to discover and replicate a genetic variant involved in processing speed.

The present report provides the most comprehensive meta-analysis of processing speed and executive function GWAS to date. We found a genome-wide significant association between widely-used tests of processing speed (LDST/DSST) and a SNP in the CADM2 gene, which is involved in glutamatergic and GABA-ergic transmission, in middle-aged and older non-demented adults. This gene is a candidate for autism and personality, but based on the pathway and expression analyses it may also be relevant to a broad range of neuropsychiatric diseases including dementias.
