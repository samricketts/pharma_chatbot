Dear Professor Thomas Jacques,

We are pleased to read Professor Jellinger’s response to our work and his analyses in the Vienna autopsy cohort [1]. These data using expert ordinal ratings of pathology largely align with our analyses using digital histopathological methods and nicely emphasize the importance of tau pathology in Lewy body dementias (LBD). There were minor discrepancies between our study and data reported in the Vienna cohort. For example while Jellinger and his colleagues found relatively similar levels of tau burden between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and LBD+AD patients across hippocampal subfields, we found a similar distribution but greater overall hippocampal tau burden in AD versus LBD+AD. This divergence in findings may be due, in part, to differences in the composition of the patient cohorts in these heterogeneous disorders and differences in methodology of neuropathological assessment between studies. Nonetheless, we agree with Professor Jellinger that data from both studies provide converging evidence within the framework of human brain hippocampal microanatomy to suggest a synergistic interaction beween alpha-synuclein and tau pathology as seen in experimental models [2]. Future work will examine larger, multicentre cohorts using harmonized neuropathological assessments as these are developed and validated [3], and this multi-centre collaborative work can be importantly enhanced with the use of digitized samples and open-source image analysis tools [4, 5] that can be easily shared for replication of results.
