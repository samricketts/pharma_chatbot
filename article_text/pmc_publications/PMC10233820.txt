Ultrasound and microbubble are used for many medical applications nowadays. Scanning ultrasound can remove amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates in the mouse brain and restores memory in an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model. In vitro studies showed that amyloid fibrils are fragmented due to the ultrasound-induced bubble inertial cavitation, and ultrasonic pulses accelerate the depolymerization of Aβ fibrils into monomers at 1 μM of concentration. Under ultrasound applied, microbubble can be in a stable oscillating state or unstable inertial cavitation state. The latter occurs when ultrasound causes a dramatic change of bubble sizes above a certain acoustic pressure. We have developed and implemented a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation algorithm to the AMBER package, to facilitate the investigation on molecular mechanism of Aβ fibrillar dissociation under stable cavitation. Our results indicated that stable cavitation not only inhibited oligomeric formation, but also prevented the formation of β-rich oligomers. The network analysis of state transitions revealed that stable cavitation altered the oligomerization pathways of Aβ16–22 peptides. Our simulation tool may be applied to optimize the experimental conditions to achieve the best therapeutical effect.

Graphical Abstract


pmc1. INTRODUCTION

Amyloid aggregation plays a critical role in the pathology of several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease.1–4 The aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is a main cause of AD. Aβ aggregation produces soluble oligomers followed by insoluble fibrillar structures. Both Aβ oligomers and fibrils are toxic to human cells, and a body of evidence showed that the former is more toxic than the latter.5–7 Aβ fibrils are a main component of amyloid plaques which together with neurofibrillary tangles of Tau protein disrupt both internal and external neuron function and lead to cell death. Aβ oligomers are products of early Aβ aggregation state, oligomerization. They even occur before the first appearance of the disease’s symptom and instigate multiple facets of AD-neuropathology.5 Therefore, AD therapies targeting amyloid aggregation, particularly oligomerization, is of great interests.8, 9 The most popular approach focusing on amyloid aggregation study is to find good inhibitors to interfere with the aggregation process. Numerous screenings have been performed for discovery of Aβ aggregation inhibitors and the promising compounds have been tested in AD treatment.10–16 However, the screenings did not confirm whether an inhibitor could inhibit the amyloid oligomerization or not. Additionally, efficiently passing through blood brain barrier (BBB) is a grand challenge for the potential compounds to reach the site of action. Other approaches including ultrasound and infrared laser have been applied to clear toxic Aβ aggregates and shown promising results.17–20 However, it is still a long way to develop a practical therapy from these findings. Until today, there is still not any drug or physical therapies targeting amyloid oligomerization approved for AD treatment.

Ultrasound has many medical applications including diagnosis, surgery and therapy.21 The possible side effects of therapeutic ultrasound, including bioeffects, hazards, and safety, also have been considered in numerous studies.22 Recently, focused ultrasound (FUS) was proposed as a novel noninvasive therapeutic approach for AD.23 The application of FUS in AD treatment can be classified into three catalogs, FUS stimulation, FUS coupled with microbubbles (FUS-MB) for drug delivery, and FUS-MB alone. FUS stimulation uses low intensity pulsed ultrasound with 1–2 MHz of frequency transducers to target the whole brain, hemisphere, or the hippocampus. It could decrease the expression of Aβ peptide, increase cholinergic activity and expression of neurotrophic factors, resulting in improvements in cognitive function and memory in preclinical models of AD.24, 25 FUS-MB uses low intensity ultrasounds (with 0.5–1.7 MHz of frequency transducers and the acoustic pressure of 0.3–0.67 MPa) and microbubble (MB) to open the BBB, and facilitate the permeation of various large therapeutic agents into the brain.26–28 On the other hand, FUS-MB induced BBB opening alone could reduce Aβ and Tau burden, enhance cholinergic function and induce neurogenesis.29–31 Therefore, it can improve cognitive and memory deficits. However, ultrasound also showed different effects on amyloid aggregation in in vitro experiments. It was reported that ultrasound can accelerate the fibrillar formation of β2-Microglobulin, prion protein and Aβ peptide.32–34 On the other hand, it can also fragment Aβ fibrils into smaller fibrils and accelerate the depolymerization of fibrils into monomers at 1 μM concentration.34, 35 Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms beyond those observation, and then optimize practical guidance on using therapeutic ultrasound in AD treatment.

In FUS-MB application, when ultrasound is applied, microbubbles start oscillating at the ultrasound frequency. The bubble can be in stable vibrating state (stable cavitation), or unstable (inertial cavitation) if the ultrasound causes an acoustic pressure above a threshold. It is a challenge to gain insight on the mechanism of inertial and stable cavitations due to their tiny size and fragility by experimental means. In complement to experiment, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation allows us to investigate microscopic structures and dynamics with fine time and size resolutions. Different models have been proposed to study bubble nucleation and inertial cavitation,36–39 while only one method recently developed by us allowing simulating the stable bubble cavitation.18 In our method, a bubble is represented by a neutral particle with a small mass. The oscillation of the bubble which elicits the time-dependent Lennard-Jones interaction between the bubble and surrounding atoms is achieved by changing the size of bubble periodically. We have implemented our bubble model into the GROMACS software package,40 and applied for all-atom MD simulation studies.18, 41 In this work, we advanced the bubble model and implemented it into the AMBER software package.42 We applied the new function to study the effect of stable cavitation on Aβ16–22 oligomerization for the first time.

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Bubble model and implementation in AMBER

The bubble model has been implemented in GROMACS40 for all-atom MD simulations in our previous studies.18, 41 In our method, a bubble is modeled by a particle with a small mass (mbb) and without any charge. The bubble interacts with the surrounding atoms (waters and proteins) by a time-dependent Lennard-Jones potential as described by the following equation: (1) V[r,σ(t)]=c0[(σ(t)r)12− (σ(t)r)6]

Where r is the distance between the center of the bubble and the atoms of other molecules, and c0 is a force constant which is related to the depth of potential well. This potential prevents other molecules to approach the particle, creating an empty spherical space which mimics a bubble with a radius R(t)=σ(t). In this implementation, we controlled the activation of bubbles using parameter ivjbmod. If ivjbmod = 1 the bubbles are active (on), and if ivjbmod = 0 the bubbles are inactive (off). For multiple purposes of bubble simulation, we defined four bubble types. For the bubble type 1, the center of the bubble is represented by a particle, and the bubble size oscillates according to Equation 2. For the bubble type 2, the center of the bubble is represented by a particle, and the size of bubbles takes different values for different time ranges of MD simulation as the following sequence: in the time-range of 0 → t1, the bubble size is kept as Rmin; in the second time-range, t1 → t2, the size of the bubble linearly increases from Rmin to Rmax; and in the last time-range, t2 → the end of simulation, the bubble size is kept as Rmax. Bubble types 3 and 4 are virtual bubbles, and the bubble position is the center of three selected atoms of the simulation system. The size of bubble type 3 is controlled with the same function as the bubble type 1 is, and the size of bubble type 4 is controlled with the same function as the bubble type 2 is. In this study, we studied Aβ16–22 oligomerization using bubble type 1 (the oscillation mode), in which the stable expansion and contraction of the bubble is mimicked by a harmonic vibration equation of the time-dependent bubble radius described by equation 2: (2) R(t)=Rmax+Rmin2 − Rmax−Rmin2cos(ω(t−t0))

Where Rmax and Rmin are maximum and minimum size of the bubble, respectively. t0 is initial time of the bubble simulation. The amplitude of the bubble varies between Rmax and Rmin with the vibrational frequency f=1/τ=ω/2π. It is pointed out that only bubble type 1 was implemented in the GROMACS package, and all bubbles used the same set of parameters, {Rmax,Rmin,c0,t0,ω}. In this new implementation into AMBER20, the size of each bubble is individually controlled by a set of parameters, {Rmax,Rmin,c0,t0,ω,mbb}, which are read from an input file. To study the effect of ultrasound on Aβ16–22 oligomerization, we applied the following parameters, Rmax=0.6 nm, Rmin=0.2 nm, τ=50 ps and t0=0 ps, for the oscillation bubble type 1. For the bubble types 2 and 4, t1 and t2 correspond to t0 and τ of the oscillation mode respectively. More details and control parameters of bubble model were described in supporting information.

2.2 System Setup

To study the oligomerization of Aβ16–22 (ACE-KLVFFAE-NME) peptides, we first placed four Aβ16–22 monomers at the four vertices of a regular tetrahedron with the side length of 3.5 nm. The minimum distance between any two peptides is larger than 2 nm. The four-peptides then were put at the center of a truncated octahedral box, which has the volume of 409 nm3 and was solvated by about 12255 water molecules (Figure 1a). The peptide concentration is around 16.2 mM. A certain number of Cl− and Na+ ions were added into the system so that the NaCl concentration is about 0.15 M. We used the four peptides in a simulation system to study the formation of oligomers up to tetramer, which was believed to be the most toxic size of Aβ oligomers,43,44 while we try to keep a reasonable size of the system for carrying out the large-scale simulations. Additionally, the four peptides with regular tetrahedron design can provide a homogeneous system in a truncated octahedral box when applying periodic boundary condition in the simulation. For the purpose of sampling, we constructed 100 different four-peptide conformations and used as the initial structures for 100 independent MD runs. Note that the four monomers of a four-peptide structure were randomly selected from a monomeric databank containing 5000 Aβ16–22 monomers. To obtain the monomeric databank, we carried out a 100 ns NPT MD simulation of a monomer in explicit solvent and collected the 5000 monomeric structures from the last 50 ns to generate the databank. A four-peptide system with presence of bubble was built by randomly placing a bubble into the aforementioned four-peptide system (Figure 1b). We named a system with presence of bubble as a bubble-induced system and the one without bubble as a control system.

2.3 Molecular Dynamics Simulation Setting

All the molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using the pmemd.cuda module of the AMBER20 software package.42 The ff14SB force field45 and TIP3P water model46 were adopted to model protein and the explicit solvent, respectively. The periodic boundary condition was applied for all simulations. The long-range Coulomb interaction was evaluated by the Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) method,47 with a cutoff of 1.0 nm for the direct calculation and reciprocal summation. The van der Waals interactions were calculated using atom-based nonbonded lists, and utilized a scheme to correct the long-range interactions beyond the cutoff of 1.0 nm. The constant pressure simulations were carried out at 1 atm via the Berendsen barostat48 with the pressure relaxation time of 3.0 ps. Each system underwent the following sequential steps. First, the steepest descent minimization followed by a conjugate gradient minimization with the peptide atoms fixed at their initial positions, then unrestrained the steepest descent minimization followed by conjugate gradient minimization were carried out. The minimization steps were followed by a short MD simulation under constant volume while the system was heated from 0 K to 310 K with weak restraints on the protein atoms. Next, a Langevin dynamics at constant temperature (310 K) and constant pressure (1 atm) were carried out for 100 ps, after that the density of the system was found to be stable around 1.0 g/cm3. Finally, in the sampling phase, a 500 ns constant volume MD run at 310 K were performed using the leap-frog algorithm with a time step of 2 fs. The temperature was regulated using Langevin dynamics with a collision frequency of 1 ps−1. The SHAKE algorithm49 was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Conformations were saved every 10 ps for post-analysis. In total, 50,000 snapshots were saved from each MD trajectory.

2.4 Data Analysis

Basic Structural Parameters.

The secondary structure contents were classified into β, helix and random coil using the STRIDE algorithm.50,51 Here, the helix content includes 3–10 helix, π-helix and α-helix, the β one consists of extended residues, and the rest is random coil. The CPPTRAJ module52 was used to calculate the solvent accessible surface area (SASA), radius of gyration (Rg) and distances of interest. Intermolecular residue-residue interaction map was constructed using a 0.45 nm cutoff for the distance between a residue pair.

Free Energy Landscape (FEL).

The free-energy surface along the N-dimensional reaction coordination V1,2,3,…N is given by ΔG=−kBT[lnP(V)−lnPmax], where P(V) is the probability distribution described by the histogram representation of the MD data. Pmax, the maximum of distribution, is subtracted to ensure that the free energy ΔG has a minimum value of 0. The kB and T are Boltzmann constant and simulation temperature, respectively. In this study, we used sum of end-to-end distances (e2e) of the four peptides and sum of distances between center of mass of any peptide pair (c2c) as reaction coordinates for the two-dimensional FEL.

Oligomerization Pathway Analysis.

In the oligomerization of short Aβ peptides, the peptides first aggregate into oligomers, and the peptides of an oligomer then rearrange to form β-sheet structure. An oligomer can be characterized by number of oligomeric size (number of peptides in the oligomer) and β-sheet size (number of peptides in the β-sheet of the oligomer). Therefore, to investigate the oligomerization pathway of Aβ16–22 peptides, we classified the states of the four Aβ16–22 peptides into ten classes based on the oligomeric and β-sheet formation of the peptides (Figure 1). The oligomers were formed if at least two peptides are in contact in space. Two peptides are in contact if their distance is smaller than or equal to 0.3 nm. A dimeric oligomer is formed when two monomers are in contact state. Three monomers would be a trimeric oligomer when a dimer is formed and at least one peptide of the dimer is in “contact state” with the third monomer. A tetrameric oligomer would be established when a trimeric oligomer is formed and at least one peptide of the trimer is in “contact state” with the fourth monomer. The four Aβ16–22 peptides are in one of the ten states. In state I, the four peptides do not contact with each other, and there is not any oligomer in this state. In state II, there are only dimeric oligomers formed, but without β-sheet formation. In state III, the largest oligomer is dimer and there is at least one dimer having β-sheet structure formed. In state IV, a trimeric oligomer is formed, but without β-sheet formation. In state V, there is a trimeric oligomer formed with two peptides forming a β-strand structure. State VI contains a trimeric oligomer with all the three peptides forming β-strand structure. In the states VII, VIII, IX and X, the four peptides formed a tetrameric oligomer, accompanied by the different numbers of β-strands formed.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

An important requirement to an amyloid aggregation study using MD simulations is a convergence of conformational sampling. To satisfy this requirement, one can used enhance conformational sampling methods such as replica exchange MD and simulated tempering.53,54 However, these techniques do not allow for tracking the evolution of the aggregation directly. Thus, the aggregation pathways and kinetics, which are very important features of amyloid aggregation, cannot be obtained. On the other hand, conventional MD simulation allows us to easily track these aggregation characterizations. The limitation of the conventional MD simulation is that the system may be trapped in one of many local minima, leading to only single pathway and kinetics observed, thus the aggregation picture will not be fully described. To overcome this limitation, multiple long MD simulations starting from different initial structures should be used. We have applied this strategy in our previous amyloid aggregation studies, and successfully obtained interesting and insightful results.55–58 In this work, for each system, we performed one hundred 500 ns MD simulation trajectories using different initial structures. Our simulations reached equilibrium states after 200 ns (Figure 2 and Figure S1). Therefore, for most of statistical analysis, the data was collected from the last 300 ns of simulation and over all 100 trajectories. The convergence of sampling is assessed by comparing the distribution of three reaction coordinates (intermolecular interaction energy – IIE, radius of gyration – Rg and solvent accessible surface area – SASA) using three ensemble statistics with the last 300 ns (from 200 ns to 500 ns) of all 100 trajectories, with 220 ns spanning from 200 ns to 420 ns of all 100 trajectories and with the last 300 ns of 75 trajectories selected randomly from 100 trajectories (Figure S2). As seen, excellent agreements were observed between the results obtained using the three ensembles for the reaction coordinates. These results give us high confidence of the quality of the sampling and length of the trajectories, allowing us to discuss the impact of stable cavitation on the oligomerization of Aβ16–22 peptides.

3.1 Bubble stable cavitation inhibits Aβ16–22 oligomerization.

To assess the oligomerization of Aβ16–22 peptides with and without the presence of bubble stable cavitation, we first considered general structural parameters including radius of gyration − Rg, solvent accessible surface area − SASA, secondary structure contents, intermolecular residue-residue contact and intermolecular interaction energy − IIE of Aβ16–22 peptides. The time dependence of Rg, SASA, IIE and β-content of Aβ16–22 peptides in the two systems were shown in Figure 2, and the evolution of number of intermolecular residue-residue in-contact interaction (Nres-res), helix content, turn content and coil content were shown in Figure S1. As expected, those parameters dramatically changed in the first 50 ns of a MD simulation, and fluctuated around the equilibrium values in the last 300 ns. The time of the first Aβ16–22 dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric formations were at 2 ± 1, 10 ± 3, and 32 ± 7 ns for the control system, and 2 ± 1, 10 ± 3, and 28 ± 7 ns for the bubble-induced system. This result is consistent with our previous findings that Aβ peptide oligomerization happened fast at high concentrations.59 The parameter averages in the last 300 ns were shown in Table 1. The values of SASA and Rg of Aβ16–22 peptides in the control system were 33 ± 2 nm2 and 1.5 ± 0.2 nm, respectively, much smaller than the corresponding values of 38 ± 2 nm2 and 1.9 ± 0.2 nm in the bubble-induced system. Similarly, the values of Nres-res and IIE, 34 ± 5 and −162 ± 20 kcal/mol in control system, were much larger than those for the bubble induced system, which are 16 ± 3 and −81 ± 11 kcal/mol, respectively. As Nres-res is a measure of compactness of two peptides and larger value implies more residue pairs are in contact state, the much larger Nres-res value of the control system suggests that Aβ16–22 peptides form more compact structures in the control system than in the bubble induced system (Figure 3a). For the secondary structures, helix and turn contents were similar between the two systems, while the β content in control system was five times higher than that in bubble-induced system (Figure 2d). Nevertheless, the β propensity of each amino acid of Aβ16–22 peptides in the two systems followed a similar trend, which was V18 &gt; F19 &gt; L17 &gt; F20 &gt; A21 &gt; K16 &gt; E22 (Figure 3b).

Next, as shown in Figure 3c and 3d, we constructed free energy landscapes using two reaction coordinates, end-to-end (e2e) and center-to-center (c2c) distances. For a short Aβ peptide, the longer its e2e distance, the easier for the peptide to form strand structure (in β-sheet). For an oligomer, the c2c distance is inversely proportional to the compactness. The FELs of both systems had three local minima. Thus, we performed k-mean clustering analysis on the FELs data to obtain the centers of the minima and population sizes. For the control system, the minima were located at (5.6, 7.0), (5.3, 14.1) and (5.1, 19.1) and the corresponding population sizes were 55%, 27% and 18%. While for the bubble induced system, the minima were located at (5.1, 15.3), (5.1, 20.0) and (5.3, 8.9) with the corresponding population sizes of 38.9%, 31.4% and 29.7%. Note that the location of a local minimum takes a format of (e2e, c2c). This result showed that the peptides are more extended in the control system than in the bubble induced system as the former has larger e2e values; and oligomers is more compact in the control system than in the bubble induced system as the former has smaller c2c values. We also constructed intermolecular residue-residue interaction maps shown in Figure 3e and 3f. The pattern of the two maps was similar to each other and the interactions between L17, V18, F19 and F20 residues are stronger than the other residue pairs. However, as to an individual residue pair, the two residues in contact interaction occurs more frequently in the control system than in the bubble induced system. Those results suggested that bubble stable cavitation not only interferes with the Aβ16–22 oligomerization, but also inhibits Aβ16–22 β-sheet formation.

3.2 Impact of the bubble stable cavitation on the Aβ16–22 oligomerization pathways.

In a self-assembly of Aβ peptides, the peptides aggregate into none-β-sheet oligomers in the early phase, then the oligomeric peptides re-arrange to form β-sheet structures in the later phase. To depict the oligomerization pathways, we have defined ten aggregation states formed by the four Aβ16–22 peptides (Figure 1). Note that, among the oligomeric states (II→X), II (dimer), IV (trimer) and VII (tetramer) states are none-β-sheet structural oligomers, while the other states are β structural oligomers. The population sizes of the ten states and the transitions between the states in the two systems were shown in Figure 4, which were summarized for all MD snapshots collected from 100 MD trajectories for each system. Similar figures, but for individual trajectories, were shown in Figures S3 and S4. It was shown that the bubble stable cavitation had strongly impact on the oligomerization pathways as the population sizes and transitions were very different between the two systems. The population of monomeric state (I) was two times larger in the bubble induced system than in the control system, while the population of the largest oligomer, i.e., tetramer (VII, VIII, IX and X states) was much higher in the control system than in the bubble-induced system. In other words, bubble stable cavitation inhibited oligomeric formation of Aβ16–22 peptides. For a given oligomer, the β/none-β sheet population ratios in the control system were much larger than that in the bubble-induced system. In the control system, the β/none-β sheet population ratios were 0.18 for dimer, 0.4 for trimer, and 0.76 for tetramer. While in the bubble-induced system, the ratios were 0.07, 0.08, and 0.13 for dimer, trimer and tetramer, respectively. It clearly showed that bubble stable cavitation interfered with the rearrangement of peptides in an oligomer into β-sheet structures. The transition frequency between two states was different from one state pair to another, and from one system to another. In the control system, the most occurring state transitions were from IV→V, VII→VII, and VIII→IX, which are from none-β sheet to β-sheet oligomeric transitions. While in the bubble induced system, the most occurring state transitions were from I→II, II→IV and IV→VII, which are none-β sheet to none-β sheet transitions. This result pointed out that during 500 ns of simulation, the early phase of the Aβ16–22 oligomerization in the control system were short, and the peptides spent much more time on the later phase. In contrast, in the bubble-induced system, the peptides spent much more time on the early phase, and the none-β sheet oligomers was unstable and easily broken into monomer and smaller oligomers. The ten oligomeric states were further characterized by the reaction coordinates including SASA, Nres-res, potential energy and IIE. As shown in Figure 5, for the same state from II to X, the oligomers in the bubble induced system have higher potential energy and IIE, larger SASA and smaller Nres-res than the corresponding ones of oligomers in the control system. Those data suggested that the oligomers formed in the control system are more stable than the oligomers in the bubble-induced system.

There are many oligomerization pathways for peptides go from state I to state X, which are constructed by the combination of the following transitions, I→II, II→III, II→IV, II→VII, III→V, IV→V, IV→VII, V→VI, V→VIII, VI→IX, VII→VIII, VII→IX, VIII→IX, VIII→X and IX→X. The probability of a transition between two states depends on the potential energy difference of the two states. The probability of the transition from State i to State j can be estimated by the following equation: Pij=min{1,e−ΔEij/kbT}, where ΔEij=Ej−Ei. If Ej is lower than Ei, the Pij ~ 1. If Ej is higher than Ei, the Pij=e−ΔEij/kbT. Therefore, the smaller |ΔEij| is, the higher the probability of the transition from a low energy state to a high energy state. Therefore, the frequency of i and j state transition is proportional to |ΔEij|. This can be applied to explain the difference of the state transitions as well as oligomerization pathways of the Aβ16–22 peptides in the two system. For example, the |ΔEij| of I→II, II→IV and IV→VII state pairs were 42.8, 74.5 and 118.3 kcal/mol in the bubble-induced system, which are smaller than the corresponding |ΔEij| in the control system, which were 60.8, 104.5 and 175.2 kcal/mol, respectively. As such, the frequencies of I→II, II→IV and IV→VII state transitions in the bubble induced system were higher than that ones in the control system (Figure 5). In contrast, for the cases of IV→V, VII→VIII and VIII→IX state transitions, the |ΔEij| in the control system (28.5, 14.9 and 26 kcal/mol) were smaller than the |ΔEij| in the bubble induced system (29.8, 30.5 and 35.3 kcal/mol). Therefore, the frequencies of IV→V, VII→VIII and VIII→IX state transitions in the control system were higher than in the bubble induced system (Figure 4).

Yumiko et al. showed that the fibril formation of β2-Microglobulin was speeded up by ultrasound, because the ultrasound can induce amyloid nucleation.32 The concentration of β2-Microglobulin monomer was 25 μM in Yumiko et al.’s experiment. As for Aβ peptide, Hisashi et al. pointed out that ultrasonic pulses accelerated spontaneous fibrillation when the peptide concentration was above 1 μM, while it also accelerated the depolymerization of fibrils into monomers at or below 1 μM.34 Hisashi et al.’s result indicated ultrasound can inhibit Aβ aggregation at low monomeric concentrations of Aβ peptides. On the other side, FUS stimulation and FUS-MB treatment provided positive results as they can increase cholinergic activity and expression of neurotrophic factors.23–26, 29–31 Particularly, FUS-MB treatment could reduce Aβ and Tau burden in the brain of AD rodent model.29–31,60 Charissa et al. found that single FUS-MB treatment significantly reduced Aβ plaque volume at two days post-sonication. Youngsun et al. showed that repeated FUS-MB treatments reduced Aβ deposits in the entire brain as well as targeted regions, increased solute Aβ to the CSF space, and enhanced CSF Aβ drainage. Although some different mechanisms of the therapeutic effects have been proposed,29–31,60 these results also implied that ultrasound, especially stable cavitation, could interfere with the aggregation of Aβ peptides in the brain, in which the peptide concentration is in nanomolar range. To our best knowledge, none of study, which considers the effect of stable cavitation on amyloid oligomerization, has been performed yet.

To observe the stable cavitation in a reasonable simulation time scale, we used the bubble with the equilibrium radius of 0.4 nm, and the vibrational frequency of 20 GHz (τ = 0.05 ns). These values are different from those in FUS-MB studies: microbubble has the radii ranging from 0.5 to 4 μm, and ultrasound frequency is from 0.5 to 2 MHz (τ in range of 2000–500 ns). We acknowledge that current computer power does not allow us to perform all-atom simulations at the μs timescale to simulate at least several ultrasound cycles with at least one real bubble inside of large simulation box with a size of several μm. Nevertheless, despite the significant difference between our parameters and experiments, our previous study showed that the mechanism should be same in case that the bubble cavitation exerts shear stress on surrounding objects.18 And the Rayleigh-Plesset Equation,61–63 which was derived from the first principles to describe the bubble cavitation in liquids in terms of macroscopic hydrodynamics, still well describes the dynamics of sub-nano bubbles in term of inertial, surface tension, and viscosity.41 Therefore, our bubble model should be sufficiently accurate to represent stable cavitations in experiment. On the other side, assuming the Aβ concentration (Cp) in FUS-MB experiment is about 100 nM (Aβ concentration in the brain is approximately in nM range) and the ultrasound frequency (fUS) is 1 MHz. we have the ratio, fUS/CP≈107 Hz/μM, in the experiment. Hisashi et al.’s result in vitro implied ultrasound with 20 kHz of frequency can inhibit Aβ aggregation at Aβ concentration equal or lower than 1 μM.34 The ratio fUS/CP in Hisashi et al.’s work is greater than 2*104 Hz/μM. From these results, we may hypothesis that ultrasound can inhibit Aβ aggregation if the ratio fUS/CP is greater than 2*104 Hz/μM. In our bubble simulation, our stable cavitation has 20 GHz of vibration frequency and the concentration of Aβ peptide was 16.2 mM. The ratio fUS/CP in our bubble simulation is about 106 Hz/μM that is greater than 2*104 Hz/μM. Thus, for the practice in investigating the impact of stable cavitation on Aβ oligomerization with available computational resource, our simulation parameters including bubble size, ultrasound frequency and Aβ concentration are reasonable and sufficient for this proof-of-concept study. Of course, our finding will need confirmations by future experiment. Next, we will find the correspondence between the simulation parameters and FUS experimental parameters, to pave the road of applying molecular simulations to optimize the FUS-MB experimental protocol.

3.3 Applications of bubble simulation

Microbubbles and nanobubbles have small size and many special characteristics such as high bioactivity, low rising velocity, decreased friction drags, high internal pressure, large gas dissolution capacity, and ability to be crushed and form free radicals.64 They have wide applications in many fields such as engineering, agriculture, environment, food, particularly biomedical diagnosis and therapy.64 In medicine, microbubbles and nanobubbles have shown a great potential for the growth of applications in drug delivery, systemic gene delivery, theranostic in oncology, and the treatments of ocular diseases and dementia.26,27,65–69 Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of effects and interactions of the bubbles to biological agents is a great interest since it can provide fundamental knowledge to improve and optimize their applications as well as growing application range. However, this task is a challenge to experiment due to tiny size and fragility of the bubbles. Fortunately, computational approaches such as MD simulation can complement to experiment to gain insight into the mechanisms. Many bubble simulations have been carried out to study inertial cavitations, in which the bubbles were modelled by empty spheres.70–76 However, these empty bubble models have the following limitations. First, the bubbles are not stable and will collapse in a short time of equilibrium simulation. Second, researchers need a good programing/coding skill to design study systems since they need to write their own code to remove waters in the bubble space and change topological files to run the simulation. Finally, these empty bubble models can not be used to represent stable cavitations, which participate in many biological phenomena with ultrasound. Interestingly, our developed bubble model can simulate stable cavitation, easily. Before this work, we have applied bubble simulation of stable cavitation (bubble type 1) to investigate the amyloid fibrils dissociation by bubble cavitation, the molecular mechanism of the cell membrane pore formation induced by bubble stable cavitation.18,77,78 Another possible application of bubble types 1 or 3 simulation is to study the effect of stable cavitation on ion channel, which is one of mechanisms of focused ultrasound for neuromodulation,79 as shown in Figure S5. The simulation using our bubble types 2 or 4 can also create empty bubbles that are used to model inertial cavitations. For example, one first can run bubble type 2 or 4 in the simulation to get a given bubble size. Then, the simulation is performed with bubble mode turn off for the inertial cavitation.

Although bubble simulations have a broad range of applications to complement to experimental studies, they also have limitations due to the significant differences of parameters/conditions between the simulation and experiment. Therefore, designing system and choosing suitable parameters/conditions of simulation for a given study purpose should be seriously taken into account. For example, in this work, we performed bubble simulation to complement to FUS-MB experiment that reduced the deposit of Aβ aggregates in the target regions of the brain. We designed four-peptide systems with and without present of stable cavitation. Our system design not only kept a reasonable size of system for performing large-scale simulation, but also allowed us to investigate the oligomerization of Aβ peptides. Additionally, bubble vibration frequency and Aβ concentration in our bubble simulation had a suitable fUS/CP ratio, at which stable cavitation can inhibit Aβ aggregation based on experimental indication. Moreover, these simulation parameters, concentration and frequency, allowed us to perform the study with a reasonable computational resource. On the other side, we carried out NVT simulation instead NPT one since the later one may interfere with the effect of ultrasound at the time the pressure was coupled. However, NPT simulation for stable cavitation can still work if the time of pressure coupling is much greater than the period of the bubble vibration. Importantly, we used a small size of the bubble (0.4 nm) and amplitude of the bubble vibration (0.4 nm), resulting in the volume change between the maximum and minimum size of the bubble is very small, 0.87 nm3 (~ 0.2% of the system volume). Therefore, the bubble simulation can avoid an artificial pressure due to the constant volume of the NVT simulation.

4. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have advanced a bubble model and implemented it into the AMBER software package. Each bubble is controlled by its own parameter set to achieve stable cavitation in all-atom simulations. We utilized this new tool investigating the effect of stable cavitation on Aβ16–22 oligomerization. Our result showed that stable cavitation strongly interfered with the oligomerization and inhibited the β-sheet formation of Aβ16–22 peptides. This finding revealed the underlying mechanisms of FUS-MB therapies for AD treatment and facilitated researchers to establish experimental protocols through molecular simulations to effectively interfere with amyloid aggregation utilizing FUS-MB.
