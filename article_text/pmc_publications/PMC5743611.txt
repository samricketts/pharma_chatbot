Regulation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by α and β-secretases is of special interest to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as these proteases prevent or mediate Aβ formation, respectively. Neuroinflammation is also implicated in AD. Our data demonstrate that the endogenous mediator of inflammation prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) promotes full-length APP (FL-APP) processing by α and β-secretases. The decrease in FL-APP was independent of proteasomal, lysosomal, calpain, caspase, and γ-secretase activities. Moreover, PGJ2-treatment promoted cleavage of secreted APP, specifically sAPPα and sAPPβ, generated by α and β-secretase, respectively. Notably, PGJ2-treatment induced caspase-dependent cleavage of sAPPβ. Mechanistically, PGJ2-treatment selectively diminished mature (O and N-glycosylated) but not immature (N-glycosylated only) FL-APP. PGJ2-treatment also increased the overall levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation, which occurs within the nucleocytoplasmic compartment. It is known that APP undergoes O-GlcNAcylation and that the latter protects proteins from proteasomal degradation. Our results suggest that by increasing protein O-GlcNAcylation levels, PGJ2 renders mature APP less prone to proteasomal degradation, thus shunting APP toward processing by α and β-secretases.

Introduction

Neuroinflammation is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of AD (Glass et al., 2010;Heneka et al., 2015). Cyclooxygenases play a central role in neuroinflammation by converting arachidonic acid into prostaglandins (Aoki and Narumiya, 2012). COX-2 induction correlates with AD severity and neurodegeneration (Liang et al., 2007;Wyss-Coray and Rogers, 2012). COX-1 is also involved in AD pathology (Choi et al., 2013). In the brain, cyclooxygenases mediate the production of prostaglandins D2, E2 and J2 (Liang et al., 2007;Ricciotti and FitzGerald, 2011). PGD2 is the most abundant prostaglandin in the brain, and increases the most under pathological conditions (Hertting and Seregi, 1989; Ricciotti et al., 2011). The levels and capacity to form PGD2 are significantly higher in the frontal cortex of AD brains than in controls (Iwamoto et al., 1989), supporting a role for PGD2 in AD.

PGD2 has a half-life of ~1.1 min in the brain, and is converted to PGJ2 by spontaneous dehydration (Suzuki et al., 1986). PGJ2 is highly neurotoxic (Li et al., 2004b), and mediates PGD2 neurotoxicity (Liu et al., 2013b). PGJ2-treatment up-regulates COX-2, initiating a positive feedback loop with potential long term effects (Aoki et al., 2012; Li et al., 2004a). PGJ2 binds covalently to proteins through its α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group (Uchida and Shibata, 2008). Thus, local concentrations of PGJ2 are potentially higher (Liu et al., 2013b). PGJ2 is also upregulated in motor neurons of ALS patients (Kondo et al., 2002;Zhang et al., 2010).

Prostaglandins are present in body fluids in the pico to nanomolar range reaching low micromolar levels at local sites of acute inflammation (Hertting et al., 1989; Offenbacher et al., 1986). In particular, plasma levels of 15d-PGJ2 increased 12-fold and 23-fold in patients following acute stroke or with vascular risk factors and atherothrombotic infarcts, respectively (Blanco et al., 2005). Like its PGD2 precursor, PGJ2 and its metabolites can be considered some of the most abundant prostaglandins in the brain (Katura et al., 2010). In rodents, upon stroke and traumatic brain injury the in vivo concentration of free PGJ2 in the brain increases from almost undetectable to the 100nM range (Liu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013a). However, PGJ2 binds covalently to proteins through its α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group (Uchida et al., 2008), therefore reported levels of free PGJ2 do not represent its total amounts. In addition, PGJ2 is uptaken by cells via a carrier-mediated active transport, ending up in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Narumiya and Fukushima, 1986). In contrast, PGD2 and PGE2 are not taken up by cells (Narumiya et al., 1986). In conclusion, the reported in vivo PGJ2 levels represent average brain concentrations, but it is predicted that local cellular and intracellular concentrations of PGJ2 and its metabolites are much higher (Liu et al., 2013b).

PGJ2 has a short half-life so the extent of its levels in AD is unclear. However, PGJ2 induces neuronal dysfunction (reviewed in (Figueiredo-Pereira et al., 2015;Yagami et al., 2017)). In relation, PGJ2 induces caspase activation and caspase-mediated cleavage of tau, generating aggregation prone Δtau in neuronal cells (Arnaud et al., 2009;Metcalfe et al., 2012). The latter seeds tau aggregation prior to neurofibrillary tangle formation (de Calignon et al., 2010;Gamblin et al., 2003). These data suggest that inflammation mediated by PGJ2 contributes to some aspects of AD pathology, in particular neuronal apoptosis and tau aggregation. In the current studies we investigated whether PGJ2 affects APP processing.

APP is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with most of its full-length present in the exoplasmic space. APP has three main isoforms, comprising 695, 751 or 770 residues (Zhang et al., 2011). APP695 is predominantly expressed in neurons (Zheng and Koo, 2006). APP is primarily processed (~90%) by the non-amyloidogenic α-secretase, and to a lesser extent by the amyloidogenic β-secretase (Placido et al., 2014). APP processing within the Aβ domain by α-secretase releases a free sAPPα ectodomain excluding Aβ formation (Zhang et al., 2011). APP processing by β-secretase releases sAPPβ and generates a C99 fragment that is additionally cleaved by γ-secretase to generate Aβ (Zhang et al., 2012).

APP plays a critical role in AD pathology as it is the precursor of Aβ that accumulates in senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits, which are hallmarks of the disease (Ghiso et al., 2014). Since Aβ accumulation correlates with increased inflammation in AD brains (Kotilinek et al., 2008;Niranjan, 2013), we investigated how prostaglandins D2, J2 and E2 alter APP processing in rat primary neuronal cultures and in SY5Y neuroblastoma cells overexpressing human APP. From the three prostaglandins, PGJ2 induced the most significant changes by promoting APP cleavage by α and β-secretases. Our studies identify potential APP-processing mechanisms that link neuroinflammation mediated by PGJ2 to AD pathophysiology.

2.2. Cell cultures

Primary cerebral cortical cultures: Dissociated cultures from Sprague Dawley rat embryonic (E18, both sexes) cerebral cortical neurons were prepared as in (Kiprowska et al., 2017) and plated (6×106 cells/10 cm dish, or 2.5×105 cells/well on 24-well plates, cell viability only). Cultures were maintained in Neurobasal media supplemented with 2% B27 and 0.5 mM L-Glutamax. Half of the medium was changed every 4 days. Experiments were performed at 7 DIV. Neurobasal medium contains several proprietary factors that ensure a mostly pure (&gt; 95%) neuronal culture; glial growth is inhibited without a need for the anti-mitotic agent arabinofuranosyl cytidine (Brewer et al., 1993;Nam et al., 2007). APP-SY5Y cells: SH-SY5Y are human derived neuroblastoma cells with neuron-like properties. The APP-SY5Y (obtained from Dr. N. Robakis) were stably transfected to overexpress wild type human APP695 (Pangalos et al., 1995). Cultures were maintained in a 1:1 ratio ATCC-formulated MEM growth media (Life Technologies, cat#11095-080) and F12 (Life Technologies, cat# 11765-054) supplemented with 1X Non-essential amino acids (Corning Cellgro, cat# 25-025-Cl), 1mM sodium Pyruvate (Corning Cellgro, cat# 25-000-Cl), 1.5g/L Sodium Bicarbonate (Corning, cat# 25-035-Cl), 5% FBS (RMBI), and 1% pen/strep (Invitrogen, cat#15140-122). All cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

2.3. Culture treatments

Cortical neurons were treated acutely (4 h, 8 h, 16 h or 24 h) by adding DMSO (vehicle control) or different drugs (dissolved in DMSO) directly to DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mM L-Glutamax and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen) in the absence of serum. APP-SY5Y cells were treated similarly, except that the drugs were added directly into their respective growth medium with all the components excluding 5% FBS. The final DMSO concentration in the medium was 0.5% for all cells.

2.4. Western blotting

After treatment, cells were harvested as in (Kiprowska et al., 2017). Following lysis (overnight at −80°C), cell extracts were centrifuged (19,000×g for 10 min) at 4°C. Protein concentration (NP40-soluble supernatants) were determined with the BCA assay. Western blot analysis was carried out following SDS-PAGE as in (Kiprowska et al., 2017), with 20 μg to 30 μg of protein loaded/lane. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) then probed with the respective antibodies, and antigens visualized by a standard chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase method with the ECL reagent. Semi-quantitative analysis of protein detection was done by densitometry and image analysis with the ImageJ program (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U.S. NIH, Maryland, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/, 1997–2006).

2.5. Cell viability assay

Cell viability was assessed with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described (Mosmann, 1983). MTT is reduced largely within the cytoplasm of most cells (Berridge and Tan, 1993;Liu et al., 1997).

2.6. RT-PCR analysis

Total RNA was isolated from rat E18 cortical neurons with the RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen). Endpoint RT-PCR: RT-PCR was performed with 1μg RNA using the Qiagen® Onestep RT-PCR Kit. The cycling parameters were: 50°C for 30 min, 95°C for 15 min, 94°C for 1 min 63°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2. 5 min for 35 cycles using the BioRad C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler. PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels and quantified using Image J. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR): Total RNA (1μg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA with the All-in-One™ First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (GeneCopoeia). The quantitative analysis of the cDNAs was performed using the All-in-One™ qPCR Mix Kit (GeneCopoeia) in an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system with cycling parameters of 95°C for 15 min, 95 °C for 15 sec, 63°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 35 sec for 40 cycles. Previously described rat primers for APP and GAPDH (Sandbrink et al., 1994) were used for both RT-PCR analyses: APPsense (sr841): 5′-GAGTCTGTGGAGGAGGTAGTCC-3′

APPantisense (αr1970): 5′-CTTCTGTCTTGATGTTTGTCAACC-3′

GAPDHsense: 5′ATGGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACG-3′

GAPDHantisense: 5′-GTTGTCATGGATGACCTTGGC-3′

For both RT-PCR analyses, PCR products were 928bp for APP and 495bp for GAPDH. APP values were normalized to GAPDH.

2.7. O-Deglycosylation analysis

Total proteins (30 μg) from the NP40-soluble supernatants obtained from the rat cortical cultures were deglycosylated at their O-glycosylation sites by O-glycosidase in conjunction with neuraminidase (New England Biolabs, cat# E0540S) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Upon completion of the assay, normalized samples were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer and loaded onto gels (30 μg of protein/lane). Following SDS-PAGE, western blot analysis was carried out as described above. The membranes were probed with antibodies for full length APP.

2.8. Secreted APP (sAPP) analysis

We assess the levels of sAPPα and sAPPβ produced by SY5Y neuroblastoma cells overexpressing APP695 (APP-SY5Y). Following the respective treatments, the cell culture medium (8 ml) from each 10 cm dish was collected, SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.2%, and the media was boiled for 10 min. The conditioned media were centrifuged at 1000×g for 2 min to remove any cell debris and then on Amicon Ultra 30K centrifugal filter devices at 3200×g for 40 min. The resulting 135 μl concentrates were normalized for protein, and prepared for western blot analysis (20μg of protein per sample) as described above. The membranes were probed with antibodies for sAPPα and sAPPβ.

2.9. Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 ELISAs

Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 ELISA kits were obtained from Invitrogen and the assay was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. APP-SY5Y cells were incubated in serum-free medium with PGJ2 for 16 h, and medium was collected and concentrated. Normalized cell lysates and conditioned media were then incubated in the ELISA plate overnight. A horseradish peroxidase–labeled anti-rabbit antibody was added, followed by a substrate, and the color change was recorded in a spectrophotometer.

2.10. Immunostaining

Primary neurons were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 37°C, rinsed three times with cold PBS, and incubated for 30 min in 100% methanol. Following a rinse with cold PBS, the neurons were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, as the blocking buffer. Subsequently, neurons were incubated overnight at 4°C with the respective primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer, and washed with PBS four times (5 min each). The neurons were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000) and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1000) diluted in blocking buffer. After several washes, the slides were cover slipped with Vectashield mounting media containing DAPI and analyzed under a Zeiss Fluorescence Axio Imager using AxioVision Rel 4.8 software.

For immunofluorescence quantification, exposure time per channel was kept constant among sections. For each captured image, ZVI files were loaded onto Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Each channel was analyzed to a threshold between 1–2 standard deviations from the mean intensity to isolate the positive signal from each image. Pixel areas meeting threshold intensity criteria, per square micron, were measured in each image crop.

2.11. Statistical analysis

Statistical significance was estimated using the Student t-test or one-way ANOVA (Tukey or Bonferroni multiple comparison test) with the Prism 6 program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

3. Results

3.1. PGJ2 more effectively decreased full length (FL) APP protein levels than PGD2 or PGE2, without altering APP mRNA levels

We compared the effects of PGJ2, D2 and E2 on FL-APP levels upon treatment for 24h in rat primary cortical cultures. FL-APP was detected as three bands (Fig. 1A). The lowest band corresponds to immature FL-APP that is N-glycosylated, and the two highest bands depict N- and O-glycosylated FL-APP (Saito et al., 2013) (scheme, Fig. 1A). While 10 μM PGJ2 diminished mature (N and O-glycosylated) APP levels by 54%, immature (N-glycosylated) FL-APP was decreased by less (30%). PGD2 showed a similar trend, but at higher concentrations (15 μM and 30 μM). PGE2 (75 μM) induced the lowest changes of all. We tested PGE2 at the 75 μM concentration, because in earlier studies (Li et al., 2004b) we compared a 20 μM to 75 μM range of PGE2 concentrations, and 75 μM PGE2 was the most neurotoxic. We also included the drug CAY10410 (CAY) in our analysis to address the mechanism by which PGJ2 induces its effect. CAY is a PGJ2 analog that binds to the PPARγ receptor but lacks the reactive cyclopentenone ring, thus it is unable to form Michael adducts by binding covalently to proteins (Shibata et al., 2003). CAY did not change any of the FL-APP forms, indicating that the PGJ2 effect is PPARγ-independent.

From all the compounds tested, 10 μM PGJ2 manifested the greatest neurotoxicity (31%), followed by 75 μM PGE2 (18%), while PGD2 and CAY exhibited no significant toxicity at the concentrations tested (Fig. 1B). Since PGJ2 induced the most significant changes in FL-APP levels and neuronal viability, we decided to focus on the effects of PGJ2 in all subsequent experiments.

PGJ2 decreased FL-APP protein levels in a time and dose-dependent manner. Treatment with 10 μM PGJ2 for 16h (Fig. 1C) decreased mature and immature FL-APP levels by ~72% and 30%, respectively. Longer incubations (24h) caused a similar trend, while shorter time points (4h and 8h) caused only minor changes. The time course of the loss in cell viability caused by 10 μM PGJ2 (Fig. 1D) coincided with the decrease in FL-APP levels, as it was significant by 16h (31%) but not at earlier time points.

Mature FL-APP levels (Fig. 1E) and cell viability (Fig. 1F) were significantly diminished upon treatment with 10 μM PGJ2 for 16h. However, PGJ2 concentrations lower than 10 μM failed to decrease the levels of mature FL-APP and cell viability except for 1 μM PGJ2, which showed a tendency to increase the levels of mature FL-APP.

The decline in FL-APP protein levels induced by PGJ2 was not due to a decrease in APP transcription. Endpoint RT-PCR analysis showed that 16h incubations with PGJ2 concentrations ranging from 1 μM to 20 μM did not significantly alter APP mRNA levels (Fig. 1G). Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the ratio of APP mRNA/GAPDH mRNA was not statistically different when normalized to the control value (Fig. 1E).

Together, these data show that PGJ2 selectively alters the protein levels of mature FL-APP, which is N and O-glycosylated, with very minor changes in immature N-glycosylated FL-APP. The decline in mature FL-APP correlates with the loss of cell viability.

3.2. The decline in mature FL-APP levels induced by PGJ2 is independent of proteasomal, lysosomal, caspase and calpain-mediated degradation

The low levels of mature FL-APP detected upon PGJ2 treatment could be related to increased FL-APP degradation by cellular proteases, known to affect FL-APP levels (Haass et al., 2012;Nixon, 2003). To address this premise, we pre-treated for 30 min the cortical neurons with proteasomal (epoxomicin, Epox, 5 nM), calpain (calpeptin, Cpt, Z-LNle-CHO, 20 μM), pan caspase (Casp, Z-VAD-FMK, 20 μM), and lysosomal (chloroquine, CQ, 10 μM) inhibitors prior to 10 μM PGJ2 treatment (16h). As shown in Fig. 2A, none of these protease inhibitors prevented the reduction of mature FL-APP levels induced by PGJ2.

Mature and immature FL-APP levels were increased by at least 60% in neuronal cultures treated with chloroquine plus PGJ2 compared to PGJ2 alone. However, the highly specific proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin did not significantly alter the levels of FL-APP in control and PGJ2-treated neuronal cultures. These data support that a certain percentage of the FL-APP degradation is mediated by lysosomes (Zhang and Song, 2013) but not by the proteasome pathway.

We also assessed the effect of the listed protease inhibitors on the C-terminal fragment (CTF) of FL-APP using an antibody raised against the last 20 residues of APP695. Calpeptin alone or in combination with PGJ2 was one of two inhibitors that stabilized CTF-APP (Fig. 2B). Chloroquine by itself also stabilized CTF-APP but to a minor extent compared to calpeptin. Previous studies support that calpeptin increases CTF-APP levels, suggesting that calpain activity regulates FL-APP cell surface distribution (Mathews et al., 2002). In conclusion, the decline in mature FL-APP induced by PGJ2 is not mediated by any of the proteases tested.

3.3. The decline in mature FL-APP levels induced by PGJ2 is mimicked by treatment with a β-secretase inhibitor but not by α or γ-secretase inhibitors

To further address the mechanism by which PGJ2 downregulates the levels of mature FL-APP (right scheme, Fig. 3A), the neuronal cultures were pre-treated for 30 min with β-secretase inhibitor II (BACE1-2, Z-VLL-CHO, 1 μM), α-secretase inhibitor TAPI-2 (10 μM), or γ-secretase inhibitor BMS 299897 (GSI, 0.5 μM) prior to the 10 μM PGJ2 treatment (16h). None of the secretase inhibitors prevented the PGJ2-induced reduction in mature FL-APP levels (Fig. 3A).

Each inhibitor on its own exerted different effects on FL-APP. The α-secretase inhibitor increased all three forms of glycosylated FL-APP (Fig. 3A) by 85% (mature, top), 49% (mature, middle), and 31% (immature), supporting its role as the major secretase for APP processing under non-stress conditions (Placido et al., 2014). The γ-secretase inhibitor had no significant effect on FL-APP levels (Fig. 3A), but was the only one that stabilized the C-terminal fragment of APP (CTF-APP, Fig. 3B, left scheme, Fig. 3A). This confirms the γ-secretase function, which is to cleave within the CTF-APP, as its inhibition increases CTF-APP levels. In Fig. 3B, the samples were run on a 4% to 20% gradient gel to capture the 15 kDa CTF-APP. Thus, under the latter conditions, FL-APP is detected as one band corresponding to its three glycosylated forms. In contrast, the three glycosylated forms of FL-APP are detected, when samples are run on a 5% gel (Fig. 3A).

Just like PGJ2, the β-secretase inhibitor alone significantly reduced mature but not immature FL-APP levels (Fig. 3A). Moreover, β-secretase levels were not altered by PGJ2 treatment (Fig. 3C). As α and β-secretases can compete for the same pool of FL-APP (Vassar et al., 1999), we postulate that β-secretase inhibition will increase FL-APP cleavage by α-secretase, thus mimicking in part the PGJ2-effect.

It is clear that the decrease in mature FL-APP induced by PGJ2 is independent of γ-secretase activity, as its inhibitor did not prevent the decline in mature FL-APP. We did not assess endogenous sAPPα and sAPPβ levels in the conditioned media from rat primary neuronal cultures because of the lack of specific antibodies for each of the rodent sAPP forms. To detect sAPPα and sAPPβ we conducted studies with human neuroblastoma (SY5Y) cells that overexpress APP695, which are shown below in Fig. 6.

3.4. PGJ2 increases the levels of O-GlcNAcylated proteins

The majority of APP processing by α, β and γ-secretases occurs following O-glycosylation (Saito et al., 2013;Tomita et al., 1998). Thus, we reasoned that PGJ2 may promote FL-APP processing by altering its level of glycosylation. We first confirmed that the three detected forms of FL-APP corresponded to glycosylated APP. The rat primary neuronal cultures were treated with tunicamycin (Tunic., 2 μM), which blocks protein N-linked glycosylation (Esko and Bertozzi, 2009). Although tunicamycin decreased the levels of all glycosylated FL-APP forms, the decline was significant only for the mature (middle) band in cultures treated with tunicamycin combined with PGJ2 (Fig. 4A). Tunicamycin causes ER stress (Liu et al., 2014), and under these conditions FL-APP seems to be turned over by the proteasome (Hare, 2006). Hence, it is not surprising that FL-APP levels are lower upon tunicamycin treatment than in controls.

The neuronal cultures were also treated with brefeldin A (Bref., 15 μM), which significantly raised the levels of all glycosylated FL-APP forms ranging between 131% and 188% compared to controls (Fig. 4A). These higher levels of glycosylated APP reflect the effect of Bref., which induces the retrograde transport of Golgi proteins into the ER, leading to their ER accumulation (Klausner et al., 1992). As Bref. also blocks ER to Golgi protein trafficking, the N-glycosylated APP is the major form detected upon Bref. treatment (Fig. 4A, lighter exposure). In addition, unglycosylated FL-APP was obvious only in Bref. treated neurons (Fig. 4A). The higher levels of FL-APP (unglycosylated and glycosylated) detected in Bref. treated neurons than in controls, suggest that FL-APP has no access to secretases for its processing, as it is most likely retained in the ER.

We next incubated control and PGJ2-treated neuronal lysates with an O-deglycosylation mix containing neuroaminidase and O-glycosidase, which when used in combination remove some but not all of the O-linked glycans from proteins (Iwase and Hotta, 1993;Uchida et al., 1979). It is clear that upon enzymatic O-deglycosylation, the top band corresponding to mature N- and O-glycosylated FL-APP, was significantly decreased (47.4%) in control neurons (Fig. 4B). A similar trend was observed for the PGJ2-treated neurons, although not significant. In controls, incomplete O-deglycosylation was observed as the levels of the other FL-APP forms (middle and bottom bands) did not decline. This was expected as there are no general glycosidases that remove all O-linked glycans from proteins. Overall, our results together with published reports by others (Perdivara et al., 2009) confirm the O-glycosylated state of the mature FL-APP forms, and that PGJ2 decreases their levels.

APP is modified by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) at cytoplasmic serine and threonine residues (Griffith et al., 1995). Moreover, an increase in APP O-GlcNAcylation promotes APP processing, in particular by α-secretase (Jacobsen and Iverfeldt, 2011). Thus, we investigated the effect of PGJ2 on overall O-GlcNAcylation of proteins. O-GlcNAcylation is a form of O-glycosylation that occurs in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and involves O-GlcNAc monosaccharide units O-linked to serine or threonine residues of proteins (Lagerlof and Hart, 2014). For this we used an antibody raised against a synthetic peptide containing serine-β-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (Ser-O-GlcNAc) that detects Ser-O-GlcNAc and Thr-O-GlcNAc, and does not cross-react with peptide determinants or other closely-related carbohydrate antigens (manufacturer specifications). Our results using this antibody show that PGJ2 increased the overall levels of O-GlcNAcylated proteins in a concentration-dependent manner in the rat neuronal cultures (Fig. 4C).

The increase in the levels of O-GlcNAcylated proteins induced by PGJ2 was mimicked by treatment of the rat neuronal cultures with the proteasome inhibitor Epox (5 nM, Fig. 4D), but not by inhibitors of β-secretase (BACE1-2, 1 μM), calpain (Cpt, 20 μM), or lysosomes (CQ, 10 μM). One of the functions of O-GlcNAcylation is to protect proteins from being degraded by the proteasome (Zhu et al., 2015). The finding that PGJ2 mimics the proteasome inhibitor effect by increasing the levels of O-GlcNAcylated proteins, suggests that PGJ2 renders mature FL-APP less prone to proteasomal degradation. Hence, upon PGJ2-treatment, more FL-APP is accessible to secretase processing, resulting in lower levels of mature FL-APP. This premise is further addressed in the discussion. Note that it is not possible to determine the direct effect of PGJ2 on the O-GlcNAcylation of APP, because FL-APP levels are highly reduced upon PGJ2-treatment (Fig. 3A, for example).

3.5. PGJ2 decreases APP levels in the ER and Golgi, disrupts APP trafficking, and induces neurite dystrophy

The appropriate glycosylation of FL-APP is required for its secretase processing as well as axonal sorting (Schedin-Weiss et al., 2014). Since PGJ2 alters FL-APP processing, we investigated whether PGJ2 changes APP trafficking by immunohistochemical analysis of rat primary neuronal cultures treated with 10 μM PGJ2 for 16h. We assessed the co-localization of APP (Fig. 5, red in all panels) with TGN38, a trans-Golgi network integral membrane protein, or calreticulin, an ER resident protein, or βIII-tubulin, a neuronal marker (Fig. 5, all in green in the respective panels). PGJ2-treatment caused a decrease in APP levels in the Golgi (Fig. 5A) and in the ER (Fig. 5B). These results show that PGJ2 does not cause APP accumulation in these intracellular compartments.

As we previously established (Arnaud et al., 2009) and is shown in Fig. 5C, dystrophic-like neurites were detected in PGJ2-treated but not control cortical neuronal cultures. Sites of neuritic dystrophy are indicated by bulb-like accumulations (white arrows) of APP (red) and βIII tubulin (green) in the PGJ2-treated neurons. Higher magnifications of these structures are shown in the bottom panels (Fig. 5D). We assessed the co-localization of APP and β-tubulin in the neuronal processes (excluding the cell bodies) and found it to be significantly higher in PGJ2-treated neurons than in controls, most likely due to high levels of APP being sequestered within the dystrophic-like neurites. These data indicate that in rat primary cortical neurons PGJ2 causes aberrant neurite dystrophy exhibiting kinks and loops, which seem to be characteristic of AD pathology (Benzing et al., 1993).

3.6. PGJ2 raises the levels of sAPPα and sAPPβ fragments, including those generated by caspases, in human neuroblastoma SY5Y cells overexpressing APP695 (APP-SY5Y)

APP is cleaved by α and β secretases at specific sites in its juxtamembrane region to release sAPPα and sAPPβ, which are ~100kDa ectodomain secreted forms of FL-APP. We investigated the effects of PGJ2 on sAPPα and sAPPβ levels using APP-SY5Y cells, because these neuroblastoma cells overexpress human FL-APP by at least ~2-fold thus facilitating sAPP detection. In addition, antibodies are available that specifically differentiate between human (not rat) sAPPα and sAPPβ. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies are selective for APP neoepitopes exposed by α or β secretase cleavages respectively, thus enabling specific detection of sAPPα and sAPPβ with negligible cross-reactivity.

Faint detection of intact (~100kDa) sAPPα and sAPPβ were observed under control conditions, whereas highly enriched sAPP fragments were detected upon PGJ2-treatment (Fig. 6A, dark exposure). In PGJ2-treated neurons (Fig. 6A, dark and light exposures) three major fragments were identified with anti-sAPPβ (75kDa, ~37kDa, and ~27kDa, left), and with anti-sAPPα (50kDa, ~30kDa and 15kDa, right). None of these fragments were detected under control conditions, and their levels were slightly altered by β-secretase (BACE1-4) and α-secretase (TAPI-2) inhibitors (Fig. 6A).

Notably, generation of the sAPPβ fragments was caspase-dependent, as their levels were significantly diminished by treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 6B, left). Formation of the sAPPα fragments was also dependent on caspase cleavage, but to a lesser extent (Fig. 6B, right). We previously demonstrated that PGJ2 induces caspase-3 activation (Arnaud et al., 2009;Metcalfe et al., 2012). Together, these results indicate that PGJ2 treatment triggers α and β-secretase processing of APP to yield the ~100 kDa sAPPβ, which undergoes further caspase-dependent cleavage to yield various fragments. The sites of this additional cleavage are unknown. However, on the basis of fragment size, the ~37kDa fragment resembles the N-APP ~35kDa fragment generated in a β-secretase-dependent manner under trophic deprivation, and shown to bind to death receptor 6 (Nikolaev et al., 2009;Xu et al., 2015).

We also assessed the levels of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, which are generated from APP by β and γ-secretases. Compared to controls, PGJ2-treatment of APP-SY5Y cells did not alter the levels of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in the cell lysates, while it decreased both Aβ isoforms in conditioned media (Fig. 6C). These findings are discussed below.

4. Discussion

The cyclooxygenase pathway is implicated in the earliest and latest stages of AD, based on human post-mortem and epidemiology studies and in transgenic rodent models of AD (Liang et al., 2007;Woodling and Andreasson, 2016). Prostaglandins, which are products of the cyclooxygenase pathway, are the principal mediators of CNS neuroinflammation (Cudaback et al., 2014). As endogenous lipid signaling molecules, prostaglandins are generated on demand in response to a variety of triggers, and are not proactively synthesized and stored within cells for future release (Cudaback et al., 2014). Understanding the mechanisms of action of prostaglandins and how they contribute to the development of AD remains understudied. We focused our studies on prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) because it is a powerful inducer of neurotoxicity compared to PGA1, D2 and E2 (Li et al., 2004b). In addition, a metabolite of PGJ2, 15d-PGJ2, was shown by others (Koma et al., 2017) to have in vivo effects relevant to AD. In the latter studies, young, mature male rats received bilateral injections of 15d-PGJ2 into the hippocampi. 15d-PGJ2 hippocampal injections significantly impaired memory retrieval in these animals, thus mimicking a cognitive deficit experienced by AD patients.

Our data show that PGJ2 promotes processing of FL-APP by α and β-secretases in rat primary cortical cultures and in human neuroblastoma SY5Y cells overexpressing APP695 (APP-SY5Y). We demonstrate that PGJ2 induces a decrease in the levels of mature (N- and O-glycosylated) FL-APP, does not increase the levels of unglycosylated or immature (N-glycosylated only) FL-APP, nor does it alter APP mRNA levels. Moreover, in the APP-SY5Y cells, PGJ2 raised the levels of sAPPα and sAPPβ, the secreted forms of APP, in particular various sAPPα and sAPPβ fragments generated in a caspase-dependent manner.

Processing of FL-APP by α and β-secretases is dependent and facilitated by its O-glycosylation (Saito et al., 2013;Tomita et al., 1998). This is required for FL-APP trafficking through the secretory pathway to reach the plasma membrane (Saito et al., 2013;Tomita et al., 1998). Once at the plasma membrane, most (~90%) of FL-APP is processed by α-secretase (Placido et al., 2014), with the remaining FL-APP being re-internalized and cleaved at the endosomal compartment, where most of the β-secretase seems to be localized (Zhang et al., 2013). It is clear from our studies that the decrease in mature FL-APP observed upon PGJ2-treatment is not caused by inhibition of APP O-glycosylation. On one hand, PGJ2 did not mimic the effect of brefeldin A, a drug that obstructs general protein O-glycosylation by preventing protein trafficking from the ER to cisGolgi (Klausner et al., 1992). In contrast to PGJ2, brefeldin A significantly increased the levels of unglycosylated and immature (N-glycosylated only) FL-APP. On the other hand, PGJ2 did not elevate, instead it diminished APP levels in the ER or Golgi, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Thus, PGJ2 did not hinder APP trafficking from the ER to Golgi or APP O-glycosylation.

The paradoxical findings that PGJ2 on one hand promotes processing of FL-APP, but on the other hand decreases the levels of O-glycosylated FL-APP led us to consider the effect of PGJ2 on overall protein O-GlcNAcylation. Protein O-GlcNAcylation involves the addition of a single O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to the hydroxyl side chains of serine and threonine residues within protein nucleocytoplasmic domains (Torres and Hart, 1984). O-GlcNAc protein glycosylation is different from glycosylation of proteins localized extracellularly and within the secretory pathway. Protein O-GlcNAcylation takes place in the nucleus and cytoplasm, does not form complex sugar structures, and is a dynamic reversible process, as O-GlcNAc can be added or removed multiple times during the protein lifetime (Torres et al., 1984). O-GlcNAcylation is often found at serine and threonine residues within “PEST” sequences, which are associated with short-lived proteins (Dong et al., 1996;Rogers et al., 1986). Thus, one of the functions of O-GlcNAcylation is to stabilize specific proteins by preventing their ubiquitination and hindering their proteasomal degradation (Powers, 2015;Zhu et al., 2015).

It is possible that PGJ2 induces APP O-GlcNAcylation to regulate APP processing. This premise is supported by the following findings: firstly, APP is modified by O-GlcNAc linked to cytoplasmic serine and threonine residues (Griffith et al., 1995). Moreover, APP O-GlcNAcylation was shown to promote APP processing by α-secretase leading to a decrease in Aβ secretion (Jacobsen et al., 2011). Secondly, FL-APP can be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (Wang and Saunders, 2014). Thirdly, our data show that PGJ2-treatment mimicked the effect of the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin on increasing overall O-GlcNAcylation proteins (Fig. 4D, lanes 2 and 4). However, epoxomicin by itself did not mimic the effect of PGJ2 on FL-APP (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3), nor did it prevent FL-APP processing in PGJ2-treated cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4). In addition, one of the functions of O-GlcNAcylation proteins is to protect proteins from being degraded by the proteasome (Zhu et al., 2015). Based on these findings, we propose that, by promoting APP O-GlcNAcylation proteins, PGJ2-treatment prevents FL-APP proteasomal degradation, and shunts FL-APP to processing by α and β-secretases, resulting in lower levels of mature FL-APP.

We found that PGJ2-treatment induces APP processing to a series of N-terminal fragments detected in conditioned media. Ectodomain fragments of FL-APP can be generated by the canonical pathway involving α and β-secretases, as well as by the non-canonical pathway that includes δ and η-secretases as well as meprin β (Muller et al., 2017). All of these proteases generate N-terminal fragments of different sizes and functions (Muller et al., 2017). We analyzed by western blotting, the APP N-terminal fragments in conditioned media of PGJ2-treated APP-SY5Y cells and controls. We used antibodies that specifically detect sAPPα or sAPPβ, or fragments derived from their further cleavage. These antibodies are specific for sAPPα or sAPPβ forms. These antibodies react with the respective neoepitopes exposed N-terminus to the α or β-secretase cleavage sites on FL-APP, with negligent cross-reactivity with FL-APP or Aβ (manufacturer’s specifications). We observed that PGJ2-treatment induces remarkable cleavages of sAPPα and sAPPβ to a pattern of fragments that differs between sAPPα and sAPPβ.

Significantly, the sAPPβ-derived fragments identified in conditioned media of PGJ2-treated cells, were generated in a caspase-dependent manner, while not all fragments derived from sAPPα were caspase-dependent (Fig. 6B). We and others previously demonstrated that PGJ2 induces caspase-activation in neuroblastoma cells (Arnaud et al., 2009;Kondo et al., 2002) and rat primary cortical neurons (Metcalfe et al., 2012). The PGJ2 metabolite 15d-PGJ2 is a potent activator of death receptor CD95/Fas (Kondo et al., 2002) and a potent sensitizer of DR5 by up-regulating its expression (Nakata et al., 2006). This is important because one of the sAPPβ fragments (~37kDa) generated upon PGJ2-treatment resembles in size the N-APP fragment (35kDa) previously shown to bind to death receptor 6 (DR6) in sensory neurons (Nikolaev et al., 2009;Xu et al., 2015). The latter N-APP fragment is also derived from sAPPβ, and is formed in a caspase-dependent manner upon trophic-factor deprivation (Nikolaev et al., 2009;Xu et al., 2015). Activation of DR6 by N-APP seems to modulate synaptic density and axonal pruning in the adult CNS, but its relation to the pathophysiology of AD remains controversial (Kallop et al., 2014;Marik et al., 2016).

We determined that Aβ1–40 levels were significantly higher than Aβ1–42 in the APP-SY5Y lysates and conditioned media. Aβ1–40 was also found to be the most abundant Aβ isoform in human CSF (Dumurgier et al., 2015). Moreover, we observed a decrease in Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in conditioned media of APP-SY5Y cells treated with PGJ2, while Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 levels in the lysates were not altered. The decline in Aβ peptide levels observed in the media, could be associated with PGJ2 inducing neurite dystrophy (discussed below), which hinders neurite trafficking (Sadleir et al., 2016), and thus could impede Aβ secretion. Alternatively, the decline in Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in the media filtrate, could be caused by the formation of Aβ aggregates that failed to pass through the filter pores. Future studies will address these and other options. Notably, for unknown reasons, the levels of CSF Aβ1–42 also decline over two decades prior to the first clinical signs of AD (Bateman et al., 2012). To a certain extent, the decline in CSF Aβ1–42 mimics what we observed in the media of PGJ2-treated cells.

We confirmed that PGJ2 causes neurite dystrophy in the rat primary cortical neurons, as we previously showed (Arnaud et al., 2009). Upon PGJ2-treatment, APP accumulation was detected within bulb-like structures located at the dystrophic neurites, indicating trafficking problems along the neuronal processes. These swollen, bulbous-shaped (dystrophic) neurites represent one of the most abundant neuritic abnormalities within the brains of AD patients, and seem to be dependent on Aβ deposition (Benzing et al., 1993). A recent study reported that dystrophic neurites in AD brains are particularly enriched in CTF-APP fragments generated by at least three of the secretases, α, β and η (Willem et al., 2015). In our studies, the APP accumulation was detected with an antibody (22C11) that reacts with residues 66–81 of the N-terminus of APP, recognizing immature, mature and sAPP. Thus, the bulb-like structures within dystrophic neurites must contain different forms of APP.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that PGJ2 promotes APP processing by α and β-secretases, and that stimulation of this proteolytic canonic pathway could be mediated by PGJ2-induced O-GlcNAcylation known to prevent proteasomal degradation (Fig. 7). Since cyclopentenone prostaglandins such as PGJ2 interact with many proteins through their α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group, it is possible that additional mechanisms may be involved in this process. It is difficult to stoichiometrically analyze APP metabolism, as it can be processed by so many different known and unknown proteases. However, our studies shed light on some of the glycosylation and proteolytic mechanisms by which neuroinflammation, via PGJ2, regulates APP processing in a manner that is relevant to AD pathophysiology. As these PGJ2-induced mechanisms give rise to a variety of secreted N-terminal APP fragments, they should be targeted in conjunction with Aβ formation to prevent/treat AD pathophysiology associated with neuroinflammation.

Cell lysates (4μg protein/sample for Aβ1–40 and 10μg protein/sample for Aβ1–42), and conditioned media (50μl from 20-fold concentrated samples) as described under materials and methods were analyzed by ELISA to assess the levels of Aβ1–40 (left) and Aβ1–42 (right). Values (pg of the respective Aβ peptide/ml of lysate or media) are means ± s.e. from four independent experiments. Asterisks identify the values that are significantly different from control, (* p&lt; 0.05; ** p&lt; 0.01, *** p&lt;0.001). sAPPβ and sAPPα, secreted (soluble) forms of APP generated by β and α-secretases, respectively; ns, non-significant.

Figure 7 Scheme depicting the effects of PGJ2 (black arrows) on FL-APP processing

Under control conditions (white arrows), full length APP (FL-APP) can be processed via various pathways that include secretases, the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (UPP), cathepsins (lysosomes), calpains, and others. The secretase pathway, includes FL-APP processing by canonical (α, β, γ) secretases to generate secreted (soluble) APP (sAPPα and sAPPβ), Aβ, and C-terminal fragments (CTFs). The non-canonical secretase pathway involves FL-APP processing by non-canonical (δ, η) secretases and meprin β to generate different forms of secreted (soluble) APP and C-terminal fragments (CTFs) that are not shown. Our data suggest that upon PGJ2-treatment, which induces protein O-GlcNAcylated, a fraction of FL-APP processing (black arrows) is shunted from proteasomal (UPP) degradation (shorter black arrow) to the canonical α and β-secretases (longer black arrow) to give rise to higher levels of sAPPα and sAPPβ. The latter are further cleaved, in most cases by caspases, to generate fragments (thinner arrows) that potentially bind to death receptors (DRs) and induce apoptosis ( ). PGJ2-treatment did not alter the intracellular levels of Aβ, while it decreased the levels of secreted Aβ. The scheme depicts the complexity of APP metabolism, rendering it difficult to analyze stoichiometrically. For simplicity, the CTF fragments are not shown under PGJ2-treatment. O-GlcNAc, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine.

Highlights

PGJ2 promotes APP processing by α and β-secretases and cleavage of secreted APP

PGJ2 enhances APP processing to a greater extent than PGD2 or PGE2

PGJ2 selectively alters full length-APP glycosylation and protein O-GlcNAcylation

PGJ2-induced APP processing mechanisms support the neuroinflammation-AD link
