Objectives:

The cortical thickness ‘signature’ of Alzheimer’s disease (AD-CT) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden have each been associated with cognitive aging and incident Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Less is known about how these structural neuroimaging markers associate with other critical behaviors. We investigated associations of AD-CT and WMH volumes with a composite index of health and financial literacy given that the ability to access, understand, and utilize health and financial information significantly influences older adults’ health outcomes.

Design, Setting, Participants:

Participants were 303 adults without dementia (age~80y; 74% women) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project.

Measurements:

Baseline 3T MRI T1-weighted structural and T2-weighted FLAIR data were used to assess AD-CT and WMH volumes, respectively. Literacy was measured using questions designed to assess comprehension of health and financial information and concepts, yielding a total literacy score. Multivariable linear mixed effects regression models determined the relationship of each neuroimaging marker, first separately and then combined, with level of and change in literacy.

Results:

Reduced AD-CT and higher WMH at baseline were each associated with lower levels of literacy; only AD-CT was associated with the rate of decline in literacy over time. The association of AD-CT with change in literacy persisted when both neuroimaging markers were included in the same model.

Conclusions:

The cortical thickness signature of Alzheimer’s disease predicts changes in health and financial literacy in non-demented older adults suggesting that the multi-dimensional construct of health and financial literacy relies on specific brain networks implicated in Alzheimer’s disease.

pmcObjective

Structural neuroimaging markers that help predict risk for and development of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have long been incorporated into the cognitive aging literature. Commonly used neuroimaging markers include the cortical thickness composite or ‘signature’ of Alzheimer’s disease (AD-CT) comprised of select regions of interest along the cortical ribbon (1), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH), i.e., areas of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRI. Less has been done investigating how these structural neuroimaging markers are associated with other domains of behaviors critical to successful aging and associated with ADRD risk.

Health and financial literacy – acquired knowledge reflecting the ability to access, understand, and utilize health and financial information (2) – influence critical aging trajectories related to health (3), and retirement (4). Furthermore, lower levels of health and financial literacy are associated with increased ADRD neuropathological burden at death (5, 6), especially Alzheimer’s related neuropathologies (5). Given the cross-sectional nature of these studies, however, it is difficult to determine directionality of results. Recently, others have extended work on literacy and neuropathology to in-vivo MRI using domain-specific measures of financial capacity (i.e., everyday financial skills including using a checkbook/register and bank statement) and PET-derived beta amyloid levels (7, 8). Results suggest that, regardless of cognitive status, higher cortical beta amyloid levels were associated with lower financial capacity scores albeit in cross-sectional analyses only. Other structural neuroimaging studies exist investigating cross-sectional associations of financial knowledge independent of the foundational knowledge represented by literacy. For example, higher levels of right temporal cortical thickness were associated with lower financial awareness, i.e., overestimates of performance on financial capacity testing (9). Additionally, cortical volume reductions within lateral parietal regions were associated with financial skills in individuals at risk for ADRD (10). While these studies contribute important information, gaps remain related to directionality of these associations that only longitudinal study may address.

To our knowledge, only one study has applied baseline levels of neurodegeneration to a longitudinal study of financial skills, and only one study investigated the construct of literacy using MRI. Specifically, investigators reported that individuals meeting threshold for neurodegeneration at baseline, determined via AD-CT scores that encompass many of the grey matter regions implicated in previous structural neuroimaging studies (9, 10), had faster rates of decline in financial capacity scores (7). Furthermore, we reported that white matter tracts connecting right temporal-parietal brain regions were associated with financial literacy (11); however, our study was cross-sectional. Thus, additional, longitudinal work is needed to investigate the specific construct of health and financial literacy with common structural neuroimaging biomarkers (e.g., AD-CT).

The current study investigated associations of AD-CT and WMH volumes with level of and longitudinal change in a composite index of health and financial literacy. Using data provided by a community-dwelling cohort of older adults without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, we hypothesized that reduced cortical thickness in AD signature regions and greater WMH volumes would each be associated with lower levels of and faster rates of decline in our composite score of health and financial literacy after adjusting for relevant confounders. Given that cortical thinning and white matter hyperintensities do not occur in isolation (12), we further investigated the combined effect of these neuroimaging markers on literacy in this same cohort.

Methods

Participants

Participants were from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP; 1997-present), an ongoing clinical-pathologic cohort study of aging (13, 14) which introduced a decision making sub-study in 2010 (15) and a 3T MRI sub-study in 2012. An Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center approved all study procedures and participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

At the time of the current analyses, 554 participants had completed their initial decision making sub-study visit and undergone 3T neuroimaging. Using a participant’s first valid 3T MRI as the analytic baseline, we paired behavioral data from the closest annual decision making visit performed after neuroimaging for this study. We excluded 75 participants who were determined to have dementia at analytic baseline based on a uniform structured clinical evaluation at that annual visit (16) as notated by experienced clinicians following the diagnostic criteria set forth by the NINCDS-ADRDA (17). Of the remaining 479 participants, we excluded a further 52 participants to ensure that all neuroimaging data were collected at the same scanner. This left 303 participants with baseline neuroimaging data from the same scanner, and 2 or more annual visits that included valid decision making data in these analyses. On average, participants underwent the decision making sub-study within 3±1.6 months of completing their baseline neuroimaging and contributed an average of 5±2.4 annual decision making visits (range 2 to 10).

Neuroimaging

High-resolution MRI data were acquired on all participants using a Siemens 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Erlangen, Germany). Participants were positioned comfortably on the scanner table, fitted with earplugs and instructed to remain still through the scan with foam padding used to further minimize head movement. The scanning protocol included T1-weighted structural and T2-weighted FLAIR data collection. Specifically, a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence [echo-time (TE)=2.98ms, repetition time (TR)=2.3s, preparation time=900ms, flip-angle = 9°, field-of-view (FOV) = 25.6 cm × 25.6 cm, 176 sagittal slices, slice thickness = 1 mm, no gap, 256 × 256 acquisition matrix, parallel imaging acceleration factor (AF)=2, scan time=5 minutes and 30 seconds]; and a 2D fast spin-echo sequence was used to collect T2-weighted FLAIR data as follows: TE=150ms, TR=9s, inversion time=2.49s, FOV = 22 cm × 22 cm, 35 axial slices, slice thickness = 4 mm, no gap, 256 × 256 acquisition matrix, AF=2, scan time=2 minutes and 42 seconds]. Quality checks were conducted on the raw data and at each stage of imaging processing.

MRI data processes included bias field inhomogeneity correction (18) of each participant’s MPRAGE and FLAIR data. To quantify the AD signature, MPRAGE images were first segmented using FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) and the resulting segmentations were manually corrected. Based on a review of the literature (e.g., (1, 19–21)) and in-house validation between ex-vivo MRI and neuropathology, the cortical thickness for AD signature regions was then calculated as the mean of the thickness of the following cortical regions from the two hemispheres: middle and inferior temporal, entorhinal, temporal pole, fusiform, superior frontal, rostral and caudal middle frontal, superior and inferior parietal, supramarginal, and precuneus. To quantify WMH volumes, MPRAGE data were registered to FLAIR data using rigid body registration and WMH were automatically segmented using sysu (22). The resulting total WMH volume in the cerebrum was then normalized by the participant’s corresponding intracranial volume, multiplied by 100, and subsequently log 10 transformed given the skewness of the data.

Literacy Assessment

Literacy was assessed with 32 questions measuring knowledge of health and financial information and concepts as well as numeracy (i.e., simple calculations) (23, 24). Health literacy questions (9 in total) included those pertaining to knowledge on leading causes of death in old age, the ability to follow prescription instructions, and understand drug risk and Medicare. An example question asked “Medicare Part D covers which of the following? (a) Inpatient hospital services, (b) Outpatient physician services, or (c) Prescription drug benefits”. The financial literacy component consisted of 23 questions, many adapted from the Health and Retirement Survey. These questions assessed knowledge of economic concepts [e.g., ‘A mutual fund is an investment that holds what? (a) Only stocks, (b) Only bonds, or (c) Stocks and bonds’] and the ability to perform simple monetary calculation [e.g., ‘If a television set is on sale for $899, which is $200 off its normal price, what is the normal price? (a) $699, (b) $1,099, or (c) $1,299’]. Questions, either multiple choice or true/false, were scored as correct or incorrect, and expressed as the percent correct of all items (0–100%). This composite score of total literacy has been shown to possess adequate psychometric properties (23, 24).

Statistical Analyses

We described participant characteristics at baseline and tested bivariate associations between key characteristics, MRI predictors (i.e., AD-CT and WMH volumes), and our literacy outcome using correlations or independent sample t-tests (two-sided) as appropriate. Linear mixed effects regression models examined the associations of MRI predictors (separately) with total literacy. Models included terms for time (in study), age, sex, and education, as well as interactions of these participant characteristics with time. We then repeated these analyses placing both MRI predictors in the same model given these brain alterations typically do not occur in isolation. Across all regression models, estimates represent the difference in percentage points of literacy with every 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in the MRI predictor in question.

Analyses were programed using SAS/STAT software, Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Linux (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Given the limited number of regression models conducted, significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Information regarding obtaining data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project for research use, including the data and code represented in this manuscript, can be found at the RADC Research Resource Sharing Hub (www.radc.rush.edu).

Results

Participants were, on average, 80 years of age, and had a mean of 16 years of education. Over 90% of participants were non-Latino White and 74% were female. Participants’ mean total literacy score at baseline was roughly 72%. Other variables of interest are described in Table 1 including cognitive status at baseline.

Bivariate correlations between participant characteristics, literacy, and our neuroimaging biomarkers revealed that age, literacy, and WMH volumes were correlated with all other continuous variables (see Table 2 for details). WMH volumes were weakly correlated with AD-CT, r(303)=−0.332, p&lt;0.001. The AD-CT measure correlated with all other variables but education (Table 2). Independent sample t-tests indicated that literacy totals differed by sex [t(303)=−2.30, p=0.022; men: n=78; 75.17±11.88, women: n=225; 71.22±13.45]; however, sex-differences were not significant for either MRI predictor (AD-CT t(301)=1.23, p-value=0.22; WMH t(301)=1.70, p-value=0.090).

Association of Individual Morphometric MRI Predictors and Literacy

We first examined the association of individual morphometric MRI predictors, i.e., AD-CT and WMH volumes, with level of and change in total literacy. In separate mixed effects regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, and each of these variables interactions with time (in study), AD-CT was associated with both level of and change in literacy (p-values≤0.020). In Figure 1, we illustrate results for three hypothetical female participants with years of age and education set to the mean of the analytic sample to represent the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of AD-CT at baseline. As may be seen, the hypothetical female with the lowest AD-CT at baseline (i.e., falling in the 10th percentile as depicted by the red dotted line) also had the lowest levels of total literacy as well as the fastest rates of decline in literacy over time when compared to hypothetical females falling in the 50th (black solid line) or 90th (purple dotted line) percentile of AD-CT. Table 3 details all model estimates which represent the difference in percentage points of literacy with every 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in the stated MRI marker for comparison purposes.

In contrast, WMH volume was only associated with level of literacy at baseline (p=0.0007; Table 3 for detailed estimates). Specifically, and as illustrated in Figure 2, for three female participants with mean age and education, the one with the highest WMH volume at baseline (i.e., falling in the 90th percentile as depicted by the purple dotted line) had the lowest levels of total literacy at baseline when compared to females falling in the 50th (black solid line) or 10th (red dotted line) percentile of WMH volume; however, all three females’ rates of change over time were roughly parallel given no differences in rates of change over time in literacy performance.

Association of Combined Morphometric MRI Predictors and Literacy

Next, we examined the association of both AD-CT and WMH volumes (combined in the same model) with total literacy. In a mixed effects regression model adjusted for age, sex, education, and interactions of these variables with time, the pattern of associations seen in individual models outline above remained. Specifically, AD-CT and WMH volumes at baseline were associated with levels of total literacy (i.e., lower AD-CT and lower literacy: estimate=2.65, standard error, SE=0.65, p&lt;0.0001; higher WMH and lower literacy: estimate=−2.05, SE=0.79, p=0.009), and lower AD-CT remained associated with faster rates of decline in literacy over time (estimate=0.24, SE=0.11, p=0.036). As in separate models, WMH volumes were not associated with changes in literacy over time (estimate=−0.12, SE=0.13, p=0.33).

Post-hoc Sensitivity Analyses

As noted in Table 1, approximately 20% of participants met criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline (i.e., they displayed memory or other cognitive abilities outside the normal range but did not meet criteria for dementia). Of these 63 individuals, during the approximately 5 years of follow-up, 20 (32%) reverted to normal cognition, 18 (28%) remained MCI, and 25 (39%) converted to dementia. Given that there was such variability in baseline cognitive profiles and longitudinal clinical outcomes for these participants, we adjusted for cognitive status via baseline scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination. The profile of results for these analyses were not substantially different than those reported above. Specifically, AD-CT was associated with level and change in literacy scores while WMH volumes were associated with level of literacy only, regardless of whether these predictors were considered separately or together (Supplemental Table 1).

Exclusion criterion for dementia was applied at baseline only in the primary analyses; however, during follow-up, 61 individuals converted to dementia (25 of who had MCI at baseline). When we excluded these individuals, resulting in much smaller analytic sample (n=242, 303 minus 61), both AD-CT and WMH volumes remained associated with literacy at baseline; however, given that the we excluded those with the greatest variability in function, neither MRI-based metric was significantly associated with change in literacy. Results were consistent regardless of whether these predictors were considered separately or together (Supplementary Table 2).

Conclusions

In this study of just over 300 older adults without initially free of dementia, we investigated the associations of MRI-derived indices reflective of the earliest stages of vulnerability for Alzheimer’s dementia (19, 20) and cerebrovascular disease (25, 26) with health and financial literacy. Results suggest that the cortical thickness signature of AD but not gross white matter integrity is associated with longitudinal change in literacy, driven primarily by individuals who converted to dementia during study follow-up. This is despite the fact that both structural neuroimaging markers were associated with baseline levels of this same metric regardless of dementia outcomes. In addition to adjusting for participant characteristics known to negatively impact brain and behavior, when combining the MRI predictors in the same model, we observed the same pattern of results noted above. Taken together, our study suggests that multiple brain regions affiliated with vulnerability to Alzheimer’s dementia predict longitudinal change in health and financial literacy for older adults – particularly those who develop dementia – even after considering a key marker of cerebrovascular disease.

Results of this study contribute to the literature on brain structure and health and financial literacy in several ways. First, to our knowledge, ours is only the second study investigating the cortical thickness signature of AD in relation to longitudinal change in financial abilities, extending recent work focused on financial capacity (7) to include health and financial literacy. Furthermore, we extend previous cross-sectional results of associations between DTI-derived white matter integrity and financial awareness (27) as well as financial literacy (11) to include white matter hyperintensities and a composite measure of health as well as financial literacy. Second, our work, employing not only a well-known structural neuroimaging marker of AD, but also one representing cerebrovascular disease, extends the applicability of a more comprehensive approach to structural MRI metrics of AD and cerebrovascular disease (12) to behaviors critical to shaping aging trajectories of health and financial outcomes. In fact, our cortical thickness results pointing toward the importance of AD regions to longitudinal change in health and financial literacy – particularly for participants who developed dementia – further support the assertion that the biological manifestations of Alzheimer’s disease may predict a broader spectrum of behavior than originally recognized (5, 6). Specifically, our sensitivity analyses, combined with our previous work suggesting that certain skills and abilities are required for literacy that are not as important for cognition (28), continues to support the assertion that while related, cognition and literacy are not synonymous and declines in literacy performance as detected by AD-CT, much like other forms of decision making (29), may be an earlier harbinger of dementia than cognition in high functioning older adults.

Despite the role of AD signature regions in predicting longitudinal change in health and financial literacy for older adults, white matter hyperintensities did not contribute to literacy performance over time; this differential Alzheimer’s versus cerebrovascular-related distinction may have several explanations. First, although WMH volume, as a metric, is a characterization of a discrete foci of white matter integrity, it can signal more widespread yet subtle changes in otherwise normal appearing white matter – but typically only when WMH burden is high (30) – which was not the case for our participants. This may have limited the predictive power of this cerebrovascular MRI marker as related to health and financial literacy performance. Second, WMHs may have several contributing factors including other cerebrovascular-related neuropathologies (31), whereas cortical thickness within AD signature regions is primarily associated with disease-specific neuropathologies (32). It follows that WMH volumes may not be the most appropriate representative for cerebrovascular disease in our relatively healthy sample. As additional MRI markers for cerebrovascular disease emerge (e.g., (33)), the role of white matter integrity in health and financial literacy should be revisited. Furthermore, the average age of our participants is slightly younger than those exhibiting the most cerebrovascular-related neuropathology with advanced age (34). Future studies in the oldest-old may provide better evidence for the role of white matter hyperintensities on health and financial literacy performance over time.

Our results contribute to the growing literature on potential underlying mechanisms for changes in health and financial literacy. For example, prior post mortem neuropathological investigations from our group (6) have shown that it is neocortical TDP-43 neuropathology, not amyloid or limbic restricted accumulation of TDP-43, that is related to alterations in the same composite index of literacy performance proximate to death. Thus, our ante mortem MRI results of reduced cortical thickness in AD signature regions predicting faster rates of decline in health and financial literacy over time – particularly for participants who developed dementia – supports and extends this finding, as well as other neuropathological investigations (5) suggesting a role for AD-related neuropathology in literacy performance of older adults. Baseline associations between WMHs and health and financial literacy performance may also be due in part to its association with AD-related neuropathology (35) including the role of white matter hyperintensities on risk for and development of Alzheimer’s dementia (36). Additionally, baseline relationships between WMH and literacy may also be driven by more peripheral cardiovascular risk factors associated with accumulating white matter hyperintensities (37) as well as Alzheimer’s neuropathology (38). Despite these linked mechanistic relationships between white matter hyperintensities and AD-related neuropathology, WMH volumes nonetheless remained independently and temporally limited in its relationship to baseline health and financial literacy performance; i.e., neither WMH volumes alone nor when considered in parallel with AD-CT predicted declines in literacy. This suggests that white matter hyperintensities do not appear to directly contribute to health and financial literacy performance over time, despite the association of white matter integrity more generally to tests of decision-making (39) and associated motivational circuitry (40) – both potential outgrowths of the ability to access, understand, and utilize health and financial information, i.e., literacy. We are in the process of investigating not only health and financial literacy measures, but health and financial decision making measures as well as other aspects of decision making to more fully understand the role of white matter on these critical behaviors.

It is important to put this study within the context of its strengths and limitations. Strengths include the large community-based sample of older adults without dementia at baseline who were assessed using a comprehensive measure of literacy for up to a maximum of 10 years. Additionally, analyses benefited from the inclusion of both AD- and cerebrovascular-related markers of brain health when considering health and financial literacy performance over time. Despite these strengths, participants of this study were almost exclusively non-Latino White older adults with a high degree of education which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Additionally, our sample size was too small to investigate more complex three-way interactions of AD- and cerebrovascular-related markers of brain health and time in study as they relate to longitudinal change in health and financial literacy despite the fact that we know these brain alterations do not exert their influence on behavior in isolation (12). This sample size was further reduced when excluding participants with dementia in sensitivity analyses; we suspect the accompanying reduction in power may be partly responsible for the lack of significant association (i.e., p=0.52) between AD-CT and change in literacy. Future work in a larger, more diverse sample is warranted to confirm and extend results of this study.

• What is the main finding of this study?

For 303 participants without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, reduced AD signature cortical thickness was associated with baseline levels of and faster declines in literacy. White matter hyperintensities were associated with level of but not change in literacy.

• What is the meaning of the finding?

Results support the assertion that biological vulnerability associated with Alzheimer’s disease may predict a broader spectrum of behavior than originally recognized, even in non-demented older adults.
