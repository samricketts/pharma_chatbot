Background

Cross-sectional epidemiological and clinical research suggest lower cardiac index is associated with abnormal brain aging, including smaller brain volumes, increased white matter hyperintensities, and worse cognitive performances. Lower systemic blood flow may have implications for dementia among older adults.

Methods &amp; Results

1039 Framingham Offspring Cohort participants free from clinical stroke, transient ischemic attack, or dementia formed our sample (69±6 years; 53% women). Multivariable-adjusted proportional hazard models adjusting for Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score (age, sex, systolic blood pressure, anti-hypertensive medication, diabetes, cigarette smoking, cardiovascular disease [CVD] history, atrial fibrillation), education, and apolipoprotein E4 status related cardiac MRI-assessed cardiac index (cardiac output/body surface area) to incident all-cause dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Over the median 7.7 year follow-up period, 32 participants developed dementia, including 26 cases of AD. Each one standard deviation unit decrease in cardiac index increased the relative risk of both dementia (HR=1.66; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.11–2.47; p=0.013) and AD (HR=1.65; 95% CI, 1.07–2.54; p=0.022). Compared to normal cardiac index, individuals with clinically low cardiac index had a higher relative risk of dementia (HR=2.07; 95% CI, 1.02–4.19; p=0.044). If participants with clinically prevalent CVD and atrial fibrillation were excluded (n=184), individuals with clinically low cardiac index had a higher relative risk of both dementia (HR=2.92; 95% CI, 1.34–6.36; p=0.007) and AD (HR=2.87; 95% CI, 1.21–6.80; p=0.016) compared to individuals with normal cardiac index.

Conclusions

Lower cardiac index is associated with an increased risk for the development of dementia and AD.

Introduction

A poorly understood aspect of cognitive aging is the association between cardiac output and brain aging. Clinical and epidemiological data suggest that after accounting for vascular risk factors, very modest reductions in cardiac output are cross-sectionally associated with worse cognitive performance,1 smaller brain volumes,2 white matter hyperintensities,3 and reduced normative cerebral perfusion values in regions of white matter injury.4 These observations may be due to subclinical systemic blood flow disrupting cerebral blood flow homeostasis, especially among older adults with compromised cerebral circulation control mechanisms.5

Given that multiple vascular risk factors6,7 and prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD)8 increase the risk for dementia, examining relations between systemic hemodynamics and incident dementia may provide essential evidence for future strategies to prevent dementia. Based on prior cross-sectional work,1,2,8 we hypothesized that MRI-assessed cardiac index would be associated with incident dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in community dwelling adults.

Methods

Participants

The Framingham Offspring Study design has been previously described.9 From 1971–1975, 5124 participants were recruited and have been examined approximately every 4 years since. The current sample was derived from 3539 participants attending the 7th Examination Cycle (1998–2001) of which 1677 consented to undergo cardiac MRI between 2002–2006. Figure 1 summarizes inclusion and exclusion criteria for the present study. The study protocol was approved by the local Institutional Review Board, and participants provided written informed consent prior to assessments.

Cardiac Index Measurement

The Framingham Heart Study cardiac MRI protocol has been reported elsewhere.2,10,11 Briefly, supine imaging was performed on a Philips 1.5T scanner with a 5-element commercial cardiac array coil. End-expiratory breath-hold, ECG-gated cine steady state free precession images were acquired in 2-chamber, 4-chamber, and contiguous short axis orientations (temporal resolution, 39ms; repetition time, R-R interval; echo time, 9ms; flip angle, 30°; field of view, 400mm; matrix size, 208x256; slice thickness, 10mm; gap, 0mm). Analyses were performed by an experienced reviewer blinded to clinical information using a clinical workstation (EasyVision 5.1, Philips Medical Systems). End-diastolic volume (EDV) was determined as the minimal cross-sectional area of a midventricular slice. EDV and end-systolic volume (ESV) were computed by summation-of-disks method with cardiac output (L/min) calculated as (EDV-ESV) x heart rate. Cardiac output was divided by body surface area to calculate cardiac index (L/min/m2). Inter-rater reliability correlation coefficient for EDV=0.95 and for ESV=0.92. Intra-observer coefficient of variation for EDV=2.6% and for ESV=3.5%.12 Inter-observer coefficient of variation for EDV=3.5% and ESV=4.8%.12

Incident Dementia &amp; AD Case Definition

Starting at Cycle Examination 5 (beginning in 1991), Offspring participants have been systematically monitored at each Cycle Examination for the development of dementia. Such monitoring includes (a) a cognitive concern by the participant, a family member, or a Framingham study physician or staff member (including concerns about neuropsychological performance), or (b) a Mini-Mental State Examination13 score below an education-based cut-off, 3-points worse than a preceding examination (after Cycle Examination 5), or a 5-point decrement overall (after Cycle Examination 5), which triggers more in-depth testing.14,15 All available neurological examination results, neuropsychological assessment results, study records, hospital records, primary care physician records, neuroimaging records, family interview information, and autopsy results are reviewed by a panel that includes at least one neurologist and at least one neuropsychologist to adjudicate dementia cases, diagnosis dates, and subtypes. Standard diagnostic criteria are used to define dementia,16 plus Framingham criteria require dementia severity be equivalent to or greater than a Clinical Dementia Rating17 global score of 1 and that symptoms be present for a minimum of 6 months. AD type dementia is defined using standard criteria and includes probable and possible AD.18

Covariates

Covariates were defined at the 7th Examination Cycle unless otherwise noted. Education was defined categorically, including no high school degree, high school degree but no college, some college but no college degree, or a college degree. Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score included age, sex, systolic blood pressure, anti-hypertensive medication, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, left ventricular hypertrophy, CVD history, and atrial fibrillation. Systolic blood pressure was the mean of two measurements obtained during the examination by a Framingham Heart Study physician. Diabetes mellitus included previous or current fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL, non-fasting glucose ≥200 mg/dL, or previous or current use of oral hypoglycemic or insulin. Current cigarette smoking (i.e., yes/no within the year prior to examination 7) and medication use were ascertained by self-report. Prior CVD (i.e., coronary heart disease, angina, coronary insufficiency, myocardial infarction, heart failure, intermittent claudication) was defined at the time of cardiac MRI acquisition and obtained via medical histories and Framingham Heart Study physical examinations and electrocardiograms as well as hospitalization and physician records. A panel of three experienced investigators adjudicated CVD events.19 APOE genotyping was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction isotyping.20

Statistical Analysis

For hypothesis testing, Cox proportional hazard regression models examined the association between cardiac index and incident dementia in two models that included covariates based on prior work.21,22 Model 1 adjusted for age (years), sex, and education (categorical). Model 2 adjusted for FSRP (which assigns points for age by sex), education, and apolipoprotein E allele 4 (APOE4) status (i.e., ε4 negative vs. ε4 positive23). Models were repeated restricting the outcome to AD type dementia. A second set of primary analyses repeated the models above treating cardiac index as a categorical variable to align with clinical cut-points of cardiac index. That is, models examined the relative risk of incident dementia between participants with clinically low cardiac index (defined24,25 as &lt;2.5 L/min/m2) and normal cardiac index (referent). Again, models were repeated restricting the outcome to AD type dementia. Secondary analyses were performed on all models excluding participants with prevalent CVD (n=145) and atrial fibrillation (n=66). These exclusions resulted in 5 fewer cases of dementia (including 4 fewer cases of AD) for analyses. Significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Results

Participant Characteristics

The mean sample age was 69±6 years (60–89 years) and 53% were women. Cardiac index was normally distributed in the sample, and low cardiac index (i.e., &lt;2.5 L/min/m2)24 was present in 33% of participants (n=341). After exclusion of individuals with prevalent CVD, low cardiac index was present in 31% of the sample (n=269). Over the median follow-up period of 7.7 years (0–11 years), 32 participants developed dementia, including 26 AD cases. Table 1 summarizes clinical characteristic details for participants included in and excluded from the current analysis.

Continuous Cardiac Index

In models adjusting for age, sex, and education, each one standard deviation unit decrease in cardiac index increased the relative risk of dementia (HR=1.71; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.14–2.57; p=0.01) and AD (HR=1.71; 95% CI, 1.09–2.66; p=0.018). When models were adjusted for education, FSRP, and APOE4 status, findings were essentially unchanged (dementia HR=1.66; 95% CI, 1.11–2.47; p=0.013; AD HR=1.65; 95% CI, 1.07–2.54; p=0.022; see Table 2). When participants with prevalent CVD and atrial fibrillation (n=184) were excluded from the analyses cardiac index was still significantly associated with incident dementia and AD (see Table 2).

Categorical Cardiac Index

In models adjusting for age, sex, and education, participants with impaired cardiac index had a higher risk of dementia (HR=2.15; 95% CI, 1.07–4.32; p=0.032) but not AD (HR=2.21; 95% CI, 1.02–4.81; p=0.095). When models were adjusted for education, FSRP, and APOE4 status, findings were similar such that participants with impaired cardiac index had a significantly increased risk of dementia (HR=2.07; 95% CI, 1.02–4.19; p=0.044) but not AD (HR=2.10; 95% CI, 0.96–4.61; p=0.063). See Table 2 for model details and Figure 2 for an illustration of categorical results using survival curves estimated using Cox regression at the mean of the covariates (age, sex, and education) for low cardiac index and normal cardiac index. When participants with prevalent CVD and atrial fibrillation were excluded, participants with impaired cardiac index had an increased relative risk of both dementia (HR=2.92; 95% CI, 1.34–6.36; p=0.007) and AD (HR=2.87; 95% CI, 1.21–6.80; p=0.016; see Table 2) compared to participants with normal cardiac index.

Discussion

Among community dwelling adults age 60 years and older, we found cardiac index is associated with incident dementia and AD over a median follow-up period of 7.7 years. That is, per one standard deviation unit decrease in cardiac index, the relative risk of incident dementia and AD increased. When cardiac index was examined categorically, participants with clinically low cardiac index had more than a 2-fold increased risk of developing dementia compared with participants with normal cardiac index. When participants with prevalent CVD and atrial fibrillation were excluded, participants with clinically low cardiac index had nearly a 3-fold increased risk of developing both dementia and AD compared to the referents.

Our data are among the first to demonstrate that low cardiac index is related to an increased relative risk of incident dementia and AD in a community-based cohort. The current findings extend our prior cross-sectional research relating cardiac index to neuroimaging phenotypes of AD, including reduced total brain volume and increased lateral ventricular volume.2 Furthermore, our secondary models suggest prevalent CVD and atrial fibrillation do not statistically explain the significant observations in our primary models.

The mechanisms underlying our observations are unknown and likely multifactorial. Human studies suggest autoregulation of cerebral blood velocity in the macrovasculature is preserved in acute settings of orthostatic hypotension.26,27 However, there is limited research assessing cerebral blood flow or perfusion regulation in the setting of chronic reduction (the exception being the extreme clinical model of heart failure28,29). Animal research suggests autoregulatory mechanisms for maintaining cerebral blood flow may not function reliably when cardiac output is manipulated,30 especially in the presence of cerebrovascular injury.31 Therefore, we speculate that one mechanism accounting for our findings is compromised cerebral autoregulation or control mechanisms whereby subtle, chronic reductions in systemic hemodynamics over time disrupt cerebral blood flow in the microvasculature. Such changes could place the brain at greater risk for cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative processes, especially in the presence of concomitant age-related changes in blood brain barrier permeability32 and vascular compliance.33,34 Furthermore, compromised cerebrovascular health has been shown to propagate amyloid deposition,35,36 is associated with compromised β-amyloid clearance,37–39 and contributes to faster clinical manifestation40,41 and trajectory42,43 of AD. Thus, systemic hemodynamics may affect cerebral hemodynamics in those older adults who have compromised cerebral circulation control mechanisms and contribute to the pathogenesis or exacerbation of amyloid deposition and subsequent neuronal injury. That being said, we cannot rule out other possible mechanisms, an epiphenomenon not captured by our covariates, residual confounding, or chance.

Consistent with our prior work in the Framingham Heart Study,2 it is notable that one third of our cohort had cardiac index values below a clinical threshold for abnormal cardiac function (&lt;2.5 L/min/m2). One explanation is that prevalent CVD may have contributed to cardiac dysfunction, resulting in lower cardiac index values. However, the prevalence of low cardiac index was similar when participants with prevalent CVD were excluded; suggesting the low cardiac index seen in our cohort is not explained by clinical heart disease. It is plausible that age-related changes in left ventricular diastolic filling, such as reduced contribution of early atrial filling, impaired left ventricular compliance, or reduced preload, may have contributed to reductions in cardiac output.44,45 Additional research is warranted to identify the mechanisms underlying lower cardiac index in ambulatory older adults, especially if future research replicates the current findings that low cardiac index is a risk factor for incident dementia and AD.

Previous work suggests vascular risk factors modestly increase the risk of AD. For example, hypertension is related to a 1.4-fold increase in incident AD,46 whereas diabetes is related to a 2.4-fold increased risk,46 especially among APOE4 negative elders (HR=2.7).7 In the current study, we report that lower cardiac index increases the relative risk of dementia and AD by approximately two-fold when excluding persons with prevalent CVD and atrial fibrillation and adjusting for key demographic, environmental, and genetic risk factors related to AD, including age, sex, education, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, prevalent CVD, and APOE4 status.6–8,21,22,46

Our study has several strengths, including the large community-based cohort free of clinical dementia and stroke at baseline, comprehensive ascertainment of potential confounders, a precise cardiac imaging technique for quantifying cardiac output in epidemiological cohorts, stringent quality control procedures for cardiac measurement and dementia surveillance, and core laboratory for processing measurements. However, the present findings must be tempered by several caveats. The racial makeup of the Framingham Offspring Study is White, so the generalizability to other races and ethnicities is unknown. Similarly, whether our results are relevant to individuals less than 60 years of age is unknown. Despite the effect size of our findings, it is imperative to highlight the very small number of incident cases as a major limitation to the current methods. There are only 26 dementia cases in total, including 21 cases of AD, which may be due to less sensitive dementia surveillance methods (e.g., utilizing impaired cross-sectional Mini-Mental State Examination performances or performance decrements over time to trigger a more in-depth assessment). It is also a noteworthy limitation that we relied on more traditional criteria for diagnosing dementia and AD rather than more recent criteria, such as recommendations put forth by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association Workgroup.47 Our methodology also did not include neuroimaging measures of cerebral blood flow, cerebrovascular reactivity, or vascular stiffness, which limits our ability to explain the mechanism(s) underlying our observations. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding or chance. The stability of associations reported here and their magnitude should be interpreted with caution until future studies can replicate our findings.

Conclusions

In summary, resting cardiac index is associated with risk for incident dementia and AD, including individuals free of prevalent CVD and atrial fibrillation. We propose that subtle reductions in cardiac index are associated with accelerated pathophysiology of dementia and AD in particular. Further investigation into the mechanisms underlying this increased risk is merited for identifying targets for primary prevention purposes or therapeutic interventions.
