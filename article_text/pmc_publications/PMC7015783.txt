Acetyl salicylic acid, commonly known as aspirin, has been being widely used as an anti-inflammatory drug for almost 100 years. However, there was no receptor known for this popular drug. Recently, we have established that Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor alpha (PPARα) acts as a novel receptor of aspirin. Activation of PPARα by aspirin stimulated a series of downstream signaling pathways that could potentially ameliorate different Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related pathologies. In this mini-review, we have discussed how aspirin-PPARα interaction plays a pivotal role in the amelioration of AD pathology via stimulation of neurotrophic factors, upregulation of plasticity-associated genes and removal of plaque burden in hippocampal neurons.

INTERACTION OF ASPIRIN WITH PPARα

Aspirin is one of the most widely-used medicines in the world (Vane &amp; Botting, 2003; Yamamoto &amp; Gaynor, 2001). As an anti-inflammatory agent, aspirin inhibits the activation of NF-κB via suppression of IKK2 activity (Kopp &amp; Ghosh, 1994; Yin, Yamamoto, &amp; Gaynor, 1998). In addition to its application as an anti-inflammatory drug, aspirin also has therapeutic implications in several cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, strokes, and atherosclerosis and in different forms of cancers (Dai &amp; Ge, 2012; Rothwell et al., 2012). However, in spite of intense investigation, there was no receptor known for this widely-used medication until our recent study, in which we reported that PPARα served as a potent receptor for aspirin (Patel et al., 2018). PPARα plays a central role in fatty acid oxidation, lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress (Berger &amp; Moller, 2002). Considering its involvement in regulating diverse cellular events, much attention has been focused on finding synthetic/endogenous ligands of PPARα that can bind and regulate its transcriptional activity (Göttlicher, Widmark, Li, &amp; Gustafsson, 1992; Issemann &amp; Green, 1990). Being a nuclear hormone receptor, PPARα needs ligands for its function (Feige, Gelman, Michalik, Desvergne, &amp; Wahli, 2006). PPARα has a large ligand-binding domain (LBD) with 1400 A° wide pocket size (Xu et al., 2001). The ligand-binding pocket of PPARα is slightly smaller than that of PPARγ (1600 A°), but larger than that of PPARβ/δ (1300 A°). However, unlike PPARβ and γ, the LBD of PPARα is more lipophilic and less exposed to solvent water allowing lipophilic compounds such as long chain fatty acids to be docked inside the ligand-binding pocket (Xu et al., 2001). Moreover, in case of PPARα, a catalytic triad of Ser280, Tyr314 and His440 of LBD implements a small polar environment (Fig.1) that also permits small polar compounds to be docked inside the ligand-binding groove. These three key residues stabilize the docking of partially polar to highly polar compounds by forming H-bonds. Aspirin is a negatively charged polar (Polar desolvation energy =−56.82 kCal/mol) compound, which could potentially engage with a strong hydrogen bond interaction with Tyr314 and His 440 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, while analyzing the interaction of aspirin with PPARα, using a combination of different biochemical approaches such as time resolved FRET and protein thermal shift assay, we have observed that aspirin forms a strong electrostatic interaction at tyrosine residue (Y314) of PPARα LBD with high affinity (Patel et al., 2018). Accordingly, aspirin failed to induce PPRE-driven luciferase activity in mutated (Y314D) PPARα-transduced Ppara-null astrocytes (Patel et al., 2018), highlighting the functional significance of its interaction with Y314 of PPARα. In fact, aspirin displays the strongest affinity toward the PPARα LBD among different structural homologs including ibuprofen, celecoxib, methyl salicylate, methyl-4-hydroxy benzoate, and naproxen (Patel et al., 2018).

ASPIRIN-PPARα INTERACTION AND NEUROTROPHISM

Previously, it has been shown that PPARα directly binds to the promoter region of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a master regulator of hippocampal formation of memory, promotes the expression of CREB and CREB-dependent neurotrophic factors (A. Roy et al., 2013; A. Roy et al., 2015). Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a downstream target of CREB (Palomer, Carretero, Benvegnù, Dotti, &amp; Martin, 2016), has been long known to directly stimulate the growth and function of hippocampal neurons (Leal, Bramham, &amp; Duarte, 2017; Vicario-Abejón, Owens, McKay, &amp; Segal, 2002). Decreased level of BDNF is also shown to be involved in the progressive loss of memory and cognitive decline in AD patients (Garzon &amp; Fahnestock, 2007). Accordingly, gene delivery of BDNF is found to be beneficial in the restoration of cognitive heath and hippocampal memory in a mouse model of AD (Jiao et al., 2016), suggesting that stimulation of BDNF could be an important therapeutic intervention against AD. Interestingly, our study has revealed that treatment with aspirin alone significantly upregulates the expression of BDNF and other members of the neurotrophin family (NT3, NT4) and its receptor (TrkB) in the hippocampal neurons (Patel et al., 2018). Consistently, aspirin is also found to stimulate the expression of neurotrophins in the hippocampus of 5xFAD animals indicating the therapeutic prospect of aspirin in the treatment of AD. It is interesting to mention that aspirin directly binds to PPARα to promote its nuclear translocation, which in turn triggers the transcription of neurotrophic factors in hippocampal neurons (Patel et al., 2018). Interestingly, embryonic ablation of PPARα in 5xFAD animals (5xFAD/Pparα-null mice) has completely abrogated the aspirin-mediated upregulation of neurotrophic factors, indicating the importance of PPARα in the aspirin-mediated upregulation of growth factors in the hippocampus of AD brain. This discovery has tremendous implication in the treatment of AD, since there are only limited number of pharmacological agents known so far that could augment neurotrophic effects in the hippocampus of AD brain, a region that suffers severe neuronal loss during AD pathogenesis. Previously, statins have been shown to employ PPARα in the upregulation of neurotrophic factors (A. Roy et al., 2015). However, not all statins are effective in crossing BBB. Some statins readily penetrate BBB (e.g.; simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin), whereas others are non-permeable (e.g.; pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and fluvastatin) (Rojas-Fernandez &amp; Cameron, 2012). Therefore, therapeutic efficacy of statins varies from one group to another when brain disorders like AD is concerned. On other hand, aspirin is a better lipophilic molecule than statin. Aspirin can be easily modified into more lipophilic derivative for easy transportation across biomembranes like BBB (J. Roy, Adili, Kulmacz, Holinstat, &amp; Das, 2016).

ASPIRIN-PPARα INTERACTION AND SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY

Synaptic plasticity of hippocampal neurons is controlled by a set of ion channels that regulates entry of calcium ions through dendritic spines modulating synaptic strength and neuronal communication through synaptic transmission (Voglis &amp; Tavernarakis, 2006). Upon binding with NMDA and AMPA, these receptors augment ionotropic influx of calcium ions, which triggers a series of intracellular signaling events leading to the phosphorylation of CREB, a master regulator of long-term memory formation (Monti, Marri, &amp; Contestabile, 2002; Perkinton, Sihra, &amp; Williams, 1999). Ionotropic calcium entry also regulates the transmission of nerve signal in a form of action potential and plays a direct role in neurotransmitter release (Neher &amp; Sakaba, 2008). Therefore, regulations of these receptors have long-lasting implications in the induction of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. Previously, it has been reported that the expression of these receptor genes including Gria1(encoding GluR1, a subunit of AMPA receptor), Dlg4 (encoding PSD95) and Grin2a (encoding NR2A, a subunit of NMDA receptor) is directly controlled by the activation of PPARα and accordingly, hippocampus of the Pparα-null mice is associated with decreased expression of these receptors (A. Roy et al., 2016). Interesting, while analyzing the involvement of same PPARα in aspirin-mediated neuroprotective effects (Fig. 2), our study reveals that low-dose aspirin enhances hippocampal levels of PSD95, NR2A and GluR1 in 5xFAD, but not 5xFAD/Pparα-null, mice (Patel et al., 2018). The role of aspirin has also been evaluated in the synthesis and maturation of dendritic spines (Patel et al., 2018). The maturation can be tested with quantitative estimation of spine size and density, whereas the function of these spines can be monitored with NMDA- and AMPA-dependent ionotropic calcium influx assay. Interestingly, aspirin stimulates the synthesis, maturation and activity of these dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons. Consistently, treatment of aspirin has also elicited a strong calcium influx through NMDA- and AMPA-type glutamate receptors as measured in hippocampal slices from 5xFAD mice (Patel et al., 2018). Surprisingly, aspirin fails to evoke similar AMPA- and NMDA-mediated calcium currents in Pparα-null hippocampal neurons and 5xFAD/Pparα-null mice (Patel et al., 2018). Furthermore, while evaluating the molecular interaction of aspirin and PPARα in the regulation of ionotropic calcium influx, our study suggests that the interaction of aspirin at the Y314 residue of PPARα is crucial for the activation of NMDA- and AMPA-dependent calcium entry (Patel et al., 2018). Accordingly, the molecular crosstalk of aspirin and PPARα is also critical in the recovery of cognitive deficits in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. While oral aspirin restores memory deficits in 5xFAD mice, 5xFAD/Pparα-null mice remain unresponsive to aspirin treatment (Patel et al., 2018), suggesting that PPARα is critical in aspirin-mediated recovery of cognitive deficits.

ASPIRIN-PPARα INTERACTION AND AMELIORATION OF AMYLOID-BETA (Aβ) PLAQUES.

It is well accepted that the dysregulation of the Aβ synthesis followed by the appearance of senile plaques in cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain are pathological hallmarks of AD (Butterfield &amp; Boyd-Kimball, 2004; Selkoe, 2001; Shankar et al., 2008). However, until now no effective therapy is available to reduce the burden of senile plaques from AD brain. Interestingly, oral administration of low-dose aspirin is shown to be involved in the lowering of plaque burden from the hippocampus of 5xFAD animals (Chandra, Jana, &amp; Pahan, 2018). The endosomal-lysosomal and autophagic-lysosomal systems play central roles in energy metabolism and cellular sorting and clearance of damaged organelles and abnormal proteins (Settembre, Fraldi, Medina, &amp; Ballabio, 2013). Mounting evidences have linked the alteration and disruption of these trafficking and degradative pathways in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD (Ghavami et al., 2014; Nixon, 2013; Nixon, Yang, &amp; Lee, 2008). Several reports indicate that under different physiological and pathological conditions including AD (Xiao et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2015), the functioning of lysosomes-mediated degradative pathways are regulated by transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis (Martini-Stoica, Xu, Ballabio, &amp; Zheng, 2016; Sardiello et al., 2009), and therefore suggest that TFEB-targeted lysosomal modulation can be a promising treatment strategy against various neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Interestingly, aspirin has been shown to be involved in the upregulation of TFEB (Chandra et al., 2018). The aspirin-mediated stimulation of lysosomal activity is further demonstrated with the quantitative estimation of increased numbers of lysosomes and subsequent stimulation of autophagy (Chandra et al., 2018). Interestingly, the failure of aspirin to induce lysosomal activity followed by the unsuccessful attenuation Aβ plaques in the hippocampus of 5xFAD/Ppara-null animals (Chandra et al., 2018) suggests that aspirin requires PPARα to clear hippocampal plaque load in a mouse model of AD.

CONCLUSION

Is aspirin a prospective drug for memory impairment in AD?

Dementia is the earliest and most prominent symptom associated with progressive AD (D. S. Roy et al., 2016). Unfortunately, until now all FDA-approved medications are unable stop the disease progression and can only provide a limited symptomatic relief, exhibiting a number of undesirable side effects. Most likely, the limited success of different therapeutic interventions is due to the complexity of the disease pathology. A growing body of evidences suggests that AD is associated with multimodal pathologies triggered by concurrent occurrence of various fundamental changes in the cellular signaling pathways including impairment of endosomal/lysosomal pathways (Nixon, Mathews, &amp; Cataldo, 2001), disruption of calcium homeostasis (Small, 2009), loss of synaptic plasticity (Selkoe, 2002) and downregulation of hippocampal neurotrophic factors (Garzon &amp; Fahnestock, 2007). Therefore, considering the heterogeneous nature of AD, it is highly necessary to find safer drugs that can intervene at multiple steps and can improve AD-associated memory loss. Our research has shown that aspirin, one of world’s oldest pharmaceutical agents, exhibits a diverse range of effects in the amelioration AD pathogenesis and subsequent protection of hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2). Although some studies indicate beneficial role of aspirin in AD (Chang, Horng, Hsu, &amp; Chen, 2016; Etminan, Gill, &amp; Samii, 2003; Nilsson et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2015), couple of studies contradict such favorable function of aspirin. For instance, Kelly et al (Kelley et al., 2015) do not find any significant relationship between the daily aspirin use and cognitive change over 2 to 6 years of follow-up after controlling for the impact of age. Similarly, in another study (Veronese et al., 2017), aspirin does not influence the onset of dementia in observational studies and improve cognitive test scores in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in older participants without dementia. One of the possible explanations for such contradictory findings could be linked to PPARα, a nuclear receptor that is abundant in the hippocampus (A. Roy et al., 2013; A. Roy &amp; Pahan, 2015).

Is PPARα essential for aspirin?

Similar to other nuclear receptors, PPARα also requires interaction with small molecular ligands for its nuclear translocation, binding to the promoters and transcription of the downstream genes. We have demonstrated that PPARα displays a strong affinity towards compounds with long aliphatic sidechains such as very long-chain fatty acids including 9-octadecenamide and hexadecanamide (A. Roy et al., 2016). In addition, PPARα also exhibits strong affinity towards small molecules such as statins and cinnamic acid (Chandra, Roy, Jana, &amp; Pahan, 2019; A. Roy et al., 2015; A. Roy et al., 2016). This extremely diverse selection of ligands is achieved due to the amphipathic nature of LBD of PPARα. A ligand-binding triad of S280, Y314 and Y464 (Fig. 1) is critical for the interaction of PPARα with small molecules. Accordingly, our insilico study supported with other biochemical analyses clearly indicated that aspirin served as a strong ligand of PPARα. This finding has resolved the mystery behind the mode of action of aspirin and revolutionized the current concept of aspirin-mediated prevention of neurodegenerative pathologies. In fact, the absence of PPARα strongly inhibits aspirin-mediated upregulation of neurotrophic factors and plasticity-associated genes in hippocampus (Patel et al., 2018). Moreover, without PPARα, aspirin is unable to stimulate lysosomal biogenesis and augment autophagic clearance of Aβ plaques in 5xFAD mouse model of AD (Chandra et al., 2018). Furthermore, reversal of cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice is solely dependent on PPARα (Patel et al., 2018). Therefore, the interaction of aspirin with its novel receptor PPARα is necessary to render aspirin mediated neuroprotection against AD-associated pathologies. Future studies should be directed to decipher how aspirin may act alone and in concert with PPARα in AD patients, which may be critical to our understanding in repurposing aspirin as a potential therapy for AD.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT

Acetyl salicylic acid or aspirin, a widely-used medication in the world, is mostly known for its ability to inhibit the cyclooxygenase pathway. Despite its long history, until recently, no receptor was known for aspirin. Recently, we have delineated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), a nuclear hormone receptor involved in fatty acid metabolism, serves as a receptor of aspirin. Upon binding to the ligand-binding domain of PPARα, aspirin increases the production of neurotrophic factors, promotes synaptic plasticity and stimulates the clearance of amyloid plaques.
