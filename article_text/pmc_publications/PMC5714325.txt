Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder that is influenced by genetic and environmental risk factors, such as inheritance of ε4 allele of APOE (APOE4), sex and diet. Here, we examined the effect of high fat diet (HFD) on amyloid pathology and expression profile in brains of AD model mice expressing human APOE isoforms (APP/E3 and APP/E4 mice). APP/E3 and APP/E4 mice were fed HFD or Normal diet for 3 months. We found that HFD significantly increased amyloid plaques in male and female APP/E4, but not in APP/E3 mice. To identify differentially expressed genes and gene-networks correlated to diet, APOE isoform and sex, we performed RNA sequencing and applied Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis. We determined that the immune response network with major hubs Tyrobp/DAP12, Csf1r, Tlr2, C1qc and Laptm5 correlated significantly and positively to the phenotype of female APP/E4-HFD mice. Correspondingly, we found that in female APP/E4-HFD mice, microglia coverage around plaques, particularly of larger size, was significantly reduced. This suggests altered containment of the plaque growth and sex-dependent vulnerability in response to diet. The results of our study show concurrent impact of diet, APOE isoform and sex on the brain transcriptome and AD-like phenotype.

1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by dementia and morphologically by senile plaques and tangles. There are two forms of AD – an early onset, relatively rare familial form, and a sporadic, Late Onset AD (LOAD), that encompasses the vast majority of AD cases. LOAD bears the characteristics of a multifactorial disease where the risk is a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors [1]. The inheritance of APOEε4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the major genetic risk factor for LOAD. Carriers of this allele are characterized by earlier onset of the disease and higher level of deposited amyloid plaques. At the same time, homozygous APOEε3 AD patients still account for the majority of LOAD cases, suggesting additional genetic, environmental and life-style factors as risk modifiers. The main function of APOE is to transport cholesterol and other lipids in the form of HDL and VLDL in periphery, or HDL-like lipoproteins in the brain [2, 3], but its role in LOAD remains poorly understood. So far the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified at least 20 additional gene variants affecting the risk for LOAD [1, 4, 5]. Most prominent among those is a rare variant of the gene encoding Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which is associated with a risk of LOAD at a level close to the risk conferred by APOEε4 allele [1, 6].

In addition to genetic variants, environmental and life-style factors including diet have been associated with the development of AD pathology [7]. Among those, high fat/high cholesterol diet (HFD) is one with several possible connections. First, the system-wide effects of HFD on the CNS are associated with APOE, as an important component of the circulating lipoproteins and the major brain cholesterol transporter. A recent study demonstrated an interaction of APOE4 isoform and insulin resistance in response to HFD that impairs cognitive function in model mice expressing human APOE [8]. Second, epidemiological studies have reported the potential link between vascular dementia and LOAD risk factors, such as hypertension, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes [9], which increase the cognitive impairment and the burden of dementia [10] especially in midlife [11]. Importantly, the above mentioned risk factors are all strongly associated with dietary patterns, and Western diet in particular [12–14]. Third, numerous studies using mouse models of AD reported that in adult mice, HFD aggravates cognitive deficit and AD related pathology, such as amyloid deposition and neuroinflammation [15–21]. Recently, we have reported that in brain of middle aged APP23 mice, HFD increases the expression of genes that regulate the immune response and TREM2 immunoreactivity. In contrast, HFD decreased the expression of genes related to neuron projections, GABA and dopamine signaling, in agreement to the significantly deteriorated neurite morphology and cognition [21].

The complexity of LOAD, encompassing interactions between age, APOE genotype as a major genetic risk factor, other contributing genetic variants, and environmental factors, complicates the interpretation of studies aimed at understanding AD pathogenesis and the pursuit of a successful strategy for therapeutic intervention. Network-based approaches [22] are particularly relevant in integrating the information contained in high-throughput datasets, linking it to a certain phenotype. These approaches not only connect the genes or gene products in one network and identify the most connected members of a given pathway, but elucidate their relevance to the clinical or experimental findings. A network based strategy for analysis of sequencing datasets increases the prospects for clarifying the biological processes leading to LOAD and other complex multifactorial diseases.

The aim of this study was to test the effect of HFD as an environmental factor, that acts chronically, on the phenotype of AD model mice expressing human APOE3 or APOE4 isoforms and to correlate the results to the brain transcriptome. To identify networks significantly affected by diet and APOE isoforms, we performed Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and identified immune response as significantly affected by diet, sex and APOE isoform. We confirmed the phenotypic changes induced by HFD and mediated by APOE isoform in microglia.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Animals and Diets

All animal experiments were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. APP/PS1ΔE9 mice were bred to targeted replacement APOE3+/+ and APOE4+/+ mice to generate APP/PS1ΔE9/APOE3+/+ and APP/PS1ΔE9/APOE4+/+ (referred to as APP/E3 and APP/E4, respectively) [23]. Males and females were randomly assigned to Normal diet (ND, Prolab Isopro RMH 3000, Lab Diet) or HFD (D12079B RD Western Diet, Research Diets) at a mean age of 3.5 months and fed for a 3 month period. HFD (D12079B RD Western Diet, Research Diets) supplements 40% calories from fat (fat was provided as anhydrous milk fat and corn oil), 16.8% from protein, and 42.6% from carbohydrates. ND (Prolab Isopro RMH 3000, Lab Diet) supplements 14.3% from fat, 26.0 % from protein, and 59.65 % from carbohydrates.

2.2. Measurements of plasma cholesterol, phospholipid and glucose

Blood samples were collected from non-fasted mice and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 5 min for separating the plasma. The plasma was then collected and snap-frozen on dry ice. The level of plasma cholesterol and phospholipid levels were measured using Cholesterol Quantitation Kit and Phospholipid Assay Kit (Sigma), respectively. For measurement of plasma glucose, we used Glucose Assay Kit (Abcam). All analyses were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.

2.3. Processing of mouse brain tissue

Mice were anesthetized with Avertin (250 mg/kg of body weight, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with cold 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4. The left hemisphere was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histology and the cortex was dissected from the other and snap frozen on dry ice for RNA and protein isolation [24]. All procedures were as reported previously [25]. Briefly, hemibrains were cut in the coronal plane at 30 µm sections and stored in a glycol-based cryoprotectant at −20°C until use. Serial sections were selected 700 µm apart, starting from approximately 150 µm caudal to the first appearance of the CA3 and dentate gyrus.

2.4. Immunohistochemistry and Quantitative Analysis of amyloid pathology

The sections were immunostained with 6E10 biotinylated antibody (Covance) as before [25, 26]. Briefly, free-floating sections were blocked for endogenous peroxidases, avidin-biotin quenched, antigen retrieval performed with 70% formic acid, and tissue blocked with 3% normal goat serum. Sections were then incubated in 6E10 biotinylated antibody (1:1000) at room temperature for 2 hours before being developed with Vectastain ABC Elite kit (Vector Labs) and DAB substrate. Amyloid pathology in the cortex and hippocampus was evaluated on 5–6 stained brain sections per mouse using Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope (10× magnification). To quantify Aβ plaques, an image intensity threshold was established to detect the 6E10 stained plaques. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn around the cortex or hippocampus, and 6E10 staining values were represented as area of 6E10 staining normalized to ROI area or percentage of area covered by 6E10 stain. All 6E10 analysis was performed with Nikon NIS Element software.

For microglia coverage of the plaques, brain sections were incubated with IBA-1 primary antibody (1:200, Wako Chemicals) overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with secondary Dylight 594 labeled antibody (1:1000, Vector Labs) for 2 hours at RT. Once mounted on slides sections were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. Compact cortical plaques were stained with X-34 (1,4-bis(3-carboxy-4-hydroxyphenylethenyl)-benzene, 100 µM) as before [25]. The microglia coverage was quantified as before with slight modification [27]. Briefly, ~25 plaques were imaged per animal from 6 separate, 30 µm brain sections with each section approximately 1080 µm apart, covering an area in the brain from bregma −1.2 mm and ending at bregma −3.9 mm (~100 plaques per group). Selected X-34 positive plaques were imaged on a Nikon 90i (20×) and plaque size was determined by tracing the perimeter of each, and then calculating the area using NIS elements. Number of microglia, determined by Hoechst 33342 surrounded by IBA-1 staining, were counted within 20 µm of the edge of the plaque. Microglia coverage was calculated as the percentage of plaque perimeter contacted by IBA-1 positive microglia processes.

2.5. RNA isolation, qPCR and sequencing

All procedures were performed as before [24, 28]. RNA was isolated from the frontal cortex and purified using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed using 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and samples with RIN &gt; 8 were used for library construction. Sequencing libraries were generated using mRNA Library Prep Reagent Set (Illumina). The libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000 at the Functional Genomics Core, University of Pennsylvania (http://fgc.genomics.upenn.edu/). All FASTQ files were processed using Subread-featureCounts-limma/voom pipeline [29, 30] and the differential expression was analyzed by edgeR package v3.16.5 (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) in R environment (v3.3.3).

2.6. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)

We performed WGCNA (version 1.60, Bioconductor) as previously [31–33]. Co-expression networks were created with a raw count exclusion so that genes below 5 reads per million mapped were removed to eliminate noise. Samples were separated by sex and clustered by gene expression profile to identify the outliers. A scale free topology model was applied to the data and weighted networks were constructed by Pearson correlation between all pairs of genes and used to determine the power for the remainder of each analysis. Modules (functional networks) were detected using automatic block detection with a minimum module size of 100 and merging height of module clustering for genes of 0.25. Generated modules were assigned an arbitrary color, then correlated with trait data – APP/E3-ND, APP/E3-HFD, APP/E4-ND and APP/E4-HFD. Within the modules, hub genes were identified by module membership (MM; &gt;0.8), which is the connectivity between genes and a given module, and gene significance (GS; &gt;0.2), which is the correlation between gene expression and trait/phenotype. Gene-association networks of interest were visualized using Cytoscape v3.3.0 (http://www.cytoscape.org/).

2.7. Functional pathway analysis

Functional annotation clustering was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery v6.8 (DAVID; https://david-d.ncifcrf.gov)[34] and Gene set enrichment Analysis v3.0 (GSEA; https://www.broadinstitute.org/GSEA) [35, 36]. For GSEA, RNA-seq data were compared with gene sets of the Biological process (BP, c5.bp.v5.1.symbols.gmt) in Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). The clusters of enriched gene ontology (GO) terms from DAVID (p-value cutoff of &lt;0.01) were visualized using REVIGO (http://revigo.irb.hr) with a similarity threshold of 0.7 [37].

2.8. Statistics

The results are reported as means ± SEM. Two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons test was used when analyzing amyloid pathology (6E10 staining) with diet and sex as main variables. Microglia coverage was analyzed by one- way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test, or by two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. Differential gene expression is analyzed by edgeR v3.16.5 (R software environment, v3.3.3). Statistics of the module-trait relationship heatmap in WGCNA are based on a Student asymptotic p-value for correlation, and statistics used to calculate the correlation between MM and GS were based on Pearson correlation. Differences were considered significant when p&lt;0.05. Unless otherwise indicated, statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism version 6.0.

3. Results

3.1. High fat diet and sex affect amyloid phenotype in APP/E4 mice

Our goal was to examine how HFD affects brain transcriptome in correlation to amyloid pathology of APP transgenic mice. We used APP/PS1ΔE9 mouse model expressing human APOE3 or APOE4 isoforms (referred to as APP/E3 and APP/E4). We chose to start diet treatment at the age of 3.5 months, a time point coinciding with the onset of amyloid pathology in this AD mouse model. The rationale is to test the effect of diet on the early stages of amyloid phenotype and determine if the diet accelerates the pathology. Since the effect of APOE4 on amyloid plaques is well-known, APP/E3 and APP/E4 mice were assessed separately. As previously shown by our group [15, 38], HFD with this specific composition increased body weight (Fig. S1A and B) and plasma cholesterol (Suplemental Fig. S1C and D) in all groups. HFD did not affect plasma phospholipids (Suppl Fig. S1E and F) and increased slightly blood glucose in male APP/E3 mice (Fig. S1G and H).

As shown on Fig. 1B and C, the analysis of cortical and hippocampal amyloid plaques in APP/E3 mice demonstrated that mouse sex affected amyloid pathology in both regions but there was no effect of diet. For APP/E4 mice, as visible from Fig. 1E, there was a significant interaction between diet and sex (F(1,24)=4.304, p=0.0489) to affect cortical amyloid. In hippocampus there was no interaction between sex and diet but significant main effect of sex (F(1,24)=10.13, p=0.004) and diet (F(1,24)=4.583, p=0.0427) on the amyloid load (Fig. 1F). Our conclusion is that diet and sex interact to increase amyloid deposition specifically in the cortex of APP/E4 mice.

3.2. Integrated system approach identifies Networks correlated to HFD in female and male APP/E4 mice

To examine how HFD and APOE genotype interact to modulate the brain transcriptome, we performed RNA-seq on samples taken from the frontal cortex and analyzed the differential gene expression. Since there were 3 factors, diet, APOE genotype, and sex, that can potentially affect gene expression, we performed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify gene networks significantly affected [33, 39, 40]. WGCNA organizes the gene expression patterns in functional networks (modules) summarized to a ‘module eigengene’ (ME) in correlation to the phenotypic traits or experimental conditions [32, 41]. In this experiment, the networks that have been identified were correlated to the phenotype of each group.

Due to the significant sex difference (Fig. 1), male and female mice were analyzed separately. In Fig. 2A, the heatmap of Module-Trait Relationships visualizes the correlation between the phenotype of each group and modules (networks) for females. Positive correlations are in red, negative in blue, and the intensity of the color corresponds to the strength of the correlation. We were particularly interested in networks affected by HFD significantly and uniquely either in APP/E4 or APP/E3 mice. Based on gene significance (GS) across modules (Fig. 2B and C), for downstream analysis we selected lightcyan module that correlated positively only to APP/E4 mice on HFD (marked with asterisks on Fig. 2A).

3.2.1. Networks affected by HFD in females

As seen in Fig. 2A, in female mice, lightcyan module correlated significantly and positively only to APP/E4 mice fed HFD (correlation coefficient=0.62, p=3.0 × 10−04). The interpretation of the positive correlation is that HFD increases the expression of the gene-members of this module in female APP/E4 mice (Fig. 3A). Functionally, lightcyan module (module size=220 genes) is enriched in genes connected to “Immune response” (p=4.69 ×10−26) and “Innate immune process” (p=2.23 ×10−8; Supplemetal Table S1). In this module, the hub genes, i.e. the genes with highest connectivity, which can be considered causal regulators, such as Tyrobp/DAP12, Csf1r, Tlr2, C1qc and Laptm5, are those associated with immune processes (Fig. 3B). Importantly, this module is also enriched in microglia specific genes. For reference, we used lists of genes classified by two previous studies; defined as a “sensome” and as a “signature” for adult microglia among the cell types in adult brain [42, 43]. We identified 44 out of 220 genes as microglia-specific with a fold enrichment of 49 – Csf1r, Csf3r, Cx3cr1, P2ry12, P2ry13, Gpr34, Siglech and Trem2 among them. mRNA levels of some of the hub genes - Csf1r, Csf3r, Tyrobp and Laptm5, as determined by their mRNA-seq values are shown on Fig. 3C, demonstrating that their expression is significantly increased by the diet.

3.2.2. HFD increases the expression of immune response related genes in female APP/E4 mice

Since we found that the network related to immune response positively correlates uniquely to female APP/E4 fed HFD, we examined the genes that are differentially affected by diet in female APP/E4 mice. To determine the biological significance of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, we summarized and visualized the redundant GO terms by semantic clustering with REVIGO (Fig. 4A, Up-regulated).

Among GO terms significantly up-regulated by diet (p&lt;0.01), we found several clusters that are associated with immune response such as “Innate immune response”, “Phagocytosis”, “Regulation of cell migration” and “Positive regulation of NFκB activity” (See Fig. 4A, Up-regulated). Most significant down-regulated categories in female APP/E4 mice fed HFD were “Learning”, “Long-term synaptic potentiation” and “Protein phosphorylation” (Fig. 4A, Down-regulated).

As seen on Fig. 4B and C, genes related to innate immune response; including toll-like receptors (Tlr2, Tlr3 and Tlr7), IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAKs; Irak1 and Irak4) and Interferon regulatory factors (Irf3 and Irf7), were significantly upregulated in the HFD group. Importantly, we also found that the expression of genes associated with TREM2/TYROBP signaling pathway such as Tyrobp, Syk, Siglech, Vav2, Pik3ap and Lcp2 is significantly increased by HFD. The expression of Trem2 was also increased but it did not reach a statitistical significance.

3.2.3. Networks affected by HFD in males

Next, we identified the networks that are uniquely affected by diet in APP/E3 and APP/E4 male mice (Fig. 5). Based on mean gene significance (GS) across the modules (Fig. 5B) and the correlation of module membership (MM) and GS (Fig. 5C), we selected for further examination tan module, which correlates uniquely to male APP/E4 mice on HFD (correlation coefficient=0.55, p=0.006). Functionally, the tan module (size = 360 genes) consists of genes related to “Transcription” (p =6.36 ×10−8), such as Nr4a3/NOR1, Egr1, Fosl2 and Rara. This module is also associated with the biological functions “Apoptosis” (p =1.64 ×10−4) and “Immune system process” (p =0.013, Supplemental Table S1). Hub genes in the tan module were mainly transcription factors, including genes involved in regulation of circadian rhythm (Per1 and Klf10), immune response, such as the nuclear receptor family (Nr4a1 and Nr4a3/NOR1), [44] and the Egr family (Egr1 and Egr2) (Fig. 6B and C).

3.2.4. HFD increases the expression of genes associated with transcription in APP/E4 male mice

To determine genes and categories differentially affected by diet in male APP/E4 mice, we compared the transcriptional profile for both diets of this genotype followed by gene ontology analysis. Enriched biological functions for 662 differentially expressed genes (313 up- and 349 down-regulated genes by HFD) revealed that “Regulation of transcription” (p =1.89 ×10−5) and “Learning” (p =3.68 ×10−4) are the most significantly affected up-regulated categories by HFD in male APP/E4 mice. The most down-regulated category was “Multicellular organism development” (p =7.59 ×10−5). Interestingly, “Positive regulation of cell migration” (p =0.002) that has a role in microglia function [45] was an up-regulated category by diet in both female and male APP/E4 mice (Fig. 7).

3.3. Microglia barrier around amyloid plaques is affected by diet and sex in APP/E4 mice

As we have shown on Fig. 1, HFD increased amyloid load only in APP/E4 male and female mice. Furthermore, WGCNA identified microglia enriched networks that correlated significantly only to APP/E4 mice on HFD. Therefore, we were interested in whether HFD affects microglia barrier/coverage around cortical amyloid plaques in APP/E4 mice of both sexes. The plaques were stained with X-34, microglia with IBA-1, and nuclei with Hoechst 33342 (Fig. 8A).

We counted the number of microglia within 20 µm of the plaque perimeter and found that there was no significant difference between the groups (Fig. 8B). Next, we quantified the microglia coverage as the percentage of plaque perimeter contacted by microglia processes. In both males and females, HFD decreased microglial coverage, but the difference was statistically significant only in the females (Fig. 8C). Additional analysis by two-way ANOVA demonstrated an effect of diet (F(1, 398)= 9.222, p=0.0025) and sex (F(1, 398)= 4.159, p=0.0421), but Sidac’s post-hoc test showed statistical significance only in females (p &lt; 0.01). We also found that microglia coverage in APP/E4 female mice on HFD was significantly reduced around larger plaques (area &gt; 200 µm2). The results show that in APP/E4 mice, the microglia barrier around amyloid plaques is decreased by HFD an effect that is more pronounced in the female mice.

4. Discussion

Here we demonstrate that HFD interacts with APOE isoform and sex to affect amyloid phenotype and brain transcriptome in AD mouse model expressing human APOE. A number of previous studies have shown that there is an APOE isoform-specific effect on amyloid plaques and immune response in the brain [46, 47]. However, how the combination of these genetic – APOEε4 and environmental factors – HFD, influence the phenotypic and transcriptional changes in the brain is still not clear. In the present study, we found that HFD affected amyloid plaques only in APP/E4 mice, especially in females, suggesting that expression of APOE4 isoform is a trait more susceptible to environmental challenges such as diet. This result is reminiscent to our prior study showing that the deficiency of one copy of Abca1 increased amyloid deposition and worsened cognition in APP/E4, but not in APP/E3 mice [23]. Consistent with our findings, a recent study shows increased amyloid deposition and glial activation in male 5xFAD mice expressing human APOE4, fed HFD [48]. The attenuated response of APP/E3 mice in both studies, as compared to their APP/E4 counterparts, suggests that in the presence of amyloid pathology, expression of APOE3 isoform renders the mice less vulnerable to additional environmental or genetic challenges.

Considering the complexity of our study, we chose network analysis as the most appropriate tool to correlate the gene expression data to diet, APOE isoform, and sex. WGCNA is an unbiased approach that organizes genes into functional networks (modules) based on topological overlap between the genes and is widely used to investigate and reveal candidate target genes in several diseases [49–51]. Using WGCNA, we identified distinct networks that significantly correlated to HFD and APOE4 isoform in females and in males.

Whereas HFD increased amyloid deposition similarly in female and male APP/E4 mice, the HFD effect on gene expression in both sexes of mice expressing APP/E4 was different. In the female APP/E4 the network that correlated poisitively to HFD group was associated with immune response and in male APP/E4 mice with transcription. Immune and innate immune responses network affected by diet in female APP/E4 contained main hub genes Tyrobp, Csf1r, Laptm5, Dock2, Itgam/Cd11b and Cd68. Previously, using WGCNA analysis on a large cohort of human AD and control samples, not stratified by APOE genotype, Zhang et al. identified TYROBP, DOCK2, LY86 and FCER1G as causal regulators [39]. This module/network was also highly enriched in the cluster of microglial genes involved in sensing of pathogens (sensome), indicating an altered susceptibility to environmental challenges in female APP/E4 mice.

We also found significantly increased expression of genes encoding downstream targets for the ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif)-signaling cascade such as Syk and Vav2; Siglech and the major hub gene Tyrobp were signficiantly increased in female APP/E4 mice fed HFD. Several receptors in microglia interact with ITAM-containing adapter proteins, such as TYROBP to trigger phagocytic activity. Recent studies report that SIGLECH can associate with TYROBP via a charged, transmembrane lysine residue and promote phagocytosis [52–54]. Since expression of Trem2 was not significantly affected by HFD, we speculate that in APP/E4-HFD mice SIGLECH/TYROBP complex is mainly involved in activation of immune response. In contrast, there were no networks correlated significantly with HFD in either female, or male APP/E3 mice. The interpretation of these findings is that the chronic amyloid deposition in this AD model sensitizes the immune cells in the brain and creates an environment of persistent microglia activation. While the analysis of brain cell specific transcriptomes was not a goal in this study, the predominant changes in expression level of microglia signature genes strongly supports the above interpretation. Altogether, it is reasonable to expect that the mice with the highest levels of amyloid plaques, i.e. female APP/E4 in this experiment, were more sensitive to the challenges presented by the diet.

The reduction of microglia barrier around the plaques by HFD in APP/E4 mice was another important finding of the study. Microglia surround plaques as a barrier to prevent extension of neurotoxic Aβ fibrils [55]. A recent study has also shown that microglia depletion increased plaque size but not the number of plaques and the plaque size was stabilized following microglia repopulation [56], suggesting an important role for microglia in plaque growth. We observed a significantly reduced percentage of microglia coverage around larger plaques (area &gt; 200 µm2) by HFD in female APP/E4 mice, but not in the smaller plaques, whereas there was no significant difference in the number of microglia around plaques. We also found less microglia coverage around larger plaques in male APP/E4 mice on HFD compared to ND counterparts, but the effect was not significant. Thus, the sex-dependent differences in APP/E4 microglia barrier function is probably associated with the differential capacity of microglia to phagocytose Aβ, apoptotic bodies or neuronal debris. The results suggest that HFD can impair the containment of the plaque growth, while there is no diet or sex dependent alteration in recruitment of microglia around plaques (Fig. 8B).

In summary, using an integrated network analysis in a mouse model of AD we revealed changes in AD pathology and transcription profile in response to multifactorial stimulation (HFD, sex and APOE isoform) that could further elucidate AD pathogenic mechanisms and provide opportunities for identification of therapeutic targets.

5. Conclusions

This study demonstrates that the effect of HFD in model mice expressing human APOE is complex, and AD-like phenotype correlates to changes in mouse brain transcriptome. We determined Tyrobp as a main hub gene within the immune response network that shows positive correlation with the phenotype of female APP/E4 fed HFD. We also found sex-specific vulnerability in response to HFD in female microglia, even though amyloid plaque load was increased in both male and female APP/E4 mice fed HFD.

Fig. 1 Effect of diet and sex on amyloid plaques deposition in APP/E3 and APP/E4 mice

Amyloid plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/E3 and APP/E4 mice fed ND and HFD were stained with anti-Aβ antibody 6E10. Two-way ANOVA with diet and sex as main variables was used to calculate the interaction. Representative images (A) and quantification (B and C) of Aβ plaques in APP/E3 mice. Amyloid plaques in Cortex (B) and Hippocampus (C). There is no interaction between the variables; there is a significant main effect of sex (F(1,21)=9.096, p=0.0066) in cortex, but not of diet on total amyloid deposition. N=6–7 mice/sex/group. Representative images (D) and quantification (E and F) of Aβ plaques in APP/E4 mice. E, Amyloid plaques in Cortex. There is a significant interaction between diet and sex (F(1,24)=4.304, p=0.0489). *, p&lt;0.05, ***, p&lt;0.001 by Sidak’s multiple comparison test as shown on the graph. F, Amyloid plaques in Hippocampus. There is no interaction and significant main effect of sex (F(1,24)=10.13, p=0.004) and diet (F(1,24)=4.583, p=0.0427). N=6–8 mice/sex/genotype/group. For A and D, scale bar = 250 µm.

Fig. 2 WGCNA reveals Gene-Networks positively correlated to HFD in female APP/E4 mice

WGCNA was used to determine the correlation of module eigengenes to diet and APOE genotype in female mice. (A) Heatmap of Module-Trait Relationships shows significant eigengene networks in female mice. Red denotes positive and blue – negative correlation; the intensity of the color corresponds to the strength of the correlation. Modules selected in this study are marked by an asterisk (*). (B) Bar plot representing the module significance (MS) in female APP/E4-HFD mice. MS denotes the mean of the absolute gene significance (GS) values across all modules for the trait HFD. Lightcyan module shows the highest GS, implying that gene expression within the lightcyan module is strongly associated with HFD in APP/E4 mice. (C) Scatter plot showing the correlation between module membership (MM) and GS of the lightcyan module for female APP/E4-HFD mice. Correlation value and p-value are indicated on the plot. Red color indicates the hub genes in the module. The statistics used to calculate the correlation between MM and GS was based on Pearson correlation. N= 7–8 mice/group.
