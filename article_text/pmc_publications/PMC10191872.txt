retinal imaging

pmcAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive form of dementia, affecting more than six million people in the US.1 AD is typically late-onset with neuropathological changes occurring years before clinical symptoms appear.2 Currently, the definitive diagnosis still relies on post-mortem identification of pathological hallmarks including extracellular aggregations of amyloid beta (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) containing hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau).3 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can provide information about Aβ and pTau burden and are often used as diagnostic criteria, but are expensive, invasive,4 and do not always predict cognitive decline in asymptomatic patients.5 A more accessible, non-invasive biomarker is needed to diagnose early stage AD, enabling clinical trial research and potential therapeutic interventions.

The retina is a light-sensitive layer of neural tissue with a direct connection to the brain through the optic nerve. The retina develops from the embryonic diencephalon and thus shares many structural and functional features with the brain.4,6 Advances in retinal imaging technology are enabling researchers to explore the retina as a noninvasive source of potential AD biomarkers. Multiple retinal structural changes are associated with AD, including retinal ganglion cell (GC) neurodegeneration, abnormal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and volume, and optic nerve axonal loss.7 Although findings are conflicting, retinal vascular changes have been also observed, including decreased vascular density, tortuosity, and branching complexity in patients with research criteria-based diagnosis of MCI and AD.8–11

In addition, there is growing evidence that the hallmark pathological signs of AD, Aβ and pTau deposition, may occur in the retina of AD patients,12 potentially providing unique insights into preclinical disease progression. Here we review the current research related to imaging amyloid/tau pathology in the retina and implications for developing retinal biomarkers of AD.

Retinal Amyloid

Pathological amyloid accumulation in the retina has been linked to aging and neurodegenerative eye and brain disease.13 In AD mouse models, retinal Aβ deposits increase with age, correlate with cerebral Aβ load,14,15 and have been identified in retina before the brain,16 suggesting that retinal Aβ may be a promising target for early AD detection.

Histopathological analysis of human AD retinas have demonstrated a range of Aβ findings.17 Koronyo-Hamaoui et al. identified Aβ plaques in flat-mount retinas from patients with neuropathologically confirmed AD versus age-matched normal controls (NCs),16 as well significant correlations between retinal Aβ and cerebral amyloid burden.18 La Morgia et al. identified Aβ deposition inside and around melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) which was associated with mRGC death.19 In contrast, neither Schön et al. nor Ho et al. detected Aβ when performing immunohistochemical analysis of retinal cross-sections from neuropathologically confirmed AD patients.20,21 A 2016 meta-analysis of retinal Aβ histopathology studies found significant statistical heterogeneity between studies, likely due varied tissue preparation and staining techniques, age and length of disease, diagnosis criteria, and other methodological differences.22

More recent studies have had mixed findings. Lee and al. found that greater retinal intracellular Aβ correlated with lower cerebral neuritic plaque scores in the temporal region, while extracellular retinal Aβ was associated with higher cerebral amyloid angiopathy scores.23 Shi et al. found extensive vascular Aβ deposition and pericyte loss in AD retinas, suggesting that retinal Aβ pathology may resemble the neuropathology implicated in blood brain barrier breakdown in AD.24 In contrast, den Haan et al. performed extensive immunohistochemical analyses of retinas from 6 neuropathologically confirmed AD cases and found no significant differences between AD and age-matched NCs.25

In Vivo Detection of Aβ Plaques in Human Retinas

Curcumin Fluorescence

Curcumin labeling is a technique used to image retinal Aβ in vivo. Curcumin is a fluorochrome with a high binding affinity to Aβ, and several formulations have been developed for oral administration prior to imaging.26 Curcumin fluorescence is captured using scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) with specific excitation and emission filter settings to distinguish curcumin-labeled Aβ from background retinal fluorescence.16

Koronyo et al. were the first to successfully implement this technique in 10 patients with mild to moderate clinical AD and 6 NC participants, using automated image analysis to assign a retinal amyloid index (RAI) score based on number, area, intensity and distribution of spots showing increased fluorescence.18 AD patients had significantly higher RAI scores compared to NCs (2.1 fold in the age-matched subgroup analysis, p = 0.0031), although there was no correlation between RAI and MMSE scores. Aβ deposits localized to the peripheral superior quadrant and to blood vessels. Dumitrascu et al. evaluated curcumin fluorescence in patients with probable AD and MCI and found that higher retinal amyloid count (RAC) and greater total retinal amyloid (RA) area in the proximal mid-periphery region of the superior-temporal quadrant correlated with lower cognitive scores and decreased hippocampal volume.27 (Figure 1) In a subsequent study evaluating retinal vascular parameters associated with AD, they found a significant correlation between impaired cognition and a combined Aβ/venous tortuosity index variable, though there were no differences between cognitively impaired participants and NCs associated with any individual vascular features.28

To evaluate retinal Aβ in early stage AD, Ngolab et al. performed cucurmin imaging on four asymptomatic Aβ PET+ participants and four Aβ PET- participants.29 Although all participants were cognitively normal, the Aβ PET- participants had fewer fluorescent spots than the preclinical AD participants (difference in means: –538, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: –979, 97), and total RAC correlated positively with cerebral Aβ as measured by PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) (Pearson’s r: 0.65). Tadokoro et al. evaluated associations between retinal curcumin fluorescence and MRI brain features in 30 participants (13 AD, 7 MCI, 10 NC), finding that RAC correlated with whole grey matter atrophy (r = 0.51, p &lt; 0.05) but not with medial temporal lobe atrophy, suggesting that retinal Aβ may be related to visual cortex changes.30 Similar to Koronyo et al., the authors found no correlation between RAC and MMSE scores, and noted that retinal Aβ tended to localize along blood vessel walls. One of the three PET Aβ+ participants showed faint Aβ fluorescence, suggesting variability in curcumin uptake/fluorescence between individuals or even differing rates of retinal Aβ deposition in biomarker-positive AD.

Although the above studies strongly suggest the presence of retinal Aβ in AD and associations between retinal Aβ and cognition and/or AD pathology in the brain, den Haan et al. found no differences in retinal fluorescent signals between biomarker positive AD patients and NCs using 3 formulations of oral curcumin.31 In participants who received the standard formulation (Longvida, Verdure Sciences, IN, USA), quantitative assessment revealed no difference in hyperfluorescence between biomarker-positive AD participants and NCs. Low plasma levels may prevent curcumin from sufficiently binding to Aβ,32 and plasma levels of unconjugated curcumin were undetectable after administration of all 3 formulations, though deconjugation of samples using β-glucuronidase increased curcumin levels for two of the three formulations (NovaSOL [Molecular Health Technologies LLC, NJ, USA] and Theracurmin [Integrative Therapeutics LLC, WI, USA]).

Methodological differences in curcumin protocols and quantification may explain the varied findings. (Table 1) Ngolab et al. theorized that the higher RAC they found compared to Koronyo et al. may have been due to higher curcumin dosing over a shorter period,29 while results from den Haan et al. suggest that curcumin uptake may vary. In addition, the retina’s inherent autofluorescence may mask the curcumin signal. 31 The presence of cataract may also impair shorter excitation lightwaves from reaching the retina.33 (Table 1)

Some findings were relatively consistent between studies, particularly localization of retinal Aβ to the peripheral superior temporal quadrant, which aligns with histopathology findings. However, all studies excluded patients with glaucoma and AMD, which may show overlapping fluorescence patterns.34 Although all studies were cross-sectional and limited by small sample size, only one study found a correlation between retinal Aβ and cognition.27 Further research is needed to assess the value of curcumin-based fluorescent imaging as a reliable approach for quantifying retinal Aβ, particularly in light of conflicting results from histopathology studies.

Hyperspectral Imaging

Hyperspectral (HS) imaging has also been used to identify retinal Aβ based on spectral shifts in the scattering of light. The retina is illuminated with varying bandwidths of visible to near infrared light, and reflected light is analyzed to determine reflectance intensity at each wavelength, as well as spatial information based on light scattering at each pixel.35,36 While HS imaging cannot visualize Aβ directly, alterations in the reflected light spectra are thought to be caused by the Rayleigh light-scattering properties of small soluble Aβ oligomers. Decreases in reflectance in the wavelength range of 480 to 550 nm are believed to be specific to Aβ.37 Thus, HS imaging is a promising imaging modality that does not require oral administration of a labeling agent.

More et al. demonstrated the potential of HS imaging for retinal amyloid detection by analyzing low-order Aβ aggregates in neuronal cell cultures to develop a characteristic spectral signal.37 They identified similar signals using in vivo HS imaging of AD mouse retinas before the onset of cognitive decline and in ex vivo human AD retinas.38 In a subsequent study, 15 cognitively impaired individuals and 16 age-matched NCs underwent HS imaging to evaluate differences in optical density signature (derived from the mean spectral profile). The greatest difference between AD and NCs occurred in the two AD subgroups with the least cognitive impairment, suggesting that HS imaging may identify retinal changes occuring early in AD.39

Hadoux et al. used HS imaging to investigate the relationship between retinal Aβ and PET imaging findings in 15 Aβ PET+ participants and 20 age-matched Aβ PET- participants.35 They adjusted for individual spectral variation by correcting for the spectral components most responsible for reflectance differences between subjects, such as ocular media, macular pigment, melanin, and hemoglobin. (Figure 2) They sampled six regions, noting that structural features cause reflectance spectra to vary between regions. A linear discrimination machine learning (ML) model anlyzed the spectral data and assigned a score based on weighted summation of reflectance wavelengths at each region. HS scores differed significantly between cases and controls for all regions, with the most significant difference in the temporal vascular arcade superior to the fovea (p = 0.002). The model classified a separate cohort of Aβ PET+ (n=4) and Aβ PET- (n=13) participants, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.87 (p=0.03, 95% CI: 0.69, 1.0). Notably, differences in raw reflectance data (not adjusted for inter-subject variability) between cases and controls were not significant.

Other studies have combined HS imaging with other features to predict AD. Sharafi et al. imaged the retinas of 26 cognitively impaired and 20 NCs to derive retinal vascular metrics (tortuosity and diameter) as well as HS texture measures.40 A classification model was trained to predict amyloid PET status from the imaging features.40 The model achieved 76% accuracy using the vascular metrics alone, and 85% accuracy when HS features were added to the model. HS features in the 450 to 550 nm range, consistent with the proposed HS signal of retinal Aβ aggregates, differed most significantly between Aβ+ and Aβ- participants. Similarly, Lemmens et al. developed a model to predict AD from a combination of HS imaging features and RNFL thickness measures in 17 AD participants (7 biomarker positive) and 22 age-matched NC participants.41 The best-performing model used a combination of 14 spectral features from a single region of interest (ROIs) and 5 RNFL measures to achieve an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.89). The ROI superior and peripheral to the ONH demonstrated the largest differences in mean reflectance spectra between cases and controls, while the best performing model relied on the inferior peripheral ROI. In contrast with Hadoux et al, HS features alone were not sufficient to predict AD.

Although HS imaging shows promise, further validation is needed. Confounding signals from other retinal features require a standardized approach, including specified ROIs and effective methods to correct for individual variability. HS imaging does not provide information related to Aβ quantification or location, and may be most effective as a biomarker of AD when combined with other retinal imaging features.

Retinal tau

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that is involved in the assembly and maintenance of axonal microtubules.42 Tau levels increase in AD and hyperphosphorylation leads to abnormal intraneuronal tangles of paired helical and straight pTau filaments, leading to structural disruption and axonal transport impairment.43 In addition to filaments, pTau can also be present in the form of smaller oligomers, which may be an early manifestation of pTau pathology more closely associated with cognitive decline.44 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based CSF measures of total tau and pTau are established biomarkers of early AD, but are expensive, invasive, and typically only available at large research centers.45

Retinal tau is less well-studied than Aβ, but represents another potential avenue for AD biomarker research, especially as growing evidence suggests that pTau pathology may be more closely tied to cognitive decline than Aβ pathology.46,47

Unlike Aβ, tau has not been imaged in the human retina in vivo. One study used a modified SLO system for in vivo retinal imaging of fibrillar tau in transgenic mice expressing human P301S mutant tau.20 Mouse retinas were imaged 24 hours after administration of fluorophore FSB (1-fluoro-2,5-bis(3-hydroxycarbonyl-4-hydroxy)styrylbenzene). Fibrillar tau in the GC layer increased with age, while no tau was identified in age-matched wild type mice. Immunohistochemical staining of retinal and brain tissue from the same mice using AT8 and AT100 anti-pTau antibodies suggested that retinal tau preceded cortical tau pathology.

The majority of the evidence related to tau accumulation in the retinas of AD patients is from histopathologiy studies, which have shown varied results. (Table 2) Schon et al. compared post-mortem eyes of 6 expert-confirmed AD cases and 4 NCs stained. Five of the AD retinas were AT8 positive, with diffuse staining in the plexiform and GC layers but localized to individual cells in the inner nuclear layer. Co-staining with fluorophore FSB was negative in the AT8-positive cells, however, as was staining for other pTau isotopes (AT100, AT180, and AT270).20 Den Haan et al. found significantly greater diffuse staining for pTau (AT8, AT100, AT270) in the inner and outer plexiform layers in AD vs. NCs, although 2 NC cases showed similar patterns of AT8 staining as the AD cases. Although NFTs were observed in cortical tissue of the AD patients, none were identified in the retina.25 Grimaldi et al. found pTau localized to RG cells in the inner plexiform layer and evidence of RG cell neurodegeneration in the retinas of neuropathologically-confirmed AD patients.48

Although the histopathological evidence seems promising, methods for imaging retinal tau remain elusive. It has not been established whether the retinal tau is the same as tau pathology in the brain, nor whether retinal tau is associated with clinical or neuropathological manifestations of AD. Similar to Aβ pathology, tauopathy in the brain is present in many neurodegenerative diseases and is not specific to AD. Further complicating the picture, diffuse tau immunoreactivity in the retina is associated with aging and with other ophthalmic diseases.49 In addition to the technical challenge of imaging these proteins in the retina, establishing the validity of proteinopathies in the retina as biomarkers of AD will require longitudinal studies in well-characterized study populations.

Future Directions

Novel retinal imaging modalities may have applications for identifying Aβ and tau pathology in the retina. Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging has been used to detect Aβ in the retinas of transgenic AD mice and to differentiate AD from wild type mice.50 Other Aβ labeling approaches, such as nanobodies and fluorescent probes, have been used to identify Aβ in young AD mice, before cerebral Aβ was detected, and in post mortem human retinas.51,52 Small molecule retinal tau tracers are in the early stages of development.53 These approaches require oral or parenteral administration of specific probes (not yet approved for use in humans) prior to retinal imaging, which limits their usefulness as screening devices.

Fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy (FLIO) has been used in pilot studies to assess several retinal diseases.54,55 Sadda et al. found that FLIO-derived parameters in AD participants differed significantly from controls and correlated with Aβ and tau CSF measures in a small, cross-sectional study.56 Although intriguing, this approach can only identify AD-related retinal abnormalities and does not directly confirm the presence of Aβ and tau pathology in the retina.

Artificial intelligence approaches to retinal imaging analysis are rapidly advancing57 and are likely the key to enabling noninvasive identification of patients with retinal AD-related changes including Aβ and tau pathology. ML models can incorporate data from multiple imaging modalities and/or rely on multiple features to diagnose and predict disease progression. These approaches may lead to the discovery of a combination of retinal imaging features, including those related to Aβ and tau pathology, that together provide a characteristic profile of AD-related retinal pathology.

Conclusion

Despite the challenges with imaging Aβ and pTau pathology in the retina, these proteins still hold promise as potential retinal biomarkers of AD. Identifying and elucidating their role in retinal pathology may provide key insights into the complex processes involved in aging and in neurodegenerative disease. Ideally, an imaging signature of Aβ and pTau in the retina will be identified that is specific to AD. Whether this is specific to biomarker-positive, clinical, and/or neuropathologically confirmed AD needs to be studied. Further validation of existing imaging techniques, particularly HS imaging due to its screening potential, is needed in larger study populations. Going forward, increasingly advanced artificial intelligence-based retinal imaging analysis may be critical to enable early AD diagnosis. HS imaging, fluorescence imaging, and novel future imaging techniques will likely be useful inputs in combination with other imaging biomarkers as inputs for these AI-based approaches.
