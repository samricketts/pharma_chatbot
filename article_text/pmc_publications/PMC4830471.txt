In our efforts to develop hybrid compounds of curcumin and melatonin as potential disease-modifying agents for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a potent lead hybrid compound, Z-CM-I-1, has been recently identified and biologically characterized in vitro. In this work, we report the in vivo effects of Z-CM-I-1 on AD pathologies in an APP/PS1 transgenic AD model. Our studies demonstrated that Z-CM-I-1 significantly decreased the accumulation of Aβ in the hippocampus and cortex region of the brain tissue, and reduced inflammatory responses and oxidative stress after treatment for 12 weeks at 50 mg/kg per dose via oral administration. Furthermore, Z-CM-I-1 significantly improved synaptic dysfunction evidenced by the increased expression of synaptic marker proteins, PSD95 and synaptophysin, indicating its protective effects on synaptic degeneration. Lastly, we demonstrated that Z-CM-I-1 significantly increased the expression level of complexes I, II, and IV of the mitochondria electron transport chain in the brain tissue of APP/PS1 mice. Collectively, these results clearly suggest that Z-CM-I-1 is orally available and exhibits multifunctional properties in vivo on AD pathologies, thus strongly encouraging further development of this lead compound as a potential disease-modifying agent for AD patients.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting around 5.2 million Americans.1 Multiple pathological factors have been extensively studied to understand the underlying mechanisms of AD.2-5 However, the exact etiology of AD still remains unknown. Addressing the issue of the paucity of effective therapeutics in the pipeline and taking the multifaceted nature of AD into account, drug development efforts have been devoted to multifunctional compounds that can target more than one potential risk factor simultaneously, thus increasing the success of disease-modifying agents for AD.6, 7

Recently, we have begun development of hybrid compounds from the structures of curcumin and melatonin, two natural products that have shown therapeutic potential in various AD models, with the intention to provide novel chemical scaffolds with potentially new or different mechanisms of action. Our results demonstrated that the hybrid strategy is a viable approach in providing chemotypes with novel pharmacology and one lead compound, Z-CM-I-1, has been identified for further optimization and validation (Figure 1).8 Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that this lead compound might interfere with the interactions between Amyloid-β (Aβ) and mitochondria in order to exert its neuroprotective activities. More importantly, we have demonstrated that Z-CM-I-1 can efficiently penetrate the blood brain barrier after oral administration.8 Herein, we report that the treatment Z-CM-I-1 on the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model9 significantly reduces multiple pathologies found in AD.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Z-CM-I-1 decreases Aβ burden in APP/PS1 mice after long-term treatment

Aβ plaques have been recognized as one of the hallmarks of AD patients.2, 10 It has also been demonstrated that Aβ plaque load is increased in the aging APP/PS1 mouse model.9 Therefore, we firstly examined the effects of Z-CM-I-1 (50 mg/kg) on Aβ accumulation in brain after treatment. After quantification and data analysis (see Material and Methods, Aβ quantification), treatment with Z-CM-I-1 was shown to significantly decrease the level of Aβ plaques in the cerebral cortical and hippocampal areas (*p&lt;0.05) (Figure 2) compared to non-treated group. From our previous in vitro studies, we demonstrated that Z-CM-I-1 shows minimal inhibition on Aβ aggregation, while moderately inhibiting the production of small Aβ oligomers (AβOs) in MC65 cells.8 This may suggest that the reduction of Aβ plaque load in APP/PS1 mice could be a main downstream outcome of the interference of Z-CM-I-1 with other factors.

Z-CM-I-1 reduces activation of microglia in APP/PS1 mice

A growing body of evidence has implicated neuroinflammation as an essential player in the etiology of AD.3, 11 This notion is supported by a number of epidemiological studies showing evidence that levels of inflammatory proteins, including C-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines, are elevated long before the clinical symptoms of AD.12, 13 Furthermore, clinical trials have provided evidence that long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can prevent or delay the onset of AD, especially when applied to early and asymptomatic phases of the disease.14-16 Pathologically, activated microglia, along with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, have been observed in AD animal models and patients.17-19 Notably, curcumin and melatonin have been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of disease models.20-23 To explore whether Z-CM-I-1 preserves the anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin and melatonin, we next studied the status of neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice after long-term treatment with Z-CM-I-1. Since microglia are a main neuroinflammatory cell type, which has been widely used as a marker for neuroinflammation, we therefore checked the activation of microglial cells by immunocytochemistry with an anti-Iba1 antibody, shown in Figure 3. While no change was detected in total microglial cell number, when microglial cells were further classified morphologically (Figure 3), treatment with Z-CM-I-1 significantly decreased the population of type IV glial cells, which are the most activated glial cell type (Figure 3D). In the control group, type IV microglia cells were around 6% of total microglia, and the Z-CM-I-1 treatment was able to reduce this significantly to 3% (Figure 3G). These results suggest that even though there were no differences between treated and non-treated groups in the total number of cells (Figure 3E), the microglia present at higher activation states were reduced in the Z-CM-I-1-treated group, thus suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect in vivo.

Z-CM-I-1 reduces oxidative stress in APP/PS1 mice after long-term treatment

Mounting evidence from pharmacological and genetic studies has confirmed a correlation between oxidative stress and Aβ accumulation.5, 24-26 For example, Aβ can reduce redox-active metals to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contribute to most types of oxidative damage noted in AD.27-29 Furthermore, the interaction of microglia with Aβ results in increased ROS burden, further contributing to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and eventually causing neurodegeneration.30-33 To determine whether Z-CM-I-1 can modulate oxidative stress in APP/PS1 mice, two oxidative stress markers were measured. As shown in Figure 4, long-term treatment with Z-CM-I-1 resulted in a significant decrease of 8-Hydroxyguanine (8OHG) (Figures 4A-4C), a marker of oxidative damage on nucleic acids, in hippocampal neuronal nuclei. Notably, treatment of APP/PS1 mice with Z-CM-I-1 also significantly reduced the level of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) (Figures 4D and 4E), a marker of lipid peroxidation. These results are consistent with our previously published in vitro results from MC65 cells demonstrating that lipid peroxidation is highly involved in the oxidative stress and cell death of MC65 cells and that Z-CM-I-1 efficiently suppressed this oxidative stress.8 Taken together, the results clearly show that Z-CM-I-1 exhibits antioxidative effects in APP/PS1 mice after long-term treatment.

Treatment of APP/PS1 mice with Z-CM-I-1 improves the level of synaptic markers

Synaptic dysfunction has been observed in AD patients and models, and has been suggested as an early event underlying AD progression.34-37 Furthermore, synaptic loss correlates well with the severity of cognitive impairment.38-40 Additionally, Aβ species, especially the small AβOs, have been shown to impair synaptic neurotransmission in various AD animal models.41-44 To evaluate whether Z-CM-I-1 has any effects on the synapse pathology, we examined the expression levels of PSD95 and synaptophysin, post-synaptic and pre-synaptic markers, respectively. Notably, as shown in Figure 5, treatment of APP/PS1 mice with Z-CM-I-1 resulted in a significant increase of PSD95 and synaptophysin compared to the non-treated group. From our previous in vitro studies, we have demonstrated that Z-CM-I-1 moderately inhibits the formation of AβOs in MC65 cells and may interfere with the interactions of AβOs and their partner proteins.8 Furthermore, we demonstrated that Z-CM-I-1 treatment significantly reduced Aβ burden in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Taken together, these effects on Aβ could potentially contribute to the observed synaptoprotective effects. Further studies are warranted to understand the mechanisms of Z-CM-I-1 on synaptic function. Collectively, the results of Z-CM-I-1 in APP/PS1 mice strongly suggest that it can improve synaptic degenerative phenotypes, suggesting its potential protective effect on cognitive deficit in AD.

Treatment of APP/PS1 mice with Z-CM-I-1 increases the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins

Mitochondria play critical roles in cellular functions and various types of defects in mitochondria have been observed in AD patients and AD animal models.4, 30, 45 In fact, APP/PS1 mice have been shown to exhibit deregulation in OXPHOS signaling, indicative of functional impairment of mitochondria.46, 47 Our previous results suggest that Z-CM-I-1 may exert its neuroprotection through mitochondria.8 Therefore, after long-term treatment, we further examined its effects on the mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 6, treatment of APP/PS1 mice with Z-CM-I-1 significantly increased the expression levels of complexes I, II, and IV. These results are consistent with our in vitro studies in MC65 cells suggesting that mitochondria might be the main organelle that Z-CM-I-1 is targeting.8 However, this does not rule out the possibility that the change in mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins could be a downstream outcome of the reduced Aβ accumulation in APP/PS1 mice. This could be due to either the direct interaction of Z-CM-I-1 with the respiration chain proteins, or the interference of Z-CM-I-1 between Aβ species and the mitochondria. Further detailed mechanistic study is warranted to better understand the mechanisms of action of Z-CM-I-1 in mitochondria.

In summary, we characterized the in vivo effects of Z-CM-I-1 (50 mg/kg) on AD related pathologies in APP/PS1 mice after long-term treatment via oral administration. The results revealed that Z-CM-I-1 effectively reduced the Aβ burden, decreased the population of highly activated microglial cells, and ameliorated oxidative stress. Notably, Z-CM-I-1 significantly improved synaptic degenerative changes, thus suggesting its therapeutic potential on memory and cognitive deficits in AD. All the observed effects on AD pathologies might be due to its interactions on the mitochondria as evidenced by its effects on complexes I, II, and IV of the electron transport chain. Collectively, the results of Z-CM-I-1 from APP/PS1 mice demonstrated that it exhibited multiple effects on Aβ and inflammatory responses, as well as oxidative stress, consistent with our original design rationale to provide novel chemical scaffolds by hybridization. These results also strongly encourage further characterization of Z-CM-I-1 for its effects on cognition and behavioral function, as well as further optimization to develop more potent analogs.

METHODS

Animals and Z-CM-I-1 treatment

Four month old double-transgenic female APP/PS1 mice expressing chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and the PS1-dE9 mutant human presenilin 1 were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (B6C3-Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/J) and were administered either vehicle (n=4) or Z-CM-I-1 (50 mg/kg) (n=7)8 by oral gavage. Animals were treated 5 times per week for 12 consecutive weeks. All mice were maintained under an approved protocol in accordance with guidelines established by the Case Western Reserve University IACUC.

Tissue collection

At the end of the treatment, all mice were sacrificed and brain tissues were collected. Half sagittal brain hemispheres of each animal were immediately frozen and stored at −80 °C for biochemical analyses, and the other halves were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemical studies. Following fixation, tissue was dehydrated through ascending concentrations of ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and 6 μm sections placed onto coated slides. For each animal, sections spanning the entire hippocampus were numbered and used for quantitative analysis.

Western blot assay

Brain tissue (cerebral cortex and hippocampus) was homogenized in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) with added protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were stored at −80 °C and the proteins (20 μg per lane) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon PVDF membranes (Millipore Corporation, Billerica MA, USA) and blocked with 5% non-fat milk. The following primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 °C: anti-synaptophysin (1:5000) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-HNE (1:1000) (Alpha Diagnostics), anti-PSD95 (1:2000) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mitochondrial complex OXPHOS (1:5000) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and anti-Complex IV (1:2000) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Then the blots were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), and HRP-labeled rabbit or mouse secondary antibodies were applied (Cell Signaling, Technology, Danvers MA, USA). Finally, membranes were rinsed in TBS-T, briefly incubated with a luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA, USA), and developed on X-ray film. For quantitative analysis, blots were scanned and analyzed with Quantity One image analysis software (Biorad). Actin levels were used as a loading control.

Immunohistochemistry

Tissue sections were de-paraffinized in xylene and hydrated through descending ethanol concentrations, and endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated by 30 min incubation in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. For some experiments, antigen retrieval through pressure cooking was performed using the manufacturer’s recommendations (Biocare Medical, Concord MA, USA). Subsequently, in all cases, non-specific binding sites were blocked with 30 min incubation in 10% normal goat serum (NGS) in TBS, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-Aβ antibody 82E1 (1/500, Immunobiological Laboratories, Minneapolis MN, USA), anti-Iba-1 (1/250, Wako, Osaka, Japan), and anti-8OHG (1/1000, Thermo Scientific, Waltham MA, USA). Species specific secondary antibodies and PAP complexes were then added, respectively. Slides were developed with 3’-3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Dako) and dehydrated through ascending ethanol to xylene, and then coverslipped. Images were obtained with a Zeiss Axiophot.

Microglial cell activation state classification

Microglial cell morphological classification was manually measured by size, shape, and branch number,48, 49 and defined as: Type I: Non-activated state cells. Without arms and circular shape. Non-ramified microglia. Type II: Low activation state cells. 2-3 arms per cell, a circular-star shape. Ramified microglia. Type III: Moderate activation state cells. 4-5 arms or more per cell and star-shaped. Hypertrophied microglia. Type IV: Heavy activation state cells. Bigger cell body with 5 or more arms and strongly star-shaped. Two tissue sections per animal were used to measure total glial cells in the hippocampus regions and quantification was performed by Axiovision image analysis software (Zeiss).

Aβ plaque quantification and data analysis

For quantification of the amyloid plaque load in cerebral cortical and hippocampal areas, 5 tissue sections from each animal approximately 140 microns apart were immunostained with the 82E1 antibody. Each section contained a different population of plaques since the largest plaque measured was near 100 microns in diameter. Staining and quantification were performed in a blinded fashion. For image analysis, using a 2.5x objective, the entire hippocampus and cortex were imaged. The regions of interest were cropped out, carefully omitting large amyloid containing vessels near the ventricle and along the meningeal layer. Finally, the percent area immunostained was determined from the cropped images using Axiovision software, setting a minimum threshold size to only mark the smallest visible plaque deposition. All images were analyzed with the software under the same conditions and at the same time. The mean values for all 5 sections were determined for each animal. Finally, the mean ± SEM was calculated for both groups.

Statistical Analysis

The Student’s t-test was used for all statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. The level of significance for all analysis testing was set at *P &lt; 0.05.
