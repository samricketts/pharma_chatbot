Objectives:

This study examined the association of cultural factors and literacy to neuropsychological performance and measures of regional brain atrophy among Hispanic elders diagnosed with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI).

Method:

Acculturation and literacy levels were measured among 45 subjects tested in Spanish; their primary language. Scores for measures of memory, executive functioning, and verbal fluency, as well as volumetric analysis of MRI scans of left hemisphere structures commonly affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were examined. Linear regression models were employed to examine the association of acculturation and literacy to neuropsychological performance and MRI measures.

Results:

After controlling for age, higher literacy levels were associated with better performance on phonemic verbal fluency (r = 0.300, p &lt; .05), while higher levels of acculturation to the U.S. was associated with poorer performance on category verbal fluency (r = 0.300, p &lt; .05). There was a significant inverse relationship after controlling for age between literacy and the left entorhinal cortex (r = −0.455, p &lt; .05), left precuneus (r = −0.457, p &lt; .05), and left posterior cingulate (r = −0.415, p &lt; .05).

Conclusions:

Results of the current pilot study indicate that high acculturation to the U.S. among aMCI immigrants from Latin-American countries may hinder performance on verbal learning measures when they are administered in one’s primary language. Moreover, in this cohort, a higher literacy level, which is indicative of greater cognitive reserve, was associated with better performance in language measures, but with greater atrophy in brain regions susceptible to neurodegenerative disease. These preliminary findings should be further examined among larger cohorts and using more diverse measures, which capture other cultural constructs.

pmcIntroduction

The estimated prevalence rate of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is expected to increase to 13.8 million cases a year by the year 2050 (Guo et al., 2013) because of the aging of the population worldwide. As such, there is an increasing focus on detecting cognitive impairment earlier and on examining factors that may contribute toward the development of AD, with the goal of preventing AD and beginning treatment at the earliest stages of the disease. There is a growing body of literature examining the impact of cultural factors, which could modify the risk for developing AD and the resulting cognitive and functional impairment among older adults. The demographic shift in the United States (U.S.) with the increase in size of ethnic minority groups, especially Hispanics, provides a valuable opportunity to examine cultural factors, which have an impact on the prevalence of AD as well as various features of the disease, such as the clinical phenotype and the rate of progression. By 2060, Hispanic minority groups are projected to increase from 57,470 to 111,216 in the U.S. (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017). Evidence on dementia risk among Hispanics/Latinos suggests an elevated risk compared to whites. In a population-based longitudinal study over a 7 year period in New York City, it was found that probable or possible AD occurred significantly more frequently among Caribbean Hispanic/Latino (9.8%) individuals than in white (5.4%) individuals (Tang et al., 2001). More recently, it has been predicted that the prevalence of dementia for Hispanics/Latinos over the age of 65 in the next 25 years will be about 32% (Mayeda et al., 2016). Examining neuropsychological and neuroimaging factors in prodromal stages of the disease, such as in amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) in Hispanics/Latinos, allows the best chance to identify factors related to cognitive reserve and the prevention of the onset and progression of dementia among this ethnic group in the U.S.

Culture refers to the set of learned traditions and living styles, shared by the members of society (Ardila, 2007). It includes the ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving (Harris, 1983), and is a multidimensional construct that includes various lifestyle factors, such as diet, educational attainment, attitudes toward cognitive testing, social interactions, and engagement in leisure-time activities and exercise (Harris, 1983). All these factors may have a major effect, not only on neuropsychological performance, but also on the development and progression of the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.

Cross-cultural cognitive testing faces major diagnostic challenges, because norms for specific neuropsychological instruments in one cultural group may not apply to other cultural groups (Ardila, 2005). Among cultural factors known to have the greatest influence on influencing performance on neuropsychological tests, are the levels of acculturation, bilingualism, and education (Acevedo et al., 2007; Bialystok et al., 2012; Boone et al., 2007; Chin et al., 2012; Ostrosky-Solis et al., 2000). These factors may impact cognitive performance (Burke et al., 2019) and the interpretation of the relationships of cognitive test scores to regional brain volumes (Burke et al., 2018). It would appear that a better understanding is needed regarding the impact of cultural factors and cognitive reserve on the detection of cognitive impairment and the underlying disease process.

Acculturation has commonly been defined as the process of assimilation of an ethnic or racial group into a new culture (Berry, 2003). This process can result in changes in values, attitudes, and behaviors (Cuellar et al., 1995). Acculturation has been found to account for some of the differences observed between cultural or ethnic groups in performance on measures of learning, executive functioning, attention/working memory, verbal fluency, and processing speed (Arentoft et al., 2012; Boone et al., 2007; Razani et al., 2007; Saez et al., 2014). It has been noted that high levels of acculturation to the mainstream culture have been associated with the delayed onset of observed cognitive deficits when compared to low acculturation levels (Kowoll et al., 2015; Saez et al., 2014).

Literacy, the ability to read and write, plays a major role in influencing cognitive processes, and extends spoken language to a symbolic visual representation affecting most spheres of cognitive functioning (Ardila et al., 2010) and represents a major element of culture (Ardila, 2005). Literacy measures have been proposed to reflect quality of education (Manly et al., 2003) and have been shown to be more related to cognitive performance than years of education (Dotson et al., 2009; Kave et al., 2012; Manly et al., 2005; Sisco et al., 2015).

Although educational level has been highly related to performance on neuropsychological testing (Ardila, 2007), the quality of schooling could relate to acquired learning strategies and to strengths in specific domains of cognition (Chin et al., 2012). Education quality, which can be captured through literacy measures, has been found to have a greater influence on certain neuropsychological test performance than age and may also delay the onset of identifiable cognitive deficits among those with brain diseases (Ardila, 2007; Schoenhofen-Sharp &amp; Gatz, 2011). Solé-Padullés et al. (2009) examined the relationship of regional brain volumes to pre-morbid IQ (as measured by the WAIS-IV vocabulary test), education, and occupation, which all contribute to cognitive reserve, among individuals performing a visual encoding test. Among cognitively normal (CN) subjects, greater cognitive reserve (identified by a composite cognitive reserve measure) was associated with larger brain volumes whereas among those with aMCI and AD, greater cognitive reserve was associated with reduced brain volumes (Solé-Padullés et al., 2009). These findings support the hypothesis that greater cognitive reserve enables compensatory mechanisms to improve performance in cognitive functioning.

The literature examining combined cultural factors and their relationship to brain atrophy during aging is limited. While it has been established that cognitive performance is associated with literacy, years of education, and with the degree of bilingual level, the effect these factors have on neural pathways in the brain is not yet understood. Different functional measures have demonstrated that literacy and education influence the pathways used by the brain for cognitive process (Castro-Caldas et al., 1998; Li et al., 2006; Ostrosky-Solis et al., 2004; Petersson et al., 2000). These studies suggest a need to further examine cultural factors in relation to neural connections in adulthood, as well as in aging, and the effects of neurodegeneration.

One of the challenges of previous studies examining cultural factors in this population is the heterogeneity of the Hispanic culture. Previous studies in the U.S. have examined cohorts from metropolitan areas that may be more representative of a specific country, such as Mexico. For example, in 2015, 63.3% of Hispanics in the U.S. were of Mexican origin and 36% were from other countries. In Miami Dade County, FL 66.8% of the population is Hispanic (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015), including 390,000 elderly residents originating from many different countries and representing the oldest Hispanic population in the U.S. (Ennis et al., 2011). In the current study, we have taken advantage of this population distribution in Miami Dade County, FL to investigate cultural and demographic factors that contribute to cognitive functioning and brain atrophy among Hispanic older adults with aMCI in an ethnically heterogeneous cohort. An initial working hypothesis was that (1) greater level of acculturation and literacy would be predictive of better neuropsychological performance and (2) these cultural constructs would be associated with lower volumes in brain regions vulnerable to atrophy in AD.

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess the influence of acculturation and literacy in the Spanish language on cognitive test performance and on regional brain volumes, in a sample of elderly Hispanic immigrants in ethnically diverse South Florida (i.e., Miami Dade County, FL) who were diagnosed with aMCI.

Method

Participants

De-identified data were collected by the 1Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (1Florida ADRC), Clinical Core. This research was approved by Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, Hispanic participants in the 1Florida ADRC who are all Spanish native speakers were evaluated at baseline and annually with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery of tests in their primary language (Spanish). The data used for this study was collected at the baseline visit of a longitudinal study of aging and Alzheimer’s disease (the 1Florida ADRC).

The sample consisted of 45 older adults (64% females) diagnosed with aMCI. Table 1 displays the demographic and cultural characteristics of the sample. All participants were immigrants to the U.S. from a variety of Latin-American countries although the majority (60%) were born in Cuba, 24.4% were from South American countries, 4.4% were from Central American countries, 2.2% from Puerto Rico, and 2.2% were from “other” Latin countries.

All participants were diagnosed with aMCI. Criteria for aMCI was based on Petersen’s guidelines (2004), which includes: (a) memory complaint(s), preferably confirmed by an informant; (b) a Global CDR scale score of 0.5; (c) no impairment in social and/or occupational function; (d) no evidence of DSM-5 criteria for major neurocognitive disorder; (e) confirmation of memory impairment at 1.5 SD or greater, below expected levels, based on age and education adjusted normative data for each cultural/language group, on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT-R, Brandt, 1991) delayed recall or on the delayed paragraph recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale–3rd edition (WMS-III Wechsler, 1997).

Exclusion criteria included: (1) sensor-perceptual loss or motor impairments, which interfered with an individual’s ability to complete a standardized battery of neuropsychological tests; (2) previous stroke or other unrelated neurological disorder that is known to potentially have a negative impact on cognition (i.e., moderate-severe traumatic brain injury, seizure disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, etc.); (3) current or past history of major psychiatric disturbance with hospitalization, active psychosis, bipolar disorder, as well as current major depressive episode, or current or past history of alcohol or substance abuse within the six months preceding the first appointment; and (4) use of medications with anticholinergic properties (i.e., antipsychotics, sedatives, etc.).

Neuropsychological testing

The participants were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation (in Spanish, their preferred language). A number of cognitive domains, including memory, attention, executive function, language, and visual-spatial function were assessed. Tests included Spanish versions of the following: letter verbal fluency (FAS; Controlled Oral Word Association Test; Benton et al., 1994), category fluency (C-Flu; Benton, 1968), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test delayed (HVLT-II; Brandt, 1991), Logical Memory delayed from the Wechsler Memory Scale, 3rd edition (WMS-III; Wechsler, 1997), and the Trail Making Test-Part B (TMT-B; Corrigan &amp; Hinkeldey, 1987; Reitan, 1958; Reitan &amp; Wolfson, 1993). These tests are part of the AD initiative for English and Spanish speaking groups and have been used for diagnostic determination in several studies with English and Spanish-speaking subjects (Hernandez Cardenache et al., 2014; Loewenstein et al., 2016, 2017, 2018). Tests had appropriate age, education, and cultural/language normative data (Arango-Lasprilla, Rivera, Garza, et al., 2015; Arango-Lasprilla, Rivera, Aguayo, et al., 2015; Ardila et al., 1994; Benton et al., 2014; Golden et al., 1999; Ostrosky-Solis et al., 2000; Pena-Casanova, Quinones-Ubeda, et al., 2009). Proficient and bilingual Spanish/English psychometricians performed testing.

MRI scans

MRI scans were acquired using a proprietary 3D volumetric protocol (MP-RAGE) on aSiemens 3.0 Tesla machine. Volumetric analysis of MRI scans of the brain used Freesufer (version 5.3), using a modification of the International Brain Atlas and Statistical Parametric Mapping or IBASPM). Only left-sided structures were examined, since verbal measures were the primary outcome variables. Furthermore, it was determined that the addition of an equivalent number of right hemisphere structures into the statistical analysis was not warranted, even if a small percentage of our participants may have right hemisphere dominant language function, as it would result in a loss of statistical power. Total normalized values for 10 regions of interest were obtained by dividing each regional volume by total intracranial volume, in order to adjust for variation in head size. Regions examined included: hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus, superior and inferior parietal lobules, superior and inferior temporal gyri, superior and rostral middle frontal gyri, precuneus, posterior cingulate, and the supramarginal gyrus. These regions have been previously identified in the literature to be affected in early-stage AD (Dickerson et al., 2011; Holland et al., 2009; Reas et al., 2018; Shim et al., 2017).

Cultural measures

Cultural measures examined in this study included measures of acculturation and a literacy measure to capture education quality. To measure acculturation level, the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (BAS; Marin &amp; Gamba, 1996) was utilized. This is a self-report measure of acculturation for both Hispanic and non-Hispanic cultures. The scale consists of 24 items with 12 items measuring acculturation to the Hispanic culture and 12 items measuring acculturation to Anglo-American culture. The items include three domains: language use (three items), linguistic proficiency (six items), and electronic media (3 items). Participants rate their agreement with statements on a 4-point Likert scale and a score is obtained by summing item values and dividing by the number of items answered. A score range of 1–4 for each domain is obtained. In the current study, the total score for acculturation to the Anglo-American culture was examined. The BAS has been shown to have good internal reliability and appropriate validity (Wallace et al., 2010).

The Letter-Word Identification subtest (LWIS) of the Batería III Woodcock-Muñoz: Pruebas de aprovechamiento (Batería III APROV) (Muñoz-Sandoval et al., 2005) was utilized in the current study as a measure of literacy. This is a short assessment that examines reading ability in Spanish.

Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistical Software (Version 26). Pearson partial correlations controlling for age, were used to associate cultural factors and left hemisphere MRI volumetric and the raw scores from the neuropsychological measures. Only left hemisphere structures were included in the analyses since the neuropsychological tests examined were heavily language based, and also to reduce error variance by reducing the number of variables examined in this study.

Multiple linear regression analyses were applied with age, acculturation, and literacy as predictor variables, and the neuropsychological raw scores and left hemisphere neuroimaging scores as the dependent variables

Results

Partial correlations, controlling for age, between the literacy, acculturation and neuropsychological performance are displayed in Table 2. A significant positive relationship was found between literacy and performance on the letter verbal FAS (r = −0.300, p &lt; .05). Higher levels of acculturation to the U.S. was associated with poorer performance on Category Fluency (r = −.300, p &lt; .05). The results of linear regression between the cultural factors, age, and neuropsychological performance are depicted in Table 3. Results of the regression model for age and cultural predictors (literacy and acculturation) did not generate a significant predictive relationship on the letter verbal fluency FAS [F(3,34) = 0.715, p = .550, η2 = 0.06] or category fluency [F(3,34) = 1.872, p = .153, η2 = 0.14]. Further examination of the unique effects of the predictors revealed that acculturation to the U.S. was a significant predictor of poor performance on the category fluency measure (β = −.368, R2 = 0.13, p &lt; .05). Age was not a significant predictor for performance on these measures.

Partial Correlations, controlling for age, between cultural factors and neuroimaging measures are displayed in Table 4. Significant inverse relationships were identified between literacy and the left entorhinal cortex (r = −0.455, p &lt; .05), precuneus (r = −0.457, p &lt; .05), and posterior cingulate (r = −0.415, p &lt; .05). The results of the multiple regression model for the cultural predictors combined (literacy, and acculturation) (Table 5) identified significant predictive relationships to the left posterior cingulate [F(3,25) = 6.281, p &lt; .01, η2 = 0.40]. Significant predictive relationships were not evident between the cultural factors and the left precuneus [F (3,25) = 2.912, p = .054, η2 = 0.25] or the left entorhinal cortex [F (3,25) = 2.458, p = .086, η2 = 0.02]. Further examination of the unique effects of the predictors revealed that literacy significantly predicted reduced volume in the left precuneus (β = −.447, R2 = 0.20, p &lt; .05), the left entorhinal cortex (β = −.453, R2 = 0.20, p &lt; .05) and the left posterior cingulate (β = −.351, R2 = 0.12, p &lt; .05). Age was identified as a stronger predictor of reduced volume in the left posterior cingulate than literacy and age (β = −.533, R2 = 0.263, p &lt; .01).

Discussion

When we examined relationships between cultural factors and neuropsychological performance, acculturation level to the U.S. was associated and predictive of poorer performance on a category verbal fluency measure (category fluency). This is consistent with previous literature that shows bilingualism interferes with performance on verbal fluency measures particularly on category fluency (Gollan et al., 2002; Rosselli et al., 2000). This finding indicates that the effects of acculturation, similar to bilingualisim, uniquely hinders the ability to successfully identify words from specific categories in their primary language among Hispanic individuals with aMCI. Hispanics who are bilingual more frequently experience the “tip of the tongue” (TOT) phenomenon and are slower in the verbal recovery and transcription of words when compared to their monolingual counterparts (Gollan &amp; Acenas, 2004; Ivanova &amp; Costa, 2008; Sadat et al., 2012). Semantic confusion in fluency exercises has also been recorded to lead to the generation of fewer words in bilingual participants (Gollan et al., 2002). Further, evidence has shown that the verbal skills of bilinguals are weaker in each language than the verbal skills of monolinguals, however bilinguals exhibit better executive control in nonlinguistic tasks than monolinguals do (Bialystok et al., 2012). In the current study, literacy in Spanish was associated with better performance on letter verbal fluency measure (FAS) given in the participants’ primary language (Spanish). This finding suggests that there is a link between education quality and verbal fluency abilities at the aMCI stage. Previous research has shown that education can account for almost 40% of the variance of results in letter verbal fluency among Spanish speakers (Ardila et al., 2000).

According to Ardila (2007) three main dimensions are identified in a culture: (1) the internal, subjective or psychological representation of culture, which includes thinking, feeling, knowledge, values, attitudes, and beliefs; (2) the behavioral dimension, including the ways to relate to others, to behave in different contexts and circumstances, such as in festivities and meetings, and the patterns of associations of musical and artistic expressions; (3) physical elements symbolic of that culture, such as clothes, food, ornaments, houses, instruments, and weapons. Language is an identifying cultural characteristic (Ardila, 2007) that plays an instrumental role in cognition (Ardila, 2018; Vygotsky, 1962) and is an integral part of acculturation; it is fundamental to all human social interactions and behaviors. Language experience may also modify how the brain works (Rosselli et al., 2014). For example, bilingual individuals, especially those who acquired the second language at about the same time as their primary language or very early in life, have been observed to display a pattern of cognitive performance dissimilar to that of monolingual individuals. (Bialystok et al., 2012). Bilinguals are known to perform worse on language-related measures than monolinguals (Gollan et al., 2008; Rosselli et al., 2000), but outperform monolinguals on tasks of executive function (Bialystok et al., 2004; Hartsuiker et al., 2008; Rosselli &amp; Ardila, 2018; Salvatierra &amp; Rosselli, 2004; Taler et al., 2013). Studies that have focused on semantic versus phonemic capabilities between monolinguals and bilinguals have identified contradictory findings in these areas (McMurtray et al., 2009). Among cognitively normal individuals, bilinguals have been found to have less brain atrophy than monolingual individuals (Olsen et al., 2015), whereas among cognitively impaired individuals, bilinguals have been found to have more brain atrophy than monolinguals (Schweizer et al., 2012). These intriguing findings show that the level of bilingualism plays both advantageous and disadvantageous roles in determining neuropsychological functioning as well as brain structure. There is a need for further studies of these phenomena.

Boone et al. (2007) examined subjective measures of language and acculturation as it relates to performance on neuropsychological functioning. Age at which English was first learned and number of years in the U.S. was found to be positively associated with language and verbal repetition/attention. In an African American sample, Manly et al. (2004) found that reading level is the strongest predictor of cognitive test performance on word list tests after accounting for acculturation level. Our examination of Hispanic individuals generated similar findings and identified literacy as a significant predictor of good performance on verbal tests.

Cognitive reserve is defined as “individual differences in how people process tasks [which allows] some people to cope better than others with brain pathology” (Stern, 2009, p. 2016). This theory suggests that individuals with increased cognitive reserve will demonstrate equal performance on assessments despite increased levels of brain pathology. Our findings show that even though brain atrophy is present among these regions, which are commonly effected in AD, cognitive performance remains intact, which is indicative of cognitive reserve. Researchers have observed associations between bilingual individuals and a delay in Alzheimer’s disease onset (Bialystok et al., 2007; Craik et al., 2010), with cognitive symptoms occurring 4–5 years later on average in bilinguals when compared to monolinguals. This suggests an increase in cognitive reserve as a result of bilingual experiences. Previous studies examining the effects of bilingualism, which is considered to enhance cognitive reserve, cognitively normal healthy bilinguals, as compared to monolinguals, have been found to have increased gray matter (GM) density in the left inferior parietal cortex (Mechelli et al., 2004). This increased difference in brain density among CN bilinguals has also been reported for the anterior cingulate gyrus (Abutalebi et al., 2012), the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the left anterior temporal lobe (Stein et al., 2012). Higher white matter integrity in CN bilinguals is primarily seen in the corpus callosum, but also in the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, right inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus (Luk et al., 2011). Bilingualism is correlated with better maintenance of white matter during aging (Davis et al., 2009), especially in the corpus callosum (Luk et al., 2011).

The cognitive reserve hypothesis suggests that for a particular level of brain pathology, those with greater cognitive reserve, such as those higher levels of education, are less likely to manifest clinical symptoms of dementia versus less-educated individuals (Roe et al., 2007). Other studies examining cognitive reserve have shown that among those with greater cognitive reserve, once neurodegenerative disease is established, the trajectory of decline in cognition and brain volumes is steeper than in those with low cognitive reserve. This phenomenon, should and does result in lower brain volumes, especially in the medial temporal lobes, among those with higher cognitive reserve, in the stage of mild to moderate AD. (La Rue, 2010; Stern, 2009). In this study we examined relationships between cultural factors and MRI volume among a sample of participants diagnosed with aMCI, while controlling for age. Significant relationships were identified between literacy and reduced volume in three left hemisphere brain regions: posterior cingulate, precuneus, and entorhinal cortex.

The literature examining clinical populations have identified conflicting findings. Costumero et al. (2020) examined global parenchymal volume among monolingual and bilingual individuals with aMCI and similar cognitive status and found bilinguals to have less parenchymal volumes than monolinguals, but faster rate of neurodegeneration and decline among monolinguals. Our results are consistent with this finding and confirms our hypothesis that language and acculturation is a source of cognitive reserve.

Some limitations in this study include a modest sample size. This may limit the generalizability of the results. Future studies should examine these cultural factors among larger sample sizes of Hispanics with aMCI. Another possible shortcoming is that the measures, which were used in this study, are heavily dependent on language. For example, our measure of acculturation (i.e., the BAS) consists of two language related constructs and one construct measuring media exposure. A common criticism of the majority of currently available measures of acculturation an over emphasis on language and a failure to capture other factors that may also be highly related to acculturation. Areas that have been understudied but are influenced by acculturation include values, beliefs, behaviors, and habits (Fox et al., 2017). Future studies should examine purer measures of acculturation that incorporate these other important areas, which may be a source of cognitive reserve. Our measure of education quality was also verbal in that we measured the literacy, specifically for Spanish words. Future studies should examine other methods of examining education quality such as the country where the majority of education was obtained, social economic status while obtaining primary education, etc. Differences between the education structure in Hispanic countries and the U.S. may be significantly related to education quality and have different effects on the brain and cognition.

In summary, we examined predictive relationships between two cultural factors, several neuropsychological measures, and regional brain volumes, which are vulnerable to degeneration and atrophy in AD, in a culturally diverse Hispanic sample. This study was conducted among Spanish speaking older adults with aMCI, most of whom would be expected to have neurodegenerative diseases and in whom we presume the phenomenon of cognitive reserve may have affected some of the results. In doing so, we found that after controlling for age, predictive relationships exist between acculturation level and neuropsychological performance, and between literacy and brain atrophy. Our findings are preliminary and should be further examined among larger cohorts and using more diverse measures, which capture other cultural, constructs.
