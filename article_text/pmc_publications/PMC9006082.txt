Background:

Limited information exists regarding the association between midlife lipid levels and late-life total and regional brain volumes.

Methods:

We studied 1,872 participants in the longitudinal community-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study. Serum lipid levels were measured in 1987–1989 (mean age, 53 ± 5 years). Participants underwent 3T brain MRI scans in 2011–2013. Brain volumes were measured using FreeSurfer image analysis software. Linear regression models were used to assess the associations between serum lipids and brain volumes modeled in standard deviation (SD) units, adjusting for potential confounders.

Results:

In adjusted analyses, one SD higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels were associated with larger total brain volumes (β 0.033, 95% CI 0.006–0.060) as well as larger volumes of the temporal (β 0.038, 95% CI 0.003–0.074) and parietal lobes (β 0.044, 95% CI 0.009–0.07) and Alzheimer disease-related region (β 0.048, 95% CI 0.048–0.085). Higher triglyceride levels were associated with smaller total brain volumes (β −0.033, 95% CI −0.060, −0.007). The associations between LDL levels and brain volumes were modified by age (P for interaction &lt;0.001), with higher LDL levels associated with larger total and regional brain volumes only among adults &gt;53 years at baseline, and were attenuated after application of weights to account for informative attrition, although associations with the parietal and Alzheimer’s disease-related region remained significant. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not associated with brain volumes.

Conclusion:

Higher LDL levels in late midlife were associated with larger brain volumes later in life, while higher triglyceride levels were associated with smaller brain volumes. These associations were driven by adults &gt;53 years at baseline.

pmcIntroduction

The brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ, containing more than 20% of the whole body’s cholesterol (Bjorkhem and Meaney, 2004). Cholesterol is not only an essential structural component for cellular membrane and myelin synthesis, but also a required component for synapse formation and axonal guidance (de Chaves et al., 1997). Cholesterol depletion in neurons results in impairments in neuronal activity and neurotransmission, leading to synapse degeneration (Linetti et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2007).

Higher lipid levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, are a well-established risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease and stroke. However, studies investigating the effect of cholesterol levels on risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease have yielded inconsistent and conflicting results (Evans et al., 2000; Gottesman et al., 2017; Kalmijn et al., 2000; Kivipelto et al., 2002; Mielke et al., 2010; Ong et al., 2018; Power et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2003). While some studies suggested an association of high midlife cholesterol concentrations with increased risk of Alzheimer disease (Evans et al., 2000; Kivipelto et al., 2002), or cognitive decline (Power et al., 2018), others have not found such associations (Gottesman et al., 2017; Kalmijn et al., 2000; Mielke et al., 2010; Ong et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2003).

Among cognitively normal adults, early alterations of the brain structure in specific regions have been shown to precede clinically-recognized Alzheimer disease by five to ten years (Csernansky et al., 2005; Fox et al., 2001; Fox et al., 1996; Kaye et al., 1997; Morris et al., 2009). Diminished brain volumes in brain regions including the parahippocampal, entorhinal, and inferior parietal lobules; hippocampus; precuneus; and cuneus have been identified as early preclinical markers of Alzheimer disease risk (Dickerson et al., 2009; Dickerson et al., 2011). Few studies have investigated the relationship between lipid levels and brain volumes (Leritz et al., 2011; Solomon et al., 2009b; Srinivasa et al., 2016). These studies have shown positive associations between cholesterol levels and thicker cortex across the whole brain (Leritz et al., 2011; Solomon et al., 2009b), and regional brain volumes (Srinivasa et al., 2016). However, all were cross-sectional in design, (Solomon et al., 2009b) investigated a small number of participants ranging between 96 and 115 participants (Leritz et al., 2011; Solomon et al., 2009b), or had relatively shortfollow-up periods of 7 years (Srinivasa et al., 2016).

Therefore we aimed to investigate the association between midlife lipid levels and late-life total and regional brain volumes in a large cohort of participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities-Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS).

Methods

Study Population

The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is a community-based prospective cohort of 15,792 participants who were 45–64 years old at the time of their enrollment in 1987–1989. Participants were recruited from four US communities: Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Washington County, Maryland (1989).

The ARIC-NCS is an ancillary study, where all ARIC participants who attended the ARIC visit 5 (2011–2013) clinic exam were invited to undergo an extensive cognitive evaluation. (Knopman et al., 2016). From the original ARIC cohort members who were alive at the start of the fifth examination, 6538 individuals took part. From this group, a subset were considered for MRI scans. The inclusion criteria for undergoing MRI scans included: 1) All individuals with cognitive impairment, 2) all participants with a prior brain MRI; and 3) an age- and field center-stratified random sample of cognitively normal individuals. We excluded participants for this study who had poor scan quality, or missing lipid values.

The ARIC Study has been approved by the institutional review boards at all participating institutions. All participants gave written informed consent at each study visit.

Brain MRI

Brain MRI scans at ARIC-NCS (2011–2013) were performed by using 3T brain MRI following identical protocols at each study site (Siemens Verio [Maryland study center], Siemens Skyra [North Carolina study center], Siemens Trio [Minnesota study center], and Siemens Skyra [Mississippi study center]) (Knopman et al., 2015). The sequences obtained included the following: localizer, magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo MP-RAGE (1.2-mm slices), axial gradient recalled echo T2- weighted imaging (T2*GRE) (4-mm slices), axial T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (5-mm slices), field mapping (3-mm slices), and axial diffusion tenor images (2.7-mm slices for Skyra and Verio scanners and 3-mm slices for Trio scanner). All scans included a sagittal T1-weighted 3D volumetric Magnetization Prepared Gradient Echo pulse sequence in order to quantify brain volumes. Data were processed by the ARIC MRI Reading Center at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN). Brain volumes were measured on MP-RAGE sequences using image analysis software (FreeSurfer; .harvard.edu) (Fischl et al., 2002). Segmentation of the brain MRIs were done using an automatic technique which assigns a neuroanatomical label to each voxel in an MRI volume based on probabilistic information automatically estimated from a manually labeled training set (Fischl et al., 2002). The brain volumes included: total brain, lobar (frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital), total deep gray subcortical structures (thalamus, caudate, putamen, and globus pallidum), and Alzheimer’s disease-related region of interest (total volume of parahippocampal, entorhinal, and inferior parietal lobules; hippocampus; precuneus; and cuneus) (Knopman et al., 2015).

Lipid assessment

Fasting blood for lipids was collected at visit 1 (1987–1989), and measured according to standard procedures (1989). Plasma total cholesterol levels and triglycerides were determined by enzymatic methods, and HDL-C was measured after dextran-magnesium precipitation. The Friedewald equation was used to calculate LDL levels in those with triglycerides levels &lt;400 mg/dL (Friedewald et al., 1972).

Cognitive assessment

Cognitive function was assessed at visit 5 using two cognitive tests in a standard order in a quiet room: the Delayed Word Recall Test (Knopman and Ryberg, 1989), and the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test (Wechsler, 1981). The Delayed Word Recall Test was used to assess verbal learning and memory, while the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test assessed executive function, sustained attention, and processing speed. A summary cognitive Z-score was created by standardizing the sum of these two tests at visit 5.

Other covariates

Variables included age at visit 1, sex, race/center (black–Mississippi, black–North Carolina, white–North Carolina, white–Maryland, white–Minnesota), educational attainment (less than high school, high school graduate or general equivalency diploma, or beyond high school), smoking status (ever or never), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), lipid lowering medications at visit 1 and APOE e4 status (by TaqMan assay; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). APOE ε4 carriers, genotyped previously, were defined based on the number of ε4 alleles (0, 1, or 2). Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, or use of antihypertensive medications. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, a nonfasting glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL, using medication for diabetes mellitus, or self-reported physician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Participants were followed up for an average of 23 ± 5 years.

Statistical Methods

We reported means with SDs and median with interquartile range for continuous variables and counts with percentages for categorical variables. All analyses incorporated sampling weights in order to account for the brain MRI sampling strategy. Brain volumes and their Z-scores were both assessed. Z- scores were calculated by subtracting the mean volume of each brain region and dividing it by the volume standard deviation. These Z-score transformations enabled us to compare the association between lipid levels across different brain volumes with different normal distributions.

We modeled the association between lipid levels and brain volumes using both continuous and, to promote interpretability, categorical lipid variables. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association between cholesterol levels with brain volumes as well as cognitive function with brain volumes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race-center, education), total intracranial volume, cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking, eGFR), cholesterol lowering medications at visit 1, follow-up duration and APOE4 status. For categorical analyses, lipid categories were defined as in the Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III) (Expert Panel on Detection and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in, 2001).

We used inverse probability weighted regression adjustments to estimate unbiased associations between brain volumes and lipid levels. This method was used to help address the possibility of selection bias from either selective mortality or other forms of attrition that could occur after study enrollment. This method is particularly relevant to longitudinal studies of aging-related health outcomes such as brain volume analyses later in life, given the high rates of attrition that are common in cohorts involving ageing populations. In order to account for potentially informative attrition in our analyses, we calculated stabilized weights (in addition to the selection to brain MRI weights) to apply to each observation in models of cholesterol levels and brain volumes using inverse probability of attrition weighting (Hernan et al., 2000; Power et al., 2013; Weuve et al., 2012). Specifically, we calculated separately two sets of stabilized weights, one modeling the probability of dying by the time of visit 5, another modeling the probability of not participation among those who were alive at the time of visit 5. Models to create weights included covariates assessed at each study visit including visit counts, age, education, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking, GFR, and cognitive test scores (visit 2 and 5), and interaction between continuous age with visit count. We then added these two weights to compute the summary weight. We calculated the C-statistics to describe each model’s ability to discriminate those who were censored from those who were not censored with higher values indicating a model with better discrimination. The C-statistics of our models used to derive inverse probability weights were 0.82 and 0.75 for death and non-death drop out, respectively. The mean of stabilized weights for death and non-death attrition were 0.98 (range 0.61 to 4.99) and 1.01 (range 0.83 to 9.77), respectively. We also truncated our weights at the 1st and 99th percentiles to investigate whether our results were driven by participants with weights at the extremes of the distribution.

Formal analysis of interaction was performed to investigate the association between cholesterol levels and total and regional brain volumes for subgroups of interest including age (analyzed as categorical variable), sex, race, status on taking lipid lowering medications, and indication for brain MRI. Multiplicative interactions were formally tested using interaction terms. Two-tailed P values &lt;0.05 were used for significance testing. All statistical analyses were done using Stata 14.0 (StataCorp LP; College Station, TX).

Results

From a total cohort of 15,792 enrolled at visit 1, 6,069 individuals died during follow-up and 469 were lost to follow-up. A total of 1,872 participants who completed brain MRI scans at visit 5 and whose blood lipid values were available at visit 1 were included for final analysis. Subjects had a mean age of 53 ± 5 years at visit 1 and 76 ± 5 at the time of brain MRI scan during visit 5. Table 1 describes the baseline and follow-up characteristics of the study population at visit 1 and 5. The mean levels of total cholesterol (mean 225.2 ± 41), LDL (140.4 ± 37), and triglycerides (104 ± 31) were higher and the HDL levels were lower (39 ± 17) for those who were lost to follow up due to death or other forms of drop out compared to the included cohort (P for all &lt; 0.01). A positive association was found between the summary cognitive score and total and regional brain volumes (Supplemental Table 1). These associations were strongest for the Alzheimer disease-related region (β 0.22, 95% CI 0.16, 0.25).

Association between midlife lipid levels and later life brain volumes and cognitive function

As shown in Table 2, multivariable models adjusting for baseline demographics, risk factors, cholesterol lowering medications, and APOE4 status were used to investigate the association between lipid levels and total and regional brain volumes. Both total cholesterol and LDL levels were positively associated with larger volumes of the Alzheimer disease-related region (β 0.036, 95% CI 0.001– 0.073, and β 0.048, 95% CI 0.048–0.085, respectively). In addition, higher LDL levels were associated with larger total brain volumes (β 0.033, 95% CI 0.006–0.060) as well as larger volumes of the temporal (β 0.038, 95% CI 0.003–0.074) and parietal lobes (β 0.044, 95% CI 0.009–0.077), with the strongest associations being present for volume of the Alzheimer disease-related region. An inverse relationship was seen between triglyceride levels and total brain volumes (β −0.033, 95% CI −0.060, −0.007); however, no significant associations were found between triglyceride levels and any regional brain volumes (Table 2). There were no associations between HDL levels and the volume of any of the brain regions (Table 2). Other variables positively associated with total brain volume included younger age, male sex, white race, and higher education, while history of hypertension, diabetes and a low eGFR were associated with smaller total brain volumes (Supplemental Table 2).

Similarly, analyses considering lipid categories showed that compared to normal LDL levels (&lt;100 mg/dl), all categories of higher LDL levels at baseline were associated with larger volumes of the Alzheimer disease-related region (Table 3). However, dose –response association were not found between higher LDL categories and the Alzheimer disease-related region. For total cholesterol values, only those with levels higher than 240 mg/dl, were found to have larger brain volumes of the parietal lobe and in the Alzheimer disease-related region (Table 3). Finally, participants with higher than 200 mg/dl triglyceride values at visit 1 were found to have smaller total brain volumes when compared to the reference range of &lt; 150 mg/dl triglyceride levels (Table 3).

When participants on lipid-lowering therapies at any ARIC visit were excluded (N=806), the effect estimate of associations between LDL levels and brain volumes increased slightly for most brain regions, although the associations remained significant only for the total brain volume (Supplemental Table 3).

Repeating the analyses using inverse probability of attrition weighting resulted in slight reductions in the coefficients of all of the associations between lipid levels and brain volumes (Supplemental Table 4). However, the relationship between LDL levels with parietal lobes, and Alzheimer disease-related region remained significant.

We did not find any significant associations between lipid levels and the summary cognitive score as shown in Supplemental Table 5.

Subgroup Analysis

Formal analysis of interaction revealed significant effect modification for the relationship between LDL levels and brain volumes by age. As shown in Table 4, the relationship between higher LDL levels with larger total and regional brain volumes were stronger and only significant for older adults (age &gt; 53). There was no evidence of effect modification by sex, or race. Also, no significant interaction was found in the relationship between other lipid levels or triglyceride levels and brain volumes for any of the above variables. Also, as shown in Supplemental Table 6, results remained similar when comparing those who underwent brain MRI scans for cognitive impairment compared to those who were randomly selected to undergo brain imaging.

Discussion

Our findings reveal that higher LDL levels at midlife are independently associated with larger total brain, temporal and parietal lobes, and volume of an Alzheimer disease-related region at late life and that triglyceride levels were found to be independently associated with total brain atrophy. However, these findings were not uniformly robust to our sensitivity analyses. Subgroup analyses indicated that these relationships existed only for the individuals who were older at baseline. After weighting to address potentially informative attrition, these associations were attenuated, but remained significant for the parietal lobe and Alzheimer disease-related region cortical volume.

The role of cholesterol levels in the pathogenesis of dementia remains controversial. A number of studies have suggested that high midlife cholesterol levels predict increased risk of dementia (Evans et al., 2000; Kalmijn et al., 2000; Kivipelto et al., 2002; Solomon et al., 2009a; Whitmer et al., 2005), and cognitive impairment (Power et al., 2018). However, other reports have failed to show such associations (Gottesman et al., 2017; Knopman et al., 2001; Mielke et al., 2010; Ong et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2003). While reasons for the discordance between the results of these studies are not clear, potential explanations include differences in the age of the cohort and the age when cholesterol levels were evaluated, with the possibility of selection bias in older cohorts (Weuve et al., 2015). Other potential explanations include the amount of time since cholesterol measurements were performed (Power et al., 2013) or reverse causation. Prior studies from the ARIC cohort have also investigated the association between cognition and lipid levels (Alonso et al., 2009; Gottesman et al., 2017; Knopman et al., 2001). Most of these reports did not find an association between lipid levels and risk of dementia or cognitive decline (Alonso et al., 2009; Gottesman et al., 2017; Knopman et al., 2001). Also, while cross-sectional analyses have failed to show any associations between lipid levels and cognitive performances at any visits in the ARIC cohort, a more recent study found that higher lipid levels at baseline are associated with a greater 20-year cognitive decline among 13,997 participants from the ARIC cohort (Power et al., 2018). In our study, cognitive function was positively associated with brain volumes, suggesting that In our study, data on changes in brain volumes were not available. Future studies are required to investigate if lipid levels have a similar longitudinal impact on structural changes in the brain as well.

We showed in the present study, that both total cholesterol and LDL levels measured at midlife correlate with total and regional brain volumes 20 years later in life. In particular, we found that the strongest associations were found between higher total cholesterol or LDL levels and larger volume of an Alzheimer’s disease-related region. It has been suggested that lower LDL levels later in life could reflect ongoing pathological processes in the brain (Leritz et al., 2011; Solomon et al., 2009b). Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease for example have shown to have disturbances in cholesterol homeostasis, leading to lower cholesterol synthesis (Solomon et al., 2009b). These individuals have also shown to have both lower plasma levels of cholesterol precursors, as well as lower levels of surrogate markers of brain cholesterol metabolism such as 24S-hydroxycholesterol (Solomon et al., 2009b). Together, these findings suggest that the process of neurodegeneration may result in lower LDL levels, due in part to a disruption in the production of brain cholesterol.

In our study, the association between cholesterol values and brain volumes appeared to only be present among individuals older than 55 years of age at baseline. This finding is consistent with a previous study from the ARIC cohort which showed that the relative hazard of dementia associated with hypercholesterolemia decreased with increasing age, which could partly be explained by the possibility that susceptible individuals died (Alonso et al., 2009). Other studies have also indicated that higher cholesterol levels in older individuals are associated with a decreased risk for dementia (Mielke et al., 2005; Solfrizzi et al., 2002). One explanation for this finding could be the recognition that hypocholesterolemia is associated with frailty and poor general health (Corti et al., 1997). Reduced cholesterol levels in late-life have also been associated with higher systemic inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6. Elevated levels of interleukin-6 are linked to cognitive impairment and dementia (Miwa et al., 2016; Trapero and Cauli, 2014). Therefore, lower serum cholesterol in late-life may reflect other ongoing pathological processes in the brain and represent a risk marker for cognitive dysfunction and dementia.

Our findings showed higher triglyceride levels associated with smaller total brain volumes. This finding is consistent with prior reports showing a link between hypertriglyceridemia and brain atrophy (Raffaitin et al., 2011; Shan et al., 2019; Tiehuis et al., 2014). A diet rich in triglycerides has shown to alter the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and subsequently induce astrocyte lipid droplet formation, and increase secretion of inflammatory cytokines (Lee et al., 2017; Refolo et al., 2000). High triglyceride levels have also shown to be associated with loss of gray matter volume (Shan et al., 2019). All these findings suggest a neurotoxic effect of high triglyceride levels on the brain structure that can induce brain atrophy over time. This is in contrast to cholesterol that is shown to play an essential role in both neuronal structure and function (Linetti et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010). The differential effects of high triglyceride levels versus high LDL levels on the brain structure found in our study suggests that these two lipid components may have different effects on the brain structure and function.

The major strength of our study included the long-term follow-up of subjects in a large cohort of well described community-dwelling individuals which allowed for the lifespan examination of the relationship and temporality between cholesterol levels and brain volumes. Our study also has some notable limitations. First, selection bias from loss of participants due to death or other forms of attrition may have influenced the results, particularly among older individuals. To address this limitation, we used inverse-probability-of attrition weighting in order to examine the influence of attrition-related selection bias on the estimated association between cholesterol values and brain volumes. Our results show that while the point estimates were often substantially attenuated, these relationships remained significant for volume of parietal lobe and Alzheimer disease-related region. Second, given that lipid measurements were likely significantly affected by using of lipid-lowering therapies, we attempted to address this issue by first adjusting for use of lipid-lowering medications at visit 1, and second by excluding individuals on lipid-lowering therapies at any visit. Our results remained materially unchanged using these approaches. Finally, the prevalence of hypertension for participants at visit 1 was relatively low which indicates a lower cardiovascular risk in our population at visit 1.

In conclusion, our findings based on a large population-based cohort study provide evidence that higher total cholesterol or LDL levels are independently associated with larger total and regional brain volumes, while higher triglyceride levels are linked to future brain atrophy. These findings highlight the complex association between blood lipids in midlife, and brain structure later in life.
