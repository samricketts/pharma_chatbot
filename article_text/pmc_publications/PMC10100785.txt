In a recent article from Cell Reports Medicine, Kwak et al. generate novel insights about subtyping cognitively impaired individuals based on structural imaging. Quantifying heterogeneity in Alzheimer’s disease via subtyping could help us harness new disease-modifying therapies and improve patient care by providing a more targeted approach.


pmcPersonalized medicine is now a fundamental part of healthcare. For example, the simple risk-based calculation, the HAS-BLED score [1], allows us to calculate the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation as we determine whether to recommend anticoagulation. This calculation and its counterpart, the CHA2DS2-VASc score, which quantifies the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, combines patient-specific factors such as history of stroke, age, and the use of alcohol, for example, to arrive at a decision that ultimately optimizes the patient’s health.

Until 2021, there were no disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) so management was primarily symptomatic. Cognitive therapies consisted of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil and the NMDA antagonist memantine, which was incidentally the most recently approved treatment for AD in 2003 (Figure 1). While these medications are somewhat effective at managing cognitive symptoms of AD, they are not strictly disease-modifying [2]. Given the recent accelerated regulatory approval of aducanumab and the preliminary success of donanemab in its Phase II trial [3], people suffering from AD now have a glimmer of hope. However, it must be noted that the promise of these therapies, especially aducanumab, is clouded by insufficient evidence on their efficacy and the projected high-cost burden that can impact patient finances and Medicare.

As personalized medicine approaches using disease-modifying therapies have the broad potential to alter the disease process of AD, it is critical for us to identify AD subtypes that may benefit the most from these medications. In the latest issue published in Cell Reports Medicine, Kwak et al. make great strides toward this end by engineering a method of subtyping patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a stage in the spectrum of AD that is potentially most amenable to treatment.

There have been numerous ways of subtyping persons with AD. Clinically, patients may present in the following ways: with the classic amnestic AD presentation; posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), where patients demonstrate visual deficits; a frontal variant, where patients demonstrate executive or behavioral dysfunction found in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD); a logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), where patients exhibit language deficits; and a motor variant called corticobasal degeneration (CBD), where patients exhibit movement deficits [5]. Clinical variants have been broadly correlated with differences in pathology [6–8]. For example, pathological subtyping has been used to differentiate AD patient groups that demonstrate hippocampal-sparing pathology, classical pathology, and limbic pathology, the hippocampal-sparing pathology bearing a larger proportion of patients with atypical features of AD [7]. This subtyping scheme could prove particularly useful in motivating the development of directed therapeutics, as hippocampal-sparing AD also demonstrates differences in TDP-43, vascular, and Lewy body pathology versus more classical pathology and limbic pathology [7]. Recently, Petersen et al. also found associations between the burden of neurofibrillary tangles in different brain regions and each of the different clinical phenotypes, including amnestic, CBD, lvPPA, bvFTD, and PCA [8].

Patients with MCI have been divided based on levels of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (CSFBs) into groups that correspond to different rates of progression to AD [9]. AD is related to high levels of CSF p-tau and t-tau and low levels of CSF amyloid-β (Aβ); patients with MCI who have CSFBs characteristic of AD are more likely to progress rapidly [9]. Thus, CSFBs give us the ability to subtype patients into those at higher or lower risk of progressing to AD rapidly and would potentially benefit the most from early interventions with novel biologics.

While CSFBs are widely available, the low dimensionality of this data, in addition to a lack of between-center standardization, are natural limitations to its utility in demarcating different AD subtypes. To this end, imaging has proved beneficial to noninvasively identify pathological subtypes in patients using data-driven approaches, such as that of Vogel et al., who utilized tau positron emission tomography (PET) and a novel algorithm to capture spatiotemporal heterogeneity in AD [10]. Interestingly, these subtypes correlate well with certain pathological and clinical subtypes of AD; they identify posterior, limbic, and medial temporal lobe-sparing subtypes among their four subtypes, in addition to a lateral temporal lobe subtype. Kwak and colleagues [4] make the latest effort to subtype AD, utilizing deep learning to sort patients with MCI into those with patterns of atrophy most like patients with AD and those most like patients with MCI, noting that the resulting subtypes demonstrate different rates of atrophy and different foci of cognitive impairment. Again, these cognitive domains are related to previously established subtypes for AD and consist of patients with executive, memory, and verbal dysfunction, as well as a cognitively normal group. Importantly, this paper extends subtyping to persons with MCI, a stage of AD where patients may be more treatable, and utilizes structural imaging [i.e., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], which is more widely available than PET and has more available data for model development. Finally, preliminary work, using different levels of Aβ, identified unique subtypes of gray matter atrophy patterns that correspond to different rates of progression to AD, which were confirmed with pathology [11].

It is interesting to note that subtyping based on each of these tools (clinical features, pathology, CSFBs, imaging, and progression rates) results in similar phenotypes. Methods to confirm discrete phenotypes will ultimately give clinicians and pharmaceutical companies better ways to stratify patients and identify those who would most benefit from targeted interventions with new biological therapies. The development of subtyping frameworks is an exciting opportunity to expand the definition of AD from a single entity to a collective of diseases arising from various etiologies.

The broken line represents the approval of memantine, in 2003, the last drug approved for AD treatment prior to aducanumab in 2021. There has been an explosion of research in subtyping since that point. Search queries were as follows: ‘(Alzheimer’s Disease[Title/Abstract]) AND ((Subtype[Title/Abstract]) OR (Subtyping[Title/Abstract]))’ in addition to: Pathology: ‘(Pathology[Title/Abstract])’, Clinical: ‘((Clinical[Title/Abstract]) OR (Clinically[Title/Abstract]) OR (Behavior[Title/Abstract]))’, Imaging: ‘((MRI[Title/Abstract]) OR (PET[Title/Abstract]))’, CSF: ‘((CSF[Title/Abstract]) OR (Cerebrospinal Fluid[Title/Abstract]))’.
