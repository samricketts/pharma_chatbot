Amyloids are self-assembled protein aggregates that represent a major hallmark of many neurologic and systemic diseases. Among the common features of amyloids is the presence of a high density of multiple binding sites for small molecule ligands, making them an attractive target for design of multimeric binding agents. Here, we demonstrate that noncovalent, intermolecular interactions between a 1:1 mixture of oppositely charged benzothiazole molecules enhances their binding to two different amyloid aggregates: Alzheimer’s-related amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides or Parkinson’s-related α-synuclein (αS) proteins. We show that this mixture leads to positively cooperative binding to amyloid targets, with up to 10-fold enhancement of binding compared to the uncharged parent compound. The observed enhancement of amyloid binding using noncovalent interactions was similar in magnitude to a benzothiazole dimer to aggregated Aβ. These results represent a novel strategy for designing amyloid-targeting molecules with enhanced affinity, which could aid in the development of new diagnostic or treatment strategies for amyloid-associated diseases.

The conversion of soluble proteins into amyloids, proteinaceous aggregates with high cross-β sheet structure, is associated with a broad range of neuro-degenerative disorders1,2 such as Alzheimer’s disease3 (AD) or Parkinson’s disease4 (PD), as well as non-neuropathic diseases such as type II diabetes5 and sexually transmitted diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).6 As the list of amyloid-associated diseases continues to grow,7 methods to target these natural materials with small molecules for disease prevention, treatment, and/or diagnosis continues to be of increasing fundamental importance.

We previously reported the design and synthesis of several oligo(ethylene glycol) derivatives of benzothiazole aniline (BTA) that are capable of targeting amyloid aggregates with mid to high nanomolar affinity.8–10 In addition to demonstrating the capability of these molecules to protect neuroblastoma cells from the toxicity of Alzheimer’s-related amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates,10,11 we showed that these molecules were also capable of targeting the naturally abundant amyloid Semen-derived Enhancer of Virus Infection (SEVI) and neutralizing its capability to enhance HIV transmission in cervical cells. While these studies reveal some exciting potential opportunities for amyloid targeting agents in disease treatment and prevention, novel approaches to further improve amyloid binding affinities are still needed to improve potency.

In order to develop a method to improve the binding of synthetic molecules to amyloid targets, we12,13 and others14 previously reported the development of oligomeric12 and polymeric13 BTA derivatives that were designed to simultaneously bind to multiple binding sites (i.e., multivalent binding) along the surface of amyloid fibrils (Figure 1a); adjacent binding sites on amyloid fibrils for BTA moieties have been estimated to be as close as 2 nm apart.15 As expected, the oligomeric BTA derivatives exhibited a trend of increasing binding to aggregated Aβ peptides as a function of increasing valence number.12 While this multivalent approach to the design of amyloid binding molecules led to significant improvements in overall binding compared to monomeric BTA molecules, some significant drawbacks16,17 to this previous approach are (1) the difficulty of synthesis,12 (2) the poor aqueous solubility of the oligomers,18 and (3) the large size of the oligomeric compounds that introduce potential challenges for biocompatibility.19 In order to address these challenges while also building upon the promising use of cooperative interactions for improving amyloid binding of synthetic molecules, here we designed and synthesized two charged derivatives of the known amyloid-binding benzothiazole molecule, BAM1-EG6 (Figure 1b),10,20 which we hypothesized could introduce cooperative noncovalent interactions between molecules bound to adjacent binding sites along the surface of amyloids, thereby improving amyloid binding while eliminating the need for covalent linkages between amyloid-binding moieties.

In this proof-of-concept study, we used electrostatic interactions between small molecules as a simple demonstration of an approach to introduce cooperativity in the binding to amyloid targets (Figure 1b). We incorporated choline and sulfonate groups into the parent BAM1-EG6 compounds since they have been widely used to install positive and negative charges, respectively, on molecules due to their capability to retain essentially permanent charges across a broad range of pH.21 The negatively charged (–)BAM1-EG6 and positively charged (+)BAM1-EG6 (Figure 1b) were prepared from BAM1-EG610,20 through standard SN2 and amide coupling procedures (see Scheme S1 and the Supporting Information for details on the synthesis and characterization of these charged compounds). We used previously reported12 BTA monomer (1) and dimer (2) (Figure 1a) as controls in this study to compare multivalent versus noncovalent interactions as strategies for designing high affinity binding agents to amyloid targets.

With the charged BAM1-EG6 derivatives in hand, we compared the binding of pure BAM1-EG6 to the binding of a 1:1 mixture of (+)BAM1-EG6:(–)BAM1-EG6 [referred to as (+/–)BAM1-EG6 for short] to aggregated Aβ peptides utilizing a previously reported centrifugation binding assay. 12,22 This intrinsic fluorescence assay was performed under equilibrium binding conditions (Figure S1). Here, we found a significantly stronger binding interaction between aggregated Aβ and the (+/–)BAM1-EG6 mixture (Kd = 20 nM) compared to the binding of the uncharged BAM1-EG6 (Kd = 170 nM) (Table 1, Figure S2). In order to compare the strategies for improving the binding of small molecules to amyloid targets using multivalent interactions versus non-covalent, intermolecular interactions (Figure 1), we calculated the enhancement factor, fi, proposed by Whitesides and co-workers [β = Ka(multi)/Ka(mono)]16,17 for both cases, which provides an estimate of the benefit of multimeric binding interactions in systems with unknown number of total binding sites (N) (as is the case with a heterogeneous mixture of amyloid aggregates). Here, we calculated an enhancement factor, β, of 10 for binding of the (+/–)BAM1-EG6 mixture to aggregated Aβ relative to BAM1-EG6 (Table 1), which was slightly better than the enhancement factor calculated for the binding of the covalently linked BTA dimer 2 (Kd = 29 nM) versus BTA monomer 1 (Kd = 235 nM) to aggregated Aβ (β = 8, Figure S3).

Next, we examined the degree of cooperativity for the binding of BTA dimer 2 and for the binding of the (+/–)BAM1-EG6 mixture to Aβ aggregates by estimating the Hill coefficients from the saturation binding curves of Aβ aggregates bound by the compounds (Figure 2, also see Figures S2 and S3).23 The analysis revealed that the binding of dimer 2 to Aβ aggregates was slightly negatively cooperative, with a Hill coefficient of h = 0.8 (p = 0.005, compared to h = 1). This result is consistent with the observed negative cooperativity typically found in most reported natural and unnatural multivalent binding systems due to various factors such as unfavorable geometric strain or entropic cost due to the structural constraint of linkers used to covalently join ligands and receptors.16 In contrast to the results with BTA dimer 2, we found that the (+/–)BAM1-EG6 mixture exhibited positive cooperativity upon binding to Aβ aggregates, with a Hill coefficient of h = 3.3; this result was significantly different from the observed Hill coefficient for both the dimer 2 (p = 0.001) and neutral parent compound, BAM1-EG6 (p = 0.02), as determined by unpaired t test (Table 1). In order to provide a qualitative visual representation for these differences in cooperativity, Figure 2 shows an overlay of the normalized binding curves of (+/–)BAM1-EG6 and dimer 2 to aggregated Aβ peptides, where the increasing steepness of the sigmoidal curve reflects the larger Hill coefficient for the binding of the mixture of charged BTA molecules compared to dimer 2.

As a control, we also assessed the binding of pure (+) or (–) BAM1-EG6 to Aβ aggregates. Since the pI of Aβ has been reported to be ~5.5,24 we performed all binding studies at pH 5.5 to minimize electrostatic interactions between the charged BAM agents and aggregated Aβ (Figure S4). Surprisingly, under these conditions we found that pure (+)BAM1-EG6 exhibited a Kd = 290 nM to Aβ aggregates, whereas pure (–)BAM1-EG6 exhibited a Kd = 40 nM to Aβ aggregates (Figure S4) (compared to a Kd = 170 nM for uncharged BAM1-EG6), suggesting that some electrostatic interactions between the charged small molecules and the (apparently positively charged) amyloid surface could not be completely avoided at pH 5.5. However, the low enhancement factor (β = 0.6 and β = 4), the lack of significant positive cooperativity (h = 0.7 and 1.6) found for binding of pure (+) or (–)BAM1-EG6, respectively, as well as the tighter apparent binding of the (+/–)BAM1-EG6 mixture (20 nM) to Aβ aggregates compared to ether pure charged BAM derivative (40 nM or 290 nM) suggests that the intermolecular noncovalent interactions between oppositely charged BAM agents in the 1:1 mixture of (+/–)BAM1-EG6 play an important role in the observed increased apparent binding of this mixture to the amyloid surface.

In order to provide additional experimental evidence that electrostatic interactions play a role in the binding of (+/–)BAM1-EG6 to Aβ aggregates, we examined the binding of (+/–)BAM1-EG6 in pH 5.5 water containing high salt concentrations (i.e., 500 mM NaCl), which we expect would diminish electrostatic interactions.25 As anticipated, under high salt conditions we observed a significantly lower apparent binding affinity for (+/–)BAM1-EG6 to Aβ aggregates compared to when no NaCl was added (Table 1). Additionally, the positive cooperativity that was observed for the (+/–)BAM1-EG6 mixture in pure water was eliminated in the presence of high salt, exhibiting a Hill coefficient that was similar (i.e., not significant by unpaired t test) to neutrally charged BAM1-EG6 bound to aggregated Aβ (Table 1). Taken together, the observed decrease in apparent affinity and cooperativity for binding of (+/–)BAM1-EG6 to Aβ aggregates under high salt conditions suggests that electrostatic interactions play a dominant role for the improved binding of (+/–)BAM1-EG6 to Aβ compared to BAM1-EG6 in pure water.

To examine whether the use of noncovalent, intermolecular interactions could improve the binding of BTA derivatives to amyloids derived from peptides or proteins other than Aβ, we next tested the binding of (+/–)BAM1-EG6 to a preparation of aggregated α-synuclein (αS) at pH 5 (the pI of αS has been reported to be ~4.726), a protein associated with Lewy bodies found in patients with Parkinson’s disease. As was the case with Aβ aggregates, we found that (+/–)BAM1-EG6 bound stronger (Kd = 400 nM) to aggregated αS compared to the uncharged parent compound, BAM1-EG6 (Kd = 1100 nM), with an estimated enhancement factor β of 3 (Table 1, Figure S5). Under high salt conditions, this enhancement of apparent binding of (+/–)BAM1-EG6 to aggregated αS was abolished and the apparent binding was comparable of BAM1-EG6. Furthermore, a Hill coefficient of h = 3.8 (with no added salt) suggested that (+/–)BAM1-EG6 exhibited positive cooperativity for binding to aggregated αS (Table 1, p = 0.006 compared to binding of neutral BAM1-EG6). These binding results with αS further support that noncovalent, electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged BTA derivatives can improve the apparent binding of small molecules to multiple (here, two) amyloidogenic protein aggregates.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that noncovalent interactions between synthetic molecules can be used to improve their binding to amyloid targets. We show that a 1:1 mixture of negatively charged (–)BAM1-EG6 and positively charged (+)BAM1-EG6 exhibited a 10-fold enhancement of binding to aggregated Aβ peptides and a 3-fold enhancement for binding to aggregated αS proteins compared to the neutrally charged parent compound, BAM1-EG6. The observed enhancement in binding was substantially reduced in the presence of high salt, supporting the significant role of electrostatic interactions in the binding of (+/–)BAM1-EG6 to the amyloid surface. We hypothesize that differences in average binding site densities for small molecules on different amyloid compositions15,27 could play a role in influencing the extent of improved binding between molecules bound to nearby sites on an amyloid surface (Figure S6). While it remains to be seen, such differences in average binding site densities may potentially be further exploited to improve the targeting of one amyloid composition over another using a similar approach as described here. Furthermore, we show that using noncovalent interactions between monomeric amyloid-binding molecules led to the same degree of enhancement in binding to aggregated Aβ as a covalently attached dimeric molecule 2, and demonstrated the possibility of using noncovalent interactions to impart positive cooperativity into the amyloid-binding properties of small molecules. Given that the affinity of BTA analogues for binding to amyloids was directly correlated with potency for reducing seminal amyloid-mediated HIV infection,12 the work presented here could lead to improved design of microbicide supplements for reducing transmission of certain sexually transmitted diseases. Current efforts are focused on exploring other noncovalent or reversible interactions (such as metal chelation) in the design of high affinity amyloid-binding small molecules to improve bio-compatibility and targeting of amyloids associated with Alzheimer’s and other amyloid-related diseases.

METHODS

Measurement ofthe Binding Affinity to Aggregated Aβ (1 – 42) or α-Synuclein (αS).

Binding of compounds to aggregated Aβ (1–42) and αS was measured according to a previously described assay.8 Briefly, 200 μL of various concentrations of BTA/BAM compounds in DI H2O or 500 mM NaCl/DI H2O (high salt conditions) were incubated in the absence or presence of 10 μg of preaggregated amyloid (total volume 220 μL). Solutions were allowed to equilibrate overnight at room temperature. Samples were then centrifuged at 16 000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed and the pellet was resuspended in 220 μL of fresh DI H2O or 500 mM NaCl. Fluorescence of the bound molecule was determined using a spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Inc., Birmingham, NJ). Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and error bars denote standard deviation from the mean. Graphs shown in Figures S1–S5 were fit using the following one-site specific binding algorithm with Hill slope to determine Kd:Y=BmaxXh/(Kdh+Xh), where X is the concentration of small molecule, Y is the specific binding intensity, Bmax is the apparent maximal observable fluorescence upon binding to Aβ/αS, and h is the Hill slope. Data was processed using Origin 7.0 (MicroCal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA) and GraphPad Prism 6. For statistics comparing Hill coefficients, the unpaired t test with Welch’s correction was used and calculated from GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA).
