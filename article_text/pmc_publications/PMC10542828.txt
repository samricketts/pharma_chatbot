In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Yoo et al.1 report that replacing Trem2 knockout microglia with Trem2 wild-type microglia-like cells derived from systemically transplanted hematopoietic cells rectifies microglial dysfunction in a mouse model of amyloidosis. These findings highlight the potential of microglia replacement therapy for Alzheimer’s disease treatment.


pmcAlzheimer’s disease (AD) remains incurable and attempts to slow down the disease progression and cognitive decline often prove unsuccessful. There is an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. In recent years, genome-wide association studies, whole genome sequencing, and gene-expression network analysis have implicated that immune networks play a significant role in AD.2 These studies have also uncovered many AD risk genes that are primarily expressed by microglia, the brain-resident innate immune cells. Microglia are essential in maintaining brain homeostasis and health. However, in the context of AD, microglia lose their ability to provide normal neuroprotective functions and instead undergo various dysfunctional changes, including morphological alterations, impaired lipid metabolism, and transcriptional changes, all of which are frequently detrimental, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.3 Introducing healthy and functionally competent microglia or microglia-like cells as replacements of diseased microglia presents potential therapeutic avenues for AD treatment. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Yoo et al.1 present initial proof-of-concept data demonstrating the potential of microglia replacement as a therapeutic approach for AD.

The experimental design in this study by Yoo et al. is innovative (Figure 1A).1 First, Trem2−/−;5XFAD mice were employed as the AD model. The R47H variant of Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (Trem2), expressed by myeloid cells including microglia, significantly increases the risk for AD. In mice, it is evident that Trem2 R47H is a loss-of-function mutation, which is partly why Trem2−/−;5XFAD mice is used as a model of Trem2-dependent AD. Using Trem2−/−;5XFAD mice also provides a reliable baseline to investigate whether replacing Trem2−/− endogenous microglia with Trem2+/+ cells can reinstate microglial functions in the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) pathology. Second, a bone marrow transplantation approach, as established in recent studies,4 is employed to efficiently replace endogenous microglia. By systemically transplanting bone marrow cells isolated from Trem2+/+;5XFAD mice, Yoo et al. demonstrate that over 90% of the endogenous microglial cells are substituted with microglia-like cells generated from donor-derived myeloid cells in the circulation.1 To account for the effects of the transplantation procedure itself, Trem2−/− bone marrow cells isolated from Trem2−/−;5XFAD mice are also transplanted into Trem2−/−;5XFAD mice as a control.

Yoo et al. present exciting findings, showing that donor-derived Trem 2+/+ microglia-like cells, but not the Trem2−/− cells, effectively restore microglial functions in Trem2−/−;5XFAD mice.1 These Trem2+/+ microglia-like cells successfully reinstate microglial activation and the disease-associated microglia (DAM) transcriptional program in response to Aβ pathology. Moreover, they contribute to the amelioration of Aβ pathology by engaging in Aβ plaque phagocytosis, reducing Aβ deposition, and promoting Aβ plaque compaction. Notably, the Trem2+/+ microglia-like cells exhibit superior neuro-protection compared to endogenous Trem2−/− microglial cells. There is a decrease in dystrophic neurites (marked by Lamp1, a late endosome and lysosome marker) around 6E10-labeled Aβ plaques in Trem2−/−;5XFAD mice that received transplantation with Trem2+/+ bone marrow cells (Figure 1A). To establish a link between histological restoration and functional recovery, it would be essential to assess functional changes in neurons (e.g., synaptic activity) and neural circuit plasticity (e.g., long-term potentiation or LTP). Additionally, conducting behavioral experiments with the mice to evaluate cognitive functions and the impact of microglia replacement on behavioral phenotypes would be ideal. Unfortunately, these data are not provided, in part due to the limitation of the mouse model where Trem2 knockout does not have a significant additional impact on animal behavior. Mechanistically, Yoo et al. employ fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate donor-derived Trem2+/+ and Trem2−/− microglia-like cells for bulk RNA-sequencing.1 By analyzing differentially expressed genes and validating them through immunohistochemistry, they propose that the Trem2+/+ microglia-like cells restore microglial dysfunction via the Trem2-Clec7a-Syk pathway. While these findings align with previous reports, performing single-cell analysis (e.g., single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq) would provide more informative insights, allowing for a clear identification of subpopulations within the Trem2+/+ microglia-like cells, assessment of their inflammatory states, and possibly a comparison between donor-derived microglia-like cells and endogenous microglia.

It is worth noting that in this study, replacing endogenous microglia in Trem2−/−;5XFAD mice with Trem2+/+ microglia-like cells only achieves a reduction in Aβ load comparable to that observed in Trem2+/+;5XFAD mice, which still represents pathological conditions. While this study introduces a promising approach for AD treatment, there are still several unanswered questions that need to be addressed before microglia replacement therapy can be deemed an effective treatment for AD.

The following are some potential questions (Figure 1B). (1) What is the optimal cell type for microglia replacement? While Yoo et al. demonstrate mouse-to-mouse cell transplantation, it is crucial to show that transplantation of human cells also provides protective effects.1 Human hematopoietic cells can be obtained from donors for transplantation, and hematopoietic progenitor cells can be differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) for systemic transplantation to replace microglia. Nevertheless, circulation myeloid cell-derived microglia-like cells are not equivalent to brain-resident microglia. The long-term impact of infiltrating the brain with microglia-like cells derived from circulating myeloid cells remains unclear, particularly in the presence of AD pathology. This raises the question of whether using authentic microglial cells derived from human PSCs would be a more suitable option for microglia replacement. (2) Which pre-clinical rodent models are suitable for validating microglia replacement therapy? The role of microglial Trem2 in neurodegeneration is perplexing. While complete loss of TREM2 function results in the neurodegenerative disease Nasu-Hakola disease, these patients do not develop AD-related hallmark pathology. In mice, Trem2 loss-of-function does not induce neurodegeneration, and Trem2 deficiency is neuroprotective in Tau mouse models.5 These findings underscore the significance of considering disease states and species differences between human and mouse biology. Therefore, it is crucial to employ rodent models that encompass various disease states, including Aβ and tau pathology stages. Moreover, utilizing chimeric rodent brain models that incorporate human microglia, macroglia, and/or neurons6–8 would enhance our understanding of the disease mechanisms and aid in treatment development. (3) Yoo et al. demonstrate that when cells are transplanted at 3 weeks of age (prior to the development of Aβ pathology), they exhibit more pronounced protective effects compared to transplantation at 8–10 weeks of age (after the development of Aβ pathology).1 This raises concerns regarding the resilience of donor-derived cells being present in the diseased brain environment over an extended period. Will they maintain their protective function or undergo dysfunctional changes that could be detrimental? Recent evidence indicates the presence of genes that confer resistance to AD and even genes that promote resilience, allowing individuals to cope with amyloid and/or phosphorylated tau while preserving learning and memory functions.9 Intriguingly, a recent study highlights the association between clonal hematopoiesis and protection from AD, suggesting the presence of protective gene variants in myeloid cells.10 Replacing microglia with hematopoietic stem cells or microglia carrying the resistance/resilience gene variants could potentially provide a long-lasting treatment for AD.
