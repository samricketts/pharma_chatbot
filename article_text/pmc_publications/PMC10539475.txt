Objectives:

As lifespans increase in people with HIV (PWH), there is concern that age-related neurodegenerative disorders may contribute to cognitive decline. We asked whether brain accumulation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated proteins amyloid-beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) predicted cognitive performance in middle-aged PWH.

Methods:

In a prospectively followed, cognitively-characterized autopsy sample of 135 PWH, we used immunohistochemistry to assess Aβ plaques and neuronal p-tau in medial temporal and lateral frontal lobes. These pathologies were tested for associations with cognitive performance in 7 domains: motor, speed of information processing, working memory, memory encoding, memory retrieval, verbal fluency, and abstraction/executive function. Univariate and multivariate analyses accounting for HIV-associated variables, reading level, and comorbidities were conducted. Longitudinal trajectories of memory functions were evaluated in 60 individuals with a median follow-up of 6.0 years.

Results:

In this population with mean age 51.4 +/− 0.9 years, 58% displayed neuronal p-tau and 29% Aβ plaques. Neuronal p-tau, but not Aβ, predicted worse memory encoding and retrieval, but not other cognitive functions. With an ordinal hierarchy of neuronal p-tau locations (entorhinal, hippocampal, neocortical), decreased memory performance correlated with neocortical distribution. Memory function trajectories could not be distinguished between individuals with and without neuronal p-tau, and over 80% of the sample showed no change over time.

Conclusion:

In this middle-aged sample, neuronal p-tau accumulation contributes to memory deficits, but is not associated with accelerated decline in function over time. In the absence of AD-like deterioration, other etiologies for neuronal p-tau in cognitively impaired PWH must be considered.

pmcIntroduction

A feature of aging and neurodegeneration is the accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates in brain, as proteostasis becomes progressively dysregulated over time (1). The parenchymal deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and intra-neuronal aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) increase in frequency with age, and are critical to the definition and pathogenesis of the most common age-related dementing disorder, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (2; 3). However, the relationship between these tissue biomarkers and cognitive phenotypes is complex. While the most severe and pervasive accumulations of Aβ and p-tau, in the form of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, are definitively associated with dementia, it is widely recognized that individuals with mild and moderate accumulations of the same proteins and pathologies can evidence normal cognition (4; 5; 6). Furthermore, extensive neurofibrillary tangle formation with little or no Aβ accumulation can be seen in non-AD pathologies, including primary age-related tauopathy (PART), whose clinical manifestations fall into a spectrum from normal cognition to selective memory loss to severe dementia (7). Diverse clinical and neuropathologic studies in HIV negative individuals have been undertaken to relate the distribution and severity of Aβ and p-tau deposition to clinical phenotypes, focused both on patterns of clinical deficit and temporal rate of cognitive decline (8; 9; 10; 11). Not only has the classification of neurodegenerative disorders evolved through these analyses, there has been increasing recognition that other co-morbid conditions, such as vascular disease and neuroinflammation, are important in defining the potentially person-specific pathologies contributing to dementia (12; 13; 9; 14; 15).

With combination anti-retroviral therapies (cART), people living with HIV (PWH) are aging into decades in which early AD pathologies manifest (16). This has created a unique paradigm for “person-specific” pathology, as there is potential for HIV to cause CNS damage in concert with aging and neurodegeneration. Whereas virally-mediated neuroinflammation accounts for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in individuals lacking benefits of cART, a residuum of generally milder neuropsychological impairment without similarly robust neuroinflammation has become apparent in treated populations (17; 18; 19). As the basis of cART-era deficits is unclear, there is interest in the potential contributions of Aβ and p-tau pathologies to HIV-associated neuropsychological phenotypes (20; 21; 22; 23; 24). While most neuroimaging and CSF biomarker studies of cognitively compromised PWH have not found increased prevalence of p-tau and Aβ pathologies compared to uninfected controls, these studies have often been undertaken in middle-aged groups where the general population-specific rates of detected abnormality are low (25; 26; 27; 23). Thus, the increased sensitivity afforded by direct neuropathologic investigation of brain tissue is necessary to determine whether abnormal deposition of Aβ and p-tau contribute to cognitive abnormalities in middle-aged and aging PWH. Accordingly, the goal of the present study was to examine potential contributions of Aβ and p-tau deposition to abnormal cognitive functioning in PWH, by direct histological examination of autopsy brain tissue from prospectively characterized donors enrolled in the Manhattan HIV Brain Bank (MHBB).

Materials and Methods

Patient population

The MHBB (U24MH100931) conducts a longitudinal, observational study of PWH who agree to be research brain donors upon demise. This study sample was selected from a group of 257 autopsies performed between 2009 and 2019, in which immunohistochemical staining of brain for Aβ and p-tau was performed (28). Of these, 135 donors had at least one neurocognitive assessment prior to death. MHBB participants are consented for study participation and brain donation with protocols approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) Institutional Review Board. The larger sample from which cognitively characterized individuals were selected had the following characteristics: mean age (years) 52.8+/−12.1 standard deviation (SD); 62% male; mean duration HIV (years) 15.5+/− 7.5 (SD); median log plasma HIV load 1.93 [1.69, 4.81] interquartile range (IQR); and median CD4 T cell count (cells/mm3) 156 [56, 394] IQR (28).

Clinical study procedures

Study participants are seen every 6, 12 or 24 months, determined by medical acuity. Visits include reviews of medical diseases and laboratory testing for plasma HIV loads and CD4 T cell enumerations. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery is administered, assessing seven cognitive domains: motor, speed of information processing, working memory, memory encoding, memory retrieval, verbal fluency, and abstraction/executive function (29). Test T-scores are calculated with normative data correcting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education as appropriate, and domain T-scores derived by averaging test T-scores as previously described (29). Pre-morbid ability is estimated with the reading subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test-3 (WRAT-3). For all 135 participants, the last assessment prior to death with at least 2 cognitive domains examined was used to probe associations between protein depositions and neuropsychological test performance. As the median time between the last study visit and death was 164 [98, 279] (IQR) days, many individuals had significant medical illness. Individual tests were not administered if response validity was questionable, impacting completion of batteries. A total of 32 study participants had one or more missing domain T scores at the last visit, but were retained in analyses for completed domains to avoid bias towards higher functioning individuals and longer intervals between cognitive and neuropathologic evaluations.

Brain processing and scoring

The brain was bisected at autopsy, one hemisphere fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin, and tissue blocks from at least 25 regions obtained, as previously described (30). Five micron sections of mid-frontal gyrus (region of BA9) and medial temporal lobe (with hippocampus and parahippocampal cortices) were used for immunohistochemical staining on a Ventana Benchmark XT autostainer (Roche Tissue Diagnostics, Tucson, AZ), using primary antibodies to Aβ (clone 4G8, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) and p-tau (clone AT8, Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Each slide was independently reviewed by two neuropathologists (EPC, SM) for intraneuronal p-tau (tangle and pre-tangle) and parenchymal Aβ plaques, with scoring finalized by consensus review.

Each donor brain was scored as either “yes” or “no” for p-tau-containing neurons and parenchymal Aβ deposits in frontal and temporal regions. To measure p-tau distribution, an adaptation of Braak staging was utilized: 0 if neuronal p-tau was absent; 1 if confined to entorhinal regions (I/II); 2 if present in hippocampus/subiculum (III/IV); or 3 if present in neocortex (V/VI) (31). The adaptation related to severity; most brains had only modest p-tau neuropathology, and the identification of one or more p-tau containing neurons in any region placed a case in the corresponding “Braak” stage regardless of neuropil thread (NT) intensity, whereas typically in AD staging, numerous NTs and tangles fill a region before higher stages are assigned. Staging for Aβ was not performed due to limited frequency of the pathology.

Statistical analysis

Correlations between domain scores from the last cognitive test battery (outcome variable) and presence or absence of neuronal p-tau and Aβ plaque (predictors) were conducted with the entire sample. In addition, to identify significant covariates for modeling of cognitive outcomes, correlations between cognitive scores and the following potential predictors were conducted: the last plasma HIV load (log transformed) prior to death, nadir CD4 T cell count, the last CD4 T cell count prior to death, duration of HIV disease, history of hypertension, diabetes, substance use disorder (SUD), APOE ε4 and ε2 allele status, and WRAT-3 reading scores. Correlations were conducted by analysis of variance or least squares regression. Multivariable regressions were then conducted with Aβ, p-tau, and significant covariates; for global scores and speed of information processing domain, covariates were WRAT-3 and duration of HIV infection; for motor domain, SUD; for working memory, memory encoding, and memory retrieval, WRAT-3; for verbal fluency, WRAT-3, plasma viral load, and HIV duration; and for abstraction/executive function, WRAT-3, plasma viral load, HIV duration, and history of diabetes. Ordinal “Braak” scales for p-tau distribution were correlated with cognitive domain scores by Kruskal-Wallis tests. With a specific focus on memory, individual T scores of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised (HVLT-R) and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test – Revised (BVMT-R) were correlated in the same manner as domain scores.

To examine whether trajectories of memory function were predicted by neuronal p-tau, 60 individuals with 5 or more cognitive assessments were selected, linear regressions on test score time course conducted, and slope, intercept, and R2 evaluated to identify the best-fit slopes for performance over time. Distributions of slopes were examined by Kruskal-Wallis test to determine whether participants with neuronal p-tau had significantly different cognitive trajectories than those without. To determine whether best-fit slopes were significantly different from slopes that did not vary with time (that is, whether there was significant change in test performance over time), scores were shuffled for each participant (to preserve performance average and variance) and best-fit slopes calculated. The shuffling was repeated 1000 times to ensure good sampling of shuffled temporal trajectories. Then, a two-tailed p-value was calculated for each participant’s observed slope in relation to the distribution of shuffled slopes, to determine whether observed slopes were significantly different from random (shuffled) values. To determine whether relationships existed between clinical variables and longitudinal test score performance, observed best-fit slopes were broken down into defining parameters – slope and intercept – and each of these was used as the response in a separate linear regression model with p-tau status, normalized WRAT-3 scores, and log plasma HIV load as predictor variables. These linear regression models were fit for the following responses: memory encoding slope, memory encoding intercept, memory retrieval slope, and memory retrieval intercept. Statistical analyses were conducted with JMP version 9.0 for Macintosh and with Python version 3.9.12, using libraries scikit-learn version 1.1.3 and statsmodels version 0.13.5 (for linear regression), scipy version 1.9.3 (for significance testing), and numpy version 1.23.4 (for general mathematics functionality).

Results

Patient population (table 1)

The mean age of the sample was 51.4 (10.5) (SD) years, 38% were female, and most self-identified as minority (47% Black, 29% Hispanic). The last CD4 count before death was low (median 133 cells/mm3), and only 42% were virally suppressed. Whereas 39% described intravenous drug use (IVDU) as an HIV risk, 85% endorsed a lifetime substance use disorder (SUD). At autopsy, 58% had p-tau containing neurons in their brain, and 29% parenchymal Aβ plaque; as published previously, the majority of plaques were diffuse, and both pathologies were generally modest in the majority of brains analyzed (18). In the 78 individuals displaying neuronal p-tau, distribution was restricted to entorhinal cortex in 35%, extended into hippocampal formation in 23%, and was neocortical in 42%. Of the individuals with neocortical p-tau, 91% also had neuronal p-tau in the entorhinal cortex, and 85% in the hippocampal formation.

Cognitive correlates of abnormal protein deposition: cross-sectional analysis (table 2)

The overall sample displayed mild cognitive deficits in motor and memory functions at the neuropsychological assessment closest to death. The presence of p-tau-containing neurons was associated with worse performance in memory encoding and retrieval, but not other cognitive domains. This association persisted when WRAT-3 Reading score was entered into multivariable models as a covariate to predict domain scores. The effect was stronger with visually mediated encoding and recall than for verbally mediated tasks (figure 1). Mean encoding scores for patients with vs. without p-tau for HVLT-R were 26.3 (1.7) and 32.1 (2.0) (p=0.029), and for BVMT-R 31.2 (1.7) and 38.1 (1.8) (p=0.007) respectively; recall trials in patients with vs. without p-tau for HVLT-R were 26.2 (2.0) and 31.6 (2.3) (p=0.080) and BVMT-R 32.9 (1.8) and 39.3 (1.9) (p=0.014). In models with WRAT-3, significant effects persisted for BVMT-R but not HVLT-R; all models with WRAT-3 were significant at p&lt;0.001; for BVMT-R encoding p-tau F=7.298, p=0.008; for BVMT-R recall p-tau F=5.474, p=0.021; for HVLT-R encoding p-tau F=3.248; p=0.074, and for HVLT-R recall p-tau F=1.932, p=0.167.

With neuronal p-tau distribution ordinally categorized (“Braak” scale), overall correlations with memory domains achieved trend-level significance (p=0.102 for memory encoding, p=0.087 for memory retrieval). In pairwise comparisons across neuroanatomic locations, neocortical p-tau deposition was significantly associated with memory domain functions when compared to individuals without neuronal p-tau (for encoding, Z= −2.163, p=0.031; for retrieval, Z= −2.339, p=0.019).

In contrast to neuronal p-tau, Aβ plaques were predictive of verbal fluency and abstraction/executive function domains; however, these associations were counter-intuitive, as improved test performance correlated with presence of pathology (table 2). Plasma HIV loads, the duration of HIV infection, WRAT-3 scores, and for abstraction/executive function, history of diabetes, also predicted these domains; when placed into multivariable models, the significance of Aβ as a predictor of abstraction/executive function was lost, but its significance predicting verbal fluency remained.

Neuronal p-tau and memory function trajectory: longitudinal analysis (figures 2 and 3)

There were 102 individuals with more than one neuropsychological evaluation, with a median duration of follow-up of 1072 [403, 2228] (IQR) days. In these study participants, test scores oscillated significantly across contiguous time points (figure 2). With fewer assessments, this variability created risk for mis-identifying random fluctuation as significant change. Accordingly, we limited longitudinal analyses to a subgroup of individuals with 5 or more cognitive assessments. For encoding, this amounted to a 60-donor sample that was 39% female; 53% Black, 25% Hispanic, 15% White, and 7% other; of mean age 57 (1.2) years; with 73% incidence of neuronal p-tau; and assessments conducted over a median duration of 6.0 [3.7, 7.3] (IQR) years. For retrieval, one patient had a missing value, for a sample of 59 with median assessment duration of 6.0 [3.5, 7.3] years.

There was no difference in the best-fit slopes describing trajectories of memory encoding and retrieval between participants with and without neuronal p-tau (p=0.676 for encoding and p=0.463 for retrieval) (figure 3). This was also the case when log plasma HIV load and WRAT-3 were included in regressions, with no effect of p-tau on cognitive trajectory and WRAT-3 the major determinant of initial memory test performance (intercept). For influence on encoding slope and intercept, respectively, p=0.617 and p=0.924 for p-tau, p=0.938 and p=0.246 for log HIV load, and p=0.816 and p&lt;0.001 for WRAT-3; for influence on retrieval slope and intercept, p=0.406 and p=0.620 for p-tau, p=0.796 and p=0.326 for log HIV load, and p=0.404 and p&lt;0.001 for WRAT-3. Only models for encoding and retrieval intercepts were significant (encoding slope F=0.119, p=0.949; encoding intercept F=9.224, p&lt;0.001; retrieval slope F=0.515, p=0.674; retrieval intercept F=11.75, p&lt;0.001). Finally, when participant test scores were randomly shuffled to determine whether observed cognitive trajectories differed from random variation, only 6 of 44 (13.6%) participants with and 2 of 16 (12.5%) without neuronal p-tau had best-fit slopes that differed in memory encoding, and 14.0% of those with and 18.8% of those without neuronal p-tau differed in memory retrieval. Thus, the proportions of participants with significant cognitive change was small (under 20%), and not related to the presence or absence of neuronal p-tau. In the entire group (with and without p-tau), 1.7% improved, 11.7% deteriorated, and 86.6% remained stable in memory encoding, and 5.1% improved, 10.2% deteriorated, and 84.7% remained stable in memory retrieval.

Discussion

There is increasing recognition that the abnormal protein accumulations associated with AD may be common to diverse pathogenetic processes, including aging. Amyloid β plaques increase in frequency with age, and while common in cognitively normal elderly individuals, enhance risk for progression to impairment and AD (32). Neuronal accumulations of p-tau similarly increase with age, and in addition to AD, are observed in brain disorders of variable clinical onset, tempo, and etiology, including PART, traumatic brain injury, chronic SUD, and MAPT locus mutations (33; 34; 35). Enhanced risk for Aβ and p-tau accumulation has also been suggested for metabolic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and neuroinflammatory processes (36; 37). There is concern that aging PWH may be at risk for neurodegenerative pathologies, as the spectrum of HIV-associated disorders overlaps a variety of Aβ- and p-tau- associated risks. Thus, an increasing literature has addressed potential means of distinguishing HAND from age-related cognitive impairment, largely through observation of AD biomarkers and clinical phenotypes. Our study used a “gold standard” method for sensitive detection of AD biomarkers Aβ and p-tau (microscopic examination of brain tissue), in concert with prospectively collected cognitive characterizations of the brain donors. The major finding – that neuronal p-tau accumulations in middle-aged PWH were associated with stable memory dysfunction – adds to a literature focused on discerning the impacts of neurodegenerative processes in the context of HIV infection. Our study also demonstrated that the cognitive trajectory associated with these abnormal p-tau accumulations was unlike the rapid deterioration seen in AD, and more consistent with other forms of degenerative pathology seen in HIV-negative populations.

Prior studies utilizing positron emission tomography (PET)-ligand studies and measurement of AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid have also been conducted in predominantly middle-aged HIV cohorts (26; 38; 27; 39; 23; 40; 41). In general, despite significant burdens of cognitive abnormality, the prevalence of radiographically-detected Aβ and p-tau in PWH has not been increased over age-matched controls, and HIV-associated CNS injury profiles have not resembled AD-characteristic combinations of increased CSF p-tau with decreased CSF Aβ42. Consistent with this, in prior histopathologic analysis of our autopsy cohort, we observed Aβ plaques and neuronal p-tau with the same frequency in PWH as in contemporaneous HIV negatives, and noted that these pathologies were generally of modest severity, and thus unlikely to be detected by PET-ligand study (28). We also demonstrated associations between APOE allele status, age, duration of HIV disease and Aβ deposition, and between diabetes mellitus and neuronal p-tau. In these studies, neuroinflammation did not show a predictive effect for abnormal protein deposition (18; 28). The current study used a smaller sample and was focused on determining the contributions of Aβ and p-tau to cognitive impairments; in establishing these relationships, we also found that HIV-associated variables (viremia and duration of HIV disease) and comorbidities (SUD, WRAT-3 reading levels, and diabetes) contributed to cognitive outcomes, highlighting the complexity of neurobehavioral outputs, which transcend a single protein deposition or clinical factor. Nevertheless, the ability to distinguish clinical effects of HIV from age-related phenomena is essential, as future treatments for AD and other neurodegenerations may require initiation before dementia onset to achieve efficacy (42; 43). Cognitive phenotyping of PWH has therefore continued as a research focus, and as many age-related pathologies manifest initially in medial temporal lobe, memory functions have been examined.

Memory impairments have been observed in PWH since the earliest descriptions of HAND, but with increased frequency in older individuals in the cART-era, there has been speculation that pathogenesis is modified or driven by age-related phenomena (44; 45; 46). Our autopsy-based results lend credence to this speculation, but with an important caveat: we cannot comment on whether the pathogenesis of p-tau pathology is related to aging phenomena (as in PART) or other comorbidities (such as diabetes, SUD or head trauma). Memory deficits in our cohort are stable for many years, and thus, for a population dying at a mean age of 51 years, culpable pathology would need to manifest in the fifth decade of life (mid-forties). With regard to neuronal p-tau accumulation, this necessitates a hypothesis related to premature or accelerated aging, or alternatively, implication of early- and/or mid-life comorbidities. Regardless of etiologic speculation, the fact remains: in middle-aged PWH, it is currently unclear how to definitively diagnose age-related pathologies on the background of HIV, and whether the neurobiology of aging is similar in PWH compared to demographically similar HIV-negatives.

In HIV-negatives, one cognitive phenotype which has been used to identify pathologic aging is the presence of single and particularly multiple domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), in which memory deficits are isolated or accompanied by other domain impairments. In older HIV-negatives, aMCI is associated with elevated and accelerated risk of progression to dementia; for AD, this progression is approximately 10–15% annually (43; 47). This is clearly not the case for middle-aged PWH; over a 3-year period in the cART-era CHARTER cohort, 77% of PWH remained cognitively stable or improved, despite over 60% of the baseline cohort demonstrating memory encoding impairments (48; 44). In our sample, over 80% remained stable in memory functions, with a median observation period of 6.0 years. However, while inconsistent with AD, the stability of our cohort does not rule out abnormal aging as a contributor to cognitive dysfunction, as not all age-related disorders display the rapid progression of AD. One such example is PART, which shows a spectrum of clinical phenotypes from normal to MCI to dementia, and in which p-tau pathologies are correlated with cognitive decline in a Braak-stage-dependent manner, with higher stages associated with more rapid decline (49). P-tau burden or stage is also significant at any individual time point of observation. In a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies on older, non-demented, HIV-negative populations, increasing tau burden assessed by biomarkers, neuroimaging, and one histopathologic analysis was associated with memory dysfunction (50). Our observation of cross-sectional associations between memory dysfunction and neuronal p-tau, and significance with more widespread neocortical locations that occurred in the context of medial temporal pathology, is consistent with these prior studies.

Understanding contributions of age-related phenomena to cognition in PWH is further complicated by the inconsistent definitions of MCI and its subtypes, and the cohort- and age-specificity of MCI phenotypes conveying enhanced risk of progression to dementia (51; 52). Of note, both CHARTER and our cohort are predominantly middle-aged, and aMCI in this age range may not have similar risk for progression to dementia as in older, HIV negative populations. While we did not characterize individual MCI subtypes in our study, others have defined an HIV-associated aMCI “risk” using individual memory test impairments in which at least one is a recognition measure (20). Using this definition in a sample of PWH aged 50 years or older, aMCI was associated with Aβ plaques in frontal cortex, but not p-tau frontal pathologies (20). In another similarly-aged sample, CSF levels of p-tau-181 and Aβ40/Aβ42 ratios showed no correlations with memory test performance, although the p-tau-181/Aβ42 ratio was correlated with performance on the BVMT-R (39). The relatively young age of our cohort, in contrast to samples defined by ages over 50, may account for the discrepancies in associations with neurodegenerative proteins. While our present study of PWH is consistent with a larger literature implicating p-tau accumulations in memory dysfunction, these discrepancies highlight the importance of recognizing that methodologies employed, whether case selection, histologic approach, or in defining impairment subtypes, impact conclusions. We did not limit our analysis to PWH 50 or older, did not require recognition deficits in defining memory impairment, and focused on neuronal perikaryal p-tau, rather than on scant albeit widespread NTs that characterize many cognitively normal samples in our experience of autopsy neuropathology.

Finally, regarding study methodologies, it is also important to account for longitudinal MCI fluctuations, as cognitive reversions are observed in almost half of HIV negative individuals across all subtypes (47). Fluctuations in milder forms of HAND have been recognized historically, and attributed to diverse factors (53). Beyond their ubiquity, these fluctuations may have clinical significance. In one HIV-negative population followed for 6 years, while both stable and reverting MCI conferred risk for cognitive progression, the risk was less for those with fluctuations (47). Our HIV-positive sample demonstrated widespread longitudinal memory fluctuations, and most did not exhibit cognitive deterioration. However, it is important to note that in order to increase reliability, we limited longitudinal analysis to individuals with 5 or more assessments. This decision introduced limitations: it is possible that individuals who experienced AD-like decline had shorter time periods on study and were excluded from longitudinal analysis, introducing bias in our observations towards those who were stable. Our decision also limited the numbers of p-tau negative individuals available for analysis, reducing statistical power to detect differential change. It will be important to continue longitudinal observation of cohorts into the seventh and eight decades of life, to determine whether memory performance variability has prognostic significance for PWH, and whether progression rates to more severe impairments remain low.

In conclusion, major findings of our study were: the association of neuronal p-tau and decreased, albeit stable, memory function in PWH; no effect of neuronal p-tau on the trajectory of memory impairment; and the importance of pre-morbid reading ability in predicting baseline memory function, even when using education-corrected normative data. Still unanswered is an important question: what is the pathogenesis of neuronal p-tau in PWH? While accelerated aging and “early onset” PART is one possibility, it is important to note that our participants have a high frequency of other conditions linked to p-tau pathologies, including SUD and head trauma. Continued characterization of p-tau lesions to further elucidate potential etiologies of neurodegeneration in individuals aging with HIV are warranted.

With p-tau in neurons (“yes” group), the mean encoding and retrieval T scores are significantly lower for both HVLT-R and BVMT-R. With multivariable analysis including WRAT-3 scores, significant differences persist for BVMT-R, but not HTLV-R.

The best fit slopes of memory encoding (left) and retrieval (right) were determined in individuals with (brown) and without (purple) neuronal p-tau (sample of 60 individuals for encoding, 59 individuals for retrieval). The linear slopes are plotted by their values on the x-axis; there is no difference in the median or distribution of these slopes for people with or without neuronal p-tau. For both domains, slopes are centered around 0, with under 20% demonstrating significant change over time.
