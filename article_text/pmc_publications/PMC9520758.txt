Neurofibrillary tangle, composed of aggregated tau protein, is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The inhibition of tau aggregation is therefore an important direction for AD drug discovery. In this work, we explored the efficacy of two types of carbon dots in targeting tau aggregation, as versatile nano-carriers for the development of carbon dots (CDs)-based AD therapy. We carried out synthesis, biophysical and biochemical characterizations of two types of CDs, namely, carbon nitride dots (CNDs) and black carbon dots (B-CDs). CDs, which are biocompatible and non-toxic, were successfully conjugated with memantine hydrochloride (MH) through EDC/NHS mediated amidation reactions followed by systematic characterizations using various biophysical techniques including UV-vis spectroscopy (UV-vis), photoluminescence (PL), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The surface diversity along with small particle sizes of CDs allowed facile delivery of MH across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), as demonstrated using a zebrafish in vivo model. The tau aggregation inhibition experiments were conducted using the thioflavin-T (ThT) assay to identify the most effective inhibitor. The kinetics and magnitude of tau aggregation were measured in the presence of CDs, which demonstrates that both B-CDs-MH and B-CDs alone are the most effective inhibitors of tau aggregation with IC50 values of 1.5±0.3 and 1.6±1.5 μg/mL, respectively. Taken together, our findings hold therapeutic significance to enhance the efficient delivery of MH to target AD pathology in the brain for improved efficacy.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common type of neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by progressive and irreversible memory loss [1]. Currently there is no cure for AD and most individuals diagnosed with AD have an expected lifespan of four to eight years. Although aducanumab was recently approved by FDA for AD treatment, this decision is controversial and whether aducanumab can indeed alter the disease progression is an open question. Therefore, there remains an urgent need for the discovery of AD drugs that can either inhibit AD pathogenesis or halt AD progression.

The complexity of AD’s pathogenesis poses obstacles in the efforts to target the pathological hallmarks of AD. AD is characterized by two main lesions: extracellular plaques of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide and intracellular deposits of neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau protein [2-8]. In the past two decades, the amyloid cascade hypothesis has dominated the field of AD research, which hypothesize that AD is caused by the accumulation and deposition of oligomers or fibrils of Aβ peptide [3, 4, 6, 8-11]. Aβ oligomers are known to be key driving species for the self-assembly and formation of cross-beta aggregates, and hence several non-invasive approaches have been applied to study the kinetics of these transient species [12]. The abnormal protein aggregation into filamentous aggregates from cross-seeding mechanism is very well studied in various amyloid proteins such as Aβ, human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), and alpha-synuclein (αS) [13]. Despite intense research efforts and expensive clinical trials, most of the clinical trials targeting the Aβ pathology have not been successful [14-20]. The main causes for these failures have been put forward, such as complex pathophysiology of AD, wrong drug target, inappropriate trial design, including treating the patients too late, and most studies related to Aβ peptide only targeted amyloid aggregation in solution [6, 16, 18, 20-23]. Moreover, other hypotheses of AD have also been proposed, such as metal ion dyshomeostasis, cholinergic neuron damage, oxidative stress, inflammation, etc [24, 25]. The lack of consideration of these potential cofactors could also bring limitations to the current investigations. Recently, researches proposed that tau pathology is a better target for disease-modifying treatment for AD [26, 27]. Tau, an intrinsically disordered protein, is a microtubule-associated protein which contributes to the stability of microtubules. Under pathological conditions, it can undergo misfolding, hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, which are key pathological features of AD and other tauopathies. In addition, tau aggregates can template misfolding and seeding of normal soluble tau and promote their aggregation in recipient cells, resulting in the propagation of tau pathology in a prion-like manner [28]. Tau lesions are strongly correlated to cognitive abnormalities [26]. Moreover, the strongest genetic risk factor of sporadic AD, APOE4 have been linked to tau pathology [29]. The suppression of tau pathology has been reported to have a profound protective role against brain damage and cognitive defects [30, 31]. Tau aggregation inhibitors, inhibitors of tau kinases, active and passive tau immunotherapies, and tau silencing by antisense oligonucleotides are the major areas for tau drug discovery. The direct inhibition of tau aggregation has become an important direction for small molecule drug discovery as one can optimize structural diversity, inhibition potency and pharmacokinetics. Although many compounds such as N-phenylamines, anthraquinones, phenylthiazol-hydrazides and rhodanines have been tested for tau-aggregation inhibition [32-34], better inhibitors remain to be discovered. Another obstacle in combatting AD as a brain disease is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB, a fundamental protective component of the central nervous system (CNS), functions as a semipermeable membrane that prevents most molecules from reaching the brain. Due to the intricacy and specificity of this “wall” of endothelial cells and other components, it is difficult for many therapeutic agents with confirmed efficacy in vitro to reach and function in the brain.

In recent years, the development of carbon dots (CDs) has revealed many unprecedented properties and achieved multiple breakthroughs, including delivering drug to penetrate the BBB [35-38]. Due to the lack of metals, CDs are biocompatible and nontoxic [39]. As a nanocarrier, CDs can be conjugated with diverse drug molecules via either covalent or noncovalent interactions due to a plethora of surface functional groups [40]. Most importantly, this surface diversity together with small particle sizes allow for facile drug delivery across the BBB, via active routes [39]. In addition, the photoluminescence (PL) of CDs makes it easy to track the movement of CDs in vivo in real time. These recent advancements in CDs provide a new tool in the fight against AD and other neurodegenerative diseases as more drugs can be delivered to the brain with these promising nanoparticles.

Herein, two types of CDs, namely carbon nitride dots (CNDs) and black carbon dots (B-CDs), were explored as both nanomedicine and versatile nanocarriers for a CDs-based AD therapy for targeting tau pathology. CNDs were previously reported for their abilities to selectively target glioblastoma cells and penetrate the BBB while B-CDs were reported to simultaneously conjugate with multiple ligands [40-43]. In addition to their previously reported nontoxicity [41, 44], they are both ideal drug nanocarriers for the treatment of AD. Moreover, we also tested the CDs conjugated to memantine hydrochloride (MH). MH is the first US FDA approved drug for the treatment of AD (moderate to severe), and was found to improve patients’ cognition and their abilities to perform daily activities, however, these beneficial effects were limited [45]. With CDs as drug nanocarriers, the efficacy of MH may be enhanced by more efficient delivery of MH to the brain. In this work, MH was conjugated with CNDs and B-CDs, separately, via EDC/NHS mediated amidation reactions. Systematic characterizations were carried out to confirm both conjugations. ThT tests of tau aggregation were conducted in presence of CNDs, B-CDs and their MH conjugates to investigate their abilities to inhibit tau protein aggregation. Eventually, a zebrafish in vivo model was applied to evaluate both MH conjugates’ ability to cross the BBB.

2. Experimental Section

2.1 Materials

Carbon nitride dots (CNDs) and black carbon dots (B-CDs) were bought from C-dots Nanotec, Miami, Florida. Memantine hydrochloride (MH, ⩾98%), thioflavin-T (ThT, 98%), dithiothreitol (DTT, 99%), sinapinic acid (SA, 98%) including salts and buffers were ordered from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Heparin (223 units/mg) was procured from Celsus Laboratories, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). Molecular tweezer (CLRO1) was prepared as described elsewhere [46, 47]. Dialysis tubing with a molecular-weight cut-off (MWCO) of 3.5 kDa and was purchased from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). The dialysis tubing with a MWCO of 100-500 Da was obtained from Spectrum Labs Inc (Rancho Dominguez, CA). Deionized (DI) water was purified using a Millipore Milli-Q system. The DI water displayed a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm, surface tension of 72.2 mN·m−1, and a pH of 6.6 at 20°C. Buffers were prepared using DI water. All the chemicals were used without further treatment. The His-tagged tau protein was expressed and purified in the lab using established recombinant methods [48] and the protein purity was assessed using SDS-PAGE gel and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy.

2.2 Conjugation of Carbon Dots with Memantine Hydrochloride

24 mg of CNDs were dissolved in 24 mL phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 and gently stirred for 30 min. EDC (61.354 mg) and NHS (153.36 mg) were then added into the CNDs solution, which was followed by gentle stirring for another 30 min. After that, MH (6.92 mg) was added into the CNDs solution, and then incubated for 24 h. The mixed solution was then transferred into a dialysis tubing (MWCO: 100-500 Da) and dialyzed for 3 days, changing the DI water every 24 h to remove unreacted precursors and intermediates. Finally, the dialyzed solution was freeze-dried at −80°C and stored until future use. The memantine-loaded CNDs were named as CNDs-MH.

8 mg of B-CDs were dissolved in 10 mL PBS at pH 7.4 and gently stirred for 30 min. EDC (88.76 mg) and NHS (221.89 mg) were then added into the B-CDs solution and stirred for another 30 min followed by adding MH (10 mg) into the B-CDs solution, and then incubation for 24 h. The mixture was transferred into a dialysis tubing (MWCO: 3.5 kDa) and dialyzed for 3 days, with DI water replaced every 24 h. Eventually, the solution was freeze-dried at −80°C and stored until future use. The memantine-loaded B-CDs were named as B-CDs-MH.

2.3 Characterization

UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 100) was used to acquire UV-vis absorption spectra. Photoluminescence (PL) characterizations were carried out with a Fluorolog HORIBA Jobin Yvon fluorometer (slit width of 5 nm for both excitation and emission). Normalization of the emission spectra was achieved by using OriginPro 9.1 software. Quartz cuvettes (optical pathlength of 1 cm) were used for all the optical characterizations. The attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was conducted with a wavenumber range of 800 to 4000 cm−1 on FTIR spectrometer (FT-Nicolet 5700, Thermo Scientific) equipped with a Smartorbit (Thermo Scientific) operation. Surface morphologies were obtained with 5420 atomic force microscope (Agilent Technologies) in tapping mode. AFM samples were prepared by dropping one drop of a conjugated CDs aqueous dispersion (1 mg/mL) onto a clean silica mica slide, followed by screening in tapping mode with a silicon tip applied with a force of 3 N/m. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Netzsch TG 209 F3 Tarsus thermo-microbalance (Netzsch, USA) by heating the sample from 40 to 1000°C at a rate of 10°C/min under the protection of nitrogen gas environment. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed using Bruker auto flex speed spectrometer to characterize the conjugation of CNDs and B-CDs with MH. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JOEL 1200EX) was applied to measure the nanoparticle size distribution.

2.4 Expression and Purification of Tau Protein

The plasmid encoding a full-length protein tau with a His x 6 tag at the C-terminus was ordered from Gen-Script, USA. The plasmid was transformed into BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) RIPL competent cells and over-expressed following a standard overexpression protocol. Briefly, the bacterial culture was started by inoculating an isolated colony into 50 mL LB with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μg/mL chloramphenicol grown overnight in a shaking incubator at 250 rpm and 37°C. This culture was pelleted and again inoculated into 2L LB with the same antibiotics. The culture was grown to an OD600 of 1.0 and protein expression was initiated by the addition of 0.4 mM IPTG. After 4 h of expression at 250 rpm and 37°C, cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −20°C until purification. The cells were then extracted and purified using Bio-Rad fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system with a His-Tag Ni-NTA column. The purified His-tagged protein was characterized by SDS-PAGE and mass spectroscopy and then lyophilized at 4 mg/mL aliquots and stored at −80°C until use.

2.5 ThT Assay

All the tau aggregation inhibition studies were performed on Tecan Infinite M1000 microplate reader at 37°C with orbital shaking at 250 rpm for over 60 h at an interval of 23 min. The ThT fluorescence intensity was monitored by exciting the molecule at 435 nm and recording the emission at 480 nm. A master mixture consisting of 10 μM His-tagged tau protein, 2.5 mM DTT, 10 μM heparin and 10 μM ThT was set up using an assay buffer with 10 mM HEPES and 100 mM NaCl at pH 7.4. Control experiments were set up in parallel consisting of blank buffer with ThT, master mixture without heparin and the master mixture with 100 uM Tweezer (CLR01, a known inhibitor of tau aggregation [46]). Serial dilutions of CNDs, B-CDs, and their MH conjugates were used to monitor the dose-dependent aggregation inhibition of tau protein. Final data analysis and extraction of kinetic parameters were performed in Igor Pro program (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA). All aggregation curves are fitted to a sigmoidal function [49-51] shown in Equation 1 to extract the half time of aggregation (t1/2), apparent elongation rate constant (kapp) given by Equation 2, and the lag time (tlag) by Equation 3.

(3) tlag=t1∕2-2τ,

where S is the observed signal, Si and Sf are the initial and final values of the signal, t1/2 is the time required to reach half of the maximum signal, and τ is the magnitude of the signal change.

2.6 Zebrafish Bioimaging

Wild-type zebrafish (Danio rerio) at 5 days post fertilization (dpf) were obtained from the University of Miami Zebrafish Core Facility. 100 nL of 50 mg/mL aqueous solutions of both CNDs-MH and B-CDs-MH were intravascularly injected into the heart of zebrafish larvae (number: 6) previously anesthetized by tricaine. Subsequently, the injected larvae were imaged using Leica SP5 confocal microscope under both white light and an excitation wavelength of 405 nm. The animal care protocol for all procedures used in this experiment was approved by the University of Miami Animal Care and Use Committee and complies with the guidelines of the National Science Foundation.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1 Characterizations of CNDs-MH and B-CDs-MH

The detailed preparations of CNDs-MH and B-CDs-MH were described in Experimental Section. EDC/NHS coupling reaction (Scheme. 1) was used to link the amine groups of MH to the carboxyl groups of CNDs and B-CDs. After dialysis and lyophilization, the purified solid conjugated products (CNDs-MH and B-CDs-MH) were collected for future characterizations.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of MH (black) in both Fig. 1A and Fig. 1B do not show any characteristic peak in the 200-800 nm region. In contrast, CNDs (red) and CNDs-MH (blue) in Fig. 1A display characteristic absorption peaks in the region 300-400 nm which can be attributed to n → π* transitions of C=O and/or C=N bonds [41, 53]. Additionally, the UV-vis absorption spectra of both B-CDs (red) and B-CDs-MH (blue) in Fig. 1B display a broad absorption peak in the 200-300 nm region due to π → π* transition in C=C bonds and sp2 networks in graphene [54]. The shift of the peak after conjugation in Fig. 1B indicates the success of MH loading.

The fluorescence emission spectra of CNDs, CNDs-MH, B-CDs, and B-CDs-MH are shown in Fig. 2. According to Fig. 2A, the maximum excitation and emission wavelengths of CNDs are 370 and 455 nm, respectively. Since the structure of MH is simple that cannot alter the PL behavior of CNDs, the CNDs-MH (Fig. 2B) exhibits the same maximum excitation and emission peaks as CNDs, which indicates that CNDs-MH has similar optical properties as CNDs. The fluorescence spectra of CNDs-MH obtained at other excitation wavelengths exhibit different peak positions compared to that of CNDs, which also suggests a successful conjugation of MH and CNDs.

Meanwhile, the fluorescence spectra of B-CDs (Fig. 2C) show that the maximum excitation and emission wavelengths are at 350 and 505 nm, respectively. It is surprising that the fluorescence spectra of B-CDs-MH (Fig. 2D) display the same maximum excitation peak (350 nm) but a different emission peak (530 nm) compared to that of B-CDs, which demonstrates that the conjugated samples have different structures and different optical properties. Different emission peaks under the same excitation wavelength also confirms a successful conjugation of MH with B-CDs.

The conjugation of MH with either CNDs and B-CDs was further confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra of CNDs and CNDs-MH (Fig. 3A) displays the peaks at 3445, 3190, and 2760 cm−1 that are assigned to N-H, O-H, and C-H stretching, respectively. Additionally, the peaks at 1770 and 1700 cm−1 are related to C=O and C=N stretching, respectively. The peak at 1590 cm−1 can be assigned to N-H bending or C=C stretching since there is a great overlap of stretching/bending bands in this region. Also, the peaks at 1360 cm−1 and 1185 cm−1 correspond to O-H bending and C-N stretching.[55] However, the peak at 1050 cm−1 can only be seen in the spectrum of CNDs-MH and it is attributed to C-N stretching of MH.[55, 56] This peak of the spectrum of CNDs-MH suggests that MH conjugation was successful to CNDs.

The FTIR spectrum of B-CDs (Fig. 3B) exhibits a broad peak between 2500-3700 cm−1 which is correlated to the presence of O-H stretching from carboxyl groups. In the FTIR spectrum of B-CDs-MH shown in Fig. 3B, the peak at 3350 cm−1 is assigned to O-H stretching, and the peak at 2950 cm−1 correlates to sp2 and sp3 C-H stretching. In the FTIR spectra of B-CDs and B-CDs-MH, the peaks at 1720, 1600, and 1240 cm−1 can be assigned to C=O, C=C, and C–O–C stretching bands, respectively. Compared to the spectrum of B-CDs, the spectrum of B-CDs-MH presents a peak at 3585 cm−1 due to the amide N-H stretching. In addition, another two peaks of B-CDs-MH at 1448 cm−1 and 1038 cm−1 are attributed to the N-H bending and C-N stretching, respectively.[56] These two peaks are also shown in the FTIR spectrum of MH.[56] The three peaks in the FTIR spectrum of B-CDs-MH further indicate the conjugation between the carboxyl groups on B-CDs and the primary amine groups on MH.

Further characterizations of CNDs, CNDs-MH, B-CDs and BCDs-MH were conducted using MALDI-TOF MS. As shown in Fig. 4A, the mass spectrum of CNDs shows mass ion peaks at m/z=576, 581 and 654. The mass spectrum of CNDs-MH in Fig. 4B displays three new mass ion peaks at m/z=736, 742 and 816. After MH (MW=179 g/mol) was conjugated to CDs, amide bond was formed, and H2O was lost. This makes a 161 Da difference between the mass ion peaks of CNDs and CNDs-MH. The mass spectra of CNDs and CNDs-MH show the peaks at m/z=576, 581, 654, and 736, 742, 816, and the differences of each peak are 160, 161 and 162 Da, respectively. By combining the mass with the FTIR spectra, we proved that the conjugation between CNDs and MH is successful. The mass spectra of B-CDs (576 and 654 m/z) and B-CDs-MH (737 and 816 m/z) are observed in Fig. 4C and 4D. The differences of mass ions of B-CDs and B-CDs-MH are 161 and 162 Da, respectively. The mass spectra together with the FTIR spectra of B-CDs and B-CDs-MH also confirm the successful conjugation between B-CDs and MH.

TGA and the first derivative of the TGA (DTG) spectra of CNDs-MH and B-CDs-MH are exhibited in contrast to that of their corresponding precursors in Fig. 5. According to Fig. 5A and 5B, the differences between the TGA spectra of CNDs-MH and CNDs, or B-CDs-MH and B-CDs, demonstrate successful conjugations between CNDs or B-CDs and MH. In addition, the decrease in the temperatures needed to decompose both conjugates suggests their decreased thermostabilities caused by the conjugations with MH. Furthermore, based on the DTG, diverse functional moieties can be identified and quantified based on their own thermostabilities and decomposition temperatures. According to our previous studies, mass loss of CNDs at 40-168, 168-338, 338-448, 448-618 and 618-688°C indicates evaporation of water molecules [57-59], decomposition of oxygen-containing functional moieties [60, 61], and decomposition of carbon nitride structures [54], respectively. Meanwhile, mass loss of B-CDs at 40-173, 173-448, 448-613, 613-763, and 763-1000°C are attributed to evaporation of water molecules, decomposition of oxygen-containing functional groups including carboxyl (-COOH) and carbonyl (C=O) groups, oxidized and unoxidized sp2 structures in the graphitic core, respectively [54]. Furthermore, due to the low boiling point of MH (239.8°C), in the DTG spectrum of CNDs-MH (Fig. 5C), the mass loss at 162-258°C indicates a 9% mass composition of MH in the conjugated structure. Similarly, according to the DTG spectrum of B-CDs-MH (Fig. 5D), the mass loss at 147-273°C reveals a 15% mass content of MH in B-CDs-MH. In comparison, the higher amount of MH loaded on B-CDs than on CNDs demonstrates that B-CDs possess a higher capacity to load drugs with amine groups compared to CNDs, which can be ascribed to the higher content of -COOH on B-CDs (48%) than on CNDs (36%) according to our previous studies [54].

Ultrasonication was conducted prior to AFM screening to avoid self-aggregation of CDs. AFM images in Fig. 6 show that the average sizes of CNDs (~ 1.75 nm, Fig. 6A), CNDs-MH (~ 3 nm, Fig. 6B), B-CDs (~ 1.6 nm, Fig. 6C), and B-CDs-MH (~ 2.2 nm, Fig. 6D) are below 5 nm, which is ideal for crossing the BBB [24]. The increased sizes of conjugated samples support the success of conjugation of MH on CDs. TEM images of CNDs-MH and B-CDs-MH in Fig. 7A and 7B show that the measured sizes of the conjugated CDs by AFM and TEM are similar which are both below 5 nm.

3.2 Tau aggregation inhibition with carbon dots-memantine conjugates

Using the ThT fluorescence aggregation assay, we have demonstrated that CNDs, B-CDs, and their MH conjugates inhibit tau aggregation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8A-E). Data are normalized in a scale of 0 to 1 with a baseline at zero and maximum uninhibited tau aggregation at 1 to facilitate comparison among various concentrations of inhibitors. The lag time (tlag) and the time at the half completion of the aggregation process (thalf) were evaluated by fitting a sigmoidal function to each kinetic trace. The uninhibited tau aggregation kinetics follows a multi-step secondary nucleation dominated pathway with a thalf of 18.9 ± 0.1 h and a lag time of 13.4 ± 0.2 h. The elongation rate constant was estimated to be 0.36 h−1 with an amplitude of 0.97 assuming a dimeric size of the primary and secondary nucleus. As the inhibitor concentration increased, the half time of aggregation increased while the elongation rate constant generally decreased except for MH itself for which aggregation inhibition did not reach 50% even at the highest inhibitor concentration. The apparent elongation rate constant decreased significantly with increasing inhibitor concentrations while the half time and the lag time slightly increased. This represents a model where the inhibitor didn’t affect the initial seed formation while impacting the elongation of the aggregates. The highest concentration of inhibitor used (143 μg/mL) almost completely inhibited the aggregation with all the CNDs and B-CDs conjugates. This prevented the extraction of exact parameters for this concentration and for that conjugate. The kinetic data reported here is of sufficient quality and reproducibility as confirmed by three duplicates of each measurement. The detail kinetic parameters are summarized in Table S1-S3 in supplementary information (SI).

3.3 B-CDs-MH and B-CDs are the Most Effective Inhibitors

Using each ThT fluorescence kinetic trace, the percentages of tau aggregation inhibition for corresponding inhibitors were determined. The IC50 for each inhibitor was then obtained by fitting a sigmoidal function to these inhibition percentage values as a function of concentration of inhibitors in a semi-log scale (Fig. 9). Based on these IC50 analyses, we confirmed that the B-CDs-MH and B-CDs are the most effective tau aggregation inhibitors compared to CNDs and CNDs-MH.

B-CDs, CNDs, and their MH conjugates were able to completely suppress the tau aggregation at nearly 143 ug/mL final concentration (Fig. 8). The B-CDs-MH and B-CDs have the least IC50 ~ 1.5±0.3 and 1.6±1.5 μg/mL, respectively, a typical range of small molecule drug candidates. As the surface modification takes effect, especially the MH conjugation, the IC50 value starts changing. Our results indicate that the overall IC50 ranking among B-CDs, CNDs and their MH conjugates follow the order B-CDs-MH ~ B-CDs &lt; CNDs-MH &lt; CNDs &lt; MH, with the least potent inhibitor MH having the highest IC50 &gt; 143 μg/mL. The calculated IC50 of all the conjugates are summarized in Table S4 in the SI.

3.4 Crossing the BBB with CNDs-MH

Based on the aforementioned results, CDs-MH conjugates have shown significant effect on inhibiting tau protein aggregation. In our previous work [42], CNDs alone was observed to cross the BBB to arrive at the spinal cord central canal of zebrafish, while B-CDs could also penetrate the BBB after conjugation with transferrin [24]. Therefore, in order to determine whether both conjugates (CNDs-MH and B-CDs-MH) possess the abilities to cross the BBB, zebrafish was employed as an in vivo model. Actually, zebrafish has been one of popular animal models for research to study CNS disorders including AD [24, 62].

A higher concentration (50 mg/mL) of both CNDs-MH and B-CDs-MH aqueous solutions were prepared and injected into the heart of 5 dpf wild-type zebrafish larvae. Under the excitation wavelength of 405 nm, the blue PL in the central canal of spinal cord in Fig. 10 indicates the presence of CNDs-MH, which is within our expectation due to the high PL intensity of CNDs and negligible optical property alteration after conjugation with MH. In contrast to the control group, it demonstrates that the CNDs-MH could cross the BBB. Unfortunately, B-CDs-MH could not be observed in the central canal. However, it is not unexpected because B-CDs has the lower quantum yield % PL compared to CNDs, but B-CDs were reported to cross the BBB after conjugation with transferrin and B-CDs themselves could not. This also reminds us that the next reseach work is to modify the B-CDs-MH with transferrin considering that B-CDs-MH has shown greater effect on tau protein aggregation inhibition, which enables the B-CDs-MH to be a potential therapeutic agent for AD treatment.

4. Conclusion

In this study, a combination of complementary techniques has been applied to synthesize and physio-chemically interrogate two types of drug nano-carriers, namely CNDs and B-CDs, and successfully conjugate them with MH for the therapeutic development of CD-based AD drugs. The zebrafish in vivo model tests showed that CNDs successfully delivered MH through the BBB which provide an opportunity for using CNDs as nanocarriers to deliver drugs for neurodegenerative diseases, while, unfortunately, B-CDs alone couldn’t deliver MH across the BBB. Previous studies have reported that CDs can be used as drug nanocarriers or therapeutic nanoagents to suppress Aβ aggregation for the purpose of treating AD.[63, 64] However, CDs have been rarely reported being used as drug nanocarriers or therapeutic nanoagents to inhibit tau aggregation which has been proposed to be a better target for disease-modifying treatment for AD.[65, 66] In this work, as discussed in Section 3.3, B-CDs-MH and CNDs-MH showed the ability to suppress the tau aggregation and both conjugates exhibited better inhibition effects than their corresponding CDs and sole MH which indicated that B-CDs and CNDs did not only function as drug nano-carriers, but also enhanced the conjugates’ ability of tau aggregation inhibition. A detailed understanding of the physicochemical properties of these drug nano-carriers has been achieved and the most effective inhibitor compounds, B-CDs-MH, and B-CDs were identified with a reasonable IC50 value best-suited for drug discovery efforts. A previous study reported that after conjugation with transferrin, B-CDs were able to cross the BBB which inspired us for our future work to modify B-CDs with transferrin and MH to enable the conjugates to cross the BBB with the greatest ability to suppress tau aggregation [40]. These findings appear poised to guide the future therapeutic development with nano-carrier based drug discovery.
